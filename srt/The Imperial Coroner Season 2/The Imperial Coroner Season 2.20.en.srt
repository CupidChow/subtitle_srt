1
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,198
(I submitted evidence)

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:14,730
(that the dead man was not You Chen'an.)

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,890
(But the body was burned
in a fire set by Gao Luoqian.)

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,878
(Therefore, it can't be verified)

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:21,410
(whether You Chen'an faked his death,)

6
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,050
(His Highness and Jing Yi
are still locked away in prison.)

7
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,730
(I was truly anxious.)

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,398
(Chu Chu has been poisoned.)

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:31,809
(I was beside myself with worry.)

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,398
(I had meant to confess to trade my guilt
for Jing Ying's release to investigate.)

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,199
(But to my surprise,)

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,599
(Jing Yi changed his word
before the Emperor)

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,130
(and took all the blame upon himself.)

14
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,049
(He was taken away alone
by Gao Luoqian and placed under guard.)

15
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,570
(I should've seen it coming.)

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,890
(He has always putting himself)

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,090
(after everyone else.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,959
(This story is entirely fictional.)

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,890
=Episode 20=

36
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,889
They were left behind
by the previous owner.

37
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,530
I simply kept them.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,038
You Chen'an seemed
to like them quite a bit.

39
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,990
Every time he came,
he would play with them for a bit.

40
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:35,530
Who was the previous owner?

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,250
The former owner?

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,598
I only met him once briefly

43
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,050
when we transferred the deed.

44
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,650
He was

45
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,399
around forty.

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,630
He has a round face, big ears,

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,330
and wears sandals.

48
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,129
Oh, right.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,090
There was a tall and thin woman with him.

50
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,799
She was dressed
in Central Plains clothing,

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,080
but she didn't look like
she was from the Central Plains.

52
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,409
Your Highness,

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,409
did you capture You Chen'an as well?

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,490
No.

55
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,330
He faked his death to frame me.

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,079
He found someone
who looked exactly like him

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,449
to die in his place

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,409
and leave this place.

59
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,279
Chu Chu had already found

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,729
the fingerprints of the stand-in.

61
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,250
But Gao Luoqian burned the body.

62
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,279
Now, there's no way to verify

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,090
whether the dead man was You Chen'an.

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,289
Unless

65
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,409
we can find fingerprints
that prove he's still alive.

66
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,409
Jing Yi took the blame
to get me released.

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,490
He's still under house arrest by them.

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,449
Wasn't this man supposed
to have no one to rely on?

69
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,009
How did he manage to pull off
something like this?

70
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,169
He.

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,729
I'm telling you all this

72
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,530
so you can see his true face.

73
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,650
Don't let him use you again.

74
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,009
These pigeons

75
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,090
are proof of how
You Chen'an kept in contact.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,689
Don't touch them.

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,370
I won't.

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,610
Your Highness,

79
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:07,009
is Chu Chu very angry with me?

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,129
Why hasn't she come to see me?

81
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,370
She's been poisoned.

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,158
It's a kind of bee venom.

83
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,449
It's highly potent.

84
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,730
She's still unconscious.

85
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,290
Poisoned?

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,810
Who did this?

87
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,050
You Chen'an?

88
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,850
Your Highness,

89
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,410
I'm begging you.

90
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,009
Get up.

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,689
You must save Chu Chu.

92
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,370
Don't worry.

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,769
Xiao Jinyu?

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,449
You!

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,529
You dare tie me up?

96
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,329
What was Chu Chu poisoned with?

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,410
How would I know
what poison the Princess Consort took?

98
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,410
It seems the cold weather

99
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,730
has frozen your brain, Lord Gao.

100
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,050
Warm Lord Gao up.

101
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,050
- Yes.
- Yes.

102
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,290
What do you mean?

103
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,290
What are you trying to do?

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,209
Untie me!

105
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,050
Aren't you afraid I'll report this
to the King of Nanzhao?

106
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:56,930
You!

107
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,159
Xiao Jinyu!

108
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,850
You!

109
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,530
You use private torture

110
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,359
to force a confession
from the Nanzhao Vice Envoy.

111
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,050
You!

112
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,329
Take it away!

113
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,810
Take it away!

114
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,810
Untie me.

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,958
Xiao Jinyu,

116
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,089
you've offended so many people.

117
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,649
On what grounds do you think
it was me who poisoned her?

118
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:49,089
You can't torture me
based on mere guesswork!

119
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,170
So it wasn't you.

120
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,329
No.

121
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,119
No.

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,170
It wasn't me.

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,290
Then all the more reason
to keep you alive.

124
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,490
What?

125
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,689
You're going to kill me?

126
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,089
You!

127
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,610
It's on fire!

128
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,398
It's on fire!

129
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,838
Put it out.

130
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,649
Hurry.

131
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,810
Xiao Jinyu.

132
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,250
It's on fire, Xiao Jinyu.

133
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,410
Xiao Jinyu.

134
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,449
You can't do this to me.

135
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,529
I'm the foreign envoy of Nanzhao.

136
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,490
I'm the Eldest Prince's
brother-in-law.

137
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,799
If I die in the Great Tang,

138
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,490
it'll spark conflict between our states.

139
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:28,490
The foreign envoy of Nanzhao

140
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,449
and Commandery Prince An of the Great Tang
were alone in a room,

141
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,958
speaking amicably,

142
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,050
when an accidental fire broke out.

143
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:38,758
Do you think Nanzhao

144
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,009
would throw away the goodwill

145
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,329
brought with both our lives?

146
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,159
Xiao Jinyu...

147
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,838
No.

148
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:49,889
Commandery Prince An,

149
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,769
I beg you.

150
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,089
Please.

151
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,679
I truly don't know.

152
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,278
Dying with me isn't worth it.

153
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,769
You seem to have thought highly
of yourself.

154
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,089
I'm not dying with you.

155
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,009
I'm dying with Chu Chu.

156
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,170
With you buried alongside her,

157
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,009
I'll count it as avenging her.

158
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,410
I'll give you one last chance.

159
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,689
Was it You Chen'an's order?

160
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,329
You Chen'an?

161
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,089
You still don't know

162
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,529
You Chen'an is Peacock.

163
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,198
Even now, you don't realize

164
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,638
you were nothing more than

165
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,009
a disposable piece
to the King of Nanzhao.

166
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,319
I'll talk.

167
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,529
I'll tell you everything.

168
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,289
How about this?

169
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,809
Let's get out of here first.

170
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,798
Let's get out of here.

171
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,169
If you speak, then speak.

172
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,129
If you don't,

173
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,090
you'll never speak again.

174
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,529
It was the poison sting and venom
of the Hongniang Bee.

175
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,730
How do you cure it?

176
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,929
I never intended to cure it.

177
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:57,319
This kind of gingery bee
is unique to Nanzhao.

178
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,330
Its venom requires special refinement.

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:08:59,839
I...

180
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,409
I truly don't know the cure.

181
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,439
I swear,

182
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,730
once I get out,
I'll help you find the antidote.

183
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,090
If we both die here,

184
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,079
the Commandery Princess Consort An
is as good as dead.

185
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,769
Open your mouth.

186
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,730
Swallow it.

187
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,450
What did you make me eat?

188
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,959
Poison, of course.

189
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,809
I'm telling you,

190
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,490
if I find out you lied

191
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,129
after leaving this place,

192
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,610
this poison will tear your insides apart
within three days.

193
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:35,289
You'd better think carefully

194
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,158
whether you want to report this
to the King of Nanzhao.

195
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,798
I won't. Don't worry.

196
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,490
I swear, I won't.

197
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,730
You...

198
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,878
What are you doing now?

199
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,798
What is that?

200
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:45,850
Open your mouth.

201
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,889
Open your mouth!

202
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,289
Drink it.

203
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,169
Finish it.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,330
Then I'll let you go.

205
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,210
All right.

206
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,809
I'll drink it.

207
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,250
Where is he?

208
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,649
I've finished it.

209
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,769
The fire is huge?

210
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,169
Scoundrel.

211
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,210
How dare he trick me.

212
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,009
Hongniang Bee?

213
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,370
I've never heard of it.

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,129
What about the rest of you?

215
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,769
- No.
- Never heard of it.

216
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,999
Indeed. Not once.

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,769
If even the poison bee is unknown,

218
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,970
then the antidote will be
even harder to find.

219
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,210
Not necessarily.

220
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,330
Poisons derived from
living creatures or herbs

221
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,278
are usually born alongside their cures.

222
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,009
As long as we can trace the poison,

223
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,839
the antidote can be found
by following the trail.

224
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,450
As the saying goes,

225
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,820
"within seven steps of a venomous snake,
there is always an antidote."

226
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,479
Exactly.

227
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,918
The priority right now

228
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,730
is to keep Princess Consort An alive.

229
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,439
Before the antidote is found,

230
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,038
her heart meridian must be protected

231
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:43,038
and her vital energy sustained.

232
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,169
But that will cost dearly.

233
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,129
Chen Feng.

234
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:47,878
Yes.

235
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:49,079
Go back and tell Lian Qiao

236
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,719
to take out all the silver

237
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,169
for the physicians.

238
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,409
If that's still not enough,

239
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,490
sell anything in the warehouse.

240
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,439
Yes.

241
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,210
Make a trip to the Jing Residence.
Handle it the same way.

242
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,129
Yes.

243
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,929
(These pigeons are proof of how
You Chen'an kept in contact.)

244
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,330
(Don't touch them.)

245
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,150
(Universal Post Station)

246
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:33,649
Sir.

247
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:42,690
Sir?

248
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:49,009
Sir.

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,590
Men from the Three Judicial Offices
just left the city through the southwest.

250
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,490
They're likely going after Second Prince.

251
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,210
Hurry.

252
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,038
Send a message to Eldest Prince.

253
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,090
Tell him You Chen'an faked his death,

254
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,529
so he can prepare in advance.

255
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,250
Yes.

256
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,809
If You Chen'an

257
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,929
is caught by the Three Judicial Offices,

258
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,158
it'll spell trouble.

259
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,490
We must pry out of Jing Yi

260
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,398
the whereabouts of the ghost guard
and Chang Shou as quickly as possible,

261
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,990
so that we can destroy all the evidence.

262
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,090
Bear this in mind.

263
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,009
Only the dead keep secrets.

264
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,649
But the Three Judicial Offices
are tight-lipped.

265
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,370
Forcing confession out of them
in Chang'an

266
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,529
won't be easy.

267
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,079
Then strike at his weak spot.

268
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,769
Isn't Vice Minister Jing
deeply devoted to his wife?

269
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,758
Feed him aphrodisiacs

270
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,758
or a knockout drug.

271
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,570
Make him lose himself completely.

272
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,479
I'd like to see
how unwavering his love can be.

273
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,769
That's brilliant.

274
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,798
Make him drink.

275
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,929
Make him drink a lot.

276
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,649
Make him repay

277
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:12,570
the debts his friend owes.

278
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,719
Vice Minister Jing,
though you're a suspect,

279
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,959
the Nanzhao delegation
has no intention to trouble you.

280
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,758
Knowing you've been
imprisoned for so long

281
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,809
and must be full of doubts,

282
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,809
we've specially prepared
a fine brew for you.

283
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,678
They say Vice Minister Jing
has a discerning palate,

284
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,090
even palace vintages
fail to satisfy you.

285
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,690
I wonder whether this brew

286
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,599
might stir

287
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,570
a hint of desire

288
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,970
in your heart.

289
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,769
Madam,

290
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,839
take a look.

291
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,878
These three

292
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:59,518
were chosen to match

293
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,409
Lady Jing's temperament and appearance.

294
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,409
They'll suit Vice Minister Jing's taste.

295
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,319
Will this really work?

296
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,409
We mustn't cause any deaths.

297
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,450
Don't worry, Vice Minister Huang.

298
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,359
Not only will no one die,

299
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,529
but there may even be

300
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,970
a new life created.

301
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,038
Vice Minister Jing must be drunk by now.

302
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,129
He's probably completely weak.

303
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,889
Choose this girl.

304
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,730
I believe Vice Minister Huang
has told you what information

305
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,809
you need to get out of him.

306
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,119
Take her there.

307
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,730
Yes.

308
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:44,809
Move.

309
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,009
Vice Minister Huang,

310
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,529
let's simply wait for good news.

311
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,409
My dear.

312
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,129
Let's take a rest.

313
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,769
My dear.

314
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,049
My dear.

315
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,730
My dear.

316
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,319
I've waited for you for so long.

317
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,330
Why did you come so late?

318
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,730
Don't be afraid.

319
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,409
As long as you write
everything I tell you,

320
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,129
we

321
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,719
can stay together forever.

322
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,719
All right.

323
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,079
Tell me what to write.

324
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,169
I'll write anything you wish.

325
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,889
Let's do it.

326
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,929
Come on.

327
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,009
To take a stand-in
for the true beauty,

328
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,409
for mistaking fish eyes for pearls.

329
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,329
The Nanzhao riffraff
would stoop to such schemes.

330
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,210
Their folly

331
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,569
is beyond words!

332
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,009
Your Highness,

333
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,919
I searched the outskirts of Chang'an.

334
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,078
You Chen'an was nowhere to be found.

335
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:30,369
Have you seen this man?

336
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,038
Sir,

337
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,329
have you seen this man?

338
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,529
No.

339
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,369
- Fortunately, someone has.
- Have you seen the man in this portrait?

340
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,518
They provided some clues.

341
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,239
I've seen him.

342
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,758
He stayed at my place for one night.

343
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,479
Are you sure?

344
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,529
Of course.

345
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,329
Judging by his whereabouts,

346
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,049
(Nanzhao)
he was heading back to Nanzhao.

347
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,690
Jiaozhou lies on the only route
to Nanzhao.

348
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,369
I've marked the approximate route
on this map.

349
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,289
You're awake.

350
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,490
Does it still hurt?

351
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,890
Your eyes are red.

352
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,049
You look worn out.

353
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,650
You don't look good anymore.

354
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,609
Princess Consort An,

355
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,529
don't go losing interest in me now

356
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,250
and throw away
the one who's always stood by you.

357
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,690
You're the most good-looking person
in this world.

358
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,329
Your Highness,

359
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:36,569
my brother is a kind person.

360
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,529
He was misled by You Chen'an.

361
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,289
I know.

362
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,049
Don't worry.

363
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,609
I already had him released

364
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,798
and arranged for him
to stay at the apothecary for now.

365
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,849
Also,

366
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,730
we must find a way

367
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,809
to get Jing Yi out of there.

368
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,289
You Chen'an...

369
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,490
Be careful of You Chen'an.

370
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:01,970
Don't worry.

371
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,809
I remember everything you said.

372
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,730
I think

373
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,410
I had a very, very long dream.

374
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,250
I dreamed

375
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,289
we went to Qianzhou with Mother

376
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,210
and met Sir Witch Doctor.

377
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:21,049
He cured me,

378
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,650
and Mother...

379
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,730
Don't worry too much.

380
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,609
I'm so sleepy.

381
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,830
(Self-Cultivation to World Order)

382
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,890
Your Highness.

383
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,049
Not so loud.

384
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,569
How was it?

385
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:00,769
Your Highness,

386
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,518
Physician Qi and other physicians
found a herb in the ancient records.

387
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,490
They said it has remarkable effects
against this kind of bee poison.

388
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,118
It's called Seven-Leaf-One-Flower.

389
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:08,479
But I searched all over Chang'an

390
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,609
and couldn't find it.

391
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,190
The imperial physicians fear
Her Highness's condition can't afford delay,

392
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,479
so they ordered me to bring over

393
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,200
all detoxifying medicines
from the palace.

394
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,009
Your Highness!

395
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,318
How could it not be found
in all of Chang'an?

396
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,520
Every apothecary said
they've never heard of this herb.

397
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,730
Gao Luoqian's poison came from Nanzhao.

398
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,798
The antidote...

399
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,450
(We went to Qianzhou with Mother)

400
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,529
(and met Sir Witch Doctor.)

401
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,049
(He cured me.)

402
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,130
Your Highness.

(May Chu Chu be free of illness

405
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,849
Herbs often

406
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:17,798
go by

407
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,558

408
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,730

409
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,119

Go to the herb storehouse

412
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,130
and find Love Apple.

413
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,049
Yes.

414
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,529
This herb has the effect of
cooling the liver and calming shock.

415
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,089
Her Highness's aggressive pulse
has eased somewhat.

416
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,690
However,

417
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,890
the heat toxin is fierce

418
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,809
and clashes with this medicine.

419
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,890
Whether she can pull through

420
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,210
will still depend

421
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,049
on herself.

422
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,049
Don't be afraid.

423
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,009

I still want to stay with you.

It was you who used to keep
Father company so often.

443
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,450
So he gave me a hint.

Sir Witch Doctor?

445
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,959
I found the name of the antidote

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,529

Really.

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,170
My Chen'an

452
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,450
can back safe and sound.

453
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,289
All thanks
to your protection and blessing, Father.

454
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,529
And also thanks to

455
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:39,450
those who chased relentlessly behind.

456
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:41,930
Chen'an,

457
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:44,210
what pleases me more

458
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,009
is that you stirred
the Three Judicial Offices into chaos.

459
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,450
My son,

460
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:51,529
I must

461
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,890
toast you.

462
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:56,809
Thank you, Father.

463
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,970
These were merely my duty.

464
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,450
What I ought to do most

465
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,239
is share your burdens.

466
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,250
Chen'an,

467
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,250
when you were faraway in the Great Tang,

468
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,490
I worried constantly.

469
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,798
Once the situation stabilized,

470
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,838
I immediately issued an edict
to summon you back.

471
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:21,410
But...

472
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,358
But when I heard of your death,

473
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,529
I was devastated.

474
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,289
It's my fault

475
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,009
and makes you worry, Father.

476
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,809
Thankfully.

477
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,569
Chen'an,

478
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,639
you're now

479
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,758
a great hero of Nanzhao.

480
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,798
I'll reward you handsomely.

481
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,318
What do you wish for?

482
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,278
Gold, jewels,

483
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,159
rank, or power?

484
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,078
Name it,

485
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,529
and I'll grant it all.

486
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:48,369
Father.

487
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,009
I don't seek worldly possessions.

488
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,490
All these years,

489
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,769
I've lived under your protection

490
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,769
as a foster son.

491
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,170
What I seek is your recognition

492
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,009
and not let your reputation down.

493
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,210
Father, I humbly ask you

494
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:05,529
to grant me this act of filial devotion.

495
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,329
Of course.

496
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,769
Granted.

497
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,278
Chen'an.

498
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:14,758
Come.

499
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,609
Chen'an,

500
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:18,159
even if you hadn't spoken,

501
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,890
I'd long intended
to restore your rightful status.

502
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,289
Thank you, Father.

503
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,210
However, this is a serious matter.

504
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,849
I can't decide it lightly.

505
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,798
Let me invite a senior monk to divine

506
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,639
an auspicious date.

507
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,199
Father!

508
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,970
Then...

509
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:34,849
Father!

510
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,650
Why are you back here?

511
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,450
Insolent!

512
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,690
What nonsense are you talking about?

513
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,049
Sit down.

514
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:43,849
Yes.

515
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:48,970
Father, forgive me.

516
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,410
I was simply overjoyed

517
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,849
to see my brother

518
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:54,970
return from the dead.

519
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,758
Chen'an, it's good that you're back.

520
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,318
Otherwise,

521
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,730
I would've led the troops
to avenge you.

522
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,849
The journey to the Great Tang
was full of hardship.

523
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,369
Sorry to make you worry.

524
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,769
However, I escaped by feigning death.

525
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,210
Great Tang hasn't found the proof
that I'm still alive.

526
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,529
If you wish to avenge me,

527
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,769
you may still send troops
to the Great Tang

528
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,130
and hold them to account.

529
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,730
Chen'an endured humiliation there
and rendered great service.

530
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,369
You must learn well from him.

531
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,650
Yes, Father.

532
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:30,609
Chen'an,

533
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,970
you've suffered greatly
on this journey.

534
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,049
From now on,

535
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,879
you and I

536
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,159
shall work together.

537
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,930
Father,

538
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,049
the journey to the Great Tang

539
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,809
was too arduous.

540
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,569
I'm not feeling well.

541
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:47,450
I will not accompany you further.

542
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,170
I take my leave.

543
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,049
Father,

544
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,049
I'll stay and dine with you.

545
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,210
Drink the medicine.

546
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,329
Physician Qi said

547
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,329
you must take it for another two weeks.

548
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,170
Once you recover,

549
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,890
you'll need proper nourishment.

550
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,730
You've suffered greatly this time.

551
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,609
It's easy for you
to have a lasting illness.

552
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,849
On top of that,
you keep letting your thoughts run wild.

553
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,210
Since when did you become
so long-winded?

554
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,650
Whose fault is that you never listen?

555
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,329
It's because I'm worried about Jing Yi.

556
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,078
I'm clueless about how he's doing
over there now.

557
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:59,529
I sent Chen Feng to quietly ask around.

558
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,369
Gao Luoqian wouldn't dare
make any overt move.

559
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,490
But

560
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,170
the Jing Residence
has been reeking of liquor lately.

561
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,289
Nothing seems amiss
on the surface though.

562
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,849
Leng Yue.

563
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,369
Your Highness,

564
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,049
I've come to report.

565
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:21,130
There's still no sign of You Chen'an.

566
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,199
Jing Yi...

567
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,250
It's all right.

568
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,490
Jing Yi's tough.

569
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,049
Gao Luoqian wouldn't dare kill him.

570
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:33,170
At most, he'll make him suffer a bit.

571
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,479
I have a way

572
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,769
to get you inside.

573
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,650
But only you can go in,

574
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,529
and nothing can go wrong.

575
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,278
Your Highness, please tell me.

576
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,410
I'll do exactly as you say.

577
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:53,890
Low humidity! Be aware of fire hazard!

578
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,130
Officer.

579
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,199
Deputy Prefect Leng.

580
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,049
Low humidity! Be aware of fire hazard!

581
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,170
Your Highness.

582
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:11,399
Has the poison fully cleared?

583
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,170
Thank you for your concern.

584
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,049
I'm still recovering,

585
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,049
but my condition is stable now.

586
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,278
I've heard that you've
been searching for women

587
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,000
who resemble Leng Yue

588
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,630
and sending them to
the Jing Residence.

589
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,289
I'd advise Your Highness

590
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,959
not to involve yourself

591
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,479
in the affairs of the Jing Residence.

592
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,890
I'm only worried.

593
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,650
Vice Minister Jing has always
lived a life of comfort.

594
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,170
How could he endure
the humiliation of confinement?

595
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,849
If he were to take his own life
out of despair,

596
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,690
the Nanzhao delegation
could simply leave,

597
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,490
but the blame would fall on the Capital
Prefecture and Ministry of Rites.

598
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,970
You wouldn't
escape responsibility either.

599
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:52,210
Are you worried for me, Your Highness?

600
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,089
You're one of the Leng family,

601
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,170
and you've been with Leng Yue
since she was a kid.

602
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,569
You and Jing Yi are also relatives.

603
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,890
That makes you family
to me and His Highness as well.

604
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,250
We ought to

605
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:06,849
look out for one another.

606
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,289
I can't look out for him.

607
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,769
Vice Minister Jing is unyielding.

608
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:11,919
No one dares approach him.

609
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,170
I have a plan.

610
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,118
It'll resolve your trouble

611
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:19,049
and also help Jing Yi.

612
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,369
Come out.

613
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,490
Greetings, sir.

614
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,250
Jing Yi.

615
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,410
Jing Yi.

616
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,450
Why are you burning up?

617
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,450
Get off of me.

618
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:16,598
Get lost.

619
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,329
I'll beat

620
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:20,410
whoever comes near me.

621
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,890
What does the woman you found

622
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,278
look like, Lord Leng?

623
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,769
Is she worse

624
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,089
than the ones I chose?

625
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,289
Hong Luan,

626
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,089
didn't you check before sending her in?

627
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,490
Sir,

628
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:43,089
when ordinary people bind their hair,
they tie a single knot.

629
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:46,130
But this one has three knots.

630
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,210
Your wife must love you deeply

631
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,970
and wish to be with you
for three lifetimes.

632
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,970
You dare speak of that?

633
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,569
Hand it over.

634
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,009
Ow!

635
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,650
My...

636
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,679
Sir,

637
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,199
are you tired?

638
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,529
Would you like me to help you lie down?

639
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,849
The night

640
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,170
is short, you know?

641
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,809
All right.

642
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,250
Anything you say, beauty.

643
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,719
I'll listen to

644
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,450
everything you say.

645
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,199
Come.

646
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,809
I'll help you, sir.

647
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,609
I'm coming, beauty.

648
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,049
I'm here.

649
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,118
Vice Minister Jing

650
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,170
has finally taken the bait.

651
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,769
We should've sent
Deputy Prefect Leng sooner.

652
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,930
I...

653
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:49,089
If we manage to
get something out of him,

654
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:53,450
we must credit Lord Leng
with great merit.

655
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,170
I'm not tired.

656
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:57,849
Beauty,

657
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,289
you're not allowed to leave.

658
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,369
Don't worry.

659
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,250
You haven't slept for days.

660
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,650
You must be exhausted.

661
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,050
I won't go anywhere tonight.

662
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,809
I'll stay with you.

663
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,439
Vice Minister Jing was raised among
refined gold and jade,

664
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,250
yet he favors something wild.

665
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,238
Though this woman

666
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,449
sounds a bit crude,

667
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,570
she does suit his taste.

668
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:32,999
Well,

669
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,130
should we keep standing here?

670
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,730
Let's go ahead and wait for good news.

671
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,650
Are you feeling better?

672
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,769
My dear,

673
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,350
there's something I must tell you.

674
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,439
I didn't touch them at all.

675
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,929
I didn't do anything to betray you.

676
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:26,769
I believe you.

677
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,130
Right,

678
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,999
His Highness thought of a way.

679
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,990
He had me bring in
some heart-protecting medicine.

680
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,210
Take one.

681
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,289
Here.

682
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,078
His Highness is trying to
figure out a way

683
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,570
to capture You Chen'an.

684
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,610
We'll find a way to get you out.

685
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,730
But

686
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,449
it may require a bit of patience.

687
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,889
You'll need to keep playing along
with them.

688
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,238
You should go.

689
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,690
I finally managed to get in.

690
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,329
How could I leave now?

691
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,570
All right.

♪This love was never easy,

693
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:36,950

697
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,090
It seems my worries were for nothing.

698
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:57,449
Your Highness managed
to enter the palace so smoothly.

699
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,409
I returned from the Great Tang
by narrowly escaping death.

700
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,610
My father would at least
grant me a few days' grace.

701
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:08,449
All thanks to your planning.

702
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,638
(Li Zhang, former Prefect of Qianzhou)
You ensured my safety in Chang'an

703
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,769
(Li Zhang, former Prefect of Qianzhou)
and allowed me to get what I wished for.

704
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:13,369
On this trip to Chang'an,

705
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,769
you deserve the greatest merit.

706
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,010
Your Highness.

707
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,929
When I ascend the throne,

708
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,369
I'll surely grant you rank and title.

709
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,730
Thank you, Your Highness.

710
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,530
I dare not hope for such things.

711
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:33,730
You showed me mercy

712
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,809
and saved my life.

713
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,929
I, Li Zhang,

714
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,718
am willing to give you my life

715
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:41,449
and follow you unto death.

716
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,570
Please give me something to eat.

717
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,409
Just a bite.

718
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,530
Please give me something to eat.

719
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,570
Shoo.

720
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,158
Please have mercy.

721
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:12,170
Please give me something to eat.

722
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:20,530
Li Zhang, you're pretending
to be mad and foolish

723
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,929
and living like a stray dog.

724
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:24,530
You must be terribly frustrated.

725
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,329
Do you want revenge?

726
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,730
A man dies for one
who truly understands him.

727
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:43,210
From the day I was saved,

728
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,530
I've entrusted my life

729
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,369
entirely to you.

730
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,690
Sit.

731
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,570
Thank you, Your Highness.

732
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:09,369
Though we were born into
different stations,

733
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,889
our circumstances are remarkably alike.

734
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,929
Let me speak from the heart.

735
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,050
Sometimes, I feel

736
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,849
you're more like my real elder brother.

737
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,809
Do you remember that day
when you proposed this,

738
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,610
pulling me out of danger

739
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,809
and giving my Chang'an journey
a strong beginning?

when I saw this
in Your Highness's possession,

743
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,170
I knew it would surely draw
the Prince An and his wife.

744
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,809
So I placed informants in the capital
to observe Xiao Jinyu's build in secret.

745
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,769
Still,

746
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,969
this was a risky move.

747
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,969
I worried it might bring trouble
to Your Highness.

748
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,610
Commandery Prince An is no fool.

749
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,650
He saw through it long ago.

750
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:03,399
I've only been curious.

751
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,530
How did Your Highness obtain

752
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,170
such a refined chart?

753
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,650
I spoke out of turn.

754
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,678
I spoke out of turn.

755
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:17,409
My apologies.

756
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,359
Oh, right, Your Highness,

757
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,439
before you returned,

758
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,570
I received a secret letter
from Chang'an.

759
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,118
It was delivered by the carrier pigeon

760
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:32,678
you used to contact me
while you were in the Great Tang.

761
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:36,289
It said Chu Chu was poisoned
by some kind of bee venom

762
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,839
and urgently needs an antidote.

763
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,399
It also said Chu He is waiting for you
at the post station.

764
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,530
Chu He?

765
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,449
He came.

766
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:10,610
Please.

767
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,929
An?

768
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,598
He.

769
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:14,439
An.

770
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,250
He.

771
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:16,969
An,

772
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,399
I've finally seen you.

773
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,050
It wasn't easy to see you once more.

774
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,759
Hadn't you helped me in Chang'an,

775
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,769
I'd have died long ago
at Gao Luoqian's hands.

776
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,809
But

777
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,489
I've got you into trouble.

778
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,879
We're friends.

779
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,289
Don't say that.

780
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,570
But...

781
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,250
It's just that...

782
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,319
Is something wrong?

783
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,929
It's just that my sister

784
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,489
was poisoned by some kind of bee venom
planted by Gao Luoqian.

785
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,769
If it were that darned Gao Luoqian,

786
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,329
my brother might have the antidote.

787
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:58,279
Chu Chu is still unconscious.

788
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,889
Even the imperial physicians
can't do anything about it.

789
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,289
An,

790
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,489
I'm begging of you.

791
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:09,238
Please help me find the antidote
and save Chu Chu.

792
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,399
Get up, He.

793
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,329
Get up first.

794
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,449
You know my relationship
with my brother.

795
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:17,038
Even if I begged him,

796
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,369
he would never give it to me.

797
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,449
If you won't help me,

798
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,210
then I'll go find it myself.

799
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,730
An,

800
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,929
what is this?

801
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:32,610
He,

802
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:35,489
the situation in Nanzhao
is unstable now.

803
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,489
You shouldn't move about freely.

804
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,610
Why not let me play the host
and have you rest here for a few days?

805
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,489
What do you think?

806
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,799
You mean to confine me?

807
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,959
You're afraid I'll go to You Longsheng
and expose you

808
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,770
when I'm searching
for the antidote, right?

809
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,250
If I can't find the antidote

810
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:57,730
to save Chu Chu...

811
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:04,449
There's no reason
for me to go on living!

812
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:14,769
He, are you all right?

813
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:17,530
An,

814
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:19,409
please.

815
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,170
Help me save Chu Chu.

816
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,570
Please!

817
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:27,690
