1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,679
(He went alone to seek You Chen'an.)

2
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,399
(He fought to the death
to obtain his fingerprint.)

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,559
(He traded his life to restore
His Highness and Jing Yi's innocence.)

4
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,359
(While we were investigating
Gao Luoqian's crimes,)

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,800
(we discovered in fear that)

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,280
(Nanzhao had been laying its plans
in the capital for a long time.)

7
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,280
(Who knows how many
Great Tang officials)

8
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,479
(have already been corrupted)

9
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,399
(and exploited.)

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,320
(Jiang Daohai, Prefect of the Capital,)

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,880
(was also secretly
colluding with Nanzhao.)

12
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,880
(Their reach)

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,200
(has already extended deep
into the imperial relatives.)

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,520
(The entanglements run deep.)

15
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,840
(There is no easy place to strike.)

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
(To ensure safety,)

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,119
(we could only begin our investigation)

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,240
(with his household member,
Zhao Wanrong.)

(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,160
(This story is entirely fictional.)

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,840
=Episode 22=

37
00:02:59,319 --> 00:02:59,919
Eldest Prince.

38
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,199
All have been eliminated.

39
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,759
Very good.

40
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,319
The civilians in the houses
on both sides ahead

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
should have all fled by now.

42
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,120
It is utterly quiet.

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,159
Past the stone steps of the alley
lies the long bridge.

44
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,800
At present, the Jiaozhou Army
has made no move.

45
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,759
As long as we are fast enough,

46
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,000
we can seize the bridge in one strike.

47
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,520
Leave two men here to keep watch.

48
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,800
Pass down my order.

49
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,680
Whoever is the first to climb
onto the bridgehead

50
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,719
will be rewarded
with fifty taels of silver.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,280
Did you hear that, brothers?

52
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,280
- We heard!
- We heard!

53
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,039
Charge!

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,919
The military situation is urgent.

55
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,120
I have no time to waste with you.

56
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,800
Hurry and assemble the Jiaozhou Army.

57
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,319
Yes.

58
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,520
Wait.

59
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,199
General Xiao.

60
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,479
Although you have already been promoted
to Annan Great General,

61
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,879
there are some matters

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,080
that are not for you alone to decide.

63
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:41,680
Han Ji.

64
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,039
Your posting to Jiaozhou
was His Majesty's

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,719
chance for you to redeem yourself.

66
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,439
Protecting the people
of Jiaozhou is your sworn duty.

67
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,280
Now the beacon towers
are seized and soldiers captured,

68
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,520
yet you still place private grudges above public duty
and make things difficult for me?

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,120
I live on the sovereign's stipend.

70
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,280
I would never sit idle
and draw pay for nothing.

71
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,719
General Xiao.

72
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,599
See for yourself.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,199
While the Outer Secretary
is in Chang'an,

74
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,959
No troops may be deployed

75
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,839
beyond the border
without imperial authorization.

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,759
Why was I never told about this

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,720
while I was in Chang'an?

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,480
Could it be that when His Majesty
issues an imperial instruction,

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,399
he must first inform you?

80
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,940
(No troops may be deployed beyond
the border without imperial authorization.)

81
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,759
Then for Nanzhao to dare launch
a sudden attack at this moment,

82
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,439
could it be that someone
leaked the news?

83
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,560
In any case,

84
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:54,920
I, Han Ji,

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,560
dare not defy an imperial decree

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,120
or act on my own authority.

87
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,910
Hurry to the Zhechong Command
and mobilize troops.

88
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,720
Mobilize as many as you can.

89
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,740
Rush at once to outside Jiaozhou City.

90
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,319
How dare you.

91
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,920
You, stop right there. Stop.

92
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,759
Chief Clerk Han.

93
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,839
What should we do now?

94
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,639
If it is truly as General Xiao says,

95
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,639
and the Nanzhao forces
learned of the imperial instruction,

96
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,930
and took advantage of the gap to strike,

97
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:19,319
then

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
Jiaozhou is in peril,

99
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,920
and the people are in peril as well.

100
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,160
What should we do?

101
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,000
This...

102
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,920
How would I know what to do?

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
I am nothing more than a Chief Clerk.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,360
How would I know what ought to be done?

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,079
You expect me to...

106
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,720
Chief Clerk Han.

107
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:34,879
Get out of here.

108
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,480
Get out.

109
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,759
What is going on?

110
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,170
Wasn't it said that no troops could move
without imperial authorization?

111
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,680
Nanzhao truly
has keen ears and sharp eyes.

112
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,800
They even know
of His Majesty's instruction.

113
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,639
This must be the Eldest Prince.

114
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,680
To dare launch such an open attack,

115
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:39,160
you are certain Jiaozhou
would not dare send troops.

116
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,560
Eldest Prince.

117
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,439
This man is Xiao Jinli,

118
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,279
the current Annan Great General.

119
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,279
General Xiao defied
the instruction and sent troops.

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,759
Are you not afraid
of inviting death upon yourself?

121
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:52,680
Eldest Prince,

122
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,199
you must not speak recklessly.

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,040
When did I ever send troops?

124
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,879
It is only that recently,

125
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
a sudden mountain flood
blocked the roads.

126
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,879
I led my men to clear
the way and happened to be here.

127
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,639
Rather, it is the Eldest Prince

128
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,120
who led troops
into Great Tang territory,

129
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,920
provoking armed conflict.

130
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,680
What is your intent?

131
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,839
If you do not withdraw at once,

132
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,920
do not blame me

133
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,680
for ensuring you return no more.

134
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,079
Eldest Prince.

135
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,720
They hold the high ground,

136
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,519
yet dare only attack with loose stones.

137
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
It is clear they lack sufficient forces.

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,959
Xiao Jinli

139
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
has only just taken office.

140
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,439
He cannot
yet mobilize Jiaozhou's troops,

141
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,759
and can only bring his own men

142
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,040
to put on a show of force here.

143
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,720
Such a rare opportunity,

144
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,639
if we withdraw now,

145
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,199
it will be lost.

146
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,800
General Xiao, why put on such airs?

147
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,199
Let us fight it out blade to blade.

148
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,040
Then we shall see who it is

149
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,240
that does not return alive.

150
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,120
Whoever captures Xiao Jinli alive

151
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,560
will be rewarded
with a thousand taels of gold.

152
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,500
(CGI effects. No animals were harmed
or abused in the making of this series.)

153
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,279
- Eldest Prince.
- Eldest Prince.

154
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:12,920
Are you hurt?

155
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,240
Who goes there?

156
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,600
I am the one who rules this mountain.

157
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,480
Seeing you all decked
in gold and silver,

158
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,079
I am collecting a little toll.

159
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,600
So you are band of bandits.

160
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,120
What ill luck.

161
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,519
If you do not leave at once,

162
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,799
I will kill you along with them.

163
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,879
Bold words.

164
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,879
That outfit you wear looks fine enough.

165
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,679
Strip it off.

166
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,240
I will trade it for a jug of liquor.

167
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,799
Nanzhao

168
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,799
dares to wage war on Great Tang.

169
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,559
To fight openly,

170
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,840
they lack the strength.

171
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,679
Yet the King of Nanzhao
is deeply calculating,

172
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,679
with countless dark schemes.

173
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,279
From what they did in Chang'an,

174
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,600
one can already see it.

175
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:54,840
At present,

176
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:56,960
we must meet them head on,

177
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,200
and win by surprise.

178
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,639
Say something I can understand.

179
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,559
No matter what tricks they use,

180
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,759
their assault on Jiaozhou

181
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,879
is all calculated

182
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,279
on Jiaozhou's current forces.

183
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,799
But if there is one force

184
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,320
outside their expectations,

185
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,480
then it may be possible

186
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,600
to catch them off guard.

187
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,879
You mean

188
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,399
our Mount Zhenyuan Abode?

189
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,600
Pour the oil.

190
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,720
What is that smell?

191
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,240
Move, quickly.

192
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,559
It is fire oil.

193
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,080
Xiao Jinli.

194
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
You are a dignified general,

195
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,759
yet you resort to trickery.

196
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,320
These stone steps

197
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,720
have been drenched in fire oil.

198
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,360
Whoever dares take one step forward,

199
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,600
I will send you to meet your ancestors.

200
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,440
All of you, attack the steps.

201
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:08,120
Charge!

202
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,200
Eldest Prince.

203
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,120
Those mountain bandits

204
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,039
are clearly working together
with Xiao Jinli's men.

205
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,879
Ahead of us is a sea of fire,

206
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,360
behind us the city gate.

207
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,799
We are completely trapped.

208
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,120
Fire. Put it out.

209
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,960
Put it out.

210
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,360
Useless fools.

211
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:43,960
Fools.

212
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,679
Fall back.

213
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,700
(Capital Prefecture)

214
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,159
It is open.

215
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:12,840
Any findings?

216
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,519
Nothing at all.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,480
- Why burn this?
- Why burn this?

218
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,420
(Capital Prefecture Seal)

219
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,440
Why is there a small notch here?

220
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,399
There is one here too.

221
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,740
(Capital Prefecture Seal)

222
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,260
There is something wrong
with the official seal.

223
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,600
All official seals of our court
are cast in copper.

224
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:04,720
This one,

225
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,519
why is it carved from wood?

226
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,519
No wonder there was a small notch.

227
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,960
It turns out to be a crack in the wood.

228
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,519
Jiang Daohai

229
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,559
must have lost the official seal,

230
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,600
which is why he had
a wooden one carved as a substitute.

231
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:29,840
Losing an official seal
is a grave crime.

232
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:32,080
It could cost him his head.

233
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,480
So this is Jiang Daohai's weakness.

234
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,840
Lord Jiang.

235
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,519
These are today's documents.

236
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,730
Please review them and affix the seal.

237
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,519
This...

238
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Did you go inside?

239
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,679
Without your permission,
no one dares enter the rear offices.

240
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,080
I have been waiting here the whole time.

241
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,559
Prefect Jiang,

242
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
have you misplaced something?

243
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,519
No.

244
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,080
Perhaps

245
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,240
I was in a hurry
and forgot to lock the door.

246
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,420
(Universal Post Station)

247
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:48,799
Why has he not arrived yet?

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,200
Could Jiang Daohai be having
second thoughts at the last moment?

249
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,080
He would not dare.

250
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,240
We still hold his solid proof.

251
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,559
Where is it?

252
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,840
Why so late?

253
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,639
Vice Envoy Gao,
my apologies for the wait.

254
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,200
At His Majesty's behest,

255
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,720
I have come to summon you to the palace.

256
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,080
Please,

257
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,480
Vice Envoy Gao.

258
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,080
Vice Envoy Gao,

259
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,279
where are you headed dressed like this?

260
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,559
By His Majesty's decree,
you were to remain at the post station.

261
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,360
Who had the nerve to let you out?

262
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,480
Could it be Jiang Daohai,

263
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:00,000
who lost his official seal
and was threatened by you?

264
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,120
Jiang Daohai lost his official seal?

265
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,840
Reporting to Your Majesty,

266
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:05,900
under the pretense of diligence,

267
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,830
Jiang Daohai stayed
in the rear offices night after night,

268
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,639
in truth to avoid his wife

269
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,159
and keep beautiful women by his side.

270
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,000
Someone seized the chance
to steal his official seal.

271
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,120
Jiang Daohai dared not search openly,

272
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,399
nor delay official business.

273
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,279
He could only imitate Chancellor Pei,

274
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,919
and carve a seal from wood,

275
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,159
passing it off as real.

276
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,600
If it were discovered,

277
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:24,759
it could be destroyed at once.

278
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,440
But he overlooked that wood,

279
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,799
once air dried, will warp

280
00:16:27,879 --> 00:16:28,759
and develop cracks.

281
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,480
If Your Majesty examines the documents
sent from the Capital Prefecture,

282
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:32,679
it will be evident at a glance.

283
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,440
What?

284
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,440
He has been summoned
into the palace by His Majesty?

285
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,399
I am under orders

286
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,519
to investigate the pharmacy case.

287
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,879
There can be no delay.

288
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,960
Since

289
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,799
Vice Envoy Gao is absent,

290
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,759
bring the female official
in for questioning first.

291
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,240
Come with me.

292
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:58,559
Yes.

293
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,440
Where is the official seal?

294
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,799
Once we are outside the city,
you will have it.

295
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,960
Lord Li of the Imperial Library,

296
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,630
Vice Minister Liu
of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices,

297
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,240
and Lord Shangguan,
the Defender of Valor,

298
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:19,599
all attended the banquet.

299
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,519
Jiang Daohai hosting
a feast for his birthday

300
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,039
appears perfectly reasonable.

301
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,920
Because the one behind it
needed to ensure

302
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,599
that those Jiang Daohai invited

303
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,079
were exactly the people required.

304
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,519
At that banquet,

305
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,119
Jiang Daohai not only served liquor,

306
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,079
he had them take poison as well.

307
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,279
Poison?

308
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,960
What poison?

309
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,000
The same poison
that even ensnared this minister.

310
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,839
It produces red blotches
resembling syphilis sores.

311
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,039
Those poisoned,

312
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,680
men like Zhao Senyao,

313
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,160
must obey the poisoner

314
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,880
if they wish to live.

315
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,759
As for the upright and incorruptible,

316
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:52,920
such as General Xie

317
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,279
and Wan Qianshan,

318
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,960
they were brutally silenced.

319
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,839
Stealing the official seal,

320
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,960
coercing the Prefect of the Capital,

321
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,839
manipulating officials,

322
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,079
my court

323
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,039
has long been riddled with holes.

324
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,559
Gao Luoqian.

325
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,960
You have tremendous nerve.

326
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,839
Your Majesty, this is merely the conjecture of
Commandery Prince An and Vice Minister Jing.

327
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,759
Where is the evidence?

328
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,240
What proof is there?

329
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,440
Surely you cannot

330
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,599
place all the old rot uncovered
in Great Tang

331
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,720
squarely on me.

332
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,079
Your Majesty.

333
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,640
Lady Jing seeks an urgent audience.

334
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:29,400
Lord Gao,

335
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:30,880
the evidence has arrived.

336
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,440
Summon her.

337
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,440
Summon Lady Jing to audience.

338
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,599
Your Majesty.

339
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,119
No need for formalities.

340
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,440
What is this?

341
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,440
Reporting to Your Majesty,

342
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,119
this is the official seal seized
from Hong Luan,

343
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,880
as well as the poison found

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,160
at the Nanzhao relay station.

345
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,400
His Highness foresaw that Jiang Daohai

346
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,890
would escort Hong Luan
out of the city alone,

347
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,279
and ordered me to follow in secret.

348
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,119
When Hong Luan handed
the seal to Jiang Daohai,

349
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,720
I apprehended them at once
with the evidence in hand.

350
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,960
After securing the seal,

351
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:18,240
I feared accomplices hidden
within the Nanzhao delegation,

352
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,039
and searched the relay station
without delay,

353
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,279
where these poisons were found.

354
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,440
I acted before reporting.

355
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:23,559
I beg Your Majesty's pardon.

356
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,710
In urgent matters,
discretion was required.

357
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,519
You acted well.

358
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,480
Rise.

359
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:27,759
Thank you, Your Majesty.

360
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,160
Your Majesty,

361
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,799
this is the same life prolonging drug

362
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,400
sold at a high price to the poisoned

363
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:34,359
by the false Zhou Han

364
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,759
in the case
of the ghost selling years of life.

365
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,000
Gao Luoqian used this drug

366
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,200
to control those officials

367
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,559
who clung to life after being poisoned.

368
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,519
Reporting to Your Majesty,

369
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,720
the Three Judicial Offices are conducting
a full search at the relay station.

370
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,920
The female attendant Hong Luan

371
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,240
has confessed to everything.

372
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,480
Jiang Daohai and Chang Shou
await outside the hall

373
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,279
and can confront Vice Envoy Gao
at any time.

374
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:03,880
Your Majesty.

375
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Spare me, Your Majesty.

376
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,680
I have neither such power nor authority.

377
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:09,559
It was...

378
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,279
It was...

379
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,440
Second Prince.

380
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,160
It was Second Prince.

381
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,160
Everything was ordered by Second Prince.

382
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,240
I knew nothing of it, Your Majesty.

383
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,559
Whether you knew or not,

384
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,240
you can explain it
at the Three Judicial Offices.

385
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,880
Issue my decree.

386
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,640
Vice Envoy Gao Luoqian of Nanzhao,

387
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,960
and the female attendant Hong Luan,

388
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,279
are suspected
of stealing the official seal

389
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,160
and poisoning officials of Great Tang.

390
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,759
Detain them pending trial.

391
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,200
Jiang Daohai.

392
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,839
Huang Lv.

393
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,880
Detain them as well.

394
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,440
Hand them over to the Three Judicial Offices
for full investigation.

395
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,440
As for all other involved parties,

396
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,119
the Three Judicial Offices

397
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,680
are authorized
to arrest and interrogate.

398
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,599
- Yes.
- Yes.

399
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,319
We obey the decree.

400
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,839
Come to think of it,

401
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,519
the blame lies with me.

402
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:56,839
I constrained him too tightly,

403
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,480
forcing him to seek pleasure elsewhere.

404
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,119
That was entirely his own doing.

405
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:04,920
To commit such disgraceful acts
within the prefectural offices,

406
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,400
was what gave villains their opening.

407
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,480
Cousin.

408
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,359
You keep taking
all the blame upon yourself

409
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,599
only because

410
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
you want me to pull Jiang Daohai
back once more.

411
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,880
After all,

412
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,279
he and I were husband and wife.

413
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,319
Cousin,

414
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:24,640
think of it as acting
for the future of the Zhao family.

415
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,920
Please help him.

416
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,440
The Zhao family...

417
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,880
If I had not favored my own kin,

418
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,079
I would never have allowed you

419
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,960
to stir up so much disgrace.

420
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,279
Fortunately, you were
not entirely muddled

421
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,720
and told Commandery Prince An
everything you knew.

422
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,920
As for Jiang Daohai's fate,

423
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,200
it will depend on his own fortune.

424
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,279
Ever since

425
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,599
you began handling cases
with His Highness,

426
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,039
you have grown busier and busier.

427
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,680
The two of us, father and son,

428
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,119
have not shared a proper meal together
in a long time.

429
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,559
I acted rashly

430
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,759
and caused you worry.

431
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,240
At the most critical moment,

432
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,039
I once begged His Majesty

433
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,000
that if there truly were no way out,

434
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,960
you should be abandoned.

435
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:24,480
So that explains it.

436
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,119
No wonder His Majesty
made his decision so swiftly.

437
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:30,960
I

438
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,640
have wronged you.

439
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,519
That is why we are father and son.

440
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,370
We understand each other without words.

441
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,640
You devoted yourself wholly
to Great Tang,

442
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,690
to the point of death if need be.

443
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,240
I must follow your example.

444
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,839
I cannot be a coward.

445
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,319
To trade my single life

446
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,880
for a chance for Great Tang to breathe

447
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,920
is more than worth it.

448
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,079
I only regret...

449
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,240
That I did not tell you earlier,

450
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,839
so you could record a great merit
for me in the genealogy.

451
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,160
Do not speak nonsense.

452
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,839
Have some sense of propriety.

453
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,519
You live well

454
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,119
is what matters most.

455
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,920
I thank you for your teaching, Father.

456
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,880
With head held high, I answer to Heaven.

457
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,519
With heart unashamed, I face all people.

458
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,440
Father.

459
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,279
You must not...

460
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,200
You have grown up.

461
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,119
Though Gao Luoqian has been
lawfully taken down,

462
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Nanzhao

463
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,400
still watches us like a tiger.

464
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,079
Following His Highness,

465
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:53,440
you still have many matters to resolve.

466
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:58,839
I understand.

467
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,319
Come.

468
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,359
Let me toast you.

469
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,160
You Longsheng brought only a small force

470
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,519
to probe the situation.

471
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,359
With Jiaozhou's troops,

472
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:21,119
how could he have been allowed
to seize the beacon tower so easily?

473
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,720
What concerns me more is

474
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,279
Xiao Jinli holds the post
of Annan Great General.

475
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,680
Against barely
a hundred Nanzhao soldiers,

476
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,720
he still dared not engage,

477
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,599
and sought reinforcements
from me across a thousand miles.

478
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,119
Your Majesty fears

479
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,720
something amiss in Jiaozhou?

480
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,480
Jiaozhou lies far away.

481
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,039
Its forces are deeply entangled.

482
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,759
Orders are hard to deliver,
dissent easily arises.

483
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,920
Xiao Jinli cannot bear it alone.

484
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:46,519
After much thought,

485
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,599
I must have you go there in person.

486
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:49,559
Go and see

487
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,160
what is truly going on.

488
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,000
That was my intention as well.

489
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,039
I will grant you the title of censor,

490
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
to ease your actions.

491
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,599
Now that their schemes are exposed,

492
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,039
they will surely have further moves.

493
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,079
Remember,

494
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:03,240
in all matters,

495
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,319
be cautious.

496
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:05,319
I understand.

497
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,920
Nanzhao has never abandoned
its designs on Jiaozhou.

498
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,759
At the root of it,

499
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:11,880
they seek
to seize Jiaozhou's trade routes,

500
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,839
its resources,

501
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,319
and its land for themselves.

502
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,839
An all out war

503
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,000
for them,

504
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,240
not the best option either.

505
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,960
I will act as the situation allows

506
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,559
and ensure Jiaozhou's safety.

507
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,039
Before Jinli departed,

508
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,759
I told him this.

509
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,319
You are Great Tang's
future and its hope.

510
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,000
Today,

511
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,839
I give those words to you as well.

512
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,119
Xiao Jinyu.

513
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,160
The realm stands precarious,

514
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,839
swayed by storm and wind.

515
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:39,799
I

516
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,759
await your triumphant return,

517
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,039
and I also hope that you

518
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,400
return safe and sound.

519
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,100
♪No matter how far, I gaze at the light♪

520
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,100
♪Fearing no wild lands, I press on♪

521
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:12,820
♪I walk once more
through the corridors of time♪

522
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,960
♪The more ordinary the years,
the more absurd they seem♪

523
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,039
- Welcome home, Your Highness.
- Welcome home, Your Highness.

524
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:24,200
Your Highness.

525
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,960
Something unusual happened today.

526
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,599
The moment we opened the doors,

527
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,960
a body was brought in.

528
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,160
So the body entered before I did.

529
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,400
When I examined him,

530
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,480
guess what happened.

531
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,559
He actually came back to life.

532
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,480
Turns out he drank
Redroot Spirit by mistake,

533
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,519
and happened to impact

534
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,079
the Futu and Renying acupoints.

535
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,680
Your Highness.

536
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,039
Your Highness.

537
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,839
You listen to me talk so much every day.

538
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,960
Do you ever find it annoying?

539
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,960
No.

540
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,400
How could I?

541
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Every word you say stays with me.

542
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:58,319
It is just that now,

543
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,200
we have something more important to do.

544
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,200
Chu Chu and I will go to Jiaozhou.

545
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,160
We leave tomorrow.

546
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,240
Chen Feng.

547
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,960
Zhang Yun.

548
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:10,799
You will come with us.

549
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,759
- Yes.
- Yes.

550
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:12,799
Leng Yue, Jing Yi.

551
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,680
Leave the follow up interrogation
of Gao Luoqian to you.

552
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,400
I want every last pair of eyes
he planted in Chang'an

553
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,640
exposed in full.

554
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,920
Rest assured.

555
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,559
With me here,
he will confess everything.

556
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,240
Then we split our forces.

557
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,920
Chang'an and Jiaozhou,

558
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,519
press both fronts at once.

559
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,799
- Yes.
- Yes.

560
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,740
(Prefect's Residence)

561
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:50,690
- He's back.
- He's back.

562
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,880
- Prefect Liu.
- Prefect Liu.

563
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,079
You have finally returned.

564
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,540
You must be weary from the journey.

565
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,759
Please come in and rest.

566
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,480
What has happened?

567
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,359
Is my wife unwell?

568
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,599
No, not at all.

569
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,240
My lord,

570
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,200
please return to the residence
to discuss.

571
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,079
This way, please.

572
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,440
The Nanzhao troops
did not enter the city.

573
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,440
Why panic?

574
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,000
You startled me.

575
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,119
They are entrenched
outside Jiaozhou City now.

576
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
That poses a hidden danger.

577
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,119
Prefect Liu,

578
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,000
you must decide quickly.

579
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,200
Indeed.

580
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,559
With Jiaozhou's forces,

581
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,240
a mere hundred men should never have broken
through the beacon post.

582
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,279
Chief Clerk Han,

583
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,759
this turmoil

584
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,200
arose while you
were overseeing Jiaozhou affairs.

585
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:52,160
Naturally, it falls to you to handle it.

586
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,119
Prefect Liu, didn't you hear in Chang'an

587
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,559
of His Majesty's instruction?

588
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,500
What imperial instruction?

589
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,400
His Majesty decreed

590
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,279
that while delegations
remain in Chang'an,

591
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,590
Without an imperial instruction,
no troops are to be deployed beyond the border

592
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
When was this issued?

593
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,090
Who received the imperial instruction?

594
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:13,880
I...

595
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,960
I received it.

596
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:17,519
What is it now?

597
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,240
Then there is nothing more to discuss.

598
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,660
Whoever received the imperial instruction
bears the responsibility.

599
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,640
I will keep to my proper duties

600
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:25,480
and will not speak out of turn.

601
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,559
I am going to see my wife.

602
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,720
I will not disturb your discussion.

603
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,880
Liu Shijiang.

604
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:29,920
You cannot leave.

605
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,279
You are the Prefect,

606
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,160
yet at a time of crisis

607
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,599
you always think of hiding.

608
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,680
Madam Yulan is pregnant,

609
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,300
yet she still worries
for the people of Jiaozhou.

610
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,119
Are you truly worse than
a woman of the inner quarters?

611
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,480
You want to see her, do you?

612
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:41,960
Fine.

613
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,079
Everyone present,

614
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,000
we will go together.

615
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,599
After that, make a decision at once.

616
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,839
I am seeing my wife.

617
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,039
Why must you follow?

618
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,720
I am following.

619
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,839
Do you know nothing of propriety?

620
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,559
You cannot leave.

621
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:53,400
General Xiao.

622
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,440
You arrived just in time.

623
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,559
The people of Jiaozhou

624
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,920
are counting on you entirely,

625
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:57,920
General Xiao.

626
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:58,960
I?

627
00:29:59,359 --> 00:29:59,880
Exactly.

628
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,519
You are now Annan Great General.

629
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,279
Military matters should naturally
be decided by you.

630
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,400
Annan Great General,

631
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:14,440
this matter

632
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,720
is not for you to meddle in.

633
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,759
When will we be allowed through?

634
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,720
Exactly.

635
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,920
Today you push it to tomorrow,

636
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,210
tomorrow you push it to the day after.

637
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:27,799
No shouting, no trouble.

638
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,599
It will be soon.

639
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,160
Everyone will be able to go home.

640
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:31,690
It has been sealed off
for over ten days already.

641
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,519
I still have work
to do to earn my living.

642
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:34,380
(Yuanxin Inn)

643
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,640
My father is still waiting
at home for medicine.

644
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,640
Let me out.

645
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,400
That's right.

646
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,680
Let us out.

647
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:41,150
Everyone, please wait a bit longer.

648
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,240
Just a little longer.

649
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:44,920
Once the inspection is finished,
passage will be opened at once.

650
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:46,559
How long is this going to take?

651
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,880
So many people are waiting here.

652
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,079
General Xiao has given the order.

653
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,599
Everyone, you may pass as normal.

654
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,119
Let's go.

655
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,000
Go.

656
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,039
No pushing.

657
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,119
One at a time.

658
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,400
Open the gate.

659
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,319
Once this checkpoint opens,

660
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,759
those Nanzhao soldiers

661
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:16,440
might disguise themselves
as civilians and slip out in the chaos.

662
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:17,920
That is exactly the point.

663
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,880
General Xiao said we cannot
deploy troops lightly right now.

664
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,240
Rather than forcing You Longsheng
into desperation,

665
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,200
it is better to let some people leave,

666
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,079
to avoid further trouble.

667
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,119
Besides, this time You Longsheng

668
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,200
has caused such a disaster,

669
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,599
he will surely have to face

670
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,799
the Nanzhao king
and that younger brother of his,

671
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,880
who is no different from an enemy.

672
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,000
I just wonder

673
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,519
what kind of shabby disguise

674
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,759
that arrogant Nanzhao Eldest Prince

675
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,480
will put on.

676
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,160
What is that smell?

677
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,880
It stinks.

678
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,000
It reeks.

679
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,759
What do you do?

680
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:58,680
Officer,

681
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:00,279
I sell fish.

682
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,880
We have not been allowed
through these past few days.

683
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:05,119
A lot of the fish and shrimp
have already died.

684
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,559
If I do not haul them out
to deal with them,

685
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,400
the whole city of Jiaozhou will stink.

686
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,279
Please take a look.

687
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,839
Go, hurry up and go.

688
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,079
(Prefect's Residence)
I heard your pregnancy was unstable.

689
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,720
I was terribly worried.

690
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,359
As soon as I received your letter,

691
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,880
I took leave of His Majesty.

692
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,400
But I caught a chill on the road

693
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,519
and was delayed for several days.

694
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,799
Are you better now?

695
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:34,599
Much better.

696
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,640
You really should not have done that.

697
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,079
No matter how urgent things are,
you must not neglect your health.

698
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,039
It was only a minor illness.

699
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:40,880
Nothing serious.

700
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:41,720
And you?

701
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,240
Are you feeling better?

702
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,359
There is no great concern now.

703
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,880
It was my own carelessness.

704
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:49,279
I startled myself over nothing,

705
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,160
and made you worry.

706
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,480
Do not say that, Madam.

707
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,920
You are with child,

708
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,680
yet I could not stay by your side
to care for you.

709
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,359
I am already deeply ashamed.

710
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:02,640
Master.

711
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,119
Han Ji...

712
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,519
Madam, what is wrong?

713
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,079
Nothing.

714
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,319
You have never hesitated with me before.

715
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,559
What exactly happened?

716
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,200
Master,

717
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,480
I have wronged you.

718
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,599
It is all my fault.

719
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,160
I failed to protect myself.

720
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,480
Chief Clerk Han, he…

721
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:43,559
Who is it?

722
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,039
It is me.

723
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,119
Madam.

724
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,160
I have something to tell you.

725
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,519
Please open the door.

726
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
Chief Clerk Han,

727
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,880
it is already late.

728
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,000
I have retired for the night.

729
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,759
Whatever it is can wait until tomorrow.

730
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,640
It concerns Prefect Liu.

731
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,119
By tomorrow it will be too late.

732
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,559
I must inform Madam at once.

733
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,160
Please open the door.

734
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,519
What is wrong with my husband?

735
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,199
Madam,

736
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
let me come inside
and explain it to you slowly.

737
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:20,519
Go.

738
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,599
Chief Clerk Han.

739
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,880
Chief Clerk Han.

740
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,599
Chief Clerk Han.

741
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,920
What are you trying to do?

742
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,159
Let go of me.

743
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,039
Chief Clerk Han.

744
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,000
He actually dared to...

745
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,440
Master.

746
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,239
Master.

747
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,159
Master, are you all right?

748
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:38,920
You...

749
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,679
Why did you not tell me sooner?

750
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,519
I had meant to end my life.

751
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,360
But I could not bear
to leave the child I carry.

752
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,360
After I give birth,

753
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,480
I will repay you

754
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,360
with my life.

755
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,840
That beast!

756
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,519
Master.

757
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:06,199
That beast!

758
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,079
Master!

759
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,440
Master!

760
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,280
In this world,

761
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
good deeds truly do bring their reward.

762
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,239
If General Xiao had
not shown mercy back then

763
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,159
and saved my life...

764
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,880
It was not mercy on impulse.

765
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,559
Then you acted because of her looks.

766
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,880
You are talking nonsense again.

767
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,320
Not desire.

768
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:42,559
Righteousness.

769
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,679
Righteousness at first sight.

770
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,679
That cannot be explained
in a line or two.

771
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,199
In any case,
it had nothing to do with looks.

772
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,000
Since you cannot explain it briefly,

773
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,920
then take three or four lines

774
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,039
and tell it slowly.

775
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:02,599
It was...

776
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,559
It was for my official post.

777
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,880
For your post?

778
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,220
I do not believe that.

779
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:10,079
People like us are bandits
in the eyes of the court.

780
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,559
If you had taken a few of our heads,
you might even have earned some credit.

781
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,440
Saving us,

782
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,840
you would be lucky
not to invite trouble.

783
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,510
How could it possibly
help your promotion?

784
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,239
Not for promotion.

785
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,639
What I mean is,

786
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,519
as a general of Great Tang,

787
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,920
one must keep a region safe.

788
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,000
No matter how border folk make a living,

789
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,119
they are all people of Great Tang.

790
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,519
Even the poorest land

791
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,719
is still Great Tang territory.

792
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,960
To guard every inch
of mountains and rivers,

793
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:34,880
every inch of land,

794
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,960
that is the duty
of a Great Tang general.

795
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,079
Therefore,

796
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,079
no matter who is in danger,

797
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:41,639
as long as I encounter it,

798
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:42,679
I will save them.

799
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,360
Then in your heart,

800
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,239
am I the same as them?

801
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:46,800
No.

802
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,159
You are different.

803
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,119
How am I different?

804
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,280
You…

805
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:54,119
I…

806
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,440
I…

807
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,800
Looks like Leng Yue was right.

808
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,199
That tongue of yours
is only good for mixing rice.

809
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,119
General.

810
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,890
Commandery Prince An
and the Princess Consort have arrived.

811
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,750
Please invite them in at once.

812
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,119
Yes.

813
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,000
Jinli.

814
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,039
Jinyu.

815
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,119
Chu Chu.

816
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,690
Why have you come to Jiaozhou?

817
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,840
The court received word

818
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,239
that Nanzhao
had raised troops to invade,

819
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,290
and even seized the beacon post.

820
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,039
His Majesty feared something
might go wrong,

821
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,480
so he appointed me as a censor,

822
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:31,639
to come assist you

823
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,000
in handling Jiaozhou affairs.

824
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,000
As soon as we entered the city,
we saw your men.

825
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
They said you have been
holding the front lines,

826
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,400
and even Chief Luo
of Mount Zhenyuan Abode

827
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,719
is stationed at the beacon post.

828
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:43,639
With the situation urgent,
we hurried over.

829
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,039
Yes.

830
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:45,320
Chief Luo

831
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,119
was originally
a precautionary arrangement.

832
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,039
I did not expect

833
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,559
that the precaution
would truly be needed.

834
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,920
The Nanzhao Eldest Prince

835
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,760
has been charging about like a wild dog.

836
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,039
I feared that trapping them
here too long

837
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:57,159
might drive them
to fight to mutual destruction.

838
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,320
To prevent sudden change,

839
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:59,400
I stayed here to hold them.

840
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,880
Why has the Jiaozhou army
not gone out to meet them?

841
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,440
It seems you are also unaware
of the imperial instruction.

842
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,559
What imperial instruction?

843
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,079
Commandery Prince An.

844
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,800
Commandery Princess Consort An.

845
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,320
Great General of the Southern Front.

846
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,280
I truly did not expect

847
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,639
the Commandery Prince and Princess Consort An
to come all the way to Jiaozhou.

848
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,639
After I was demoted to Jiaozhou,

849
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,199
while traveling here,

850
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,000
my wife sank into despair
and passed away.

851
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:31,840
Though Your Highness once

852
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,420
spoke a few kind words for me
before His Majesty,

853
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,119
still,

854
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,000
my being forced to Jiaozhou

855
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:38,880
cannot be said to have nothing to do
with Your Highness.

856
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:43,920
Now I have already shut myself
away in Jiaozhou to reflect on my faults.

857
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,400
Yet I never imagined

858
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,880
Your Highness would still refuse
to let me be.

859
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,079
You have even pursued me to Jiaozhou.

860
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,000
Lord Han.

861
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,760
It has been some time.

862
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,039
Your Highness.

863
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,800
This is Jiaozhou,

864
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,559
not the Capital.

865
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,760
You may wield great influence
in the capital,

866
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:04,000
but affairs in Jiaozhou

867
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,840
are not yours to decide.

868
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,750
If the two of you
are not here to investigate a case,

869
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,800
then please take your leave.

870
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:11,599
As an Imperial Censor,

871
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:14,290
I naturally have the authority
to inquire into affairs in Jiaozhou.

872
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,239
Besides, Prefect Liu
has already returned.

873
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,800
This Prefectural Residence

874
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,840
is no longer for Chief Clerk Han
alone to decide.

875
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,559
Where is Liu Shijiang?

876
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,119
Have him come speak.

877
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,679
He is not here.

878
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,760
Where did he go?

879
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,079
Your Highness,

880
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,840
did you not just say so yourself?

881
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,039
This is the Prefectural Residence.

882
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,719
Prefect Liu has the final word.

883
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:37,840
Where he goes,

884
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,360
would he inform me?

885
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,440
Chief Clerk Han.

886
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,239
Chief Clerk Han.

887
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,519
And who might this be?

888
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:52,239
This is Prefect Liu's wife,

889
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,360
Madam Yulan.

890
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:59,199
This is the Commandery Prince An,

891
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,390
the Commandery Princess Consort An,

892
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,599
and Annan Great General.

893
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,920
I pays my respects
to the Commandery Prince An,

894
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,880
the Princess Consort,

895
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,520
and Annan Great General.

896
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,450
I did not know
honored guests were present.

897
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:09,599
Please forgive my discourtesy

898
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,400
for intruding upon you.

899
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,719
I came only because

900
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,079
I could not find Prefect Liu anywhere

901
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,840
and wished to inquire of you.

902
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,559
Has anyone seen him?

903
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,480
Liu Shijiang is missing?
