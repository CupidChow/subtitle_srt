30
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:23,120
Shopping?

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,840
Sure.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,000
Last time, when Leng Yue and I went,

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,400
we saw a new pastry shop
open in the East Market.

34
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,120
The line was so long,
so we did not get to buy anything.

35
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,390
This time we can finally try it.

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,039
What is it?

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,580
Why are you looking at me like that?

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,520
Actually, today's outing

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,690
has another purpose as well.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,120
What purpose?

41
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,680
I want to put an end to those rumors.

42
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,639
The ones about You Chen'an and me?

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,960
It is not that I take
those rumors to heart.

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,840
I understand.

45
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:58,960
There are so many people in this world

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,350
who misunderstand you,
openly and in secret.

47
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,639
You never take those to heart.

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,719
Only this one truly matters to you.

49
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,719
It is not the words you care about.

50
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,879
It is me.

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,879
I am sorry, Chu Chu.

52
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,319
It was my carelessness

53
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,719
that allowed those rumors

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
to spread this far.

55
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,560
To break rumors,

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,280
the best weapon

57
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,680
is the truth.

58
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,319
Once they see the truth,

59
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,919
rumors will have nowhere to hide.

60
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,960
I promise.

61
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,039
It will not happen again.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,199
Your Highness truly is clever.

63
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,560
To think of such a win-win solution.

64
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,300
And you do not blame me at all?

65
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,960
As long as you buy pastries with me

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,750
from that shop,
I will not blame you at all.

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,759
I will not fail you.

68
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,800
Do not push.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,639
Do not push!

70
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:50,540
- I want some too!
- Me too!

71
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,840
Maybe we should forget it?

72
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,330
There are so many people lining up.

73
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:55,400

77
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,720
You are here to buy pastries too?

78
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,199
- Commandery Prince An.
- Commandery Prince An.

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,199
So even Commandery Prince An
eats street snacks?

80
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,479
I thought Your Highness
only ate delicacies.

81
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,780
Even Commandery Prince An
buys pastries from our shop.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,220
Everyone, the Three Judicial Offices
are a modest post.

83
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,639
Let us make way
for Commandery Prince An.

00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,060
- All right.
- All right.

86
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,670
What would you like?

87
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,150
Please give me one of each
of whatever pastries you have left.

88
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,959
Coming right up.

89
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,319
How much is it?

90
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,519
It is an honor that Your Highness
favors our pastries.

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,079
Please take these as my gift.

92
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,279
This is a small business.

93
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,600
How could I let you take a loss?

94
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,480
My wife has been longing
to try your pastries for a long time.

95
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,480
I only hope your shop

96
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,959
will thrive for many years to come.

97
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,959
Commandery Prince An lowered himself
to stand crowded with us for so long.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,900
So it turns out he was buying them
for the Princess Consort.

99
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,990
Was it not said the Princess Consort
and  Second Prince of Nanzhao...

100
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,319
You believe whatever others say?

101
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,639
If you ask me,

102
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,199
His Highness
is handsome and considerate,

103
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,710
and though
the Princess Consort is a woman,

104
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,200

- They are truly a perfect match.

106
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:05,920
It is good.

107
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,390
How would they have time to mind others?

108
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,820
- Exactly.
- That is right.

109
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,260

110
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,540

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,439
Was Wan Qianshan's death not enough?

185
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,759
Now they all flock to places like this,

186
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,399
making grand speeches
with a few dancing girls.

187
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,160
How absurd.

188
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,079
What are you doing?

189
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,839
Are you all right?

190
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,600
Has no one ever told you before?

191
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,279
If I hear again anyone gossiping
behind others' backs,

192
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,879
I will break his legs.

193
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,830
You are crude and vulgar.

194
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,920
You are just feeling guilty.

195
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,279
Say that again.

196
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,399
Say that again.

197
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,399
You brute.

198
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,639
A vulgar lout.

199
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,399
Say that again.

200
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:10,360
What is going on?

201
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,320
Someone is dead.

202
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:15,990
Someone has died.

203
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:16,399
Quick.

204
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,430
Report it to the authorities.

205
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,679
Get Miss Feng down here.

206
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,240
Everyone, step back.

207
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,240
Do not disturb the scene.

208
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,080
Do not die here.

209
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,240
Do not drag us into this.

210
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,519
What happened?

211
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,080
My lord,

212
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,759
those men

213
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,900
were drinking,
and somehow beat someone to death.

214
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:33,480
Look at this.

215
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,770
You two, tell me what happened.

216
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,919
We did not lay a hand on him.

217
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,960
- Zhao Fengming struck first.
- That is right.

218
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,350
He attacked me as soon as he came up.

219
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,430
Someone died not long ago,
and now another one is dead.

220
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,240
Do not panic.

221
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:43,070
One at a time.

222
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,190
We really did not touch him.

223
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,480
Everyone,

224
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,399
do not move.

225
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:48,559
You there,

226
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,240
do not move.

227
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,180
Commandery Prince An.

228
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,919
Commandant Zhao Fengming,

229
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,360
after fighting with several men,

230
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,559
collapsed and died here.

231
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,860
(There are clear signs of a struggle.)

232
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,660
(No obvious fatal external injuries.)

233
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,399
This really is...

234
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:33,879
Are you all right?

235
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,159
His manner of death is exactly
the same as Wan Qianshan's.

236
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,159
Exactly the same?

237
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,559
On his body,

238
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,590
there are the same syphilis infection
marks as Wan Qianshan's,

239
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
but far from severe enough to be fatal.

240
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,080
If

241
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,159
we can take his body
back for examination,

242
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,919
then Wan Qianshan's cause of death
may finally become clear.

243
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
What should we do, sir?

244
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,690
Everyone, the Three Judicial Offices
have conducted a preliminary examination.

245
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,080
The cause of death remains unclear.

246
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,480
However, due to
evident external injuries,

247
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,440
death by beating cannot be ruled out.

248
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:25,960
Deputy Prefect Leng.

249
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
This case is connected to another

250
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,990
currently under review
by the Three Judicial Offices.

251
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,090
The Three Judicial Offices
will handle it together.

252
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,679
Yes.

253
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,799
Once the cause of death is established,

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,680
and responsibility
is clearly determined,

255
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,320
judgment and sentencing will follow.

256
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,360
Until then, all involved will be held

257
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,399
at the prison
of the Court of Judicial Review.

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,700
Take them away.

259
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,360
My Lord.

260
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,399
It was not us.

261
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,720
This has nothing to do with us.

262
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,490
Your Highness has grown thinner again.

263
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,300
I heard the Three Judicial Offices
have been swamped with cases lately.

264
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,290
I feared you and His Highness
might be overheated from the strain,

265
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:37,200
so I made some lily and mung bean soup

266
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,820
and brought it for you and His Highness.

267
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,759
Thank you, Lian Qiao.

268
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,679
His Highness is likely still occupied.

269
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,990
You should return to the manor first.

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,559
I will bring it to him later.

271
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,799
Then once you finish it,

272
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:49,990
please rest early as well.

273
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,440
I will speak plainly.

274
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,360
By rights, I should have
avoided suspicion at this time.

275
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,070
Yet I felt that when one stands upright,
there is nothing to fear.

276
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,250
If I truly kept my distance,

277
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,990
it would seem
as though something were amiss.

278
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,080
Chu He even scolded me in anger.

279
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,360
Chu Chu,

280
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
if you truly feel

281
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,799
these rumors trouble you,

282
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,639
then I will not come again.

283
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,840
You are poorly informed.

284
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
His Highness and I
have already settled this matter.

285
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,039
You have real talent as a coroner,

286
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,840
with courage and diligence to match.

287
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,879
So

288
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:50,000
do not let irrelevant people
or words sway you.

289
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:52,720
That is good.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,500
As long as it does not implicate you,

291
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,440
I am willing to keep learning.

292
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,559
You came at the right time.

293
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,799
Before Qinxiang's autopsy,

294
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,690
this was compiled by me
and the other coroners,

295
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,690
the procedure for examining
the syphilis infection.

296
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,559
Have a look and see
what can be improved.

297
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,440
It will be issued tomorrow,

298
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,200
to screen
the officials' health conditions.

299
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,440
His Majesty is pressing on this matter.

300
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,480
What is wrong?

301
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,000
Earlier, I found it strange.

302
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,660
Commandery Prince An
cares for you so deeply.

303
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:31,919
How could he bear

304
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,159
to let you risk doing autopsies?

305
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,799
Now I understand.

306
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,280
Commandery Prince An's breadth
of mind and courage

307
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,990
are beyond anything
I could reach in this life.

308
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,159
Chu Chu.

309
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,080
I offer soup in place of wine,
to toast you.

310
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,639
I believe

311
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,799
that one day,

312
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,200
you will become
the finest coroner in the world.

313
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,519
I will.

314
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:22,550
Your Highness.

315
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,679
Your Highness.

316
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,799
Why are you resting here again?

317
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,970
The window is not even closed.

318
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
What if you catch a chill

319
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,320
and fall ill?

320
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,639
No wonder I was bitten by mosquitoes.

321
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,039
Go.

322
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,470
Light some insect-repelling incense.

323
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,799
Yes.

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,559
I will also fetch some herbal ointment.

325
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,320
This...

326
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,480
Your Highness.

327
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,000
(Qi Yuan, Physician)
Greetings, Your Highness.

328
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:08,440
Jing Yi.

329
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,960
This is...

330
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,360
This is Physician Qi from Sansheng Hall.

331
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,840
Let him examine you.

332
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:15,720
See a doctor?

333
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,519
I do not feel unwell at all.

334
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,060
Your Highness, please.

335
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:32,600
Did the His Highness ask you to come?

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,919
Where is His Highness?

337
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,279
Your Highness,

338
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,840
allow me to check your tongue.

339
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,840
All right.

340
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,720
Vice Minister Jing, please rest assured.

341
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,919
The Princess Consort is well.

342
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,360
As long as she is fine.

343
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,240
What is really going on?

344
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,159
It is nothing.

345
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,240
Only that

346
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,840
you have been too tired lately.

347
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:04,839
I was afraid it might harm your health,

348
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,720
so I asked Physician Qi to examine you.

349
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:07,910
It is good that you are fine.

350
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,750
Where are you going?

351
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,990
His Highness was being thoughtful.

352
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,359
Of course I should thank him.

353
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
Why be so formal
between husband and wife?

354
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:20,240
His Highness is busy.

355
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,480
He said

356
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,160
he wishes to stay
at the Three Judicial Offices for a while,

357
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,359
to focus on official duties.

358
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,720
As for the manor, Wu Jiang, Lian Qiao,
and the others will handle matters.

359
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:29,480
Do not worry.

360
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:31,000
If anything urgent comes up, tell me,

361
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,200
or leave a note.

362
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,119
You just said His Highness
would not see me,

363
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,300
and plans to stay alone
at the Three Judicial Offices.

364
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,039
He also had Physician Qi examine me.

365
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,920
I have heard of Sansheng Hall.

366
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,880
They specialize
in treating external illnesses.

367
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,319
His Highness...

368
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,160
Has he contracted some kind of epidemic?

369
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,400
No.

370
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,750
If it were an infectious illness,

371
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,740
then both the Commandery Prince An's
Mansion and the Three Judicial Offices

372
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,920
would have to respond at once,

373
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,880
and inform the palace.

374
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:57,880
Right.

375
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,200
We would also need Wu Jiang

376
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,200
to immediately compile
a list of everywhere

377
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,470
His Highness has been recently,
and everyone he has met.

378
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,839
Forget it, I will do it myself.

379
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,150
Let me do it, Chu Chu.

380
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,440
Jing Yi, do not stop me.

381
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,680
Chu Chu.

382
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,160
Chu Chu, listen to me.

383
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,000
I already told His Highness

384
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,990
that even I would not be able
to hide this from you.

385
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,640
What exactly is wrong with His Highness?

386
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,660
His Highness
is afraid of implicating you

387
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,640
and harming your health.

388
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:22,359
Implicating me?

389
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,079
His Highness...

390
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,799
Say it clearly.

391
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,800
His Highness
has developed a syphilis infection.

392
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:37,880
A syphilis infection?

393
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,720
But do not worry.

394
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:39,780
He has already been examined.

395
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,950
There is no immediate danger.

396
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
Where is he? I must see him.

397
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,240
- His Highness ordered that no one is to see him.
- Let go of me.

398
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,160
If you were infected,

399
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,690
His Highness would be tormented by guilt
for the rest of his life.

400
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,370
Your Highness, please do not panic.

401
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,390
Although His Highness
has developed a syphilis infection,

402
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,640
his pulse indicates

403
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,400
that his condition is still stable.

404
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,039
He has never had direct contact
with any patient.

405
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,519
How could that be?

406
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,160
Could it be

407
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,200
that it was me?

408
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,119
Could it be that

409
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,359
I did not clean myself properly
after the autopsy,

410
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,840
and ended up harming His Highness?

411
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,440
A syphilis infection
can be fatal, Jing Yi.

412
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,920
What should we do?

413
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,480
Chu Chu, this is not your fault.

414
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,870
His Highness did not want you to know

415
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,279
because he was afraid you
would blame yourself.

416
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,240
- I...
- Do not worry.

417
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
Physician Qi
is the only doctor in Chang'an

418
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:33,119
who has ever treated
a syphilis infection.

419
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,300
We will think of a way together.

420
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,400
He can be cured.

421
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,279
Physician Qi.

422
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,920
I know better than anyone

423
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,480
how dangerous a syphilis infection is.

424
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,240
Since they asked you to come,

425
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,200
they must trust your skill completely.

426
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,599
Whatever medicines you need,

427
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,119
I can obtain them.

428
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,400
Name them.

429
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,559
I will do everything I can.

430
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,640
I only ask you

431
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,160
to cure His Highness.

432
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,359
Please.

433
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,279
Your Highness, you are too kind.

434
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:06,279
I will do all I can.

435
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,420
(Wanguo Courier Station)

436
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
How rare.

437
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,400
At this hour,

438
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,150
our chief envoy was just about
to report to the Three Judicial Offices.

439
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,920
Lord Gao is well informed.

440
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,759
How could you not know
the Three Judicial Offices

441
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,590
have taken in another body
infected with syphilis?

442
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,160
I was worried that if I went too early,

443
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:33,359
the autopsy would fall to me.

444
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:35,799
If I were infected
during the examination,

445
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:37,279
and brought it back to you,

446
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,200
would that not be trouble?

447
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,480
I am heading out now.

448
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,000
Lord Gao,

449
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:45,279
you should alert your eyes and ears.

450
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,240
Sir.

451
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,960
Let us talk inside.

452
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,640
What is it?

453
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,519
This morning Vice Minister Jing
rushed to Sansheng Hall

454
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,000
and took Physician Qi with him.

455
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,559
I asked around.

456
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,319
One of Physician Qi's most known cases

457
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,720
was curing a syphilis infection.

458
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,300
(Coptis. Banxia. Eucommia)

459
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,599
That young woman

460
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,000
could not be sure
which prescription worked.

461
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,400
So I

462
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,160
reviewed them all,

463
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,799
and added these herbs.

464
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,160
For now, we can only try them one by one.

465
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,519
Vice Minister Jing.

466
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,039
Why are you here?

467
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,500
This is an ancient prescription
from Nanzhao.

468
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,880
It follows a different approach
from Great Tang physicians,

469
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,890
but it is worth trying.

470
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,279
Out of nowhere,
why give me an ancient formula?

471
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,800
Vice Minister Jing,

472
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,440
at a time like this,

473
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,230
do you really need to beat around
the bush with me?

474
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,640
I would rather my guess be wrong.

475
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,150
Commandery Prince An once saved my life
and recognized my worth.

476
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,590
It would be best
if this prescription is never needed.

477
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,079
Thank you.

478
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,079
But for the time being,

479
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,990
it may not be appropriate for you
to come to the Three Judicial Offices.

480
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,960
I understand.

481
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,440
Still,

482
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:33,640
if you need anything,

483
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,279
you can always come to me.

484
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:46,720
Physician Qi, please take a look.

485
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,940
(Angelica Dahurica. White Peony.
Platycodon. Tufuling.)

486
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,960
It truly differs from the methods
of Great Tang physicians.

487
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:54,720
Several of these are herbs from Nanzhao.

488
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,279
May I copy it down

489
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,440
and study it for a few days?

490
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,640
That would be excellent.

491
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,119
Thank you, Physician Qi.

492
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,319
Much obliged.

493
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:20,240
What brings you to drink with me today?

494
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,960
Did Xiao Jinyu not assign you any work?

495
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,759
No.

496
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:28,319
What has you so troubled?

497
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,400
This wine is good.

498
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,880
Did Gao Luoqian

499
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:37,960
give you a hard time?

500
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,880
Or was it that Nanzhao fellow again?

501
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,599
It is nothing.

502
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,500
Something happened to Chu Chu.

503
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,519
No.

504
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,279
An,

505
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,680
I treat you like my own brother.

506
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,680
Fine.

507
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,000
You will not say it?

508
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,480
Then I will ask myself.

509
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,400
He.

510
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:57,480
It is not Chu Chu.

511
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,759
It is not Chu Chu.

512
00:23:59,250 --> 00:23:59,880
Sit down first.

513
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:00,920
Sit.

514
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:04,440
It is

515
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,359
Commandery Prince An.

516
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,240
It is Xiao Jinyu.

517
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,880
I have already found
a suitable prescription

518
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,690
and given it to him.

519
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,440
He is a grown man. Being ill is nothing.

520
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,990
Is it really worth
worrying yourself sick over him?

521
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,920
What illness is it?

522
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,880
Syphilis infection.

523
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:21,920
Syphilis infection?

524
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,940
(See the Wind and Listen to the Rain)

525
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,780
Your Highness, please stop.

526
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,600
His Highness knew you would come

527
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,680
and instructed me

528
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:32,960
not to let you go inside.

529
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,359
I will only look at him.
I will not go near.

530
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,200
Wu Jiang, stop her.

531
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,960
Chu Chu.

532
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,079
Do not come closer.

533
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,790
Such a serious matter, how long
were you going to hide it from me?

534
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,799
How do you feel right now?

535
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,119
Do you feel unwell?

536
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:53,880
I am fine.

537
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,279
Physician Qi said

538
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,559
your pulse is very stable now,

539
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,440
and it was discovered early.

540
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:03,990
As long as you take your
medicine properly and follow treatment,

541
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,839
you will recover soon.

542
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,480
Do not cry.

543
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,000
Do not cry.

544
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:18,799
Look.

545
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,519
I am standing here just fine, am I not?

546
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,690
If you had fallen ill
in the line of duty,

547
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,079
the Three Judicial Offices

548
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,800
would have to pay you
heavy compensation.

549
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,780
I would even be summoned
to the palace to be scolded.

550
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:31,279
This is all my fault.

551
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,119
How could it be your fault?

552
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,960
I was the one who was careless.

553
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,160
Knowing how serious
syphilis infection is,

554
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,519
I still failed to be cautious.

555
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,799
I am sorry, Your Highness.

556
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,799
Do not blame yourself.

557
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,240
I have been weak
and sickly since childhood.

558
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,890
Recently, I was frequently
at the Music Office

559
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,720
and came into contact
with Qinxiang's belongings

560
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:53,079
and Zhao Fengming's body.

561
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,990
I could have been infected anywhere
along the way.

562
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:57,759
All of you are fine,

563
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,519
I am the only one who fell ill.

564
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,839
That means the source must lie with me.

565
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,640
No.

566
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,690
It is because I failed to consider this.

567
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,079
None of us had ever dealt
with syphilis infection before.

568
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,039
Perfect protection was impossible.

569
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,990
And with long illness comes experience.

570
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,039
This disease may be dangerous to others,

571
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,759
but it might not affect me much.

572
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,780
Otherwise, how could I be
handling official matters here as usual?

573
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:23,799
That is true.

574
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,119
You are right.

575
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,599
Your Highness is blessed
and will surely be fine.

576
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:29,880
Besides,

577
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,839
Miss Hua Mei was cured as well.

578
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,920
So can you.

579
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,440
Do not be afraid.

580
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,480
I will find a way

581
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,400
to cure you.

582
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,519
Alright.

583
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:41,519
With you here,

584
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,039
I am not afraid.

585
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,599
Since you are here,

586
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,680
how did the examination of

587
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,980
Zhao Fengming's body go?

588
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,500
Zhao Fengming did not die of illness.

589
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,839
He was poisoned.

590
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,839
Do you remember
Qinxiang's autopsy sheet?

591
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,440
Qinxiang suffered
from syphilis infection while alive.

592
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,519
(Syphilis infection)
Aside from signs of drowning,

593
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,200
her mouth and internal organs

594
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,480
showed lesions
caused by prolonged illness.

595
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:21,759
Yet these signs
were absent in Zhao Fengming.

596
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,079
Zhao Fengming did not die
from syphilis infection.

597
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,759
A body does not lie.

598
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,440
It is true that Zhao Fengming

599
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,519
had red sores associated
with syphilis infection,

600
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:30,720
on his body.

601
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
But the internal signs

602
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,200
differed too greatly.

603
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,440
That makes no sense.

604
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,240
Without other autopsy records
to compare,

605
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,880
I cannot draw a conclusion yet.

606
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,559
Records of deaths
from syphilis infection

607
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,759
are extremely scarce.

608
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,359
Trying to find clues from past cases

609
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,880
may not be feasible.

610
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,519
Actually,

611
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,880
there is another way.

612
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:55,960
Wan Qianshan.

613
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,440
Yes.

614
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,079
Wan Qianshan and Zhao Fengming show
nearly identical external signs.

615
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,240
If we can examine Wan Qianshan,

616
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,960
and compare the two,

617
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,720
we may find the answer.

618
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,960
With doubts like this,

619
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:11,400
issuing an order to bring the body over

620
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,400
should not be difficult.

621
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,559
Zhao Fengming,
who once refused an autopsy,

622
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,799
has already died.

623
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,440
The Wan family has only just arrived.

624
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,680
They know little
of Great Tang criminal procedure.

625
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,079
I will go speak with them

626
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,880
and bring Wan Qianshan
to the Three Judicial Offices.

627
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,440
Good.

628
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,880
Go ahead without hesitation.

629
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,599
I will handle everything.

630
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,440
He, listen to me.

631
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,680
Xiao Jinyu truly did nothing

632
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,519
to wrong Chu Chu.

633
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,359
Please believe me.

634
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,200
At a time like this
you are still defending him?

635
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,720
Who is your real brother here?

636
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,400
No.

637
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,200
He.

638
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,260
You really...

639
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,210
He, what is the matter?

640
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:52,759
Girl.

641
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:54,200
Girl.

642
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,340
- Are you all right?
- He?

643
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,119
Why are you here?

644
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,950
You Chen'an said Xiao Jinyu
caught a syphilis infection.

645
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,039
Did it not spread to you?

646
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,960
Come with me at once.

647
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,990
We will see a physician.

648
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,519
This Three Judicial Offices
is no place to stay!

649
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,119
He.

650
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,359
I am fine.

651
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,580
Something this serious happened.

652
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,880
Why did you not tell me?

653
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,160
I always felt Xiao Jinyu was unreliable.

654
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,640
Only three years into marriage,
he was already fooling around,

655
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,870
and even caught such a disease.

656
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,440
Where is he?

657
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:16,839
Tell him to get out here!

658
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:17,960
He.

659
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:24,640
He.

660
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:25,980
His Highness...

661
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,400
He may have been infected
because I was careless for a moment.

662
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,680
So many people
already bear him ill will.

663
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,920
You were shouting just now,

664
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,580
If someone
with ulterior motives hears it,

665
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:35,470
would that not hand them

666
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,270
a pretext to attack
and slander His Highness?

667
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:38,240
Chu,

668
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,480
I was only worried about you.

669
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,799
I did not know the full truth before.

670
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,920
I was not angry with you.

671
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,559
It is just that right now,

672
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,400
His Highness and the Three Judicial Offices
are in a difficult position.

673
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,370
We cannot afford
our own people making mistakes.

674
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,400
He.

675
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,000
I need to go find someone at once.

676
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
You go back first.

677
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,960
Girl,

678
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,519
take care of yourself.

679
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,559
I will see you back.

680
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:10,500
(Capital Prefecture)

681
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,200
Lord Huang.

682
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,519
What do you mean by this?

683
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:29,839
Look at this.

684
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:47,759
So Xiao Jinyu has come to this at last.

685
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,400
Heaven has eyes.

686
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,079
Heaven truly has eyes.

687
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:51,880
Tonight,

688
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,400
we will prepare fine wine,

689
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,359
and drink our fill.

690
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:00,720
At last he
has brought this upon himself.

691
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,119
Our chance

692
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,400
has arrived.

693
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,279
Your Highness.

694
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:22,960
I have brought Wan Qianshan's body back.

695
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:24,880
How are you feeling now?

696
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,000
Let me check on you first.

697
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,880
Open the door.

698
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,039
Better not.

699
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,799
I have always relied on my looks.

700
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,319
If you see me like this,

701
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:35,799
I fear I may fall from favor.

702
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:38,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

703
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,319
I know

704
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,200
no matter how I look,

705
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,400
you would not mind.

706
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,559
But if you were to see me,

707
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,440
I would overthink it all night

708
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,119
and be unable to sleep.

709
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,119
All right.

710
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,710
Then I will do as you say.

711
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,980
I will also stay
at the Three Judicial Offices.

712
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,480
If anything happens,

713
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,200
have someone come call me.

714
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,039
All right.

715
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,330
Even if nothing happens,
you may still call me.

716
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:12,359
All right.

717
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,319
Your Highness.

718
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:26,440
I am here.

719
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,119
I will see you through this.

720
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,390
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for granting permission.

721
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,039
Please trust me, Your Majesty,

722
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,640
and trust Xiao Jinli as well.

723
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,500
On this journey to Jiaozhou,

724
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,920
as long as I draw breath,

725
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,119
Nanzhao will not set foot
in the Great Tang.

726
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,839
I will also temper Xiao Jinli with care,

727
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,890
so that he may mature
as swiftly as possible.

728
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:28,680
Your Majesty,

729
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,759
the situation now
leaves no room for delay.

730
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,400
Nanzhao is openly ambitious.

731
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,119
The people are ready for war.

732
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,279
The Great Tang must not retreat.

733
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,160
Your Majesty must not retreat.

734
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:40,799
I

735
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,400
must go.

736
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,559
Very well.

737
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,599
General Xie.

738
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,160
I have seen your resolve.

739
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,119
Please rise.

740
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,079
I now entrust Jiaozhou to you in full.

741
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:57,400
I

742
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,319
will not fail Your Majesty.

743
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,310
I will return in triumph

744
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,799
to repay Your Majesty's trust.

745
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,039
Xiao Jinyu.

746
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,920
I heeded your counsel

747
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,400
and made this decision.

748
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:28,650
I do not know if it was right or wrong.

749
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,400
Now I have wagered
the fate of the Great Tang

750
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,440
in full

751
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,000
upon the hands

752
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,719
of you young men.

753
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,639
Your Majesty.

754
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:45,239
Your Majesty.

755
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:49,280
Your Majesty.

756
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,119
Reporting to Your Majesty,
I have an urgent memorial to present.

757
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,920
Speak.

758
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:55,440
Your Majesty, after investigation
by the Capital Prefecture,

759
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,360

has been afflicted
with a syphilis infection

761
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,719
for several days.

762
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,360
What did you say?

763
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,719
Commandery Prince An
has a syphilis infection,

764
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,639
and it has lasted several days.
