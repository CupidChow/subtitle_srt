1
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:14,790
(Gao Luoqian's crimes are exposed,)

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,320
(and he is imprisoned.)

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,120
(Yet the political storm in Great Tang)

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,519
(only grows fiercer.)

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,920
(Sudden turmoil erupts in Jiaozhou)

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,950
(as Nanzhao launches
a surprise military attack,)

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,790
(yet the city garrison fails
to muster any defense.)

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,239
(What on earth)

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,039
(has happened with Jinli?)

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,240
(His Highness and I have been
ordered to rush to Jiaozhou)

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,990
(Given its location on the border
between Great Tang and Zhao,)

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,550
(it's likely that Nanzhao's
influence there runs far deeper than)

13
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,039
(it ever did in the capital.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

30
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,660
(This story is entirely fictional)

31
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:22,340
=Episode 23=

32
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,680
Please forgive my discourtesy

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,080
for intruding upon you.

34
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,759
I came only because

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,520
I could not find Prefect Liu anywhere

36
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,240
and wished to inquire of you.

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,879
Has anyone seen him?

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,240
Liu Shijiang is missing?

39
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,919
Since when?

40
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
He had a bit

41
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,520
to drink at home last night.

42
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,800
Then, he went out to look for...

43
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,479
I mean, then he left

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,599
and never came home.

45
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,700
I'm worried something
may have happened to him.

46
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:49,159
What's there to worry about?

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,600
With Nanzhao troops pushing in,

48
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,460
he was probably afraid
of being held responsible,

49
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,599
so he slipped off quietly
to hide somewhere.

50
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,639
That can't be.

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,159
He may not be the bravest man,

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,240
but he did rush back to
Jiaozhou despite everything.

53
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,639
Chief Clark Han,

54
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,479
he is, after all,
the Prefect of Jiaozhou.

55
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,840
Could it be that Nanzhao got to him?

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,680
Then...

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,599
Careful, Madam Liu!

58
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,400
Madam Liu, please, don't fret.

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,599
This is Jiaozhou, and he's the Prefect.

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,990
What could possibly happen to him?

61
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,150
Alright, I'll send men
to look for him at once.

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,830
Take Madam Liu back to get some rest.

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,360
Yes.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,599
We'll help search as well.

65
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,759
Alright.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,360
I've long heard that
the Three Judicial Offices miss nothing

67
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,990
and have solved
countless difficult cases.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,100
With Commandery Prince An
and Princess Consort here,

69
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,520
I feel at ease.

70
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,960
Jinyu,

71
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,520
why are we searching on our own
instead of following Han Ji?

72
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,400
Do you know where Liu Shijiang is?

73
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,159
How could I possibly know?

74
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,759
I just don't fully trust Han Ji

75
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,660
and let him lead us around by the nose.

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,360
Your Highness,

77
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:20,839
look at these footprints.

78
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
They might be Liu Shijiang's.

79
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,720
How can you tell?

80
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,300
Madam Yulan said he'd
been drinking before he left.

81
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,879
So compared to a sober person,

82
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,480
his footprints would be more erratic

83
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,360
and his weight shifted unevenly.

84
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,600
Just like these here.

85
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:35,920
Come on.

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,680
Lord Liu!

87
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,720
Lord Liu!

88
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,560
Lord Liu!

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,790
Your Highness,
something's going on over there.

90
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,439
Is it Liu Shijiang?

91
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:02,759
It's him.

92
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,439
It's a message formed by insects.

93
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,920
"Jiaozhou is a cursed land.

94
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,720
All living things will be destroyed.

95
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,120
If a new king does not rise,

96
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,399
no life can survive."

97
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,839
What does that mean?

98
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,600
What is it implying?

99
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,040
Liu Shijiang was fine just yesterday.

100
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,160
How did this happen?

101
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,560
When was the last time you saw him?

102
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:37,759
It was yesterday around noon.

103
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,560
I heard he'd returned to Jiaozhou.

104
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,759
So, I rushed back
to the Prefect's office

105
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,390
to discuss the Nanzhao
conflict with him.

106
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,399
I found him arguing with Han Ji.

107
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,100
He kept making excuses
and shifting blame,

108
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,420
and in the end, he tried to
pin the responsibility on me.

109
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,920
He had a confrontation with Han Ji?

110
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,319
Yes.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,390
Are you suspecting his death
has something to do with Han Ji?

112
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,480
It's just too strange.

113
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,639
What?

114
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,920
I was just thinking,

115
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,160
Liu Shijiang's death is too strange.

116
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,600
If he was murdered,

117
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,839
there's no sign of a struggle
around the body.

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
But if he simply fell onto

119
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,680
the bamboo shoots himself,

120
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,000
then the way he landed

121
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,279
looks a little

122
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,240
too placid.

123
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:20,920
You mean

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,519
if someone were walking
and accidentally fell,

125
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,319
they'd instinctively try to break
their fall with their arms or legs,

126
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,839
right?

127
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:27,800
That's right.

128
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:29,959
But when we saw Liu Shijiang's body,

129
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,959
it was as if he dropped
straight down from the sky,

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,900
like he'd been struck by
some divine punishment.

131
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,490
You're thinking about that message
formed by the insects, aren't you?

132
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:44,079
"Jiaozhou is a cursed land.

133
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,120
All living things will be destroyed.

134
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,079
If a new king does not rise,

135
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,600
no life can survive."

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,700
It certainly doesn't
sound like a blessing.

137
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,759
It implies this land

138
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,879
is cursed,

139
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,959
that all living things here

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,240
will be wiped out,

141
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,879
and unless a new king is crowned,

142
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,279
all hope is lost.

143
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,350
Those insects certainly know
how to arrange themselves,

144
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
crawling out

145
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
such treasonous words.

146
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:09,639
So-called prophecies and divine oracles

147
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,639
have popped up throughout history.

148
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,680
They're nothing but tricks
dressed up in mystery.

149
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,360
And those insects

150
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,600
are strange, too.

151
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,399
I've never seen that kind

152
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,879
in all my time in the Southwest.

153
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,040
They have this bluish-green sheen,

154
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,759
likely poisonous.

155
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,439
But why would there be so
many of them in a bamboo grove?

156
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,199
If only we could
examine the body again.

157
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,760
Han Ji has had the prefecture's
coroner take it for examination.

158
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,319
We'll have to wait.

159
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,079
His eagerness clearly means he doesn't
want us near the corpse first.

160
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,480
I think we need to return
to the bamboo grove.

161
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,319
I feel we've missed something.

162
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,790
Let's start by taking another look
at His Majesty's handwritten decree.

163
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,480
(No border troops shall engage external
forces without an imperial decree.)

164
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,600
"While the Outer Secretary
was in Chang'an,

165
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,590
No troops may be deployed beyond the border
without imperial authorization."

166
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,550
I never heard His Majesty mention

167
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,199
such an order while
I was in the capital.

168
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,240
Neither have I.

169
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,959
Prefect Liu said the same thing.

170
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,340
(Imperial silk.)

171
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,480
(No border troops shall engage external
forces without an imperial decree.)

172
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,319
I've looked it over carefully.

173
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,040
(Dragon seal. Imperial ink.)

174
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,820
(In the Emperor's own hand)
The handwriting is His Majesty's,

175
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,959
and the seal is authentic.

176
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,660
Moreover, Han Ji served
in the Ministry of Justice

177
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,879
and has verified countless
forged documents.

178
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,800
If this decree were fake,

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,120
wouldn't he have spotted it?

180
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,690
Everything checks out.

181
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:26,879
Nothing strikes you as odd?

182
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,319
The odd thing...

183
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,040
is that

184
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,919
it's all too perfect.

185
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
Even two leaves

186
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
from the same tree are
never entirely identical.

187
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,559
Even the same person

188
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,039
has completely different fingerprints

189
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,639
on each of their ten fingers.

190
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,159
You two are certainly in sync,

191
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,799
but what exactly are you getting at?

192
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,519
What she means is, even if a person writes
the same character

193
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,200
a thousand times in their life,
no two will be perfectly identical.

194
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,519
Yet on this document,

195
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,700
these two characters look
exactly the same.

196
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,919
Look at the two "an"
and the two "external."

197
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,060
(An, External)

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,180
Not the slightest difference.

199
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,600
Which someone copied

200
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,919
His Majesty's handwriting

201
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,639
and forged this.

202
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,320
Who could possibly forge it
so flawlessly?

203
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,679
Do you remember the Wu Liang case?

204
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,639
The imperial guard
who stole from the palace

205
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,840
and assaulted the maids?

206
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,240
At the time,

207
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:30,840
several of His Majesty's
calligraphy scrolls were stolen.

208
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,759
They must have been used for this.

209
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,020
Such meticulous planning,

210
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,890
laying the groundwork
for this far in advance.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,399
We must notify Jing Yi immediately.

212
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,840
Have him work with the Palace
Domestic Service and Consort Hui

213
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,950
to root out any conspirators
still inside the palace.

214
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,320
Then he needs to confirm
the decree's authenticity

215
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,000
directly with His Majesty

216
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,240
to be absolutely certain.

217
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:50,840
Alright.

218
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,710
Who received this decree
in the first place?

219
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,279
Han Ji.

220
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,840
Han Ji...

221
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,000
You're finally back.

222
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,399
I was worried sick about you.

223
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,759
What is that smell? You reek.

224
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,559
Xiao Jinli

225
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,399
is vicious.

226
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,150
He actually teamed up
with mountain bandits

227
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,759
and trapped my troops in Jiaozhou.

228
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,480
I need to ask Father for reinforcements
and get them all out.

229
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm just glad you made it back.

230
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,759
While you were gone,

231
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,879
You Chen'an killed even
more Tang people in Chang'an,

232
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,679
and he's just walked away scot-free.

233
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,759
Now the Great Tang emperor is claiming

234
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:39,559
my brother should
take the blame for him.

235
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,639
I've been risking my life
on the front lines,

236
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,740
while my dear brother-in-law sits safely
in Tang territory, scheming for Nanzhao.

237
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:45,480
And in the end,

238
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,600
he thinks he can just reap the rewards?

239
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,360
Dream on.

240
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,200
I need to figure out a way

241
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,559
to seize Jiaozhou quickly

242
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,000
and win back some favor
in Father's eyes.

243
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,879
I can help you.

244
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,840
How can you possibly help?

245
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,200
While you were away,

246
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,679
I caught a Tang man

247
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,399
who's been working for You Chen'an.

248
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,240
He seems to know a lot of his secrets.

249
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,000
Who is he?

250
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,399
Let me see him.

251
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,960
Go wash up and change first.

252
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
You smell awful.

253
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,960
Fine, my dear.

254
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:22,720
Your name is Zhou Han?

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,240
It wasn't, not originally.

256
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,840
There was a man in
Nanzhao called Changshou.

257
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,080
He said I looked almost exactly

258
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,759
like a former Tang Shence Army officer

259
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,639
named Zhou Han.

260
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,759
So he recruited me,

261
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,159
had me change my name and identity.

262
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,759
What were you doing

263
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,919
in Chang'an?

264
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:49,720
I was working for

265
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,279
Peacock in Chang'an.

266
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,080
I met Lord Gao a few times
while I was there.

267
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,120
Later, I was arrested by
the Three Judicial Offices.

268
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,480
They were afraid Lord Gao
would send someone to rescue me,

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,840
so they kept moving
me from place to place.

270
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,240
When I finally saw an opening,

271
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,120
I escaped.

272
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,399
But then

273
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,840
I was intercepted by
Second Prince's men.

274
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,960
That's when I found out

275
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,200
Second Prince

276
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,480
was Peacock.

277
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,080
You Chen'an is Peacock?

278
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,279
He is indeed!

279
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:22,840
I risked my life for him in Chang'an.

280
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,840
Once he decided I was no longer useful,

281
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,679
he made me sleep in the stables

282
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:31,080
and even tried to have
me killed to cover his tracks.

283
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,600
I spent every last bit of money

284
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,039
bribing the guards

285
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,159
just to make it back alive.

286
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Why did they have you impersonate

287
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,880
that military officer?

288
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,360
Impersonate an officer? Please.

289
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,960
I was just playing

290
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,360
the role of a demon,

291
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,799
selling "life extensions."

292
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,399
Those so-called longevity potions

293
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,120
were actually poisons
meant to control Tang officials.

294
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,759
Knowing this much,

295
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,159
you really were working for Nanzhao.

296
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,120
I would never dare lie
to you, Your Highness.

297
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,279
You've been through a lot.

298
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,240
Get some proper rest for now.

299
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,200
We'll talk more

300
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,480
later.

301
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,639
Thank you, Your Highness.

302
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,780
This is the spot.

303
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,879
The insects and the prophecy are gone.

304
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,200
So it really was spice.

305
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:35,159
Spice?

306
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,900
Someone must have sprinkled a substance
that attracts poisonous insects

307
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,279
along the lines of the characters.

308
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,230
The insects gathered following
the scent, forming the words.

309
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
Once the fragrance dissipated,

310
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:45,440
they scattered.

311
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,960
Last night, I assumed

312
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,879
they were drawn by the smell of blood.

313
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,039
But look,

314
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,560
there are no signs of insect

315
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,879
clusters on these bloodstains at all.

316
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,919
If a new king does not rise,

317
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,639
no life can survive."

318
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,159
Looks like the King of Nanzhao
is growing impatient.

319
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,100
There are spies inside Jiaozhou's walls.

320
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,919
With no signs of a struggle
anywhere nearby,

321
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,840
the person who did this was likely
someone Liu Shijiang knew well.

322
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,920
How did those bamboo shoots

323
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,519
grow so much overnight?

324
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,890
At this time of year,

325
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,639
bamboo in the southwest shoots up fast.

326
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,660
It's much more vigorous than the kind
grown in the gardens back in Chang'an.

327
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,799
Overnight...

328
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,790
Your Highness.

329
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,639
Your Highness, the coroner has finished
examining the body.

330
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,799
Come, let's go take a look.

331
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:40,639
Wait.

332
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,200
I need to get one thing.

333
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,879
My husband!

334
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,480
My husband!

335
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,000
Madam Liu.

336
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,480
Let me through!

337
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,890
Madam Liu, please return first.

338
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:51,430
Madam Liu....

339
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,919
Chief Clark Han!

340
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,000
I want to see Chief Clark Han!

341
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:57,919
Chief Clark Han,

342
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,000
come out!

343
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,500
Lord Han has asked you to
return to your residence first.

344
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,740
As the matter is still
under investigation,

345
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,620
you must refrain from
holding the funeral

346
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:04,570
or disclosing any news.

347
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,080
Chief Clark Han!

348
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:08,559
Alright.

349
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,080
Skip the trivial details.

350
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,320
Just give us the essentials.

351
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:12,240
Yes, sir.

352
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:13,639
The examination shows

353
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,679
the deceased was
pierced by bamboo shoots.

354
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,170
Multiple internal organs were damaged,

355
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,590
and he died from massive blood loss.

356
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,110
There was also a strong smell
of alcohol in his mouth and nose,

357
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,480
suggesting he drank
heavily before his death.

358
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,600
See?

359
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,039
That explains it.

360
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,840
Liu Shijiang had been away
from home for a long time,

361
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,360
so

362
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,759
Madam Yulan hosted a family banquet

363
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,600
to welcome him back.

364
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,799
He drank too much,

365
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,799
wandered off to a bamboo grove
to sober up,

366
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,600
lost his way,

367
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,639
collapsed from exhaustion,

368
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,720
and fell onto the bamboo shoots.

369
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,399
Chief Clark Han,

370
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,879
that's a remarkably
clear reconstruction.

371
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,000
I saw he was reeking of alcohol,

372
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,919
and it wasn't just me,

373
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,240
everyone at the residence saw it, right?

374
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,360
Go on.

375
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Based on the body,

376
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,480
there are no signs of a struggle,

377
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,000
and no evidence of poisoning either.

378
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,799
So it's very likely an accident.

379
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,279
And also...

380
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,399
Also what?

381
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,879
Also,

382
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,399
there was a line of prophecy
found near the body.

383
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,480
Watch your mouth.

384
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,759
Within official gates,

385
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,620
we have no place for talk
of supernatural nonsense.

386
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,399
Yes, yes.

387
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,399
I misspoke.

388
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,600
There might be another possibility.

389
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,840
Bring it in.

390
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,679
This is a bamboo shoot I
just dug up from the scene.

391
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,080
While it didn't

392
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,559
directly impale Prefect Liu,

393
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,240
it was lying in the pool of his blood,

394
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,960
leaving a very distinct bloodstain.

395
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:45,120
That means,

396
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,720
(A distinct bloodstain)
using this bloodstain as the dividing point

397
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,120
the part below it

398
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,000
(Newly grown section)
grew after the incident.

399
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,759
The part above, untainted by blood,

400
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,600
was already underground
before that night.

401
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,919
So?

402
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,960
What of it?

403
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,879
While each bamboo shoot
grows at a slightly different rate,

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,440
those in the same patch of soil

405
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:03,759
won't differ too much.

406
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,359
By comparing these two sections,

407
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,799
we can roughly estimate

408
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,160
that the bamboo shoots

409
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,359
grew overnight

410
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,599
about this much.

411
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,640
You're saying

412
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,559
the bamboo shoot grew little by little

413
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,079
into the deceased's body,

414
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,990
until it eventually pierced
all the way through?

415
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,599
Exactly.

416
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,100
During the season when
bamboo grows wildly,

417
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,440
it's not uncommon

418
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,839
to find animals in the mountains

419
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,240
whose bodies are pierced by
bamboo that shot up overnight.

420
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,039
Poetry often praises

421
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:32,319
bamboo as a gentleman,

422
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,599
modest and principled.

423
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,319
But in the wilderness,

424
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,880
bamboo is a symbol
of raw, relentless force.

425
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,559
Your Highness,

426
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,480
that sounds a bit far-fetched.

427
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,319
This is all just your
speculation, isn't it?

428
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,799
Verifying it is

429
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,319
actually very simple.

430
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,759
Re-examine the wounds,

431
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,780
and especially the condition
of the wound edges

432
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,590
and the organs
at the points of penetration.

433
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,200
A simple comparison

434
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,319
will prove

435
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,279
whether these wounds were caused
by a single, instantaneous impalement,

436
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,519
or if they were slowly punctured

437
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,000
as the bamboo grew.

438
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,640
That would likely require a
full autopsy of Prefect Liu.

439
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
But his body is barely cold,

440
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,279
his wife is with child,

441
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,550
and I lack the authority to
order such an examination.

442
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,470
It seems highly inappropriate.

443
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,559
That's right. And besides,

444
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,000
even if he wasn't pierced all at once,

445
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,680
he still died drunk, didn't he?

446
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,839
Commandery Princess Consort An,

447
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,039
Commandery Prince An,

448
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,260
you're accustomed to the procedures
of the Three Judicial Offices.

449
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,390
You may not understand the
simpler ways of the borderlands.

450
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
This is as clear a case as they come.

451
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,240
Why go to such elaborate lengths?

452
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,240
If he died from being slowly
pierced by a growing shoot,

453
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,359
it proves he was either already dead
or on the verge of death

454
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,079
when he fell onto it,

455
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,039
unable to struggle.

456
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,880
A simple drunken fall
wouldn't look like that.

457
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,920
Chief Clark Han, you seem so certain

458
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,559
that Prefect Liu died
from a drunken accident.

459
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,319
Chief Clark Han,

460
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,599
where did you go
that night after you saw

461
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,990
the heavily intoxicated Prefect Liu?

462
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,400
I went back to my room to rest.
Is that not allowed?

463
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,119
However, according to servants,

464
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,200
Prefect Liu went looking
for you after drinking,

465
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,960
and it seems you had an argument.

466
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:09,799
What exactly was the argument about?

467
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,920
What are you implying?

468
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:12,599
You all know what happened!

469
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,670
That day, I criticized him
for neglecting his duties

470
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,820
without sparing him any dignity.

471
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,870
He flew into a shame-fueled rage.

472
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,079
As more people gathered,

473
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,119
he simply ran off.

474
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,240
You know this!

475
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,000
After separating from you,

476
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,400
Prefect Liu was never seen again.

477
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:24,279
Which means

478
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,559
you were very likely the last person
to see him alive.

479
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:28,839
And you'd just had
a heated confrontation.

480
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,359
What are you implying?

481
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,440
That I killed Prefect Liu?

482
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,839
That's absurd.

483
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I see what this is now.

484
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,780
You're afraid the higher
authorities will investigate,

485
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:40,599
so you're

486
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,039
pushing me out

487
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,759
as a scapegoat to save yourselves!

488
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:54,680
Commandery Prince An, Prefect Liu

489
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,319
met a sudden, violent death
under suspicious circumstances.

490
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,079
As a Censor,

491
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,790
you have the authority to temporarily
assume the duties of Jiaozhou Prefect

492
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,519
to quell the Nanzhao unrest,

493
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,599
investigate the truth
behind the Prefect's murder,

494
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,240
and neutralize the crisis
sparked by the prophecy.

495
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,490
- Please assume the Prefect's authority
- Please assume the Prefect's authority

496
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,220
- and take command, Your Highness.
- and take command, Your Highness.

497
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,519
Nanzhao has long been eyeing Jiaozhou.

498
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,599
For the prefect to die under
such suspicious circumstances

499
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,920
at this critical moment,

500
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,880
and with a prophecy clearly
pointing toward Nanzhao,

501
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,079
this is no small case.

502
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:27,400
As a Censor

503
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,720
dispatched by imperial decree,

504
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,279
I must shoulder this responsibility
to resolve Jiaozhou's predicament.

505
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,470
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

506
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,950
Chief Clark Han, you are hereby required

507
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,900
to recuse yourself from the
prefect's case for the time being.

508
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,150
You are not to leave Prefect's Residence
without authorization,

509
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,690
and you must cooperate
fully with the investigation.

510
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,240
Madam Liu prepared wine and
dishes to welcome Master Liu home.

511
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,039
Master Liu had a few drinks,

512
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,480
then left in a tipsy state

513
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,920
to go find Chief Clark Han.

514
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,720
What was the Prefect's condition

515
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,799
before he left?

516
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,359
He seemed fine.

517
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,640
I didn't see Master when he left,

518
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,559
but I happened to be making

519
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,920
my rounds lighting the lamps
when he was arguing

520
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:06,880
with Chief Clark Han.

521
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,160
What did they argue about?

522
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:10,839
You scum!

523
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,710
Don't think that just because
I've been away,

524
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,670
this Prefect's Residence
is yours to do as you please.

525
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,079
Don't...

526
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,000
Don't lay a hand on me.

527
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,300
This is all a misunderstanding.

528
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,190
You've abused your
power and lost all decency.

529
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,119
The audacity!

530
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,720
They didn't say much more after that.

531
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,640
As more people
gathered outside the room,

532
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,079
Master probably didn't
want to make a scene,

533
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,100
so he stopped arguing.

534
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:29,680
Scram!

535
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,400
Scram!

536
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,640
Scram!

537
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,839
Are you going to keep lying?

538
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,880
Prefect Liu cherished his wife dearly.

539
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm sure he treated you well too.

540
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,559
Get up and speak.

541
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:52,759
Don't be afraid.

542
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,279
We only wish to see
justice done for Prefect Liu.

543
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,640
You just need to tell us what you know.

544
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,279
If Madam Liu finds out
I spoke out of turn,

545
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,440
she'll surely punish me.

546
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,960
I give you my word.

547
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,839
Once we leave this room,

548
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,799
no one else will know

549
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,319
what you've told us.

550
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,799
At first,

551
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:13,680
Master Liu was really
happy to see Madam Liu.

552
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,759
Later,

553
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,680
I don't know what they said in the room,

554
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,599
but I heard Master Liu
loudly questioning her,

555
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,060
asking why she hadn't told him sooner.

556
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,440
He even cursed, "Scum."

557
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,640
Then he stormed out in a fury

558
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,550
and went straight
to Chief Clark Han's quarters.

559
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,079
Madam Liu was worried,

560
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,400
so she sent me to follow him.

561
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,160
Prefect Liu treated his wife
extremely well.

562
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,079
With her pregnant,
for him to lose his temper like that,

563
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,090
it must have been something
completely unforeseen,

564
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,150
something that made him forget
even the child for a moment.

565
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,480
Han Ji isn't the type to bow his head

566
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,559
just because of rank.

567
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
For him to act so evasive,

568
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,799
it couldn't have been a
dispute over official matters.

569
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,119
And Liu Shijiang cutting
himself off once people gathered,

570
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:57,690
it means he didn't want whatever
was being hidden to come out in public.

571
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:03,680
Whatever could anger Liu Shijiang
to that point yet force him to swallow it,

572
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,440
it also made Madam Yulan
afraid to speak out,

573
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,839
and left Han Ji walking on eggshells.

574
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,880
It must have been something
deeply shameful.

575
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,559
I heard

576
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,119
Madam Yulan's pregnancy

577
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,680
was only confirmed
after the Prefect had left.

578
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,079
That would give Liu Shijiang
and Han Ji's conflict

579
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,680
a clear cause.

580
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,440
Looks like Madam Yulan and Han Ji share

581
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:30,759
a special relationship.

582
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,640
But this involves the reputations of
Madam Yulan and the deceased.

583
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,310
We'll need solid, unmistakable
evidence before we go any further.

584
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,759
A full autopsy?

585
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:45,200
But to find a coroner
with proper experience,

586
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,790
we'd probably have to request
one from a neighboring prefecture.

587
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,630
Just sending the official
paperwork back and forth

588
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,200
would take at least three to five days.

589
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,759
With this heat and humidity,

590
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,519
the body might decompose before then.

591
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:58,279
Commandery Princess Consort An
has autopsy experience.

592
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,780
She is an imperially appointed coroner.

593
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:00,690
As for the paperwork,

594
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,880
the Three Judicial Offices
can submit it afterward.

595
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,880
Even so,

596
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,119
we really ought to seek
Madam Yulan's consent first.

597
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,599
No, that won't do.

598
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:11,640
Madam Liu is in a delicate
condition and already grief-stricken.

599
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,580
To bring this up now
would be most inappropriate.

600
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:14,720
But this case is

601
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,759
of great importance.

602
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,599
It even implicates Chief Clark Han.

603
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,039
We can't afford to delay.

604
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,119
Jiaozhou is facing an urgent crisis.

605
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,000
If anyone is
to be held accountable afterward,

606
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,580
I will bear the responsibility alone.

607
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,799
Prefect Liu's abdominal cavity
has multiple penetrating wounds.

608
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,200
Judging from the bleeding,

609
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,020
several internal organs
were likely ruptured.

610
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,000
We can't wait any longer.

611
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,599
After the autopsy,

612
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,519
I will do my utmost to restore the body.

613
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,640
Please trust me.

614
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,950
- We will follow your arrangements,
- We will follow your arrangements,

615
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,519
- Your Highnesses.
- Your Highnesses.

616
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:49,200
If you hadn't caught that detail with
the bamboo shoots, Your Highness,

617
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,599
I would've made a terrible mistake.

618
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:52,880
It's not your fault.

619
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,920
You weren't at the scene,

620
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,359
you didn't see the body as it was found,

621
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,119
and you hadn't heard

622
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,839
His Highness's analysis of the case.

623
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,559
Judging solely from a body
that had already been cleaned,

624
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,660
being able to uncovered this much means
you were doing your job responsibly.

625
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,640
This is precisely why

626
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,690
the Three Judicial Offices
have always strictly required

627
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,780
that homicide cases submitted
from prefectures and counties

628
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,599
must be examined by
two different coroners,

629
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,200
one for the initial inspection and
another for the re-examination.

630
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,490
The results of both inspections
must align without contradiction

631
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,790
before they are considered valid.

632
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,799
How could there be foreign matter here?

633
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,900
I strictly followed the
examination protocols.

634
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:37,400
I had the room thoroughly
cleaned before the autopsy

635
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,680
to avoid any interference.

636
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,480
But this...

637
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,200
It likely isn't your oversight.

638
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,000
These are the egg casings

639
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,900
from those poisonous insects
in the bamboo grove yesterday.

640
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,119
How did they end up here?

641
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
Could it be those insects truly fell
from the sky?

642
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:01,519
Is this

643
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,079
really divine punishment?

644
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,960
We discovered numerous
insect egg casings,

645
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,960
and even some unhatched insects,

646
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,200
inside Liu Shijiang's body.

647
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,359
In his body?

648
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,200
Therefore,

649
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,359
the insects we saw at the scene

650
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,279
didn't gather from the bamboo grove,

651
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,839
they crawled out of him.

652
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,519
How is that possible?

653
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,799
It is hard to believe,

654
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,250
but the corpse tells the story.

655
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,480
Those insects were growing
inside him all along,

656
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,599
until the night he died,

657
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,960
when they hatched and emerged.

658
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,319
So, Prefect Liu's organs

659
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,640
were first pierced and
killed by the insects,

660
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,690
and then his body was
placed on the bamboo shoot.

661
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,240
The insects crawled out through
the wounds caused by the shoot,

662
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:46,640
forming the prophetic message.

663
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,079
In other words,

664
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:49,920
his body

665
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,119
was like a...

666
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,240
A vessel for breeding poisonous insects.

667
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:55,039
Correct.

668
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:57,200
If we follow this logic,

669
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,160
the insects must have been

670
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,220
implanted in him before
he left for the capital.

671
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,310
The killer had been
planning this for a long time.

672
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:06,559
The other night was
simply the moment he chose

673
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,790
as the most opportune
time for Liu Shijiang to die.

674
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,799
That's horrifying.

675
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,559
What kind of person
would do something like this?

676
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,599
Jinli,

677
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,319
do you remember that forged decree?

678
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,079
Liu Shijiang's death

679
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,440
and the insect-formed prophecy

680
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,640
share a similar underlying effect.

681
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,519
What effect?

682
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,039
They throw Jiaozhou into chaos.

683
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,799
Militarily, politically, and in
terms of public sentiment,

684
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,260
everything tilts in Nanzhao's favor.

685
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,160
The person capable
of orchestrating all this

686
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,680
must be inside Prefect's Residence,

687
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,279
and very close to Liu Shijiang.

688
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Your Highness,

689
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,079
to get to the bottom of this,

690
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
there's a person I need to see.

691
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,440
Madam, Commandery
Princess Consort An is here.

692
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,039
What does she want now?

693
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,559
Madam has nothing to say to her.

694
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,750
She's likely come because there are
findings from examining Master.

695
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,119
No matter what, this is
something we must hear.

696
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,119
Please show her in.

697
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,240
Yes, Madam.

698
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,960
Your Highness, please come in.

699
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,720
Greetings, Your Highness.

700
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,680
Please spare the formality.

701
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:28,839
I came today to express my gratitude
for your thoughtful hospitality

702
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,519
while we've been staying

703
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,559
at Prefect's Residence.

704
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,440
There's no need for thanks.

705
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,400
I only hope the case can be solved soon,

706
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,079
so Master's spirit may
finally rest in peace.

707
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,079
I truly understand what
you're going through.

708
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,480
Being forced to authorize
an autopsy on Prefect Liu,

709
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,119
I'm deeply sorry.

710
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:49,759
After much thought,

711
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,640
His Highness and I
visited a jade workshop

712
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,799
and chose a pair
of mother-and-child bracelets

713
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,920
for you and your unborn child.

714
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,319
It's a wish for your health
and a smooth, fortunate life together.

715
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm not sure about the sizing.

716
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,519
Let me help you try it on.

717
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,120
Thank you for your
kindness, Your Highness,

718
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,599
but I am in no state

719
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,680
for visitors today.

720
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:29,559
You should go.

721
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:30,960
Forgive me, Madam.

722
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,710
I'm not accustomed to
wearing jewelry myself.

723
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,640
How clumsy of me.

724
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,640
I'll find something better another day

725
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
and make it up to you.

726
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,400
Show our guest out.

727
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,559
Yes, Madam.

728
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,160
Please, Your Highness.

729
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:10,680
Who is it?

730
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,960
Chief Clark Han,

731
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,279
are you in bed?

732
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:14,640
Yes.

733
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,990
Commandery Prince An, after all these years
in the Three Judicial Offices,

734
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,359
you've grown increasingly overbearing.

735
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,160
There's been progress
in Prefect Liu's case.

736
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,359
Aren't you interested?

737
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,119
That is good news.

738
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,759
Then go arrest the culprit.

739
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,079
Why bother telling me?

740
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,759
Or is it that

741
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,599
you still can't find the real killer,

742
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,960
and now you're suspecting me again?

743
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,599
Please don't be so agitated.

744
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:50,119
Prefect Liu's body

745
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,119
has told us who the killer is.

746
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,160
That night,

747
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:56,480
the killer took advantage
of his drunken state

748
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,160
and lured him to the bamboo grove.

749
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,640
While he was unconscious,

750
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,440
the killer turned him face down,

751
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,599
spread his limbs,

752
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,440
and tied him to the surrounding
bamboo stalks.

753
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,720
By then, Prefect Liu's organs

754
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,920
had already been pierced
by the insects inside him.

755
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,200
He was essentially gone.

756
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,200
That's why there were
no signs of struggle,

757
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,000
allowing the killer

758
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,000
to position his limbs
wide apart as desired,

759
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,670
making it appear he died from
being impaled by the bamboo shoot.

760
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,079
Based on the growth rate,

761
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:26,079
a single night was enough for the
shoot to pierce through his body.

762
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,079
And under the killer's arrangement,

763
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,319
the wounds from the shoot

764
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,960
conveniently covered
those from the insects,

765
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,359
which is why
the prefecture's initial autopsy

766
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,559
detected nothing unusual.

767
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,800
The killer had ample time overnight

768
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,279
to remove the ropes

769
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,079
and erase all traces.

770
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:46,839
The reason for

771
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,720
such an elaborate method

772
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,990
was to ensure those
poisonous insects would emerge,

773
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,240
forming that horrifying prophecy.

774
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,559
Your Highness, I've long heard
that you enjoy tales of the bizarre.

775
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,400
I didn't expect

776
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,920
you'd be so unique

777
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,680
in telling them as well.

778
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,920
Planting insects inside someone?

779
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,200
You overestimate my capabilities.

780
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,880
Chuchu wasn't talking about you.

781
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:10,680
Then who?

782
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,400
To release the insects
at the right place and time,

783
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:15,000
forming that prophecy,

784
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,920
required precise control over
Prefect Liu's return to Jiaozhou

785
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,920
and the incubation period
of the insects.

786
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,759
Who knew his schedule best?

787
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,720
Or rather,

788
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,440
who could control his movements?

789
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,920
You mean...

790
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,540
The person who sent the urgent
letter summoning Prefect Liu back,

791
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,960
who prepared the very last meal he ate.

792
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,160
Preposterous!

793
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,790
There's something
even more preposterous.

794
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,680
The decree forbidding troop
movement without an imperial order

795
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,599
is a forgery.

796
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,519
What did you say?

797
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,640
A forgery?

798
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,960
His Majesty also had doubts

799
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,319
about You Longsheng's
earlier surprise attack,

800
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,839
wondering why Jiaozhou's forces

801
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,500
only defended and
never counterattacked.

802
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,839
Concerned that someone
in this remote region

803
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,240
might harbor disloyalty,

804
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
he sent me here.

805
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,720
I've examined that decree myself.

806
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,359
It is undoubtedly fake.

807
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
That's impossible!

808
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:08,759
That decree...

809
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,240
But I believe you.

810
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:12,920
His Majesty said

811
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,759
your transfer to Jiaozhou,

812
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,519
while nominally a demotion,

813
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,599
carried a vital duty.

814
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,279
Knowing Liu Shijiang's
temperament all too well,

815
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,759
His Majesty sent you here
to oversee all of Jiaozhou's affairs,

816
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,710
and to prevent unrest on the frontier

817
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,279
from being concealed out of fear,

818
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,960
only to spiral into a catastrophe.

819
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,359
His Majesty even told you

820
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,039
that?

821
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,240
His Majesty shared this with me

822
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,319
because the turmoil in Jiaozhou

823
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,000
has become a thorn in his side.

824
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:42,160
All officials here must unite

825
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,119
to overcome this crisis.

826
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,319
You're right.

827
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,519
After arriving in Jiaozhou,

828
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,190
I discovered Liu Shijiang
was abusing his position

829
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,079
to grant extensive privileges
to Nanzhao merchants operating here.

830
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,160
Trade between the two regions

831
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,720
isn't inherently bad,

832
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,279
but I later found

833
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,000
his lax oversight

834
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,920
created significant hidden dangers.

835
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,359
So, you initially got close to him

836
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:08,000
just to gather information?

837
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:08,840
That's right.

838
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,310
I wanted to determine
whether he was merely corrupt

839
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,800
or had other schemes in play.

840
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,760
But in the course of that,

841
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,760
you became familiar
not only with Liu Shijiang

842
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,400
but also with Madam Yulan.

843
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:20,960
You...

844
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,120
Chief Clark Han, there's
no use hiding it any longer.

845
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,559
Anyone can see

846
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,719
that your relationship with Madam Yulan

847
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:27,920
is far from ordinary.

848
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,639
Commandery Prince An
and Commandery Princess Consort An,

849
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,430
are you really trying
to bait me with lies?

850
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,760
You couldn't pin this on me,

851
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:35,580
so now you're turning
on Madam Yulan instead?

852
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,559
She is heavily pregnant.

853
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,719
How could she possibly
kill a strong, dead-drunk man

854
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,599
like Prefect Liu?

855
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,920
When did your affair
with Madam Yulan begin?

856
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,790
What does that have to do with the case?

857
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,360
Why should I answer you?

858
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,159
This is...

859
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,639
Why does it suddenly hurt?

860
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,760
My stomach...

861
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,490
My stomach feels
like it's about to burst!

862
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,719
What's wrong?

863
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,360
What's wrong?

864
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:32,119
What is this?

865
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,119
Hurry, this way!

866
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:13,650
Your Highness.

867
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,159
Come in.

868
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:18,720
Your Highness,

869
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,890
something's happened
at the Nanzhao military camp.

870
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,639
No one knows how,

871
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,679
but they're all dead.

872
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,519
Keep a close watch on Madam Yulan.

873
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,519
When I found them all dead,

874
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:38,840
I feared something was off.

875
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,480
Worried that animals or
insects might ruin the bodies

876
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,890
and interfere with your investigation,

877
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,719
I surrounded them
with a ring of bonfires.

878
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,079
Did anyone approach them

879
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
before they died?

880
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,000
No.

881
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,280
I had them completely sealed off.

882
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,000
(Bravery)

883
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,119
Aside from Eldest Prince,
whom I deliberately let go,

884
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,760
not a single person went in or out.

885
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,840
Good thing you set up those bonfires.

886
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,079
Why's that?

887
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,000
This sachet contains the same incense

888
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,990
used in the bamboo grove to
attract and arrange the insects.

889
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,160
You mean they were also
killed by poisonous insects?

890
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,639
Yes.

891
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,519
I discovered

892
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:17,599
that two of the soldiers,
like Liu Shijiang,

893
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,890
had been incubating insects
inside their bodies for a long time.

894
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,440
(Insects erupting from bodies)
The insects erupted from them,

895
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,760
drawn by the scent,

896
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,679
(Attacking soldiers, drawn by scent)
and attacked the other soldiers.

897
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,159
(Signs of insect bites)
All of them

898
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,559
bear insect bite marks,

899
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:31,840
with wounds showing cyanosis

900
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,100
and their lips, tongues,
and nails turning blue-black.

901
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,190
But why would they make
their own soldiers suffer first?

902
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:37,719
I don't know.

903
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,079
Maybe they lost control, and
the insects turned on their hosts.

904
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,639
I've heard

905
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,000
that Nanzhao's sorcery

906
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,559
involving breeding poisonous insects

907
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,159
and using them to harm others.

908
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,199
I just never imagined
the scale could be this devastating.

909
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,039
Is ambition for power

910
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:00,559
truly worth this?

911
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,280
These were living, breathing people.

912
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:07,119
Since ancient times,
in war and the struggle for power,

913
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,480
the victor's path has always

914
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,679
been paved with the bleached bones
of soldiers and common folk alike.

915
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,480
I haven't thanked you
for everything you've done.

916
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,200
There's no hurry.

917
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,920
You can thank me properly

918
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,770
once all of this is settled.

919
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:40,000
I only hope the people along the border

920
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,519
can find peace soon.

921
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,480
Whether they're common folk or soldiers,

922
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,079
everyone deserves to live in stability.

923
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,079
They will.

924
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:48,960
Chief,

925
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,159
Guo and Granny Chunxi are missing.

926
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,960
Someone's gone missing
in the village again?

927
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,559
More and more border villagers
have been going missing.

928
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,920
It used to happen now and then,

929
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,639
mostly hunters or woodcutters.

930
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:05,079
But over the past half year,
the numbers have surged.

931
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,000
Men, women, the elderly, even children.

932
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,360
Lately, people in our village
have been disappearing.

933
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,890
We've sent search
parties out everywhere,

934
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,920
but there's been no trace.

935
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,470
These past few days, we've been
busy blocking those Nanzhao men

936
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,990
and couldn't spare any
attention for the village.

937
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,559
According to the men who stayed behind,

938
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,220
Guo and Granny Chunxi
went down the mountain

939
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,800
to buy daily supplies five days ago

940
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,079
and never returned.

941
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,679
Don't worry, Chief. I'll
take good care of Granny.

942
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,100
(Mount Zhenyuan Abode)

943
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,750
A child and an elderly woman,
where could they possibly have gone?

944
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,960
Could they have been abducted?

945
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,990
Or taken by the Nanzhao people?

946
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,559
Don't panic.

947
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,620
I'll return to Prefect's Residence
and inform Jinyu.

948
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,680
We'll send some troops to
search together with your people.

949
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,239
Alright.

950
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,000
Looks like the missing people
aren't limited to just laborers.

951
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,760
There's clearly another agenda at play.

952
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,270
When hunters or woodcutters
vanish in the mountains,

953
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,159
it's considered normal,

954
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,920
hardly enough to draw
widespread attention.

955
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,880
The mastermind behind this

956
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,519
is exploiting that very assumption

957
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,800
to cover up the disappearances.

958
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,580
To be this meticulous, targeting men
and women alike without discrimination,

959
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,800
what could the goal possibly be?

960
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,559
Cultivating insects inside a human body

961
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,559
isn't easy.

962
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,559
It would require countless trials.

963
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,920
It's highly likely

964
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,039
these missing people were taken
and used as live test subjects.
