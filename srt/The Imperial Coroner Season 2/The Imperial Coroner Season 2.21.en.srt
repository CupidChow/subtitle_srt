00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,879
(while saving me,)

3
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:19,239
(putting her life at risk.)

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,960
(And the one behind it, You Chen'an,)

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,719
(may already have slipped away.)

6
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,679
(I would give my life
to keep Chu Chu safe.)

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,559
(Thankfully, my efforts
were not in vain.)

8
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:31,800
(Chu Chu finally pull back
from the brink of death.)

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,359
(But Jing Yi)

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,920
(is still trapped
in the hands of Nanzhao,)

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,039
(enduring torment.)

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,320
(After weighing every option,)

13
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,799
(the only choice left
was to send Leng Yue to Jing Yi's side)

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,439
(to guard and protect him.)

33
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,199
An,

34
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm begging you.

35
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,719
Please help Chu Chu.

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,080
Please.

37
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,560
What are you doing?

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,400
Don't come near.

39
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,520
Don't come near.

40
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,120
We can't let the news leak.

41
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,039
Stop him.

42
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:57,599
- Yes.
- Yes.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,560
Chu,

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,560
I did all I could.

45
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:03,479
He,

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
in this world,

47
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,120
you're the last person I wanted to kill,

48
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,879
yet you betrayed me.

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,079
You Chen'an.

50
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,079
It was you

51
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,720
who betrayed me first.

52
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,120
You caused the deaths
of so many innocent people.

53
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,680
I treated you as my friend.

54
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,720
And you

55
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,120
used me

56
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,839
and Chu Chu.

57
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,639
I will

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,639
be waiting for you

59
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,040
in hell.

60
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:44,680
No.

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,120
You've committed too many evils.

62
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:49,600
Not even the Grim Reaper would take you.

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,240
You will never

64
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:52,319
hurt

65
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,680
Chu Chu again.

66
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,920
An,

67
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:06,600
how did you get hurt so badly?

68
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,000
I fell into my brother's ambush.

69
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:08,680
An,

70
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,240
let me tend to your wounds first.

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm here.

72
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,480
I won't let anything happen to you.

73
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:13,519
He.

74
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,439
An!

75
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,120
You came to Chang'an too?

76
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,079
That's wonderful.

77
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,560
We can see each other more often now.

78
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,199
Eat up.

79
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,000
This feels like a family.

80
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,480
Bury him properly.

81
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,240
- Yes.
- Yes.

82
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,500
(Jing Residence)

83
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,959
We got the locations

84
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,760
of Chang Shou and the ghost guard.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,920
On the left of the rice shop
in West Market.

86
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,920
Second unit of the Tianshui Alley.

87
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:57,120
Where's the woman?

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,959
She said she needed to go home
to put something away.

89
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,839
Don't worry, sir.

90
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,519
I had two men follow her.

91
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,120
Very well.

92
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,800
Your Highness.

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,839
Chu Chu.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,279
You and Jing Yi
chose the same window, huh?

95
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:14,000
Not bad.

96
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,639
You look much better.

97
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,399
How's Jing Yi?

98
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,399
Same as ever.

99
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
Gao Luoqian is watching him closely.

100
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,319
I had to put on quite a show

101
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,319
and shake off two tails
just to come back.

102
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,879
But Gao Luoqian
has no sense of restraint.

103
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,720
I'm afraid he'll injure
Jing Yi's organs.

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,279
So I came back to fetch some medicine.

105
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,519
Ask Chen Feng to give you more.

106
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,639
Your Highness, how is the investigation?

107
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,720
Any news of You Chen'an?

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,959
Not yet.

109
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
But Nanzhao has been aggressive

110
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,720
along the border recently.

111
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,720
You Chen'an has likely gone back.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,439
This won't do.

113
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,920
I have to find a way to go to Nanzhao.

114
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,839
Even if I can't bring him back,

115
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,120
I must gather some clues.

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,439
Otherwise,

117
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,240
if Gao Luoqian keeps trapping him
like this,

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,800
Jing Yi may not survive.

119
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,240
I've already sent people ahead.

120
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,180
(Nanzhao Border)

121
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,240
Hyah!

122
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,959
(Nanzhao Border)

123
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,079
We can't put all our hopes

124
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,680
on Zhou Han.

125
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,560
While investigating You Chen'an
these days,

126
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,240
I uncovered quite a few things
about Gao Luoqian.

127
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:32,319
Since You Chen'an has fled,

128
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,160
we might as well

129
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
arrest Gao Luoqian first

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,639
and follow the trail

131
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,360
and wipe out the Nanzhao delegation.

132
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,199
Good.

133
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,160
You Chen'an is cunning,

134
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,759
and Gao Luoqian is no less so.

135
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:46,680
I have a plan

136
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,680
to save Jing Yi,

137
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
but he'll have to suffer a bit.

138
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,439
Are you saying

139
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,920
the Great Tang will soon find out

140
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,720
that you faked your death?

141
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:03,920
Yes.

142
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,040
I feared the campaign would be delayed,

143
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,639
so I came to report at once.

144
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,639
These past few days,

145
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,720
I've also been mobilizing troops.

146
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,120
But there's a gorge in Jiaozhou,

147
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,480
and it's the only route

148
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,800
to Jiaozhou City.

149
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,150
It's easy to defend
and hard to launch attacks.

150
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,600
Plus,

151
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
the Jiaozhou border is packed
with sentries.

152
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,680
If we make the slightest move,

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,319
they'll block the bridge
at the gorge immediately.

154
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,639
We still won't be able
to enter the city.

155
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,200
Father,

156
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,440
I'll lead a small unit

157
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,039
across the Jiaozhou border

158
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,399
and the choke point.

159
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,559
Give me some time

160
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,879
to think it over.

161
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,200
Come.

162
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,399
Your Highness, please.

163
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,039
You're most thoughtful, Lord Li.

164
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,440
I know you were coming,

165
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,720
so I prepared

166
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,159
some of your favorite festival dishes.

167
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,360
What's wrong, Your Highness?

168
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,600
Have your tastes changed

169
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,759
after a trip to the Great Tang?

170
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,320
Lord Li, do you know

171
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,320
why I always insist on having this dish
that everyone finds strange

172
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:30,039
every Chinese New Year?

173
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,879
Rather than liking it,

174
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,399
it's more about remembrance.

175
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,679
I'm not capable enough

176
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,799
to protect you.

177
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,200
After you finish
these roasted silkworm pupae,

178
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,200
I'll send you away.

179
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:49,600
I have distant relatives in Qianzhou.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,840
You'll stay there for a few years.

181
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,600
Once I find a way to make a living,

182
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,639
I'll surely bring you back.

183
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,840
Lord Li, what kind of person

184
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,960
do you think I am?

185
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,960
Your Highness,

186
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,240
you resemble a ruler
often spoken of among the Han,

187
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,679
Gou Jian, the King of the Yue state.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,159
He endured humiliation,

189
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,279
hid his brilliance,

190
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,879
and planned far ahead.

191
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,080
A rare talent fit to rule.

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,039
I follow you

193
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,000
because I strongly believe

194
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,200
you will one day achieve great dominion.

195
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,360
Then why did Chu He say

196
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,399
that even the Grim Reaper
wouldn't take me?

197
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,639
I've exhausted every effort
just to survive.

198
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,399
But why

199
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,399
even the last person who treated me well

200
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:35,879
had to turn against me.

201
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
What was all of this for?

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,840
Your Highness,

203
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,360
a frog in a well
can't understand the sea.

204
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,279
You've journeyed upstream
through endless danger.

205
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,679
There is no way back.

206
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,279
All you can do is
grit your teeth and keep going.

207
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,980
(Self-Cultivation to World Order)

208
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,440
Can't sleep?

209
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,720
Let's talk.

210
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,879
You're smart.

211
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,279
I've acted this well,

212
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,360
yet I still couldn't fool you.

213
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,919
You're worried about Jing Yi,
aren't you?

214
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,480
He took the blame for me.

215
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,960
Gao Luoqian must be tormenting him

216
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
to get what he wants.

217
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,799
But you must steady yourself first.

218
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,919
Only then can you break out
of this bind

219
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,519
and find a way through.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,320
You say that,

221
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,159
but you're not sleeping either.

222
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,559
You're thinking about He, right?

223
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,559
He's deeply emotional.

224
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,320
You Chen'an hurt him badly this time.

225
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,159
I'm afraid his grief will overwhelm him.

226
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,200
And he's been like this
since he was little.

227
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,639
When he's done something wrong,

228
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,039
he hides and refuses to see me.

229
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,200
He actually misses you very much.

230
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,840
He's deeply worried about you.

231
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,279
You're recovering now.

232
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,919
Staying cooped up in the room all day
will only stifle you.

233
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,200
Why not go out for a walk?

234
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,039
Tomorrow,

235
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,240
I'll go out for a walk.

236
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,159
Get some sleep now.

237
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,919
Second unit of the Tianshui Alley.

238
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,399
This is the place, sir.

239
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,420
(Second Unit, Tianshui Alley)

240
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,200
You two,

241
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,240
stay guard outside.

242
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

243
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,639
Sir!

244
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:21,559
Jing Yi?

245
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,679
What happened to you, Lord Gao?

246
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,000
You stink.

247
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,480
How dare you fool me?

248
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,559
How did this note end up in your hands?

249
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,080
That girl said she was going
to the latrine,

250
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,240
so I wrote down the location for her.

251
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,720
Lord Gao, how did you...

252
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:39,919
Fine.

253
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,600
Very well, Jing Yi.

254
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,200
You still think

255
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,200
you're the admired Vice Minister Jing,
do you?

256
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,120
Come.

257
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,559
Give Vice Minister Jing
a proper welcome.

258
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

259
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,840
Your Majesty,

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,159
you must demand justice for me.

261
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,759
I've worked with utmost devotion

262
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,240
for Great Tang.

263
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,559
Now, in my old age,

264
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,240
my only son has been suffering.

265
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,360
I

266
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,600
can't sleep at night.

267
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
My heart aches!

268
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,000
Senior Jing,

269
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,480
what has happened?

270
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,000
Wasn't Jing Yi resting safely at home?

271
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,879
What went wrong?

272
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:29,840
Come, rise.

273
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,679
Gao Luoqian,

274
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,120
you speak.

275
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,679
Your Majesty,

276
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,120
I have no idea what happened.

277
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,159
Vice Envoy Gao,

278
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,440
as the Nanzhao envoy,

279
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,080
I can't believe you refuse to admit
what you've done.

280
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,799
Senior Jing,

281
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,200
this is clearly slander!

282
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:50,720
Enough.

283
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:53,600
The truth will soon be clear.

284
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:54,440
Jinbao.

285
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,440
Summon Jing Yi to the palace.

287
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes.

288
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:03,799
He.

289
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:08,879
He.

290
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,679
He.

291
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,559
(I may not return this time.)

292
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,399
(Take care, all of you.)

293
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,559
(I humbly ask Commandery Prince An)

294
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,159
(to take care of Chu Chu
for the rest of her life.)

295
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,960
Yi!

296
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,960
Yi!

297
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,799
Yi,

298
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,639
how did you end up hurt like this?

299
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:18,519
Gao Luoqian,

300
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,120
you dared to use torture!

301
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Have you forgotten

302
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,000
that you're still

303
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,679
in the Great Tang?

304
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,240
I didn't do this, Your Majesty.

305
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,240
I have no idea what happened.

306
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,120
Wait, Vice Envoy Gao.

307
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,000
What,

308
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,080
did I beat myself like this?

309
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,080
It was your wife.

310
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:39,639
Come on.

311
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,279
I was furious yesterday, yes.

312
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:42,600
- But I only meant to scare you.
- Yes.

313
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,440
Gao Luoqian,

314
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
how dare you!

315
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,240
His Majesty ordered you
to keep watch,

316
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:53,440
yet you hurt him without permission.

317
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,000
I see.

318
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,240
You and your wife staged a whole act,

319
00:16:58,279 --> 00:16:59,759
treating me like a fool?

320
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,039
Let me remind you,

321
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,279
Senior Jing

322
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,480
only has this one son.

323
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:09,079
If he finds out that his only son

324
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,960
was beaten by you,

325
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,920
I believe he'll stop at nothing
to settle accounts with you.

326
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,519
Lady Jing, you're protective
of your husband.

327
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,000
How could I deny you that?

328
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,200
Since you're here,

329
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,720
none of  you should leave.

330
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,240
I'll be sure to provide you both
with food and drink.

331
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,680
What right do you have to detain me?

332
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,290
I'm to keep Vice Minister Jing
under strict guard

333
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,279
by imperial order.

334
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,319
Lady Jing, you barge in so abruptly.

335
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,079
You probably have coordinated
with Vice Minister Jing

336
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,759
to pass messages out.

337
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:44,079
Naturally,

338
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,119
I can't let you go.

339
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,000
Watch them closely.

340
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,799
Gao Luoqian!

341
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,839
Gao Luoqian!

342
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,000
Gao Luoqian!

343
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:53,880
You!

344
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,079
Looking back now,

345
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Lady Jing showed up there on purpose.

346
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,440
After I left,

347
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,319
it must've been Lady Jing

348
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,759
who beat you into this state.

349
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:10,599
Vice Envoy Gao,

350
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,799
what's wrong with you?

351
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,440
Your Majesty,

352
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,079
Vice Envoy Gao insists

353
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:21,319
that I conspired with Commandery Prince An
to kill Second Prince.

354
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,079
So he attempted

355
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,240
to force a confession.

356
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,319
That is sheer fabrication!

357
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,440
I trust the laws of the Great Tang.

358
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,319
How could I

359
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,839
abuse my power for personal revenge?

360
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,599
On top of that,

361
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,039
even if

362
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,039
I torture you into confessing,

363
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,400
once we stood before His Majesty,

364
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,880
the truth would still come out.

365
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,160
Just like how you're slandering me

366
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,799
right now.

367
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,440
I have no reason to do such a thing.

368
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:46,640
If it were only for Second Prince,

369
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,599
you wouldn't have the reason.

370
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,119
But I happened to hear

371
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,279
that Vice Envoy Gao

372
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,960
was connected to the poisonings
of Great Tang officials.

373
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,039
So you sought to

374
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,200
silence witnesses.

375
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,720
Is this true?

376
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:03,640
Slander!

377
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,480
This is slander!

378
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,720
Slander?

379
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,599
Vice Envoy Gao, have you forgotten

380
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,240
that you sold an apothecary
half a year ago?

381
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,400
Your Majesty.

382
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,200
Half a year ago,

383
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,599
Vice Envoy Gao sold an apothecary,

384
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,839
and the clerk was left behind,
Chang Shou.

385
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,759
He was one of the Nanzhao spies

386
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,240
who sold poison in the poisoning cases.

387
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,839
According to him,

388
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,279
he acted under Vice Envoy Gao's orders.

389
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:45,240
He disguised himself
and lay low in Chang'an,

390
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,960
waiting for chances to cause trouble.

391
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,599
Vice Envoy Gao,

392
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,559
how do you explain this?

393
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,039
Your Majesty,

394
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:55,920
I

395
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,839
sold an apothecary

396
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,440
due to poor management.

397
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,400
But as for Chang Shou,

398
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,559
I knew nothing of him.

399
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:05,880
No one would investigate
every clerk's background

400
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,400
when running a business.

401
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,880
Moreover,

402
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,240
when the poisonings occurred,

403
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,599
the apothecary had already been sold.

404
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,880
If I remember correctly,

405
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,680
the buyer who took it over

406
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:23,559
was the elder brother
of Commandery Princess Consort An.

407
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,279
If we speak of suspicion,

408
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,359
his is greater than mine.

409
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,319
Must I confess

410
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,240
to a fabricated crime

411
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,279
based solely on a statement

412
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,400
pieced together by Commandery Prince An?

413
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,680
Right now, I indeed have no proof

414
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,039
to verify Chang Shou's words.

415
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,359
Exactly.

416
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,079
But as you said yourself,

417
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,079
this concerns two states.

418
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,480
Anyone with suspicion

419
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,799
should first be detained.

420
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,359
The Great Tang's laws
apply equally to all.

421
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,160
Vice Minister Jing could comply,

422
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,000
so should you.

423
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,720
You killed Second Prince of Nanzhao,

424
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,279
then you intend to
detain the vice envoy.

425
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,319
Commandery Prince An.

426
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,079
Vice Minister Jing.

427
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,480
Aren't you afraid

428
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,200
that your personal motives

429
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:14,400
will escalate tensions

430
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,160
and make you sinners?

431
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,599
I hadn't informed you

432
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
that we've already obtained proof

433
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,799
that Second Prince is still alive.

434
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,119
What did you say?

435
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,000
Your Majesty,

436
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,039
I request that the coroner
Chu Chu be summoned.

437
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,200
Granted.

438
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,720
Your Majesty,

439
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,680
You Chen'an faked his death and escaped.

440
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,160
Not long ago, he returned to Nanzhao.

441
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,000
The blood print here

442
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,799
was left by his finger.

443
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,119
What does

444
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,519
a single fingerprint prove?

445
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,279
This fingerprint

446
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,079
perfectly matches the prints

447
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,240
collected by the Three Judicial Offices.

448
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:14,759
Who knows

449
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,240
when this print appeared?

450
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:19,279
Perhaps you obtained it
before killing him.

451
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,480
The bloodstains on the cloth
can be examined.

452
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,039
This fingerprint

453
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:25,160
is no more than three days old.

454
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,640
This is irrefutable evidence

455
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,680
sent back by my brother, Chu He,

456
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:33,359
from You Chen'an's side.

457
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:49,440
Knowing the danger of this mission,

458
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,039
my brother was prepared
to perish with the enemy.

459
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,319
The carrier pigeon
that returned with his letter

460
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,799
was stained in chaotic blood.

461
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,039
There must've been a fierce struggle

462
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,520
when he took the fingerprint
from You Chen'an.

463
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:00,880
In haste, he could only

464
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,640
send back the fingerprint
and his final letter.

465
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:05,000
My brother paid with his life

466
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,880
for this proof.

467
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,839
With witness and evidence both present,

468
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
do you have anything else to say,
Vice Envoy Gao?

469
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,839
This is all one-sided testimony.

470
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,319
I will report this to my king.

471
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,599
No need.

472
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,000
Once your name is cleared

473
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,759
and returns to Nanzhao,

474
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:32,720
you may see for yourself

475
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,720
whether You Chen'an is dead or alive.

476
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,359
Vice Minister Jing is innocent.

477
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,440
Release him at once

478
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,599
and restore him to office.

479
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,000
The Three Judicial Offices

480
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,599
uncovered the faked death
of Second Prince of Nanzhao.

481
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,410
They should be rewarded.

482
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,559
Gao Luoqian

483
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:47,160
is suspected of planting spies

484
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,000
and poisoning Great Tang officials.

485
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,440
Order the Capital Prefecture,
from today onward,

486
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,400
to seal the Nanzhao post station.

487
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,200
Until the truth is found,

488
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,599
no one is permitted to enter or leave.

After leaving West Market, head east.

500
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,680
There's a pond there.

501
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,359
I picked these fresh for you.

502
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,480
I don't know
whether the lotus seeds in Chang'an

503
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,839
taste better than those from Qianzhou.

Gently does it.

505

He wrapped it in a handkerchief.

524
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,240
He must've treasured it dearly

525
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,160

I prayed for this
with my first month's pay,

530
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,680
yet it couldn't keep him safe.

531
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,480
What mattered most to him

532
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,160
was your sincerity.

533
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,160
These past few days,

534
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,920
I've kept dreaming of
when we were still in Qianzhou.

535
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,599
If he hadn't been worried about me,

536
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,119
he wouldn't have come to Chang'an.

537
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:10,279
And none of this would've...

538
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,079
He gave his life

539
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,240
not only for you,

540
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,240
but also for the greater cause.

541
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,599
So take good care of yourself.

542
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,599
Only then can he rest in peace.

543
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,920
The chance he brought with his life

544
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,559
will never be wasted.

545
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,000
I'll let this amulet

546
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:43,720
stay with him.

547
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,480
May he find joy and peace

548
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,440
in his next life.

549
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,079
Throw it back to him.

550
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:57,039
Don't bring every trivial thing to me.

551
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,359
Madam.

552
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,279
What's so serious

553
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,079
that you're sighing?

554
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,319
You're here.

555
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,599
How can I not sigh?

556
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,119
You don't know.

557
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,359
The Capital Prefecture

558
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,839
is cleaning up all the mess
for the Three Judicial Offices.

559
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,480
They give me endless trouble every day.

560
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,119
He's in the Emperor's good graces
right now.

561
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,680
Just keep your distance.

562
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,440
Distance?

563
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:30,599
How?

564
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,200
I can't.

565
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,680
Do you think the Prefect of Capital

566
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,720
can dodge
all the dirty and exhausting work?

567
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,119
They even assigned me

568
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,920
to guard the Nanzhao delegation.

569
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,119
Relations between the Great Tang
and Nanzhao are tense.

570
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,960
If anything goes wrong,

571
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,759
Xiao Jinyu can keep himself away
from trouble,

572
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,480
and I'll be the one taking the blame.

573
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,119
I...

574
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,599
Enough.

575
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,880
You just deal with it for now.

576
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,240
Get through this safely
and step down in peace.

577
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,599
Don't end up being sent away
from the capital.

578
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,240
Do you hear me?

579
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:14,680
I do.

580
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,599
I'll listen to everything you say.

581
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Just one word.

582
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,680
Endure.

583
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,160
Although Gao Luoqian
is now under our control,

584
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,640
for him to pull off so many misdeeds

585
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,200
in the capital,

586
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,400
he must've had help
from local officials.

587
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,400
These people

588
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:43,200
are a hidden danger in the Great Tang.

589
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,000
The more you think about it,

590
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,880
the more chilling it feels.

591
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,680
We thought everything
was calm and smooth,

592
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,839
but the enemy's claws

593
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,519
have long been driven

594
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,440
deep into the Great Tang.

595
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,480
I remember

596
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,240
when you were tracking down You Chen'an,

597
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,200
you once ran into officials from
the Capital Prefecture searching as well.

598
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,319
But they

599
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,480
never reported their findings
to the Three Judicial Offices.

600
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,200
Exactly.

601
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,480
I ran into him at a post station
outside the capital.

602
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,640
He was chatting happily
with Gao Luoqian.

603
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,720
What were they doing there?

604
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,839
They were looking nearby for suspects.

605
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,240
Do you know what they talked about?

606
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,039
My memory isn't good.

607
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,160
Ah, I remember now.

608
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,759
That foreigner

609
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,240
told the officer

610
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:44,079
to expand the search area
and report back to him promptly.

611
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,200
A few officials traveling through
were lodged at the post station.

612
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,559
They heard them.

613
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,039
I asked them all.

614
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,990
Their accounts matched
what the post station officer said.

615
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:54,000
Then there's only one possibility.

616
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,519
You mean...

617
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,920
The Capital Prefecture
is colluding with them.

618
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,660
(Capital Prefecture)

619
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,620
(Capital Prefecture Seal)

620
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,079
The Capital Prefecture
is colluding with Nanzhao?

621
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,000
Do you realize what you're saying?

622
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,000
I wish we were wrong.

623
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,119
Jiang Daohai has never
gotten along with me.

624
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,599
Ever since I proposed sending censors

625
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,680
to each province,

626
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,359
those prefects have wanted me
brought down.

627
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,480
Jiang Daohai is close to them.

628
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,880
After that, whether it was
the serial murders at the Music Office,

629
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,640
the capital's security issues,

630
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,839
or spreading rumors

631
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,559
about my illness,

632
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,319
he may well have been behind it.

633
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,720
What we don't know is

634
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:50,160
who's standing behind Jiang Daohai.

635
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,960
Jiaozhou is sending troops.

636
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,960
Nanzhao will surely try every way

637
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,200
to drag the Great Tang
into a worse position.

638
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,559
Next,

639
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:03,720
there will be a major upheaval.

640
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,039
If it's Nanzhao acting alone,

641
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,200
no matter how much noise they make,

642
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,000
it could merely be driven
by personal ambition.

643
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,200
But if Nanzhao colludes
with Great Tang officials

644
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,799
and sows discord in Chang'an,

645
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,720
then they want only one thing.

646
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,759
The nation.

647
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,799
Your Majesty,

648
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,720
Commandery Prince An submitted a memorial
just before the palace gates were locked.

649
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,160
He left word

650
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,559
that the matter is urgent

651
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,160
and asks that Your Majesty

652
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:49,680
read it at once.

653
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,000
Read.

654
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:51,799
Yes.

655
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,240
"There may be officials in the capital

656
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,359
colluding with Nanzhao.

657
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,039
The Three Judicial Offices
are conducting a discreet investigation.

658
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,319
I beg Your Majesty to be cautious

659
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,039
and not trust one side's words alone."

660
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:12,080
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

661
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,720
This map

662
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,000
needs some dusting.

663
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,640
This is the medicine Physician Xu
prepared for Lord Jiang.

664
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,480
Thank you so much.

665
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,880
Grind this finer.

666
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,079
Add that in.

667
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:44,839
Come on.

668
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,279
All right.

669
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,100
The Three Judicial Offices are using
this place to investigate a case.

670
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,079
Close the shop.

671
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,039
Yes.

672
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,240
Out.

673
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,480
Move along.

674
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:58,440
Your Highness?

675
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,680
What is all this?

676
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,960
Don't be anxious, Madam.

677
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:05,960
We just have a few questions.

678
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,320
Your Highness,

679
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,480
you haven't fully recovered.

680
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,400
Why didn't you rest properly

681
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,599
and instead

682
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
come to see me?

683
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,800
I heard you've been visiting physicians
in private.

684
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,719
Is Prefect Jiang unwell?

685
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,440
His Highness happens to know
a highly skilled physician.

686
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,039
We could introduce him to you.

687
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,280
How about this?

688
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,239
I know a bit about
herbal remedies myself.

689
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,159
Shall I take a look?

690
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,960
No need.

691
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,320
My husband is in good health.

692
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,639
We won't trouble Your Highness.

693
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,119
Commandery Prince An!

694
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,940
(Angelica, corydalis, astragalus)

695
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,559
This is

696
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,239
a fertility prescription.

697
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:00,760
I've been married to Jiang Daohai
for years

698
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:02,880
and still have no child.

699
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,800
What's wrong with buying him
some medicine to regulate his health?

700
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,320
If you spread this around

701
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,639
and damage the Zhao family's reputation,

702
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,239
you'll gain nothing from it.

703
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,800
We have no interest

704
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
in your private matters.

705
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,320
We came here

706
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:20,480
only because Prefect Jiang

707
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,920
is in grave danger.

708
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,599
What happened to him?

709
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,280
I did everything

710
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,119
you asked of us.

711
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,159
Why haven't you

712
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,960
returned it to me?

713
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,360
Lord Jiang,

714
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:37,239
the weather is dry.

715
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,880
Have a cup of hot tea

716
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,880
to cool your temper.

717
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,719
Rest assured.

718
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,239
We only have one last favor to ask.

719
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:48,840
Once it's done,

720
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,440
everything ends.

721
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,199
Speak.

722
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,199
Please take the trouble

723
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,480
to send us out of the capital.

724
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,239
Are you insane?

725
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:05,199
If this is discovered,

726
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,840
do you think I'll keep my head?

727
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,320
Do you think

728
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,400
you can still

729
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,400
walk away unscathed?

730
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,920
I...

731
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,159
Sending us away

732
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,320
is also sending away your leverage.

733
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,320
But if Commandery Prince An

734
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,440
pins our crimes on us,

735
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,159
even if you get the thing back,

736
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,679
you won't be able to get away with it.

737
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,440
Your future

738
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,360
lies in a single choice.

739
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,039
There is a mole
in the Capital Prefecture?

740
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,400
I'm not sure about the others,

741
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,360
but Jiang Daohai would never dare
commit treason.

742
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,119
He doesn't have the nerve.

743
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,480
If you trust him,

744
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,159
you should all the more
cooperate with me.

745
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,519
Prevention is better than a cure.

746
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,119
If there is a hidden disease,

747
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:08,599
you must root it out
before it grows into something grave.

748
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,760
Only then can there be peace.

749
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:11,559
If you keep delaying,

750
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:13,800
and the illness breaks out
for all to see,

751
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,079
then even an immortal couldn't save it.

752
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,480
If Prefect Jiang

753
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,360
is innocent,

754
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,000
the Three Judicial Offices
would never allow anyone

755
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:23,800
to wrong him.

756
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,320
Well.

757
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,599
At this point,

758
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,840
I don't wish to cover for him.

759
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,719
I don't know about other matters,

760
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,280
but there is one thing.

761
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:45,480
If someone were to seize this weakness,

762
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,480
his career would be finished.

763
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:48,599
What is it?

764
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:50,760
He once

765
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:53,599
had an affair in the back offices

766
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,199
behind my back.

767
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,840
You bring this up so suddenly.

768
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,000
Were any of those women

769
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:02,920
suspicious?

770
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,679
I once saw a woman

771
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,760
wearing foreign attire
enter the back offices.

772
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,639
It was too late in the day,

773
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
and I couldn't see her face clearly.

774
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,199
Through the papered window,

775
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,239
I saw the two behaving intimately.

776
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,079
After that,

777
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,199
I never saw her again.

778
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,559
Do you recall

779
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:22,679
when she came?

780
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,159
It was after Master Shenguan died.

781
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,519
That day,

782
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,079
I had intended to discuss with him

783
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:33,800
how to save Senyao.

784
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,960
After Master Shenguan died?

785
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,639
Since then,

786
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:46,719
Jiang Daohai

787
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,679
has been helping Gao Luoqian.

788
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,280
Could that woman

789
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,840
have been Hong Luan?

790
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,000
It must've been
Gao Luoqian's honey trap.

791
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,679
He used it skilfully.

792
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,440
Jiang Daohai is lustful,

793
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,159
but he's timid.

794
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,679
Rather than a honey trap,

795
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,840
I believe Hong Luan,

796
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,360
or rather Gao Luoqian,

797
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,599
had leverage over him.

798
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:12,840
Gao Luoqian won't be easy to pry open.

799
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:15,519
But the Capital Prefecture
isn't a solid wall.

800
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:17,400
Leng Yue. Jing Yi.

801
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:19,000
There's something I need you to do.

802
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,760
No.

803
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,320
Father,

804
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
it took me a long time
to set up this campaign.

805
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,199
It's foolproof.

806
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,239
According to your plan,

807
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,480
our army must pass a gorge.

808
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,970
It's easy to defend
but hard to launch attacks.

809
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,679
If

810
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,159
the Great Tang army
stations troops at the bridgehead,

811
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:39,599
you'll be completely blocked.

812
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,559
This won't do, and that won't do.

813
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,519
Then why did you

814
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,039
have me prepare before?

815
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,519
Conventional tactics won't work.

816
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,480
But

817
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,559
a swift action tactic
couldn't be more suitable now.

818
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,519
Someone has proposed

819
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,320
that you lead a small unit,

820
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,480
strike the Tang border,
seize the gorge,

821
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,360
and hold it.

822
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,320
That way, the main force
can advance without obstruction.

823
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:01,960
But

824
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:04,000
what if the Tang troops discover
and intercept us?

825
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,679
Don't worry.

826
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,320
Right now,

827
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,320
there's already someone

828
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,239
inside Jiaozhou

829
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,719
creating the perfect opportunity for you.

830
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:13,920
You're finally back.

831
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,840
After a few of us escaped
to the Prefect's Residence,

832
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,679
we searched every day

833
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,119
but couldn't find you.

834
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,960
We thought...

835
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,000
We thought you'd...

836
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:21,039
I'm fine.

837
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,480
What's the situation in the city?

838
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,719
Any news of Nanzhao?

839
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,800
General Xiao.

840
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:30,800
General Xiao,

841
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,039
how are you?

842
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,280
Chief Clerk Han.

843
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,119
You and Commandery Prince An

844
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,960
are truly brothers.

845
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,280
You run into each other

846
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,599
wherever you go.

847
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,880
That makes the rest of us look lazy.

848
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,119
General Xiao,

849
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,360
before Prefect Liu
returns from Chang'an,

850
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,280
I'm temporarily overseeing

851
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,280
the Prefect's Residence.

852
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,559
If you need anything,

853
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,320
feel free to instruct me.

854
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,079
By imperial decree, I've taken up the post
of Annan General,

855
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,320
commanding the Jiaozhou border forces.

856
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,239
To guard against the Nanzhao raid,

857
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,460
I need to understand the military affairs
as soon as possible.

858
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,039
I ask that you give

859
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,599
your full cooperation, Chief Clerk Han.

860
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,960
I see.

861
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:16,920
Chief Clerk Han!

862
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,400
Chief Clerk Han,

863
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,920
something's happened!

864
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,360
Why the panic?

865
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:22,840
Speak.

866
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,679
Chief Clerk Han,

867
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,119
