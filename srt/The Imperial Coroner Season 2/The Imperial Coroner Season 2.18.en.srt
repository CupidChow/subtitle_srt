1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,359
(You Chen'an died an accidental
death in Weiguo Temple.)

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,860
(Jing Yi and I, who were
the only people at the scene,)

3
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,990
(were treated as suspects.)

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,359
(Gao Luoqian will certainly use
diplomatic relations as his leverage)

5
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:22,640
(to launch an attack.)

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
(This time,)

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,120
(Nanzhao is baring their fangs.)

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,920
(His Highness and I deduced
from the slightest clues)

9
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,079
(that Peacock is likely You Chen'an.)

10
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:34,759
(And, this elaborate trap)

11
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,479
(was set up by him as well.)

12
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:37,880
(You Chen'an)

13
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,000
(might still be alive.)

=Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,240
(This story is entirely fictional.)

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,920
=Episode 18=

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,719
Chen'an fulfilled
his mission with honor!

33
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,159
He did it for the greater good!

34
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,159
But look at what happened to him!

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,599
As a ruler, and as a father,

36
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,000
I have

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,759
let my son down.

38
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,319
Father, Great Tang is bullying us because
there's no one to stand up against them!

39
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,919
They've trampled upon

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,280
the dignity of Nanzhao!

41
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,550
- That's right!
- That's right!

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,280
They went overboard!

43
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,879
They're too much!

44
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
My dear brother!

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,719
You suffered a wrongful death!

46
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:58,159
Now, everyone is talking about this.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,000
How can the imperial court
retain its dignity

48
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,759
if we don't seek justice
from Great Tang?

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,439
That's right!

50
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,599
At most, we'll just go to war!

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,919
Great Tang is no longer
what it used to be!

52
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,479
We can definitely defeat them!

53
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,680
- Go to war!
- Go to war!

54
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,639
- Avenge Second Prince!
- Avenge Second Prince!

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,390
- Go to war!
- Go to war!

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,120
Father!

57
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,759
Chen'an!

58
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,680
Chen'an is my son.

59
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
But the soldiers of Nanzhao,

60
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,599
they're my people too!

61
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,159
How can I...

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,360
How can I send them
to the battlefield just like that?

63
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:29,039
We mustn't declare war against them!

64
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,639
My King,

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,199
this is the last straw!

66
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,240
Father!

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,479
Please calm down.

68
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,400
This matter has yet to be finalized.

69
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,919
Gao Luoqian made a three-day pact
with the Tang emperor.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,960
If the Tang emperor
still refuses to give us

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
an account by then,

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,719
I won't tolerate it any longer!

73
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,639
The men of Nanzhao would rather
spill their blood on the battlefield

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,439
than remain as cowards!

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,840
- My King is wise.
- My King is wise.

76
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,439
- We shall defend Nanzhao's honor!
- We shall defend Nanzhao's honor!

77
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,080
- We shall avenge Chen'an!
- We shall avenge Second Prince!

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
Excellent.

79
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,960
My brother wrote to us.

80
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,039
Take a guess.

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,399
I've already found out.

82
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,839
You Chen'an got his well-deserved death.

83
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,240
Your brother did a beautiful job.

84
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,399
I'll surely reward him handsomely.

85
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:24,959
You should read it first.

86
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,602
(The plan was off-course. You Chen'an
was struck by a crossbow bolt.)

87
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:30,111
(Eldest Prince, is there
someone else assisting you?)

88
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:31,620
(Getting rid of Xiao Jinyu as well
is a brilliant plan on your part.)

89
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,000
So, it wasn't him?

90
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,360
I was perplexed as well.

91
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,480
Could it be

92
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,639
that you have another
brother-in-law out there?

93
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,200
Even if I do want to get another wife...

94
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,959
That's not it.

95
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,240
Where can I find
such a capable brother-in-law?

96
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,160
Your Highness, I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

97
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:53,720
In my opinion,

98
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,680
there's only one person
who's capable of this feat.

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,279
Who?

100
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,399
It's Father.

101
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,639
You're right.

102
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,720
Father needed a reason
to mobilize his troops.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,520
And, he could use this chance
to get rid of Xiao Jinyu as well.

104
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,090
It's literally
killing two birds with one stone.

105
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,759
You Chen'an's death is well worth it.

106
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,480
I was wondering

107
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,839
why Father wanted to see me alone

108
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,120
after the court session was over.

109
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,319
What did Father say?

110
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,240
He told me to get ready.

111
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:22,680
He said I might be

112
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,199
leading the troops to Jiaozhou anytime.

113
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,800
I told you already.

114
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,360
Father dotes on you the most.

115
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:29,880
In the end, he's still siding with us.

116
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,639
My dear, you're wise indeed.

117
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,759
It's truly fortunate that Nanzhao

118
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,879
will have an empress like you
in the future.

119
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,240
Of course.

120
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,240
(At the hour of Mao on the second day)

121
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,500
I have to see the corpse
before I can tell if it's real.

122
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,560
Wu Jiang, rush to the Court
of Judicial Review

123
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,500
and ask the minister
to permit it as soon as possible.

124
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,110
I'm going to examine
You Chen'an's corpse personally.

125
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,480
Yes.

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,480
Vice Envoy,
what else are you worried about?

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,660
Why must you come to see me
this early in the morning?

128
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,180
Your Majesty, you've already promised.

129
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,199
I have no objections.

130
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,480
It's just that Second Prince

131
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,720
is still all alone.

132
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,000
Now,

133
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,519
it's the height of summer.

134
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,399
Mosquitoes are abundant
during this season.

135
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,639
I...

136
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,160
I truly

137
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,160
am not willing to leave him alone,

138
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:34,920
and I can't bear

139
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,160
to just ignore the fact.

140
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,920
What do you want, then?

141
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,639
Your Majesty,

142
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,639
please allow me

143
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,759
to retrieve Second Prince's body

144
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:51,879
and place it in our residence for now.

145
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,639
This won't do.

146
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,240
The case hasn't been solved yet.

147
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,959
His body must remain there.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,120
Your Majesty, do you
still intend to touch his corpse?

149
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,839
Why must you humiliate Nanzhao?

150
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,279
According to our customs,

151
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,200
after one's passing, their body
must be laid out promptly

152
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,390
for sutra-chanting in order
for them to reach Nirvana.

153
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,399
Your Majesty,

154
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,759
Second Prince died a wrongful death.

155
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,560
Please let him

156
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,399
rest in peace after death!

157
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,120
Fine.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,560
I shall

159
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,839
permit your request.

160
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

161
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,519
Sir,

162
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,079
I think we have to figure out

163
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,360
who the culprit is

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,759
just in case.

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,480
Besides the monks,

166
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,920
only Xiao Jinyu, Jing Yi,
and You Chen'an were there that night.

167
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,439
The monks have already figured it out.

168
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,360
Xiao Jinyu and Jing Yi were afraid
that You Chen'an might be killed.

169
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,720
Naturally, they wouldn't be the culprits.

170
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,240
You've already had the scene inspected.

171
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,920
He showed signs of being poisoned
by Herb of Drowsiness.

172
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,800
And, the arrow embedded within his heart

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,480
was coated with Arrowheart Poison.

174
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,720
The culprit was bent on taking his life.

175
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:34,320
He was meticulous,

176
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,639
and had a thorough grasp
of the time of the crime.

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,399
It can only be him.

178
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,039
Who is it?

179
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,679
Go hire a better coroner.

180
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,320
Remember,

181
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,720
the coroner

182
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,200
must have nothing to do
with the Three Judicial Offices.

183
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,919
Yes.

184
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,639
Sir, Commandery Prince An's men are here.

185
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,990
They said they would like to help
with the corpse inspection.

186
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,440
It seems they have the same idea as you.

187
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,039
(At the hour of Wei on the second day)

188
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,600
Your Highness,

189
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,060
Gao Luoqian sought an audience
with His Majesty this morning.

190
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,540
He took the body back to their lodging.

191
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,690
I discussed the matter with him.

192
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,890
But he insisted on performing
the rites of the dead for him first.

193
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,840
He said we have to wait

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,230
until the rites are over before
we can examine the body.

195
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,080
He was wishing for You Chen'an's demise.

196
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,600
Rites of the dead?

197
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,200
By the time the rites are over,
the day's all but done.

198
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,110
He's using this as an excuse

199
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,990
so that we won't be able
to examine the corpse.

200
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,279
Gao Luoqian even said

201
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,840
that Your Highness had
a unique relationship with the suspect.

202
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,780
Even if someone
were to examine the corpse,

203
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:36,879
it shouldn't be you.

204
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,799
Suspect?

205
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,960
Gao Luoqian was always up to no good.

206
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,590
Twisting the truth
was his specialty all along.

207
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,720
I was one step too late.

208
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,450
The corpse is
the most crucial piece of evidence.

209
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,240
We know that.

210
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,360
Gao Luoqian knows that too.

211
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,840
He's determined to harm
His Highness and Jing Yi.

212
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,879
Naturally, he'll try to stop us.

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,830
If so, let's check out
the crime scene first.

214
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,120
Yes.

215
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:57,679
Let's go.

216
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,799
Xie Huaiding was harmed.

217
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,519
The source of the poison
hasn't been verified yet.

218
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,200
Xiao Jinli was attacked and
went missing, with his fate unknown!

219
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,639
At this moment,

220
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,990
we can't afford to let anything
happen to Great Tang!

221
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,639
As an emperor,

222
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,200
I'm a coward.

223
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:28,720
Your Majesty!

224
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,440
Please look after your health!

225
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,290
If, one day,
something does happen to you,

226
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:34,559
the state

227
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:37,600
will fall.

228
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
You're right.

229
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,840
I mustn't fall.

230
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,960
I need to leave the palace
in civilian clothing.

231
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,799
Jinbao.

232
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,590
Help me get changed.

233
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,290
Yes, Your Majesty!

234
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,320
(At the hour of Shen on the second day)

235
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
Senior Jing, I missed you.

236
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,559
In the palace,

237
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,919
I have no one to confide in.

238
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,679
(Jing Zhi, Senior)
There are all kinds of problems as well.

239
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,039
They give me a headache.

240
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,919
Your Majesty,

241
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,639
the fate of the people

242
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,480
is on your shoulders.

243
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,639
Indeed.

244
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,639
It's very taxing on me indeed.

245
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,720
Old people like us

246
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,759
have toiled away most of our lives.

247
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,879
We have the same mindset.

248
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,120
We merely wanted the people
to lead better lives.

249
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,399
We wanted them to lead peaceful lives.

250
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,559
Your Majesty,

251
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,519
I have

252
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,000
a request.

253
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,480
Please grant me

254
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,480
your permission.

255
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,879
Please tell me.

256
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,120
If you ever

257
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,840
find yourself with no way out,

258
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,080
you may dispose...

259
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,480
You may dispose

260
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,679
of them!

261
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,720
Senior,

262
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,799
I have

263
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,799
let you down.

264
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,679
(At the hour of Xu on the second day)

265
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,970
Has the Prefect of the Capital
inspected the crime scene?

266
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,240
Logically speaking,
he should've done so.

267
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,279
But they won't inspect the crime scene

268
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,279
without His Majesty's oral edict.

269
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,240
The temple has prepared

270
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,039
a resting room for You Chen'an alone.

271
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,679
However, they chose
to commit the crime here.

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm sure there's a reason why.

273
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,160
Let's inspect the place thoroughly.

274
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,919
The blood has taken on a dark tint.

275
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,799
It's indeed a sign of poisoning.

276
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,840
It's empty under the tile.

277
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,080
Wu Jiang.

278
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,840
Yes!

279
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,440
Try to lift this tile.

280
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,480
Yes.

281
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,559
There's actually
an underground path here.

282
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,370
As a child, the elders in the family
had mentioned this story before.

283
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,279
They said

284
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,279
that the capital was thrown into chaos

285
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,559
when An Lushan invaded Chang'an.

286
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,700
Many people dug
an underground path just to escape.

287
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,590
Over the years,
multiple paths such as this

288
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,790
have been discovered sporadically.

289
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,679
I didn't expect to see one here.

290
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,360
But something's off.

291
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,879
It's been so many years.

292
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,879
Logically speaking, this underground path
should've been blocked.

293
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,440
Let's go down and take a look.

294
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:25,960
Yes.

295
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:29,720
Here.

296
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,520
Your Highness, please mind your steps.

297
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,399
Here,

298
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,039
Lady Jing.

299
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,480
It's obvious

300
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,519
that someone was living here.

301
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:07,879
Leng Yue, look.

302
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,679
These footprints

303
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,759
resemble You Chen'an's.

304
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,500
No. These are footprints
of two separate individuals.

305
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,440
They have
completely different walking habits.

306
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,519
Chu Chu, look.

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,150
For this set of footprints,

308
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,480
(Marks on the sole are clear)
the mark on the left sole is clearer.

309
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,679
As for this set,

310
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,759
(Marks on the heels are more pronounced)
the mark on the heel is more pronounced.

311
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,519
And,

312
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,940
the individual
who walks mostly with his heels

313
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,039
has left behind

314
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,279
multiple traces.

315
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,759
He should've been
living here for a longer time.

316
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,519
The person who used more
of his soles to walk

317
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,600
left fewer footprints.

318
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,759
Judging from the size of the soles,

319
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,840
this individual should have a figure

320
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,400
that's very similar to You Chen'an.

321
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,200
So, I think the culprit was hiding in here

322
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,440
after committing the crime.

323
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Now,

324
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,159
it's hard to say whether You Chen'an

325
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,279
is the victim or the culprit.

326
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,639
What should we do, then?

327
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,240
At dawn,

328
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,000
we will split up
and conjure a grand show.

329
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:11,720
All right.

330
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:12,080
Yes.

331
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,159
Let's go.

332
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:13,799
Let's go.

333
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,140
The secret passageway in the temple
leads to the outside of the city.

334
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,660
Wu Jiang, you and Leng Yue should
investigate the area outside the city.

335
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,990
Notify the Prefect of the Capital
immediately upon locating the exit.

336
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:40,679
Don't worry.

337
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,600
I'll definitely find the culprit

338
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:44,600
even if I have to
flip the city upside down.

339
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,639
(No matter if you trust me or not,)

340
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,440
(I've never wanted to kill you.)

341
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,840
(That silly elder brother of yours)

342
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,559
(wasn't capable enough to do so either.)

343
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:08,279
(But where exactly did it go wrong?)

344
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,480
(Who killed you?)

345
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,720
(In the end, I was the one
who've let you down.)

346
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,839
(As your father,)

347
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,559
(I will)

348
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,920
(definitely avenge you.)

349
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,759
Chen'an.

350
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,119
This lamp of eternity

351
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,559
will

352
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,599
provide you with light

353
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:42,440
for all eternity.

354
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,599
(Prefect's Residence)

355
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,680
(Yu Lan, Wife of Jiaozhou's Prefect)
Now that the Prefect has headed to Chang'an,

356
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,200
(Yu Lan, Wife of Jiaozhou's Prefect)
I'll entrust the affairs of the residence

357
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,839
to you now.

358
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,680
(Han Ji)
As the chief clerk,

359
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,440
(Chief Clerk of Prefect's Residence)
this is merely my duty.

360
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,160
Madam, you flatter me.

361
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,480
Chief Clark Han, you're very talented.

362
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:03,319
You're merely working here

363
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:04,920
for the time being.

364
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm sure you'll be able to return
to the imperial court

365
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,080
and develop your career in the future.

366
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,240
What's so good about Chang'an?

367
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,759
Madam, why did you summon me

368
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,039
today?

369
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,240
Someone delivered this

370
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,759
to our residence at sunset today.

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,360
They said it was an important order
from the capital to you.

372
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,450
I don't know anything about it.

373
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,319
Therefore, I didn't dare to open it.

374
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,020
(Imperial Decree to the Jiaozhou Army)

375
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,720
This...

376
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,680
This...

377
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,119
This is an imperial decree
from His Majesty!

378
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,680
Something's off.

379
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,119
Prefect Liu is in Chang'an.

380
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:59,720
His Majesty could've
delivered the decree to him there.

381
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,240
Why did he deliver it

382
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,440
all the way to Jiaozhou?

383
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,759
It's all my fault.

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,990
The physician said
my fetal position was abnormal.

385
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,359
Thus, I wrote to Chang'an

386
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,279
out of fear.

387
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,039
Upon receiving the letter,

388
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,160
I assume my husband
bade farewell to His Majesty

389
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,640
before receiving the decree.

390
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,720
Naturally, the decree arrives here

391
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,279
much faster than my husband.

392
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:23,480
I suppose that's why

393
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,720
he missed out on it.

394
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,799
Madam, are you saying

395
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,160
that Prefect Liu will return soon?

396
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,079
Since this is an imperial decree,

397
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,400
if the order

398
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
is delayed,

399
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,759
I'll be convicted.

400
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,160
Madam, please calm down!

401
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,559
It might affect your child.

402
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,200
Hurry!

403
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,279
Help Madam sit down.

404
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:51,720
Yes, sir.

405
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:52,119
Hurry!

406
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:52,699
Madam,

407
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,519
please sit down.

408
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:00,480
Chief Clerk Han,

409
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,319
what should we do?

410
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,960
Fine.

411
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,090
Prefect Liu instructed me to take charge

412
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,319
of the residence before he left.

413
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,960
I suppose receiving

414
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,990
the imperial decree
on his behalf is viable.

415
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:14,680
It is!

416
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,440
It is!

417
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:34,960
Prefect of Jiaozhou,

418
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,079
and Annan Great General,

419
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,960
during the foreign envoy's
stay in Chang'an,

420
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,100
no one shall dispatch troops
to the frontier

421
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:45,240
without an imperial decree?

422
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,559
This...

423
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,920
Something's off

424
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,440
about this.

425
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,599
I don't know

426
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,880
anything about it.

427
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,559
But luckily,

428
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,720
we have you, Chief Clerk Han.

429
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:25,480
(At the hour of Chen on the third day)

430
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,960
So, the passageway leads here.

431
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,480
It's quite a long journey.

432
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,119
Wu Jiang, report this
to the Prefect of the Capital.

433
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,260
Tell him to send his men here.

434
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:36,079
Why did Her Highness

435
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:38,799
insist on making us
seek the Prefect of the Capital?

436
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,799
You'll know by then.

437
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:41,600
Yes, Lady Jing.

438
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,359
Wu Jiang!

439
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,079
Mind your steps!

440
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,799
Sir, I'm done with the examination.

441
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,519
It took you quite some time.

442
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,290
What results have you obtained?

443
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,079
This...

444
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:28,799
Take him away.

445
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,980
Leave no traces behind.

446
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:30,759
Sir!

447
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,240
Sir!

448
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:31,519
Come!

449
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:31,960
Sir!

450
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,079
Sir!

451
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Sir!

452
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,039
Sir!

453
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,519
Any news?

454
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,060
There's news.

455
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,710
Commandery Princess Consort An
and Lady Jing went to Weiguo Temple.

456
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,470
There, they discovered
a secret underground passageway

457
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,740
that leads to the outside of the city.

458
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,100
After that, Lady Jing
followed the passageway all the way.

459
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,990
She even notified
the Prefect of the Capital.

460
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:03,440
I assume they'll arrive soon.

461
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,319
I knew it would spell trouble for us.

462
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,519
Prepare a horse for me.

463
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,680
I'm going to check it out.

464
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,480
Yes, sir!

465
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,300
(Third Quarter of Hour of Si
on the third day)

466
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,200
Lady Jing, I bumped into Gao Luoqian
on my way there.

467
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,160
He insisted on following me.

468
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,990
Now, you know why, right?

469
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:22,720
Indeed.

470
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,440
That scum is keeping an eye on us.

471
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,880
Lady Jing.

472
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,880
Where's the exit?

473
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,559
It's inside the abandoned well.

474
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,680
Vice Envoy Gao,
you're resourceful indeed.

475
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,300
The Three Judicial Offices
has leads about this case.

476
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:41,300
Why didn't you guys notify
the Nanzhao delegation?

477
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,290
What do you mean by this?

478
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,390
Are you hiding them from us on purpose?

479
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,319
I notified the Prefect of the Capital
right after making this discovery.

480
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,440
As for the Nanzhao delegation,

481
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,839
I suppose you were always
relentless in your efforts.

482
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,200
No.

483
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,640
I mean, you're well-connected.

484
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,440
You came to us
before we even got to notify you.

485
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,200
By the way, Wu Jiang,
where's the dog I told you to find?

486
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,000
A dog?

487
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,079
Oh, you mean that dog?

488
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,559
It's following us from the back.

489
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,880
If so, I suppose Vice Envoy Gao
is faster than the dog, huh?

490
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
He's so fast.

491
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,400
Vice Envoy Gao,
if you wish to inquire about the case,

492
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,759
please come with us.

493
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,559
Don't step on the footprints.

494
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,980
(Universal Post Station)

495
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,640
Commandery Princess Consort An.

496
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,880
What brings you here?

497
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,720
I'm here to see You Chen'an.

498
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:53,119
We still don't know

499
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,279
who murdered Second Prince.

500
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,319
Commandery Prince An and Vice Minister
Jing are involved with the case.

501
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,200
And, they're connected to you.

502
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,260
You're also considered
a member of the officialdom.

503
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,840
You should know when to avoid suspicion.

504
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,710
You Chen'an is
the second prince of Nanzhao.

505
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,720
He's my friend as well.

506
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,390
Both professionally and personally,

507
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,240
I wish to accompany him
on his final journey

508
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,500
before you guys perform the rites.

509
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,200
Your Highness,
let me give you a reminder.

510
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,319
To avoid any further misunderstandings
between Great Tang and Nanzhao,

511
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,440
Your Highness,

512
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,780
please don't harbor any thoughts
of touching his remains.

513
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,000
I came from Weiguo Temple.

514
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,300
The circumstances surrounding his death
have become clear to me.

515
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:24,690
There's no need
to examine his body again.

516
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,559
I merely came here

517
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,880
to pay my respects to him as a friend.

518
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:30,240
Envoy,

519
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,519
please make an exception

520
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:33,319
and let me see him one last time.

521
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,790
I actually made some discoveries
when I investigated the crime scene.

522
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,200
Envoy, if you don't mind,

523
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,160
I can tell you about them
after I'm done visiting You Chen'an.

524
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,319
Let's arrest

525
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,559
the culprit together,

526
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:46,319
okay?

527
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,880
Your Highness, I'm pleased

528
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,390
that you're willing to share it with me.

529
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,200
Please.

530
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,590
Beneath the meditation hall
where the incident occurred

531
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
lies a secret passageway.

532
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,319
It leads all the way here.

533
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,440
Someone must've used the passageway
before and after

534
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,680
the incident.

535
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,920
You guys won't tell me
that the culprit has run away, will you?

536
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:17,920
This is ridiculous.

537
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,799
Vice Envoy Gao,
you and Deputy Prefect Leng

538
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,279
arrived at almost the same time.

539
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,160
That means there's no chance
that I and Deputy Prefect Leng

540
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:26,960
can collude during that short period.

541
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,400
Why don't you

542
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:31,200
help us analyze the situation as well?

543
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,839
Who might be coming and going

544
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,039
to the temple through this passageway?

545
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,599
How should I know?

546
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,559
These footprints lead all the way

547
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:49,359
from Weiguo Temple
through the underground passage.

548
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,200
Judging from that,

549
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,759
someone should've left the passageway
and headed outward.

550
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,240
Vice Prefect Leng.

551
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,839
What's that direction?

552
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:13,640
South.

553
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,039
South?

554
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,480
I know it's pointing toward the South.

555
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,039
I mean,

556
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
what lies

557
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,720
in that direction?

558
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,000
Vice Envoy Gao, calm down.

559
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,980
I've already sent my men
toward that direction.

560
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,079
No matter who it is,

561
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,319
there's no way they can escape.

562
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,960
If that's the case,

563
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,119
I shall wait for the good news

564
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,759
from Vice Prefect Leng
and the Three Judicial Offices.

565
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,759
Your Highness,
you've examined countless bodies.

566
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Are you still afraid
of Second Prince's body?

567
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,319
I'm not afraid.

568
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,000
I just can't believe it.

569
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,680
He said goodbye to me
just a few days ago.

570
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,880
But now, he's...

571
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,200
What's wrong?

572
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:24,720
Do you think

573
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,920
there's something off

574
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:27,599
about his death?

575
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,559
Have you seen the wound on his chest?

576
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,400
What's wrong?

577
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,599
What has that got to do with his chest?

578
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
You'll know when you see it.

579
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,319
(The scars on this corpse)

580
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,319
(bear little resemblance
to You Chen'an's.)

581
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,400
(This isn't You Chen'an.)

582
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:06,559
It's just some old wounds.

583
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,590
What has this got to do
with Second Prince's death?

584
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,440
It's all about these old wounds.

585
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,119
He told me before

586
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,759
that he received these scars

587
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,759
from the hunting ground.

588
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,640
He had a rough life when he was a child.

589
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,400
No one knew how much effort it took him

590
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,279
to earn the favor of
the king of Nanzhao.

591
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,920
He didn't even get to give his mother,
who passed away early, an account.

592
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,230
To think
that he passed away just like that.

593
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,799
I'm sure he's unsatisfied!

594
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,279
(She's such a drama queen.)

595
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,359
(Surely this princess consort)

596
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,400
(wasn't involved
with You Chen'an, right?)

597
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,390
Your Highness, please stop crying.

598
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,000
You Chen'an!

599
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,340
So, as you've mentioned before,

600
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,440
what was off about
Second Prince's death?

601
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,160
You Chen'an, I'm sorry!

602
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:18,400
My chest hurts!

603
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,279
Please hold me!

604
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,079
Someone!

605
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:21,839
Yes.

606
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,780
Please take her with you.

607
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,119
Yes.

608
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,920
You Chen'an!

609
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,640
You Chen'an!

610
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:40,200
She...

611
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,400
Did she only bring some
wild grass with her?

612
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:44,519
Yes.

613
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,880
Before that,

614
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:08,480
she even showed me
the wound on his chest.

615
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,400
But You Chen'an spent

616
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,780
his younger days rolling
and crawling in the hunting ground.

617
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,400
It's normal for him to have such scars.

618
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,960
It seems we couldn't hide it from them.

619
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,079
Leng Yue invited
the Prefect of the Capital there

620
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,599
deliberately

621
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,599
for us to see.

622
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,680
Commandery Princess Consort An

623
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,910
took advantage of my absence
and came to check out the body

624
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,359
using paying respects as her excuse.

625
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,319
I'm sure she found out.

626
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:50,720
If so, sir, how did you find out
that this person wasn't You Chen'an?

627
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,440
After the autopsy, the coroner told me

628
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,279
that this person has had work done
on both his facial bones and skin.

629
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,160
This was an extremely intricate disguise

630
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:02,200
meticulously crafted over
a long period of time.

631
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
You Chen'an

632
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,400
played a clever trick on us.

633
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,039
If Commandery Princess Consort An
reports this to their emperor...

634
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:12,680
Nanzhao will turn into a laughing stock.

635
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:13,880
By then,

636
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,039
I will become

637
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,200
the scapegoat.

638
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,039
Forget about returning to Nanzhao.

639
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,440
I might not even survive.

640
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,559
If so,

641
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,079
what should we do?

642
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,680
Send out our suicide warriors.

643
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,759
Leave no one alive.

644
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:36,799
Yes, sir.

645
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,880
What time is it?

646
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,640
It's about the Hour of Shen.

647
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,000
(Xiao Jinyu)
(This is a plot set up by Nanzhao.)

648
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,319
(I, Chu Chu,)

649
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,440
(and Leng Yue are trying
to gather evidence.)

650
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,950
(Your Majesty, please delay them
for as long as you can.)

651
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,960
(If it reaches the point of no return,)

652
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,360
(I'm willing to stop the conflict
by sacrificing myself.)

653
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,799
(Your Majesty, I only hope)

654
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,850
(that you can protect Commandery Prince
An's Residence and Jing Residence.)

655
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:08,519
(I'm prepared to die for it.)

656
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:09,799
Jinbao.

657
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

658
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:12,680
Make haste.

659
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:14,559
Dispatch the Imperial Guards.

660
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,079
Instruct them to protect
Chu Chu and Leng Yue.

661
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:17,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

662
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,340
(Commandery Prince An's Residence)

663
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,940
(Second Quarter of Hour of You
on the third day)

664
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,920
Chu Chu!

665
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,480
Leng Yue.

666
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,720
I was able to see the body

667
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,630
all thanks to your effort
in delaying Gao Luoqian.

668
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,519
It wasn't You Chen'an after all.

669
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,670
If so, we have to head to the palace
and report it to His Majesty.

670
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,700
I'll head there right now.

671
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,799
Try to get a hold of
the fake You Chen'an's body.

672
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,190
That's the most
crucial piece of evidence.

673
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,440
Okay. I'll take Chen Feng with me
and make haste.

674
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,960
Be careful, okay?

675
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,519
Don't worry.

676
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,580
Your Highness!

677
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,320
Your Highness!

678
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,719
Your Highness!

679
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:18,990
His Highness and Vice Minister Jing
will be executed

680
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,090
at the third quarter of the Hour of Xu.

681
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,910
Follow me to see
His Majesty immediately.

682
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,680
Yes, Your Highness.

683
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,719
Your Highness, watch out!

684
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,199
Who sent you guys here?

685
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,480
Gao Luoqian?

686
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,480
Or Peacock?

687
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,580
This is Commandery
Prince An's Residence.

688
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,870
Are you guys prepared
to face the consequences?

689
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,280
Kill them!

690
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,500
Hurry and escape with Her Highness!

691
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,360
Run!

692
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:24,280
Your Highness!

693
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,639
Run!

694
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:43,760
Wu Jiang!

695
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,960
(Third Quarter of Hour of You on the third day)
The two are to be executed at once.

696
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,440
That is all.

697
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,719
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

698
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,079
Commandery Prince An, Vice Minister Jing,

699
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,199
His Majesty has already done his best.

700
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:11,599
Sir, please tell His Majesty

701
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,039
that we understand.

702
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,440
Run!

703
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,519
Run!

704
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,440
Run!

705
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,520
Lady Jing, please stay.

706
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,960
Under His Majesty's order,

707
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,400
we're to protect you
and Commandery Princess Consort An.

708
00:36:57,559 --> 00:36:58,719
Protect us?

709
00:36:59,330 --> 00:36:59,960
For what reason?

710
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,760
I don't know.

711
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,020
But His Majesty has ordered us
to ensure both of your safety.

712
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:03,719
Our safety?

713
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,470
Have you guys been to
Commandery Prince An's Residence?

714
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,639
We haven't. Initially,
I was planning to head there.

715
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,650
This is bad.

716
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,519
Let's hurry!

717
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:17,480
Your Highness, Vice Minister Jing,

718
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,679
the path ahead has been swept clean.

719
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,920
Later, please depart in peace.

720
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,450
May you two never encounter
such sinister individuals again.

721
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,719
Thank you for everything.

722
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,440
I'm full now.

723
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:34,840
Your Majesty,

724
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:37,639
(Fifth Quarter of Hour of You on the third day)
I'm writing to Nanzhao

725
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,990
to notify our king about your intention
of being on good terms with us.

726
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:42,199
May I know why you summoned me here

727
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,199
urgently?
