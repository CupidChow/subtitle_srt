1
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,330
(Before His Highness entered the temple
to accompany You Chen'an in prayer,)

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,000
(he has done many things for me.)

3
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,679
(He didn't say much to me,)

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,399
(but I could feel his unease.)

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,079
(To be honest, I also feel)

6
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,920
(that You Chen'an's actions are weird.)

7
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,600
(I followed the clues
and looked into it.)

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,090
(Since the day he joined
the Three Judicial Offices,)

9
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,960
(there have been too many oddities.)

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,679
(His Highness is now trapped
in Weiguo Temple.)

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,320
(It's deeply worrying.)

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,960
(You Chen'an,)

13
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,880
(are you the one manipulating the game?)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,960
(This story is entirely fictional.)

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,640
=Episode 17=

32
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,159
Commandery Prince An,
you've pinned a lot of blame on me.

33
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm just a lowly hostage.

34
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,080
I'm not capable of any of that.

35
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,039
I assume you just want to know about

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,840
Nanzhao's next plans and moves
in Great Tang, right?

37
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,390
You could've
gotten straight to the point.

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,599
Why beat around the bush?

39
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,919
Right now, we share a common enemy.

40
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,010
There's no need for us
to lock horns with each other.

41
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,159
Gao Luoqian wants you dead.

42
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,520
But the Three Judicial Offices

43
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,199
can keep you safe in the Great Tang.

44
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,159
We can even send men

45
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,150
to escort you back
to the Nanzhao imperial court.

46
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,280
You and I are alone here
in Weiguo Temple.

47
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,570
Commandery Prince An,

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,919
how can you be sure of my safety?

49
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,080
If it weren't for me,

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,159
you would likely already be dead.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,000
What do you mean by that?

52
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,120
Little master.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,159
Where does the medicinal smell
come from?

54
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,039
Perhaps from the kitchen.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,319
Thank you.

56
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,039
Oh, merciful Buddha.

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,039
Your Highness.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Sorry to disturb you.

59
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,360
Master Wu Nian, you're
boiling so much medicine.

60
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,479
Are many people here ill?

61
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,120
Don't worry, Your Highness.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,919
This is herbal tea.

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,919
Herbal tea?

64
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,360
Master brought this recipe from Nanzhao.

65
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,319
If you drink it during midsummer,
it cools the body, dispels dampness,

66
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,560
and strengthens the stomach.

67
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,960
Was Master Shenguan skilled in medicine?

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,960
Earlier,

69
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,830
when officials from the Ministry of Rites
and foreign envoys came to pay respects,

70
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,680
Master even discussed medicinal theory

71
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,919
with the Nanzhao envoy

72
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,120
and made some improvements
to the recipe.

73
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,880
(Your Highness,)

74
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,319
(a few days ago, I noticed)

75
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,080
(that besides old scars,)

76
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,110
(You Chen'an also has some spots
that haven't faded.)

77
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,480
(He appears to suffer from hives.)

78
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,759
Was the person who discussed medicine
with Master

79
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,920
Vice Envoy Gao?

80
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,839
Yes.

81
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,800
After the tea is brewed,

82
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,560
will it be sent to Second Prince?

83
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,839
Vice Envoy Gao instructed

84
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,279
that once it's ready,

85
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,200
it should be delivered
to Second Prince first.

86
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,319
By now, he should be back in his room
drinking it.

87
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,720
The scented balm you're carrying

88
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,600
is made from spices mixed with herbs.

89
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,480
Smelling it daily helps boost vitality

90
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,000
and relieve colds and itching.

91
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,920
It's commonly used

92
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,199
by those with hives.

93
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,079
During midsummer,

94
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,040
the heat and dampness

95
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,120
easily trigger flare-ups.

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,160
That's why you carry it with you
at all times.

97
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,360
I didn't know

98
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,000
you were so well-versed in incense.

99
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,240
Siler is common in the Guanzhong.

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,959
For ordinary people,

101
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
it's a summer herb
to dispel colds and clear heat.

102
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,680
But once added to tea or soup,

103
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:11,199
for someone with hives like you,

104
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,120
it becomes lethal.

105
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,519
Vice Envoy Gao has truly gone
to great trouble.

106
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Right now, the only person
who wants you alive

107
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,199
is me.

108
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:31,000
Only if you tell me
everything truthfully

109
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,240
can I keep you alive.

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,759
I guarded against everything,

111
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,959
even so, one slip was enough.

112
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,800
I never expected Gao Luoqian
to use such a method against me.

113
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,120
I kept retreating,

114
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,560
and he kept pressing forward.

115
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,759
Then don't blame me for striking back.

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,199
Commandery Prince An,

117
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,879
please come with me

118
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,050
to speak in Master Shenguan's
secret chamber tonight.

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,040
What is it?

120
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,120
His Highness is in danger.
I have to find him.

121
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:28,800
You can't go.

122
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,839
Why not?

123
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,920
Stop keeping me in the dark.

124
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,319
What are you talking about?

125
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,959
Whenever you argued with Jing Yi,

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,519
you were the one who threw him out.

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,680
You never stormed off yourself.

128
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,000
I lost my head in anger, that's all.

129
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,520
You two didn't have an argument.

130
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,080
It was His Highness who ordered you
to stay with me at all times.

131
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,160
He must've sensed something
and made this arrangement in advance.

132
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:50,959
Am I right?

133
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,199
That's not coming from me.

134
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,319
I need to see Jing Yi.

135
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,839
I have to get answers from them.

136
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,959
Chu Chu.

137
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,399
Vice Minister Jing,

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,319
how many times do I have to tell you?

139
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm innocent.

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,839
I'm a good citizen.

141
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,600
How could I be a spy?

142
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,480
So explain it clearly.

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
Why were you there?

144
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,079
Why were you dressed like that?

145
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,160
I wanted to learn acrobatics

146
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,550
and street performance.
What's wrong with that?

147
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
Besides, the Three Judicial Offices

148
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,199
have no rule saying masks are forbidden.

149
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,120
Chu He,

150
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,920
I don't want to believe
you're the mastermind.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,399
But this concerns Great Tang,

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,879
whether it's you or anyone else,

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,079
we won't bend the rules
or let it slide.

154
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,240
Vice Minister Jing,

155
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,600
how does this involve Great Tang?

156
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:39,240
I'm bad with words,
I can't explain it clearly.

157
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,639
I want to see my sister.

158
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,079
You won't be seeing Chu Chu.

159
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,000
In a couple of days,

160
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,090
your brother-in-law will explain
everything to you.

161
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,639
He.

162
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,240
Chu!

163
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,120
He.

164
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,959
I'm here, Chu.

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,319
It was urgent.

166
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,120
I couldn't stop her.

167
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,079
Explain to Vice Minister Jing for me.

168
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,680
I was wrongly accused.

169
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,000
Jing Yi, something's wrong
with You Chen'an.

170
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,040
His Highness is in danger.

171
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,800
His Highness already had his suspicions
before going to Weiguo Temple.

172
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:10,319
The Peacock case isn't settled yet,
and now it's one thing after another.

173
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,279
Peacock?

174
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,319
You Chen'an?

175
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,560
How could anything be wrong with An?

176
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,160
He,

177
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,120
you know something, don't you?

178
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,720
His Highness is in danger right now.

179
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,690
If you keep hiding the truth,
it'll be too late.

180
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,120
That peacock mask

181
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,360
was given by You Chen'an.

182
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:37,090
If there's anything you need help with,
just say the word.

183
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
On my way back,

184
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,159
I arranged for some men
to protect me in secret.

185
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,159
But I can't show myself.

186
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,279
If I do,

187
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:46,320
Gao Luoqian will be onto me at once.

188
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,440
So

189
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,679
I need you to meet them

190
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,360
for me.

191
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Tell them my return route
so they can prepare in advance.

192
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,720
No problem.

193
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,799
Leave it to me.

194
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,159
This mask

195
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,879
is the signal.

196
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,639
When the time comes,

197
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,720
put it on

198
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,000
and give them their orders.

199
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,679
Chu,

200
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,240
this mustn't be mentioned to anyone.

201
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,960
Otherwise,

202
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,360
my life will be at stake.

203
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,240
All right.

204
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,200
I won't say a word.

205
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,159
I won't tell a soul.

206
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,399
My life

207
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,480
is in your hands, Chu.

208
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,000
I can't just stand by and watch him

209
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,519
be killed by his own brother.

210
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,960
He also said

211
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,480
that if this got out,

212
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,799
it wouldn't just be him,

213
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,720
everyone who knows this
would be silenced.

214
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,320
I didn't want to drag you all into this,

215
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,759
so I didn't speak up.

216
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,440
Jing Yi.

217
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,919
I'm heading to Weiguo Temple now.

218
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,720
Yue,

219
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,000
stay with Chu Chu.

220
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,159
Don't leave her side.

221
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,120
I know.

222
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,320
Be careful.

223
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:01,080
Don't be impulsive.

224
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,519
General,

225
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:17,240
this is a routine patrol.

226
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,679
Why did you come in person?

227
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,159
Earlier, there were signs of spy activities in this area.

228
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,080
Since General Xie passed away,

229
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,679
and I took on the post of
Annan Great General,

230
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,840
I haven't been at ease.

231
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,650
So I trouble you all

232
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,380
to patrol with me and eliminate
any hidden threats along the border.

233
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:33,919
Yes.

234
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,159
Soldiers, stay alert!

235
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:35,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

236
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,799
Second Prince.

237
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,840
Knockout smoke.

238
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,360
You Chen'an.

239
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,399
You Chen'an.

240
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:35,559
You Chen'an!

241
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,360
His Highness!

242
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,279
His Highness.

243
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,279
What's going on?

244
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,159
You Chen'an.

245
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,559
Stop right there.

246
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:08,679
Who is there?

247
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,120
General,

248
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,080
we're hunters from the Great Tang.

249
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,759
We've just brought down some game.

250
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,559
Hunting at this hour?

251
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:17,919
The mountain roads are rough,

252
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,600
so

253
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,240
we were delayed for several hours.

254
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,039
General, why is there
that strange smell again?

255
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:27,919
They look like

256
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,720
the people we lost last time.

257
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,080
General.

258
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,039
This...

259
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,559
General, you...

260
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,240
Speak.

261
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:48,399
What is being transported in the cart?

262
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,480
It's game, General.

263
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,480
It truly is game.

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,919
Search it.

265
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,120
Draw your swords.

266
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,639
You two, withdraw separately.

267
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,120
Go report to the Jiaozhou Prefecture
at once.

268
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:06,759
- Yes.
- Yes.

269
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,080
General!

270
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,559
Please don't kill me, General.

271
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,120
General.

272
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,519
Please don't kill me, General.

273
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:51,279
Please don't kill me, General!

274
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,480
Please don't kill me.

275
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,120
Speak.

276
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,120
- Please don't kill me.
- Who are you working for?

277
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,240
Xiao Jinli?

278
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,279
Why are you here?

279
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,559
Chu Chu was worried about you.

280
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,919
We still failed to avoid this.

281
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,639
I saved him once today.

282
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,799
I never thought he'd still die here.

283
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,440
This is clearly a trap set in advance

284
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,120
meant to lure you in.

285
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,520
It's been planned for a long time.

286
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,600
Whoever set this up

287
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,919
is very likely trying to drag me down.

288
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:01,639
One meditation room, you and I alive,

289
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,600
and You Chen'an dead.

290
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,879
There's no way
we could explain ourselves.

291
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
Nanzhao has evil intentions.

292
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:11,480
They actually use a prince as bait.

293
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,080
Hurry up.

294
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:13,960
Quick.

295
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,720
Arrest them at once.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,679
But

297
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,200
those two inside are...

298
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
This can't be covered up.

299
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,620
No matter who they are,

300
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,120
they must be investigated by law.

301
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:40,720
Yes.

302
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,159
Come with me.

303
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,519
Have you found out

304
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
why Jing Yi was there?

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,080
Not yet.

306
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,720
But we did confirm

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,679
that You Chen'an didn't die
from the tea we prepared.

308
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:04,120
He was killed by an arrow.

309
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,919
Killed by an arrow?

310
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,840
Since the blame has already been thrown

311
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,440
onto Xiao Jinyu and Jing Yi,

312
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,320
their guilt must be sealed.

313
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,320
The stage has been set,

314
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,039
we'll just carry this play

315
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,360
all the way through.

316
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:51,600
Your Highness.

317
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,000
Your Highness.

318
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,919
We can't afford to take the blame
for killing Second Prince of Nanzhao.

319
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,559
Our heads would roll.

320
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,400
The enemy is in the shadows,
and we're in the open.

321
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,640
The situation is unclear.

322
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,640
Don't lose your head.

323
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,640
You said

324
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,559
Chu Chu said I was in danger

325
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
and sent you to save me?

326
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,400
You two truly are husband and wife.

327
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,599
Your conclusions

328
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,480
matched perfectly.

329
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,720
Chu Chu said You Chen'an was suspicious.

330
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,079
She even forced the truth

331
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,480
out of your brother-in-law.

332
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,000
She...

333
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,980
Don't blame me for that.

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,090
And don't blame Yue either.

335
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,960
Chu Chu's been around you for too long.

336
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,100
She's learned how to trick people.

337
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,440
Yue is the worst liar.

338
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,160
Chu Chu coaxed it out of her.

339
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,640
Why are you panicking?

340
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,839
What I meant to ask

341
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,720
was what Chu Chu got out of Chu He.

342
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,799
Chu He said

343
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,480
You Chen'an told him to impersonate
the Peacock

344
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
to pass messages.

345
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,799
If You Chen'an wanted
the message delivered,

346
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,519
he wouldn't have chosen Chu He.

347
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,160
He used him
only to draw the attention

348
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,640
of the Three Judicial Offices.

349
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,960
If You Chen'an was the Peacock,

350
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
then he controlled

351
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,400
the largest spy network
Nanzhao planted within the Great Tang.

352
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,200
Who would have the nerve and the ability

353
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:11,279
to set up such an intricate plot,

354
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,480
kill him, and frame you at the same time?

355
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:15,920
No idea.

356
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,240
The person behind this
is trying to force me into the game.

357
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,079
Currently, we can't see

358
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,000
the whole picture yet.

359
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,880
Your Majesty,

360
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,039
this is all that I witnessed.

361
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,240
The witness is here.

362
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
Commandery Prince An's motive is clear.

363
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,519
What doubts do Your Majesty have?

364
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,799
Commandery Prince An

365
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,519
was merely carrying out his duty.

366
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,119
There was no personal grudge
against You Chen'an.

367
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,119
As for rumors on the streets,

368
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,079
they grow from exaggeration.

369
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,319
They're not worth trusting.

370
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,920
Your Majesty, are you saying that

371
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,359
to shield the murderer?

372
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,319
Insolence!

373
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,319
What?

374
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,519
You Chen'an is dead?

375
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,359
His Highness and Jing Yi
have been arrested?

376
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,759
What exactly happened?

377
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,680
I heard from Leng Baichuan
that a monk at the temple

378
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,950
saw His Highness and Vice Minister Jing
kill You Chen'an.

379
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,079
The rest is still unclear.

380
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,000
The cause of You Chen'an's death

381
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,599
hasn't yet been investigated.

382
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,720
How can you convict someone
based on mere suspicion?

383
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,359
I've ordered the Capital Prefecture
to investigate immediately.

384
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,519
Once there's a result,

385
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,440
Nanzhao and you will be informed.

386
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,000
At that time,

387
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,990
only Commandery Prince An,
Vice Minister Jing,

388
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,039
and Second Prince
were inside the meditation room.

389
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,799
Could the killer have appeared
out of thin air?

390
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,400
I know

391
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Your Majesty favors those two.

392
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,480
But if I don't demand an explanation,

393
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:47,319
I fear I would have no shame
facing the people of Nanzhao

394
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:49,359
and our king.

395
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,720
The laws of the Great Tang are strict.

396
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,559
Even princes aren't exempt.

397
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:55,960
If it's proven

398
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,000
that Xiao Jinyu

399
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:57,599
and Jing Yi

400
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:58,839
are the killers,

401
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I will punish them
according to the law.

402
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,200
Vice Envoy Gao,

403
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,319
this case involves grave interests.

404
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,480
It can't be settled hastily.

405
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,079
Vice Envoy Gao,

406
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,400
you should've minced your words.

407
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,480
Indeed.

408
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,480
Second Prince

409
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:20,960
cared deeply for peace.

410
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,680
Vice Envoy Gao,

411
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,680
you should keep that in mind

412
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,079
and not let this matter harm
the harmony between our states.

413
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,519
Then I ask Your Majesty
to set a deadline.

414
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,759
Don't make me

415
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,240
and Second Prince wait.

416
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,799
The day after tomorrow.

417
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:43,880
At the hour of You.

418
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,440
After sunset,

419
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:46,559
the Great Tang

420
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,119
will uncover the true culprit.

421
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,119
And if there's still no conclusion?

422
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,359
What do you propose?

423
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,759
Then it must mean
Commandery Prince An and Vice Minister Jing

424
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,210
are covering for each other
and refusing to speak the truth.

425
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,640
By the Great Tang law,

426
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,319
anyone who plots against royal blood,

427
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,200
principal or accomplice,

428
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,119
must pay with their life.

429
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,200
Approved.

430
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,119
(At the hour of Chen on the same day)

431
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,799
Thank you, Your Majesty.

432
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,559
Second Prince,

433
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,799
please rest assured.

434
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,960
His Majesty has promised

435
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,440
that the culprit will not go unpunished!

436
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,039
- Greetings, Consort Hui.
- Greetings, Consort Hui.

437
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,660
(At the hour of Shen on the same day)

438
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,640
Rise.

439
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,599
Two silly girls.

440
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,200
Why didn't you come to me
when something this serious happened?

441
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,160
Chu Chu said

442
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,960
this involved court affairs

443
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,920
and didn't wish to trouble
Your Highness.

444
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,559
You're too considerate.

445
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,500
Commandery Prince An and Jing Yi
have fallen into trouble.

446
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:10,190
There's no telling

447
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,630
that there won't be people
who fawn on the powerful

448
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,840
will come looking for trouble.

449
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,599
It's my duty to protect the families
of court officials.

450
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,920
If you need anything, just let me know.

451
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,319
Your Highness,

452
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,119
I wish to examine You Chen'an's body

453
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,519
and find out how he died.

454
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,319
You may be a coroner,

455
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,319
but you're also Princess Consort An.

456
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,680
There are things other coroners
could do,

457
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:33,519
but if you do, it'll only give others
something to talk about.

458
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,279
Do you understand?

459
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,510
Thank you for the reminder,
Your Highness.

460
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:45,519
Still,

461
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:46,880
the two of you

462
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,720
are Commandery Princess Consort An
and Lady Jing.

463
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,720
Visiting your husbands

464
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,440
is only proper by law and reason.

465
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,519
Really?

466
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,079
Can we visit Jing Yi and His Highness?

467
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,240
But does His Majesty know?

468
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,000
Will this cause trouble
for Your Highness?

469
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,519
If His Majesty hadn't agreed,

470
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,640
how would I dare decide this on my own?

471
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,440
Go without worry.

472
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,839
Thank you, Your Highness.

473
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,440
Let's go.

474
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:23,580
(At the hour of You on the same day)

475
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,160
Your Highness.

476
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,039
Why are you here?

477
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:34,839
Your Highness,

478
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,839
Consort Hui said that His Majesty
gave his tacit consent for our visit.

479
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,640
Are you all right?

480
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,680
I'm fine.

481
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,519
My dear!

482
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,340
It's from the Guangtai House, right?

483
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,590
I can tell the moment I smell it.

484
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,359
I even dream about this.

485
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,480
You're dreaming about food

486
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,279
when you're in prison?

487
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,400
Quick.

488
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,839
I'll do it.

489
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,319
My dear,

490
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,599
it's not that bad.

491
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,079
It's almost comfortable.

492
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,319
Usually,

493
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,160
I'm running off my feet.

494
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,799
I can finally put my feet up,

495
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,920
eat when I want,
and sleep when I want.

496
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,150
It's a life like an immortal's.

497
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,839
What kind of immortal's life.

498
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,319
It's all my fault.

499
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,480
I failed to notice the danger
and caused all this.

500
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,759
Has anyone taken the chance

501
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,920
to make trouble for you?

502
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,799
Don't worry.

503
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,319
With everyone
in the Commandery Prince An's mansion

504
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,599
and the Three Judicial Offices

505
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,119
working together,

506
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,400
no one can bully us.

507
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,839
It's you

508
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:54,960
who's suffering here.

509
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,319
Why are you looking at me?

510
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,400
Eat.

511
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,720
Just looking at you
is enough to satisfy me.

512
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,759
Smooth talker.

513
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,920
Move back a bit.

514
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:23,440
Aren't you always sharp?

515
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,119
How did you get yourself into this?

516
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,119
Are you going to give up
the great name of Vice Minister Jing?

517
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,160
Don't worry.

518
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:33,559
I promise

519
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:35,839
I won't drag down Heroine Leng's reputation

520
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,319
in the martial world.

521
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,279
What do you mean?

522
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,039
I'm warning you.

523
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,000
Don't go thinking anything silly.

524
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,319
If you pull some trick behind my back,

525
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
believe it or not,

526
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
I won't forgive you,
even in the next life.

527
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,079
All right.

528
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,160
Your Highness,

529
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:02,920
what exactly happened last night?

530
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,519
We didn't kill You Chen'an.

531
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,759
I went over everything

532
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,640
from beginning to end,

533
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,279
and finally found a clue.

534
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,519
It all happened too suddenly.

535
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,560
I only had time

536
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,080
to take some ash from the incense burner
in the meditation room.

537
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,640
It smells like Knockout Herb.

538
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,559
You recognize it?

539
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,960
I remember it was recorded in
"Classic of the Meteria Medica"

540
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,839
that Leng Yue once gave me.

541
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,359
When this herb is mixed into incense
and burned,

542
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,200
the smoke puts people into a deep sleep.

543
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,319
Your Highness, could this have been
Gao Luoqian's doing?

544
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:44,720
Not necessarily.

545
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,279
Early on, Gao Luoqian

546
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:48,039
attempted to drug You Chen'an.

547
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,000
He had Master Shenguan alter the recipe

548
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,400
for the temple's summer herbal tea.

549
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,519
If that's the case,

550
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,160
judging by both the cause of death
and the timing,

551
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,599
a simple examination

552
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,559
and a few questions for the monks

553
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,980
would be enough to prove
that you had nothing to do with it.

554
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,480
So the killing trap Gao Luoqian set

555
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:12,279
was never meant
to be a flawless frame-up

556
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:13,519
against me.

557
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,599
Second Prince.

558
00:27:17,079 --> 00:27:17,759
Second Prince.

559
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,079
If the herbal tea
hadn't been discovered,

560
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,039
and you hadn't stopped
You Chen'an in time,

561
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,279
what would've happened?

562
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,559
It wouldn't affect ordinary people much.

563
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,279
But for something with hives
like You Chen'an,

564
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,440
it would've been fatal.

565
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,599
His goal

566
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,839
was to make sure You Chen'an died
in the temple.

567
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,039
That's all.

568
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,680
But the motive that night

569
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,799
was completely different.

570
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,839
You Chen'an.

571
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,039
The trigger of this mechanism
was tied to You Chen'an.

572
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Once he moved

573
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,119
and pulled the line,

574
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,839
the crossbow would fire.

575
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,710
The knockout incense was placed
in such an obvious spot

576
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,880
on purpose as to make sure
you'd notice it.

577
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,720
It was meant to use your kindness
to kill someone.

578
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,759
Utterly vicious.

579
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,559
You're right.

580
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,400
The herbal tea during the day
was aimed only at You Chen'an.

581
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,160
The second trap at night

582
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,920
wasn't meant for him alone.

583
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:58,880
Exactly.

584
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,400
You Chen'an was already unconscious
at that time.

585
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,440
Killing him would've been effortless.

586
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:05,920
So

587
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:08,279
the true target of that mechanism

588
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,160
was you.

589
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,480
The killer wanted You Chen'an dead,

590
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,880
and you framed at the same time.

591
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,720
That's killing two birds with one stone.

592
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,559
Who else would kill You Chen'an?

593
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,359
The only person from Nanzhao

594
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,759
who could pull this off in Chang'an

595
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,720
is no one but Peacock.

596
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,160
Do you remember
when we interrogated Chang Shou?

597
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,079
He said

598
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,400
the only proof of the Peacock's identity

599
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,519
was the mask.

600
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,839
Exactly the same.

601
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:45,839
Chu He confessed

602
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,640
that this mask was given to him
personally by You Chen'an.

603
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,440
Based on these clues,

604
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,400
You Chen'an is Peacock.

605
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,319
Are you saying

606
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,759
You Chen'an planned his own death?

607
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,440
It sounds unbelievable.

608
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,720
But based on my examination
of the scene,

609
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,920
there were no traces of anyone else.

610
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,400
And it fits the theory.

611
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,000
But why would he do that?

612
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,400
I was about to expose

613
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,920
his identity as Peacock.

614
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,640
So he tried to frame me.

615
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,440
That makes sense.

616
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,440
But stepping into the trap himself

617
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,519
is far too high a price to pay.

618
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,559
He doesn't care that deeply
about Nanzhao.

619
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,720
If he wanted to fake his death and
slip away, that would make more sense.

620
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,119
What if

621
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,400
You Chen'an isn't dead?

622
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Didn't you see him dead
with your own eyes?

623
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,279
I've seen cases in the records.

624
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,440
Death can be faked.

625
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:48,400
Yes.

626
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,559
You're right.

627
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,599
Under certain conditions,

628
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,400
a person's breathing and heartbeat

629
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,960
can completely stop for a set time,

630
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,359
just like real death.

631
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,839
As long as the person is saved in time,
both breathing and heartbeat

632
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,920
can be restored.

633
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:03,960
Nanzhao is rich
in rare herbs and plants.

634
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,200
And You Chen'an knew coroner's skills.

635
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,319
With careful planning,

636
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,240
he could've fooled me
and everyone in the Capital Prefecture,

637
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,240
even in such a rushed situation.

638
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:16,200
After that, once his body
was sent back to the relay station,

639
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,799
he could come back to life.

640
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,119
Right.

641
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,720
Then I need to examine
You Chen'an's body.

642
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,480
But the Three Judicial Offices
don't have investigative authority now.

643
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,079
We'll have to think of another way.

644
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,759
Commandery Prince An.

645
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:36,640
Princess Consort An.

646
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:38,279
It's time to go.

647
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,000
Remember to eat on time.

648
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,359
Wait for me.

649
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,559
Take care of yourself.

650
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,380
(Prefect's Residence)

651
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,660
(Luo Yan,
Chief of Mount Zhenyuan Abode)

652
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:17,920
Chief.

653
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,359
Has Liu Shijiang returned yet?

654
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,279
Not yet.

655
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:23,160
But I heard the Prefect's wife
isn't feeling well.

656
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,710
Prefect Liu should be on his way back
once he gets the message.

657
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,160
This is bad.

658
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:46,400
Xiao Jinli.

659
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,519
Do you not recognize me?

660
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,559
Chief Luo,

661
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,640
why is it you?

662
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,920
Why don't you let him go before we talk?

663
00:32:58,790 --> 00:32:59,519
Sorry about that.

664
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:01,480
Tietou,

665
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:03,359
go boil his medicine.

666
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,880
I prepare his medicine?

667
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,400
Hurry.

668
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,519
You were fast.

669
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,519
You've almost recovered?

670
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:22,160
Don't worry.

671
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:23,480
This is Mount Zhenyuan Abode.

672
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,759
Everyone here are is our own people.

673
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,880
How did I end up here?

674
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,970
I heard you were coming to Jiaozhou
to take up your post,

675
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,920
so I wanted to see you
before you assumed office,

676
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,850
so you wouldn't get pushed around
as a newcomer.

677
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,160
Who knew

678
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,119
a group of hunters

679
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,559
would have the audacity?

680
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,799
When I arrived that night,

681
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,599
you were already fighting.

682
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,160
Soldiers,

683
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:46,559
charge!

684
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,119
- Yes!
- Yes!

685
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,480
Those hunters

686
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,079
abandoned their companion's body,

687
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:52,839
dragged the cart, and fled.

688
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:55,500
I was worried it might be an ambush,

689
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,400
so I didn't chase them.

690
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,359
General Xiao.

691
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,240
Xiao Jinli.

692
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,519
But why would a group of hunters

693
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,480
try to kill you?

694
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,719
They weren't ordinary hunters.

695
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,119
They were from Nanzhao.

696
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,990
And what they were transporting
wasn't game.

697
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,119
It was corpses.

698
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,159
Most likely the Great Tang civilians

699
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,559
they had murdered.

700
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,800
Nanzhao people?

701
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,960
Now that you mention it,
their way of killing was indeed strange.

702
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,770
That forest is right on the border
between Nanzhao and the Great Tang.

703
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:30,360
Nanzhao bandits often sneak in.

704
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:31,719
Say,

705
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,679
my soldiers...

706
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:38,840
I...

707
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
I arrived too late.

708
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,719
I only managed to save you.

709
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,960
Thank you.

710
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,320
No need to thank me.

711
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,960
You saved me once before.

712
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,360
We're even.

713
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:00,880
By the way,

714
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,559
the people you sent with the letter

715
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,519
arrived safely
at the Prefect's Residence.

716
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,090
As for what happened after that,

717
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,800
people like us can't really find out.

718
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:14,840
Guo.

719
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,360
Chief.

720
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,760
It's so late.
Are you taking your granny out?

721
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,679
It's dark. Don't fall.

722
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,258
(Guo, a subject of Jiaozhou)
I'm walking with Granny

723
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:26,800
(Guo, a subject of Jiaozhou)
to help her digest.

724
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,199
Chief, don't worry.

725
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,599
I'll hold on to her.

726
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,000
Well, well.

727
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,320
What a clever girl.

728
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,280
Don't go too far.

729
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,280
Let's go, Granny.

730
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,920
all right.

731
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,800
Let's go.

732
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:43,320
Be careful.

733
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,199
We will.

734
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,159
This abode

735
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,880
is also a refuge for the local people.

736
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,440
Just a few more mouths to feed.

737
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,599
It's nothing.

738
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,639
So

739
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,639
one more person eating here
makes no difference.

740
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,760
Just rest and recover.

741
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,300
You can leave after you're well.

742
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,679
I've brought you a lot of trouble.

743
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,210
I should head back as soon as possible.

744
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,920
The court is probably searching
for me by now.

745
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,079
But the remaining poison in your body
hasn't been cleared yet.

746
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,039
If you leave like this,

747
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,199
what if

748
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,559
something happens on the road?

749
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,639
You were attacked
on the way to Jiaozhou.

750
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:34,039
It's possible someone doesn't want you
to enter the city.

751
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,599
Right.

752
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:47,141
(At the hour of Yin on the second day)

753
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,039
Warden.

754
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,790
Your Highness,
have you made up your mind?

755
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,920
This matter hasn't fully concluded.

756
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:58,000
Why the rush?

757
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,840
Your Highness.

758
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,519
Please

759
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:03,079
present this missive to His Majesty.

760
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:03,920
Your Highness!

761
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,360
Yes.

762
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:10,960
Your Highness,

763
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,280
you're resigning your title
and leaving the Three Judicial Offices.

764
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,079
This may not be
what His Majesty wishes to see.

765
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,950
We can't strip the Three Judicial Offices

766
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,639
of their authority
to investigate the case on my account.
