(The scars on that corpse)

2
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:16,640
(are far different from You Chen'an's.)

3
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,900
(The one who died
was indeed not You Chen'an.)

(His Highness and Jing Yi)

to immediate execution.)

the Commandery Prince's Mansion,)

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,039
(intent on silencing me for good.)

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,200
(Wu Jiang died protecting me.)

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,439
(The mansion ran with blood.)

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,399
(How many more lives
must be sacrificed before)

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,960
(Nanzhao's ruthless ambition ends?)

13

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,360
(This story is entirely fictional.)

30
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,040
=Episode 19=

31
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,439
Summon

32
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,560
the Commandery Princess Consort An.

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,240
Wu Jiang!

34
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,199
Chu Chu.

35
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,680
Leave this to me. Go.

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,719
Why are you...

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,039
Your Majesty.

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,039
This case is in doubt.

39
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,759
The dead is not You Chen'an.

40
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,159
Commandery Princess Consort An.

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,680
What do you mean?

42
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,759
Your Majesty.

43
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,199
In the meditation chamber
at Weiguo Temple,

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,790
there is a secret passageway
to a small shrine outside the city.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,560
Inside are two sets
of very similar footprints.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,240
One belongs to You Chen'an.

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,199
The other

48
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,719
belongs to the true victim.

49
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,319
Before the incident,

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,919
the victim had lived
in the passageway for days.

51
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:47,199
From the living traces,

52
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,360
it coincides with the time

53
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,760
when Nanzhao's chief envoy
proposed entering Weiguo Temple.

54
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:55,400
The mechanisms were set by You Chen'an,

55
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,759
but the one meant to die

56
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,520
was the stand-in hidden here.

57
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,680
He lured the man out,

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,520
then knocked him out with incense.

59
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,599
He calculated the angles,

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,240
set the crossbow,

61
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,039
and ran the trigger beneath
the victim's wrist.

62
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,399
He then slipped away,

63
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,160
escaping through the passageway.

64
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,439
So,

65
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,279
You Chen'an is still alive?

66
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,120
Yes.

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,920
But he has fled for days.

68
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,360
In that time,

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,920
has he been silenced by someone
who knew the truth?

70
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,519
Absurd!

71
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,720
To evade your guilt,

72
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,600
you would invent such a laughable claim.

73
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,350
If this spreads,

74
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,760
are you not afraid of being mocked
by neighboring states?

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,360
Nanzhao will never accept such mockery.

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,040
Jiang Daohai.

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,560
Here, Your Majesty.

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Has the Capital Prefecture verified what

79
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,040
the Commandery Princess Consort An said?

80
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
Reporting to Your Majesty.

81
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,000
Deputy Prefect of the Capital,

82
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,000
Leng Baichuan did take part
in the investigation this morning,

83
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,519
and found some traces,

84
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,360
but no conclusive evidence.

85
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,950
Commandery Princess Consort An.

86
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:40,560
Lady Jing is desperate
to save her husband,

87
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,439
yet without proof,

88
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,720
you fabricate

89
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,439
such a shocking tale out of thin air.

90
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,199
It is impossible for me to believe it.

91
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,720
Who says there is no evidence?

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,980
When I went to the inn today
to pay my respects,

93
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,319
by chance,

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,720
I saw old scars on the corpse.

95
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,160
At the scars,

96
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,920
there was clear stagnation
of qi and blood,

97
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,879
leaving marks from blocked meridians.

98
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,800
The marks spread outward,

99
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,120
like blood obstruction.

100
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,439
This is a sign
of severe scarring disorder.

101
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,759
This condition is congenital.

102
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:13,879
Even minor skin injury,

103
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,240
or an insect bite,

104
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:16,439
can easily cause

105
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,879
such distinct scars.

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,319
What is strange about
Second Prince having this condition?

107
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
Or the Commandery Princess Consort An

108
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,879
has seen the real
Second Prince's body yourself?

109
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
I have.

110
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,959
When You Chen'an studied forensic skills
at the Three Judicial Offices,

111
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,120
he often bared
his upper body for practice.

112
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,519
That was nothing unusual.

113
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,199
Moreover,

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,439
the scars on the corpse
were still faintly red,

115
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,000
indicating recent injury.

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,360
You...

117
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,260
Besides this,
I have another piece of evidence,

118
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,000
to prove the dead man's
identity at once.

119
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,439
I ask Your Majesty to allow
the presentation of physical evidence.

120
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Granted.

121
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,660
Commandery Princess Consort An.

122
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,040
This is...

123
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,860
When I went to pay my respects,

124
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,090
I brought a bouquet of flowers.

125
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,120
By chance,

126
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,759
the dead man's hand

127
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,519
was stained with balsam juice,

128
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,399
and inadvertently,

129
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,720
it transferred onto my sleeve,

130
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:08,879
leaving this fingerprint.

131
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,759
Coincidentally, when You Chen'an
was at the Three Judicial Offices,

132
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,240
he also left fingerprints.

133
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,260
(You Chen'an)

134
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,480
These are for your future use

135
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:22,279
as protective clothing in the mortuary.

136
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,360
Thank you.

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,680
Here.

138
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,519
Another handprint is needed here.

139
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,560
Another handprint?

140
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,590
Those are the rules
of the Three Judicial Offices.

141
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,720
All items issued within proper limits

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,720
for official duties

143
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,360
how many, what items,

144
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,560
and their purpose must be recorded.

145
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,680
Commandery Prince An
was indeed thorough.

146
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,040
(You Chen'an)
A person's fingerprints never change.

147
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,959
Second Prince of Nanzhao
has rare reverse whorl patterns.

148
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,000
A comparison alone will prove it.

149
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,079
The dead man at the inn
was not the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

150
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,519
Of course,

151
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,360
Vice Envoy Gao
would not accept my evidence.

152
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,160
So,

153
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,279
I asked Lady Jing to go to your inn,

154
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,879
to await Your Majesty's order,

155
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,490
to collect the corpse's fingerprints.

156
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,160
If Commandery Princess Consort An
had such insight,

157
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,920
why not present it earlier?

158
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,439
Now it is too late.

159
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,040
Your Majesty,

160
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,480
by the rites of the Nanzhao court,

161
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,200
the rites for Second Prince
were completed this morning.

162
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,559
By this hour,

163
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,799
the cremation

164
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,480
should already be done.

165
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,639
You burned the body?

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,639
We did so for harmony
between our states.

167
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,480
I wish more than anyone
that the chief envoy were still alive.

168
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,080
If Great Tang can produce proof,

169
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,799
Nanzhao will not oppose Great Tang.

170
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,470
Vice Envoy Gao makes it sound easy.

171
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
The body has been destroyed.

172
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,200
Unless I bring You Chen'an

173
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,679
before you alive,

174
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,000
what other proof could there be?

175
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,159
So please, Commandery Princess Consort An,

176
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,240
spare no effort and find him,

177
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,840
no matter where he is.

178
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,200
According to
the Commandery Princess Consort An,

179
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,559
if the one who left
truly was Second Prince,

180
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,960
then by now he should
have gone south out of the city.

181
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,320
Why not send a group
to search the south?

182
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,279
But Your Majesty
and I agreed on a deadline,

183
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
and the time is now up.

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,720
I fear...

185
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:39,140
(Eighth Quarter of Hour of Si
on the third day)

186
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,799
No need for shackles.

187
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,159
You two.

188
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,790
Please step out and board the carriage.

189
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,639
Thank you for the kindness.

190
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,120
Proceed by the law...

191
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:50,919
You're innocent.

192
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
Nanzhao has gone too far.

193
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,600
Though I cannot save your lives,

194
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,279
I will not let you

195
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,519
suffer humiliation.

196
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,200
Shackles and the execution blade
are not a disgrace,

197
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,679
but proof that records
our honor for posterity.

198
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,440
Please.

199
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,919
Vice envoy of Nanzhao, how do you prove

200
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,200
that the body you burned

201
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,879
was Second Prince?

202
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,200
Second Prince died
in the temple before all eyes.

203
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,720
What proof is still needed?

204
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Originally,

205
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,840
there was no dispute.

206
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
But now,

207
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,840
the identity of the dead is in doubt.

208
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,039
Great Tang law is founded on
law for all under heaven,

209
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,759
thus creating an age of clear justice.

210
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,399
Imperial power may not
overstep the courts.

211
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,540
According to the Great Tang laws,
under the provisions of On Adjudicating Cases,

212
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:01,039
this matter constitutes
a case of doubtful guilt.

213
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,000
Senior Jing is right.

214
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,600
The laws of Great Tang
stand above the Emperor's word.

215
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,639
At present, even I

216
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:09,799
cannot sentence
the Commandery Prince An to death.

217
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,440
Senior Jing.

218
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,519
As for this doubtful crime,

219
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,000
how should it be ruled?

220
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,279
At most, a doubtful crime is redeemed
with 120 jin of copper.

221
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,679
For the Jing family,

222
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,000
though it would ruin us,

223
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,200
I

224
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,519
will still do his utmost to pay
the copper for my son and His Highness.

225
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,679
You are abusing power to oppress us.

226
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,720
Our Second Prince of Nanzhao
died unjustly in Great Tang.

227
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,559
And now you mean
to settle this with a fine.

228
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,639
Senior Jing.

229
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,360
You...

230
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,919
You are insulting Nanzhao.

231
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,600
It seems conflict between our states
is unavoidable.

232
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,360
I will report this to our King at once.

233
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,480
Vice Envoy Gao.

234
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,559
The matter is not yet clear.

235
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,679
There is no final ruling.

236
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,080
Why rush to report it?

237
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,799
With all this evasion,
who knows when it will be resolved.

238
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,290
Commandery Princess Consort An.

239
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,679
Do you have a definite deadline
for the investigation?

240
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Send the death squads.

241
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,799
Leave no survivors.

242
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,120
Chu Chu.

243
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,519
Leave this to me. Go.

244
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,690
Quickly send the Commandery
Princess Consort An back to the manor.

245
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

246
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,639
Your Majesty.

247
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,250
In Commandery Princess Consort An
current condition,

248
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,519
she likely cannot investigate further.

249
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Does Your Majesty intend

250
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,080
to keep me and Second Prince
waiting any longer?

251
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,240
Great Tang
has no shortage of capable men.

252
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,320
The true culprit
will not escape justice.

253
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,280
Take the suspects back
to the Court of Judicial Review.

254
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,080
Your Majesty.

255
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,840
Jinbao.

256
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,879
Escort Vice Envoy Gao back to the inn.

257
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,240
See to him properly.

258
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,159
Yes.

259
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,879
Guards.

260
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,799
Vice Envoy Gao.

261
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,039
This way.

262
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,399
An imperial oral decree.

263
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,000
An imperial oral decree.

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,980
An imperial oral decree.

265
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,559
His Majesty withdraws the order.

266
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,679
Judgment postponed.

267
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:29,519
I obey the decree.

268
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,320
Remove the shackles at once.

269
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,120
Your Highness, I told you
we are hard to kill.

270
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,519
We always find a way out.

271
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,380
Did Commandery Princess Consort An
have an audience with His Majesty?

272
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,190
Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,540
Commandery Princess Consort An
found proof

274
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,380
that Second Prince
of Nanzhao faked his death.

275
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,390
Where is the Princess Consort?

276
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,840
Why did she not come with you?

277
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
The Princess...

278
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,690
The Commandery Princess Consort An...

279
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,639
She...

280
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,120
Chu Chu.

281
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,600
Leng Yue.

282
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:12,720
Hold on a little longer.

283
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,360
Physician Qi will be here soon.

284
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,440
Does it hurt?

285
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,519
It is just a minor wound.

286
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:26,720
It is nothing.

287
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,290
This is my fault.

288
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,679
Do not say that.

289
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,200
Women protecting women

290
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:36,799
is only right.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,960
Before,

292
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,120
you said the same.

293
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:44,519
But I failed to protect you.

294
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,440
Do not be sad.

295
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,360
You saved me.

296
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,799
You are a heroine.

297
00:14:58,879 --> 00:14:59,720
Chu Chu.

298
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:02,960
Chu Chu.

299
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,799
Physician Qi.

300
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,240
The imperial physicians
have examined her in turns.

301
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,480
They only found signs of poisoning.

302
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,399
Nothing else is clear.

303
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,390
Chu Chu has taken a ginseng pill
to sustain her breath.

304
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,600
Any external injuries?

305
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,480
When I changed her clothes,

306
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,600
I found none.

307
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,360
Near the heart meridian,
the silver needle turned black.

308
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,200
It is a deadly poison.

309
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,720
Deadly poison?

310
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,890
The Imperial Medical Bureau,
the Three Judicial Offices, the mansion,

311
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,080
all have antidote pills.

312
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,600
Physician Qi, tell me what is needed.

313
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,550
I will fetch it at once.

314
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,519
Lady Jing, do not panic.

315
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,679
We must first find
the source of the poison.

316
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,159
In this emergency,

317
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,480
I

318
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
can only use extraordinary means.

319
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,559
This is bad.

320
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:38,600
It is a wasp stinger.

321
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,440
Poison this potent,

322
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,559
I have never seen before.

323
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,480
It was certainly not taken
from an ordinary wasp.

324
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:47,679
For now,

325
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,080
I can only give Her Highness

326
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,919
medicine to ease the pain.

327
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,519
As for the rest,

328
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,399
I must study it further.

329
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,990
Thank you for your trouble.

330
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,759
For His Highness,

331
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,079
you truly risked your life.

My dear, you have deft hands.

343
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,920
I cannot compare.

344
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,880
Losing to skill calls for a punishment.

345
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:04,319
How many taels of gold
did you set aside?

346
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,480
If you help me solve it,

347
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,400

Three years ago,

352
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,319
I tied a red cord

353
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
beneath the Tree of Love
in Guanling County,

354
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,400
and my wish was granted, to marry you.

355
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,079
If there truly are gods in this world,

356
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,960
I hope Yue Lao will tie our red thread

357
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,039
a little tighter.

358
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,920
Together, morning and night,

359
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,160
for all our lives.

360
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,960
How can I stay calm?

361
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,599
I said Chu Chu is my bottom line.

362
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,680
His Majesty and Physician Qi are here.

363
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,319
Chu Chu will be fine.

364
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,640
Jing Yi.

365
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,759
I have decided.

366
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,960
I will go before
His Majesty and confess.

367
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,700
What nonsense are you saying?

368
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,480
Only if I confess as the real culprit
can you get out quickly

369
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,640
and stop Gao Luoqian's next move,

370
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:31,039
and save Chu Chu,

371
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,559
then break this deadlock.

372
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,400
You trust me this much,

373
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,759
you have even put Chu Chu's
life in my hands.

374
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:41,119
I will not say more.

375
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,359
We have known each other
since childhood.

376
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,319
I treat you as a true brother.

377
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,039
I know you feel the same.

378
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,240
I cannot get out right now.

379
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,680
Chu Chu's life

380
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,279
is in your hands.

381
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Your Highness, do not...

382
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:04,920
I promise you.

383
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,500
Even if I must go to the underworld,

384
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,000
I will bring Chu Chu back alive.

385
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:15,160
Sir.

386
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,359
(Universal Post Station)

387
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:16,759
Sir.

388
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,950
A secret order from His King.

389
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:42,400
His King is truly wise.

390
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,000
With this in hand,

391
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,160
let us see how

392
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,480
the Emperor of Great Tang can evade it.

393
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,920
Your Majesty.

394
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,200
I have reported to the King of Nanzhao

395
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,160
that Commandery Prince An
and Vice Minister Jing

396
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,680
were ruled as a doubtful case.

397
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,720
His Majesty was furious,

398
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,799
saying Great Tang trampled on the dignity
of the Nanzhao royal house,

399
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,960
and treated the life
of a Nanzhao prince as nothing,

400
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,240
seeking to brush it aside.

401
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,759
Nanzhao will therefore send troops
to Jiaozhou at once,

402
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,119
to console the soul of Second Prince,

403
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,319
and quell the anger
of the Nanzhao people.

404
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,480
Great Tang has its own laws.

405
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,599
Nanzhao has no place to interfere.

406
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,400
For the sake of amity,

407
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,890
I have shown restraint time and again.

408
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,799
Yet Nanzhao

409
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,920
continues to press further.

410
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,960
Do you truly think
Great Tang fears Nanzhao?

411
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,160
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

412
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,759
If Your Majesty can punish
the true culprit severely,

413
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,920
I believe my own efforts
to persuade them

414
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,920
may still leave room
to turn things around.

415
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,720
After all, King of Nanzhao
values peace above all.

416
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,519
Enough.

417
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,599
Since you are set on taking up arms,

418
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,839
then we fight.

419
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,200
When Nanzhao is defeated,

420
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,599
do not say Great Tang relied on force.

421
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,160
Vice Envoy Gao.

422
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,279
Please.

423
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,799
Your Majesty.

424
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,119
Your Majesty.

425
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,670
Word has come
from the Court of Judicial Review.

426
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,400
The killer of the Nanzhao Second Prince

427
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,440
has confessed.

428
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,079
Confessed?

429
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,720
Who confessed?

430
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,039
That day at Weiguo Temple,

431
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,519
I had been intent on
protecting Second Prince.

432
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,319
You Chen'an remembered this kindness,

433
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,759
and invited me to Master Shenguan's
meditation chamber to speak at night.

434
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,519
When I arrived as agreed,

435
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,559
You Chen'an suddenly turned hostile,

436
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,000
and tried to attack me.

437
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,119
In the moment of panic...

438
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,400
- I happened to arrive.
- I...

439
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,200
I saw You Chen'an

440
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,599
about to harm His Highness.

441
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,079
To protect His Highness,

442
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:57,400
I struck and killed Second Prince.

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,440
Jing Yi...

444
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,880
This matter had nothing to do with
the Commandery Prince An.

445
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,240
He feared I would
surely die if arrested,

446
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:04,200
so he wished

447
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,599
to bear it together.

448
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,079
It was clearly me...

449
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:06,690
Your Highness,

450
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,240
at this point,
hiding it for me is useless.

451
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,799
Once you are released,
look into what followed.

452
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,690
There may still be
a chance to save my life.

453
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,039
It is well known that Vice Minister Jing
and Commandery Prince An are close as brothers.

454
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,720
Who is to say that today

455
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,039
he is not taking the blame for him?

456
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,119
There were three arrows that day.

457
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,799
One struck You Chen'an
squarely in the back.

458
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,279
That was the fatal blow.

459
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,000
Even so...

460
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,079
I have made myself clear.

461
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,400
Vice Envoy Gao, do you still doubt it?

462
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,359
Besides,

463
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,640
His Highness has no strength to kill.

464
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,039
How could he commit murder?

465
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,160
That still does not prove
the Commandery Prince An is innocent.

466
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,599
What if he was an accomplice?

467
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,920
Vice Envoy Gao,

468
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,759
you are the vice envoy of Nanzhao.

469
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,000
You must speak with evidence.

470
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:55,880
Where is it?

471
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,400
You cannot rely on clever words alone

472
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,559
and speak at will.

473
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:01,839
Very well.

474
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,680
Since the real culprit has confessed,

475
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,559
Your Majesty,

476
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,640
will you not issue the order?

477
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:09,400
Wait.

478
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,480
What is it?

479
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,720
Is the Commandery Prince An
trying to excuse the killer?

480
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,240
Jing Yi did kill someone,

481
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,319
but not the true Second Prince.

482
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,880
Only a stand-in.

483
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,200
Since the dead was not
from the Nanzhao delegation,

484
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,119
a Great Tang official killed
someone within Great Tang.

485
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,559
How it is handled

486
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,200
is not for Nanzhao to decide.

487
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,160
Enough.

488
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,160
Commandery Prince An,

489
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,160
you and your wife

490
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,960
truly have no new argument at all?

491
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,279
As far as I know,

492
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,160
Chu Chu found evidence,

493
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,400
and Vice Envoy Gao burned it.

494
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,559
You are the one delaying this case.

495
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,279
You...

496
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,480
Vice Envoy Gao,

497
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,839
why the hurry?

498
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,599
I am in custody. I cannot flee.

499
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,160
Commandery Prince An, Xiao Jinyu
is released without charge.

500
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:03,079
You are ordered
to find the Nanzhao chief envoy,

501
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,480
You Chen'an, at once.

502
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,799
No matter how far,

503
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,359
you must give
the Nanzhao delegation an answer.

504
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,759
Commandery Prince An,

505
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:12,839
rise.

506
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

507
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,720
As for Jing Yi...

508
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:18,440
Your Majesty,

509
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,839
place the suspect under the supervision
of the Nanzhao delegation.

510
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,119
The Jing Family's influence

511
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,680
is widely known.

512
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,160
If Vice Minister Jing
were to disappear in custody,

513
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,519
I could not answer
to the King of Nanzhao.

514
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:40,880
Your Majesty,

515
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,279
I have already yielded.

516
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,690
I am willing to wait
for Commandery Prince An's result.

517
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,559
I ask Your Majesty
to approve my request,

518
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:51,599
to show fairness.

519
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:54,839
Your Majesty,

520
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
I'm willing.

521
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,519
Very well.

522
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,920
The Nanzhao delegation may not
enter Great Tang prisons.

523
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,319
Jing Yi shall be confined
at his residence.

524
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,960
Only then will I consent.

525
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,820
Order Vice Minister Huang
of the Ministry of Rites

526
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:08,920
and the Nanzhao delegation

527
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,319
to guard him together.

528
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

529
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,720
Commandery Prince An, I hope you
will uncover the truth quickly

530
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,400
and give Nanzhao an answer.

531
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,839
I will.

532
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,400
Vice Envoy Gao,

533
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,519
return and inform the King of Nanzhao.

534
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,640
If he insists on his own course

535
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,359
and sends troops to Jiaozhou,

536
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,000
Great Tang will not fear it.

537
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,960
Our armies

538
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,039
will advance without delay

539
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,000
and take all of Nanzhao.

540
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,680
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

541
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,079
I will do all I can
to persuade His Majesty,

542
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,279
and promote peace and amity
between the two lands.

543
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,580
(Zichen Hall)

544
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,160
Your Highness.

545
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,960

Commandery Prince An.

554
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,390
His Majesty orders you to go
to the Imperial Study at once.

555
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:11,680
(Zichen Hall)

556
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,519
Outrageous.

557
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,759
The title I bestowed upon you

558
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,359
is not something you may resign at will.

559
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,319
I acknowledge my guilt.

560
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,920
I ask Your Majesty to punish me.

561
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,839
You two brothers

562
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,119
staged a farce before me,

563
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
rushing to confess,

564
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,720
yet never reported it to me first.

565
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,630
You treat the Three Judicial Offices
and the court

566
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
as if they were your own backyard.

567
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,359
If my life

568
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,279
buys Great Tang a moment's respite,

569
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,319
it is worth it.

570
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,279
Jinbao.

571
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,440
Help him up.

572
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,039
Xiao Jinyu.

573
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,400
Punishing you would
be letting you off lightly.

574
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:49,599
You must clean up this mess for me.

575
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,599
Did you think you could play your part

576
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,839
and then leave it to me?

577
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,599
I understand.

578
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,960
I will do everything in my power

579
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,960
to quell caused by Nanzhao.

580
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,000
In prison,

581
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,160
you suffered quite a bit, did you not?

582
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,090
The prison of the Court of Judicial Review
is run by my old subordinates.

583
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,680
They did not mistreat me.

584
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:13,000
I know you well.

585
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,680
To come up with such a plan,

586
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,230
you must have been pushed to the brink.

587
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,640
You already know
about Chu Chu being poisoned?

588
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,680
The best medicine from the palace

589
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,359
has been sent to your mansion.

590
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,039
Thank you, Your Majesty.

591
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,720
I will not fail Your Majesty,
even at the cost of my life.

592
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,359
Chu Chu.

593
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:09,720
You are back.

594
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,400
Or am I

595
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,160
dreaming?

596
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:16,640
I am back.

597
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,400
Was I good?

598
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,480
You were.

599
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:26,920
You saved me.

600
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,480
Your Highness.

601
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,240
I am so sleepy.

602
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,319
Then rest a while.

603
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,720
I will be here when you wake.

604
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,440
Chu Chu is still asleep?

605
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:05,720
She just fell asleep.

606
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,319
Leng Yue.

607
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,200
To get me released sooner,

608
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,400
Jing Yi confessed before His Majesty.

609
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,200
I am sorry.

610
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:30,359
Your Highness,

611
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,839
from the day we chose to follow you,

612
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:36,279
we were ready to give our lives.

613
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,079
What Jing Yi did

614
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
was not only for you,

615
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,599
but for Great Tang.

616
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,430
Nanzhao has been plotting for years,

617
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,440
infiltrating Great Tang from within.

618
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,560
Their ambition
is far greater than it seems.

619
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,559
From Zhao Senyao

620
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
to Wan Qianshan,

621
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:53,480
then Chu Chu,

622
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,680
Jing Yi, and you,

623
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,400
every move was part of their scheme.

624
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,279
Now the only one
who can save Chu Chu and Jing Yi

625
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,799
and turn this around is you.

626
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,400
Do not worry.

627
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,880
What Nanzhao owes us,

628
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,519
I will take back myself.

629
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,599
Wu Jiang has been settled by Lian Qiao

630
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:22,400
in the right wing hall.

631
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,400
I will go see him.

632
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,319
Your Highness.

633
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,680
I will stay with him.

634
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,759
Yes.

Lian Qiao.

650
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,490
Take my tally. Go at once and summon
the Imperial Medical Service.

651
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,199
Also,

652
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,400
Huichun Hall,

653
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,119
Hongbu Clinic,

654
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,440
Mengyu Hall,
and the physicians of Xuanhu Clinic.

655
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,280
Bring them all.

656
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,800
Yes, Your Highness.

657
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,559
Where is Chu He?

658
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,280
He is still being held.

659
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,079
He has said everything he can.

660
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,440
It is now for you to handle.

661
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,519
Jing Yi asked me to give this to you.

662
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,940
(Letter of Separation)

663
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,000
Your Highness.

664
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,079
Please pass this letter to Yue.

I promise

669
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,519
I will never tarnish
Miss Leng's reputation

670
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,159
in the martial world.

671
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,239
What do you mean by that?

672
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,960
I am warning you.

673
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,880
Do not get any twisted ideas.

674
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,239
If you scheme behind my back,

675
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:57,440
I will not forgive you

676
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,239
in my next life,

677
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,159
or the one after that.

678
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,840
Alright.

Such a mess.

683
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,920
Everything I said

684
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,280
went straight past him.

685
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,960
And he even wrote
a Letter of Separation.

686
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,599
I should go to the prison right now

687
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,360
and knock some sense into him.

688
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,500
He has been taken home
and kept under watch.

689
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,920
You cannot see him for now.

690
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,159
Once we get Jing Yi out,

691
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:27,719
you can teach him a lesson.

692
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,199
I will not stop you.

I will spare him for a few days.

696
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,239
What matters now
is to capture You Chen'an.

697
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:48,119
Only then can Jing Yi be cleared.

698
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,400
If he returns to Nanzhao,

699
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,280
it will become a real problem.

700
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,119
Your Highness, tell me

701
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,400
what I should do.

702
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,500
Take men from
the Three Judicial Offices at once

703
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,690
and intercept You Chen'an
on the roads toward Nanzhao.

704
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,490
Issue warrants immediately to
every prefecture and county along the way.

705
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,639
Your Highness is certain

706
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,480
he will return to Nanzhao?

707
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,599
You Chen'an wants to live too badly.

708
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,039
No matter the time or place,

709
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,679
he would never wait to die.

710
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,760
What is more, he infiltrated Chang'an
and rendered great service.

711
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,220
He was even praised
by the King of Nanzhao

712
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,239
as a pillar of the state,
righteous and loyal.

713
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,100
This is his best chance
to establish authority in Nanzhao

714
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,159
and trade it for survival.

715
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,599
As long as he is alive,

716
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,320
he will seize the chance
to return to Nanzhao.

717
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:32,500
Understood.

718
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,480
I will go now.

719
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:58,960
Do not bother me.

720
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,480
Leave the food on the table.

721
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,360
He.

722
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,079
No missing arms, no missing legs.

723
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:16,480
I told you, An would never harm me.

724
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,199
Chu Chu was worried sick.

725
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,800
So something really happened?

726
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,559
Then...

727
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,440
Then I...

728
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,719
We have already found out.

729
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,960
You were used.

730
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,430
You had nothing to do with the case.

731
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,679
You can leave prison now.

732
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,239
Let us go back to the pharmacy first.

733
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,039
He often came to drink and talk with me,

734
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,290
to pour out his troubles,

735
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:54,760
and curse his elder brother.

736
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,440
Did he have close dealings

737
