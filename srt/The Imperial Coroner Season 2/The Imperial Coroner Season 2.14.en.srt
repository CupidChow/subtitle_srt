(I buried myself in autopsies,)

(never imagining that at such a moment)

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,519
(His Highness would be harmed
and be infected with syphilis.)

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,559
(His was weak to begin with.)

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,199
(I'm worried for him.)

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,519
(Every case and clue,)

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,519
(points back to this baffling illness.)

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,439
(Can I really make him well again?)

(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,640
(This story is entirely fictional.)

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,320
=Episode 14=

28
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,740
(See the Wind and Listen to the Rain)

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:23,900
Your Highness.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,180
Bad news. His Majesty is
at the Three Judicial Offices.

31
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:27,570
He has reached the Two Merits Hall.

32
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,820
(Two Merits Hall)

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,180
Chu Chu, coroner of the Three
Judicial Offices. At your service.

34
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,080
Where is Xiao Jinyu?

35
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,439
Commandery Prince An is

36
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:52,879
a little unwell.

37
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:53,990
He is unfit to be here.

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,800
A little unwell?

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
And I was never informed?

40
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,520
Since when is syphilis
considered a "little unwell?"

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,039
Xiao Jinyu truly commands loyal men.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,960
The Three Judicial Offices
are sealed tight.

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,360
You are conspiring

44
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,919
to deceive everyone.

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,680
This is outrageous!

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,080
If Jiang Daohai had not
accused him before me,

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,200
I would still know nothing.

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,199
I placed great hopes in him.

49
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,439
Others accused him
of abusing his office,

50
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,159
using investigations as a cover

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,879
to frequent pleasure quarters.

52
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,560
I never believed it.

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,080
Yet he took me for a fool!

54
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,719
After his investigations,

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,439
there were only more cases.

56
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,000
Xiao Jinyu's crime cannot be forgiven.

57
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,450
- Your Majesty, calm down.
- Your Majesty, calm down.

58
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,400
Then tell me.

59
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,599
How should I calm it?

60
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,800
Should I abolish
the Three Judicial Offices instead?

61
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,159
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,080
This matter is entirely my fault.

63
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,439
His Highness was at the Music Office
for investigations.

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,590
As for how he contracted the illness,

65
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,800
it was because I failed
to cleanse myself after an autopsy.

66
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,759
He was already weak in health.

67
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,290
When the sickness took hold,

68
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,520
he was drawn into it.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,600
Your Majesty.

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,719
All responsibility

71
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,879
is mine to bear alone.

72
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:02,840
Very well.

73
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,879
Guards.

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,439
Your Majesty!

75
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,319
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,360
Commandery Prince An
requests an audience.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,439
Has he lost his mind?

78
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:14,879
At a time like this,

79
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,720
he still wants to see me?

80
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,279
Have Physician Qi treat his head first.

81
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:23,839
His Majesty must already know

82
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,680
that I contracted syphilis.

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,690
What should we do?

84
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,680
Your Highness.

85
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,040
We cannot provoke

86
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,759
His Majesty further.

87
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:33,920
Wu Jiang.

88
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:34,720
Yes.

89
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,250
I oversee the Three Judicial Offices.

90
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,759
It is my duty to protect them.

91
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,839
No matter what happens,

92
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:40,930
as long as I live,

93
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,600
the blame shouldn't fall on you.

94
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,319
Chu Chu means more to me
than my own life.

95
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,959
I regard all of you as family.

96
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,560
His Majesty came in fury today

97
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,079
to make a show for certain people,

98
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,360
and

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,639
because of the string of cases.

100
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,990
The Three Judicial Offices
must give an answer.

101
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,040
Your Majesty,

102
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,240
Commandery Prince An has a plan.

103
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,720
Please set your mind at ease.

104
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,040
He says

105
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,600
that recent murder cases
have surged in the capital.

106
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,050
The Three Judicial Offices are
pursuing them at full strength.

107
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,190
Clues have emerged,

108
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,319
however faint.

109
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,160
But too many are involved.

110
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,360
The case itself is deeply tangled.

111
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,319
It cannot yet be concluded.

112
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,439
I was careless,

113
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,120
and caught an illness.

114
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:21,839
I have disgraced the royal family.

115
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,680
I will accept any punishment.

116
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,519
But the deaths of these four

117
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,120
mustn't be ignored.

118
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,639
I cannot ignore them.

119
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,279
I was fortunate to have

120
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,680
Your Majesty's trust.

121
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,519
I would never forget that.

122
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,240
I know

123
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,639
the court is full
of conflicting voices right now

124
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,439
and how difficult it is for you.

125
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:43,279
Even so, I ask that
you trust me once more.

126
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,959
Allow me to explain everything in full.

127
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,519
Very well.

128
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,360
I would like to see for myself

129
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,120
what he still hopes to say

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,959
now that he stands at the edge.

131
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,240
Summon Xiao Jinyu.

132
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:57,959
Yes.

133
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,120
Your Highness.

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,519
How could His Majesty doubt you?

135
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,120
His Majesty belongs to all officials.

136
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,079
If he trusted me
without question even now,

137
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,279
the Three Judicial Offices
would truly be in danger.

138
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,839
His Majesty needs a way out.

139
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,160
More importantly,

140
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:14,439
a reason to trust me.

141
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,120
Xiao Jinyu.

142
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,279
I am baffled.

143
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,600
You insist on
a thorough investigation in the capital.

144
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,199
After all this digging,

145
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,240
what have you actually uncovered?

146
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,560
You have fallen ill yourself,

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,240
and stirred the entire city into chaos.

148
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,519
That is precisely

149
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,800
why I know I was right.

150
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:32,800
Right about what?

151
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:33,519
Oh?

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,360
Should I reward you for it?

153
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:36,839
Just as Your Majesty said,

154
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,519
if the Music Office murders

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
were truly as simple as they appeared,

156
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,160
we would not have caused such turmoil

157
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,079
by investigating them.

158
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,439
What we see now proves the opposite.

159
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
There must be more to it.

160
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,560
Always more mysteries.

161
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,519
So what exactly is it?

162
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,560
What could be worth
pushing you this far?

163
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Enough kneeling.

164
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,720
Stand up.

165
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,519
Much obliged.

166
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,000
Eunuch Jinbao.

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,120
This…

168
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,879
Chu Chu once said

169
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,800
that without direct contact,

170
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,600
syphilis cannot be transmitted.

171
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:22,800
Yes.

172
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,160
Your Majesty.

173
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,240
These are three bodies
we recently examined.

174
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,240
All three had shown
signs of syphilis before death.

175
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,360
They are Qinxiang,

176
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,319
Wan Qianshan,

177
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:38,519
and Zhao Fengming.

178
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,399
Chu Chu.

179
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:44,880
Your Majesty.

180
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,759
All three bore external sores,

181
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:49,399
but during the autopsies,

182
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:51,079
we found that only Qinxiang's organs

183
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,439
showed signs
of true syphilitic infection.

184
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,680
Wan Qianshan and Zhao Fengming

185
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,319
did not die from syphilis.

186
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,360
They were poisoned.

187
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:00,839
Poisoned?

188
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,959
Like Zhao Fengming,

189
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,240
Wan Qianshan died
from ingesting the same toxin.

190
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,920
So you suspect deliberate poisoning.

191
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,519
Yes.

192
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,439
But why choose these two?

193
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,120
They held opposing political views,

194
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,240
yet both were
top laureates of their year,

195
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,720
young and exceptionally capable.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,560
They were pillars of the state,

197
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,439
known as the Twin Stars of Great Tang.

198
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,439
They often opposed one another openly.

199
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,500
Behind them stood
the civil and military factions.

200
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,120
Each side praised its own champion,

201
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,279
but in truth used them to voice

202
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,560
their own agendas.

203
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,080
Both have died in quick succession
at the Music Office.

204
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,279
Both were marked
with signs of syphilis.

205
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,279
This was enough
to cause public uproar,

206
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,399
and shake
the people's faith in the court.

207
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,279
It also drives a wedge

208
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,399
between the civil

209
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,440
and military factions.

210
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,440
Even my own infection

211
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,000
was part of their calculations.

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,759
The timing of my illness,

213
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,799
and how quickly the news spread,

214
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,320
were far too precise.

215
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,240
It all feels deliberately arranged.

216
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,080
You mean to say…

217
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,000
Yes.

218
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Just like Wan Qianshan
and Zhao Fengming,

219
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,200
the syphilis I contracted was also

220
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,440
caused by poison.

221
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,639
Don't worry.

222
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,039
You are saying

223
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,279
that the true culprit
behind the Music Office case

224
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,399
is someone from Nanzhao?

225
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,919
Then, the case of Master Shenguan

226
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,440
is connected to all of this as well?

227
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,440
Yes.

228
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,720
Zhao Senyao, who harmed Master Shenguan,

229
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
was approached by Nanzhao ghost guards.

230
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,559
They sold him

231
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,639
elixirs said to extend one's life.

232
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,120
They chose Zhao Senyao

233
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,159
because he oversaw

234
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,679
the appointment and transfer reviews

235
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,390
of military officers
below the eighth rank.

236
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,120
This matter runs deeper than expected.

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,120
Nanzhao's plots and schemes

238
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
have already reached

239
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,120
into our military appointments.

240
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,840
They seek to erode the state at its core

241
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,080
and shake the foundation of the realm.

242
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,519
When will we finally uproot

243
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,600
this parasite
that hides behind superstition?

244
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,370
Leng Yue is now investigating.

245
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,080
We will have news soon.

246
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,000
Xiao Jinyu.

247
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,919
Are you determined

248
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,399
to pursue it to the end?

249
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:21,919
Yes.

250
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,320
Even if it pushes you

251
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,960
into the very eye of the storm?

252
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,440
I am already in it.

253
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,960
Xiao Jinyu.

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,320
Do you understand

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,039
that this involves
relations between states?

256
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,240
If anything goes wrong,

257
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,639
I...

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,559
I must

259
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,039
place the peace
of Great Tang above all else.

260
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,590
Do you...

261
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,759
Do you understand?

262
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,360
I do.

263
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,960
I will give everything I have

264
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,360
with no regrets.

265
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,320
Your Majesty.

266
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,770
Allow me to investigate
alongside Commandery Prince An.

267
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,840
Chu Chu.

268
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,240
You serve in the Three Judicial Offices.

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,960
When orders are given,

270
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:15,919
you are to obey.

271
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,320
There is no need to petition me again.

272
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
I am not asking for an order.

273
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,590
I ask to pursue this case
with Commandery Prince An.

274
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,039
If anything goes wrong,

275
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
you may punish me alone.

276
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:26,840
That way,

277
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,320
the cost of calming
the situation is kept to a minimum.

278
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,799
I understand

279
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,080
Your Majesty's difficulty.

280
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,810
Commandery Prince An carries
a heavy responsibility at court.

281
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,399
If anything happens to him,

282
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,919
the court will fall into chaos.

283
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,159
I am only a coroner.

284
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,970
My life weighs almost nothing.

285
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,799
Yet I am a coroner personally
appointed by Your Majesty.

286
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,240
This is my duty.

287
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:53,159
Let me investigate together with him.

288
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,840
If the worst should happen,

289
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,000
Your Majesty will have a choice
that preserves the greater good.

290
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:02,600
Your Majesty.

291
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,919
I am willing
to investigate alongside Chu Chu.

292
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,399
We are in this as one.

293
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,679
You two…

294
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,080
Your Majesty.

295
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,519
It is getting late.

296
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:18,720
You have also summoned
the envoy from Xinluo.

297
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,919
Return to the palace.

298
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,519
(Two Merits Hall)
Move the carriage.

299
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,759
Your Highness.

300
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,320
Thank you.

301
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
You are the finest coroner
in Great Tang.

302
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:48,720
This is a battle

303
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,799
we will not lose.

304
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,279
Your Highness.

305
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,610
You did not sleep well
last night, did you?

306
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:11,890
Sharp eyes, Physician Qi.

307
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,440
An old problem.

308
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,000
Your Highness's pulse

309
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,559
does resemble poisoning.

310
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,320
But this toxin

311
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:23,320
is one I have never seen before.

312
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:25,399
As for an antidote,

313
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,960
I will need time

314
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,720
to study it carefully.

315
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,300
Thank you for your trouble.

316
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,240
Your Highness.

317
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,620
Your Highness.

318
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,400
Vice Minister Jing.

319
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,639
Zhao Senyao has taken ill.

320
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:36,519
What happened?

321
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,120
He suddenly broke out

322
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,519
in a cold sweat.

323
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,580
His body began convulsing.

324
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,720
He keeps drooling and crying,

325
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,990
and his face has turned pale.

326
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,360
He looks completely dazed,

327
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,320
muttering nonsense.

328
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
Does syphilis really cause this,

329
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,720
even in its later stages?

330
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,320
That is impossible.

331
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,759
These symptoms

332
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,879
have nothing to do with syphilis.

333
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,559
Ghost guard! Ghost guard!

334
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,279
I want to see the ghost guard!

335
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,240
Young Master Zhao.

336
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,440
Calm yourself.

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,919
Let me see the ghost guard.

338
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,500
Your Highness.

339
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,240
This is no time for persuasion.

340
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,639
Just knock him out already.

341
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:08,799
Open the door.

342
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,799
Ghost guard...

343
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,840
I want to see the ghost guard.

344
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,759
Physician Qi.

345
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,279
Be careful.

346
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,960
This young man's illness

347
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,360
is truly unusual.

348
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:34,240
What do you mean?

349
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:36,840
Judging from his sores and pulse,

350
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,919
he does appear to have syphilis.

351
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,879
But

352
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,799
syphilis does not
cause full-body convulsions.

353
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,159
This looks far more like poisoning.

354
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,879
Then, is it possible

355
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:49,799
that besides syphilis,

356
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,039
he was also poisoned?

357
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,679
That would mean

358
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,279
he,

359
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,850
Wan Qianshan and Zhao Fengming,
and even Commandery Prince An,

360
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,279
were all given the same poison.

361
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,240
It's all right.

362
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,120
Your Highness.

363
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,620
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

364
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,110
Your Highness!

365
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,990
What's wrong, Your Highness?

366
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,560
Your Highness.

367
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,919
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

368
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,120
Your Highness.

369
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,279
Please have some.

370
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,240
Physician Qi said
His Highness is stable for now.

371
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:33,720
You needn't worry too much.

372
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,720
Leave it there.

373
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:35,879
I will eat shortly.

374
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,200
Let me stay and attend to you.

375
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:39,559
You have been exhausted.

376
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,039
If you fall ill as well,

377
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
His Highness will only
worry more when he wakes.

378
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,440
Lian Qiao.

379
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,440
It suddenly struck me

380
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,240
I've been busy every day with matters
of the Three Judicial Offices,

381
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,990
and have hardly spent
any proper time with him.

382
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,720
Don't worry. I will eat.

383
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,200
At a time like this, I won't be willful.

You're awake.

395

How are you feeling?

396
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,240
Slowly.

397
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,340
♪Like sinking into the deep sea♪

Sorry to worry you.

400
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,079
Based on what we've guessed,

401
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,160
perhaps...

402
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:22,920
Perhaps

403
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,720
I will suffer the same fate as

404
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,319
Zhao Fengming and Wan Qianshan.

405
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:34,519
Don't worry.

406
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,440
I am still perfectly fine.

407
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,440
And Zhao Senyao is still alive.

408
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,000
That means this poison,

409
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,960
when it takes effect,

410
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,839
may only disturb the mind,

411
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,680
and not necessarily be fatal.

412
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:52,720
True.

413
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,799
If it is poison,
there must be an antidote.

414
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,759
An antidote…

415
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,400
- Ghost guard.
- Ghost guard.

416
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,279
The fact that Zhao Senyao is still alive

417
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,839
might really be because

418
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,720
the ghost guard gave him the medicine.

419
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,880
But who poisoned you?

420
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,799
No idea.

421
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:20,519
I have met too many people recently.

422
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,240
It will be hard to trace.

423
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,200
What matters most right now

424
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:26,079
is to obtain some of that

425
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,680
so-called life-extending medicine.

426
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,920
Once we have it,

427
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,240
there may be

428
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,319
a way to neutralize the poison.

429
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,400
We will look for it together.

430
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:38,599
Your Highness.

431
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,400
You promised to grow old with me.

432
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,960
Don't break your word.

433
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:46,799
I never will.

434
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,559
Your Highness, Princess Consort.

435
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,319
Are you finished
speaking from the heart?

436
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,200
May I come in to report something?

437
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,680
As if I can stop you from coming in.

438
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,119
I followed your instructions

439
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,039
and withdrew everyone
from the Music Office.

440
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,519
But you said the killer
would make another move.

441
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,519
Why pull everyone back?

442
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
Have you not noticed

443
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,119
that the Three Judicial Offices
have been tied down

444
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,519
by the syphilis case?

445
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,720
You mean

446
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:23,519
the culprit

447
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,319
intentionally drew us into this,

448
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,920
and forced us to act by his plan,

449
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,960
cornering us?

450
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,839
Exactly.

451
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,000
They could have done
what they did to Zhao Senyao.

452
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,559
They could have

453
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,559
used poison to corrupt our officials.

454
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,119
Kept them alive,

455
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,519
forced them into bribery,

456
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,559
selling offices and favors.

457
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,039
But instead,

458
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,880
they killed Zhao Fengming
and Wan Qianshan.

459
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,440
All of this

460
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,880
was to use the fall of the Twin Stars

461
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,720
to stir public outrage.

462
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,519
To spark infighting
between civil and military factions.

463
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,799
And to make the people

464
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,200
lose faith in the court.

465
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:01,559
When you put it that way,
it does sound logical.

466
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,880
The most ingenious part of this poison

467
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,559
is that it creates
sores identical to syphilis.

468
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,720
People avoid speaking

469
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,079
of such an illness.

470
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:15,880
Those who suffer from it
are ashamed to seek treatment.

471
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,039
From the moment the Three
Judicial Offices took this case,

472
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,119
we were already
trapped in a deadly bind.

473
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,440
And after I was poisoned,

474
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,200
if you had not held your ground,

475
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,640
the Three Judicial Offices would have
collapsed from all sides.

476
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:32,440
The person behind this
understands human nature well,

477
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,640
and knows how to exploit it.

478
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,519
All of this is likely meant

479
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,799
to conceal a far greater goal.

480
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:44,920
In the end,

481
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,039
everything began with Qinxiang.

482
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,640
I remember how she died.

483
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,839
She was strangled
and drowned in a washbasin.

484
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:53,839
Such brutality

485
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,599
against a defenseless woman

486
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,240
feels more like
interrogation by torture.

487
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:00,519
Yet no drugs

488
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,200
were left behind in her room.

489
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,440
They acted carefully.

490
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,279
Before silencing her, they made sure

491
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,720
she held no hidden evidence.

492
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,079
So what could have driven them

493
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,039
commit such brutality against her?

494
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,519
And why would Qinxiang choose death

495
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,000
rather than submit?

496
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,039
Qinxiang's weakness

497
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,160
was her family.

498
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,160
They went after Jing Yuan.

499
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,720
But he was just a young monk.

500
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,000
Was he really worth such trouble?

501
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,279
There is another.

502
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:38,599
Xie Huaiding.

503
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:45,400
Is General Xie at home?

504
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,240
He went out.

505
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:53,680
Was he meeting someone?

506
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,039
How do you know this, Vice Minister Jing?

507
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,119
Where did he go?

508
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,119
Well...

509
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,279
He never told us.

510
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,960
Cavalry General
Xie Huaiding was appointed

511
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:07,119
by His Majesty

512
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,519
(Map of Chang'an)
for the Jiaozhou front.

513
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,279
Here.

514
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,640
(Music Office)
They control Great Tang officials here.

515
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,519
The moment we pulled out,

516
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,440
they began to move.

517
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,550
Let's go to the Music Office.

518
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
What is it?

519
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:27,440
Nothing.

520
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,090
The Music Office still stands,

521
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,119
but Qinxiang is gone forever.

522
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,680
Let's go.

523
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,799
(Music Office)

524
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:46,599
Your Highness.

525
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,319
We are here to find General Xie.

526
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,920
Do we really have to dress like this?

527
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,559
If we came in official robes,

528
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
they would have

529
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:57,680
shut the doors before we even arrived.

530
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,079
Why is Jing Yi not here yet?

531
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,519
He is already inside.

532
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,519
Let's go.

533
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,860
(Music Office)

534
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,240
I am here.

535
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,720
Where is she?

536
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,119
General.

537
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:18,559
Have some patience.

538
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:21,400
She is safe.

539
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,440
As long as you do me a small favor,

540
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,000
I will naturally

541
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,680
return her to you.

542
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,519
Would you like to hear a tune?

543
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,920
No need.

544
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,599
Sir, you seem tense.

545
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,599
Why such a heavy temper?

546
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,079
Let me help ease it.

547
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,599
Leave!

548
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:13,880
General Xie.

549
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,720
Vice Minister Jing?

550
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,240
Why are you here?

551
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,060
Your Highness.

552
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:23,720
He got away.

553
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,519
Commandery Prince An.

554
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:30,799
What?

555
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,799
Has the Three Judicial Offices
begun spying on me as well?

556
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,960
You misunderstand, General.

557
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,900
The one who asked you here

558
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,720
meant to take your life.

559
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,680
General,

560
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,759
I saw it just now.

561
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,710
You also have
the red blotches of syphilis.

562
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,559
Nonsense!

563
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,599
I have never set foot in such places.

564
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:48,960
How could I have syphilis?

565
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,160
General, you are mistaken.

566
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,839
You were poisoned.

567
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,519
This poison causes

568
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:55,279
red blotches identical to syphilis.

569
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,960
Lord Zhao and Lord Wan
both died from it.

570
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,759
If I am not mistaken,

571
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,160
there is poison

572
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:02,759
in this pot of tea as well.

573
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,980
That is why I stopped you
from drinking it.

574
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
His Majesty said

575
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,559
someone was trying to
rot Chang'an from the inside.

576
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,440
Could this be what he meant?

577
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,759
Who did it?

578
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,880
Nanzhao?

579
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,960
There is no proof yet.

580
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,960
It must be them.

581
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,319
No wonder.

582
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,359
I suddenly developed rashes,

583
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,799
and within days, someone came to me,

584
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,559
insisting I had syphilis.

585
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:34,559
He even told me

586
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,039
to buy my life back.

587
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,119
Did he call himself a ghost guard?

588
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,400
How did you know?

589
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,319
That little wretch spun a wild tale.

590
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,559
One look and I knew he meant no good.

591
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
He even tried to strike a deal with me.

592
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:51,039
He claimed he could give me
his ghosts as soldiers,

593
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,400
and guarantee me victory.

594
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:54,440
A load of nonsense.

595
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,640
I drove them out at once.

596
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,039
But

597
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:00,359
I kept the evidence.

598
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
I seized their medicine.

599
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:11,079
This pill looks strangely familiar.

600
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,240
You should recognize

601
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,119
that ghost guard as well.

602
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,039
Zhou Han.

603
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,119
Exactly.

604
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,359
General, would you tell us

605
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,240
why they asked you to meet them here?

606
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,759
I was searching
for a woman named Lv Ying.

607
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,640
Half a month ago,

608
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,920
someone said there was news of her here.

609
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:40,920
You wanted to see Lv Ying?

610
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,000
You know her?

611
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,000
Where is she?

612
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,519
(Weiguo Temple)
Lv Ying fled the Xie Residence years ago

613
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,079
and later gave birth to a child.

614
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:06,599
General.

615
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,960
Master Jing Yuan already knows.

616
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,519
He wishes to see you as well.

617
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:18,079
All these years,

618
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,039
Lv Ying changed her name,

619
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,559
and struggled just to survive.

620
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,599
She was killed because of me.

621
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,680
Even our son became a monk.

622
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,640
And I knew nothing.

623
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,640
My wife and child suffered.

624
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,400
Yet I lived on like a useless man.

625
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:35,440
How do I even face him now?

626
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,200
Amitabha.

627
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,240
Honored patrons.

628
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,039
Little Master.

629
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,160
We learned you stayed in the capital.

630
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,119
Forgive us for troubling you.

631
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,119
The delegation said

632
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,039
they would return together.

633
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,720
I have just brewed tea.

634
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:59,880
Would you like to come in for a cup?

635
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,240
When she entrusted me to my master,

636
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,200
she asked him to tell me

637
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,759
that my birth father

638
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:19,359
was an upright and courageous man.

639
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,079
You did not betray her trust.

640
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,200
Nor do you need to apologize to me.

641
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,640
Though I have left the mortal world,

642
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,559
to know that

643
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,839
I was loved by my parents

644
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:34,759
still brings me peace.

645
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,119
There will always be regrets.

646
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,039
General,

647
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,079
do not trap yourself

648
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,680
in the past.

649
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,839
Are you really

650
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,079
not coming home with me?

651
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:07,920
Sir, please have some tea.

652
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:09,960
Then,

653
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,839
I will soon depart for Jiaozhou City.

654
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,839
Would you be willing to come with me?

655
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,720
Sir,

656
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,599
please drink the tea.

657
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,640
Then in the future, may I still...

658
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:41,200
Fine tea.

659
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,279
There is nothing amiss.

660
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,680
The aroma suggests

661
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,599
several warming and restorative herbs.

662
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,599
It resembles Heavenly Rejuvenation Pill.

663
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,000
Heavenly Rejuvenation Pill?

664
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:17,240
I often give
this medicine to His Highness.

665
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,200
I even have one here.

666
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,200
The weight feels slightly different.

667
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I am ashamed.

668
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,279
I am getting old.

669
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,980
My hands tremble.

670
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,390
I can't tell by touch alone.

671
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,839
What is this?

672
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,039
It does not seem herbal.

673
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,079
Rather, it seems...

674
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,400
It's pungent.

675
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,200
Like powder burned from shells

676
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,559
or crustaceans.

677
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,039
White powder.

678
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,640
I investigated all the women
of the Music Office.

679
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,839
Indeed,

680
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,720
many of them

681
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:29,440
bought scented powder from Qinxiang

682
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
to attract patrons.

683
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,119
The culprit used these women

684
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,039
to spread the powder,

685
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,279
targeting the noble youths
they wished to control.

686
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,759
Once the poison took hold,

687
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,160
these young men

688
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:43,559
developed red blotches
resembling syphilis.

689
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,359
And since they

690
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,519
frequented pleasure quarters
and the Music Office,

691
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,920
they naturally assumed

692
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,759
that they had contracted syphilis.

693
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:51,319
Zhao Senyao was the same.

694
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,759
He did contract syphilis,

695
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,599
but what flared up was the poison.

696
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,000
Even Qinxiang never realized
he had been poisoned.

697
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,440
He was terrified and
dared not seek treatment.

698
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,519
At that moment,

699
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,920
the so-called ghost guard
would appear.

700
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:06,799
With a face that looked reborn,

701
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,400
they spun tales
of extending one's lifespan.

702
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,079
So they used women

703
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,519
to poison officials
and nobles of Great Tang.

704
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,500
Those men then depended
on the so-called life-prolonging pills

705
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,519
and were thus controlled.

706
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,960
If someone refused to comply,

707
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,680
they used a stronger dose

708
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,599
and killed them.

709
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,000
Wan Qianshan and Zhao Fengming
were prime examples.

710
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,920
This both threw our court into chaos

711
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:37,079
and intimidated
the remaining noble houses.

712
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:40,079
Those women never knew
they were accomplices.

713
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,390
Even if they learned the truth,

714
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,160
it was too late.

715
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,880
They fell deeper into the darkness.

716
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,319
Anyone who tried to resist,

717
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:47,240
like Qinxiang,

718
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,599
was silenced.

719
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,680
What a vicious scheme.

720
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,359
Have you found the ghost guard?

721
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,759
Any clues left behind?

722
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,759
The ghost guard vanished.

723
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,599
They seemed to know our every move.

724
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,290
So, even
the Three Judicial Offices there was...

725
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,799
Your Highness.

726
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,240
Your Highness.

727
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,640
Do you recall the white powder I found

728
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,960
on Wan Qianshan's clothing?

729
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:09,759
I do.

730
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,000
I compared them.

731
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:16,839
That powder

732
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,440
is identical to the substance

733
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,520
coating the ghost guard's

734
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,079
life-prolonging pills.

735
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,960
I also consulted medical texts.

736
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,759
Zhao Senyao's earlier symptoms

737
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,759
closely resemble
Five-Stone Dust addiction,

738
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,799
but this poison is far stronger

739
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,079
and causes red blotches.

740
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,200
Five-Stone Dust circulated
for five hundred years.

741
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:35,079
Millions took it.

742
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,559
Hundreds of thousands died from it.

743
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,799
That is why it was banned
during the Zhenguan era.

744
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,680
(Ban)

745
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,359
If this poison is even more addictive

746
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,640
than Five-Stone Dust,

747
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,920
then Great Tang

748
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,319
and its people

749
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:47,880
will suffer devastation

750
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,119
beyond measure.

751
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:54,000
So the so-called life-prolonging pill
is poison after all.

752
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,790
But that doesn't add up.

753
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,559
Wan Qianshan and Zhao Fengming
were killed instantly.

754
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,890
Why has Zhao Senyao survived
after taking it for so long?

755
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,279
Both Wan Qianshan and Zhao Fengming

756
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,559
had severe swelling

757
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,359
in the throat,

758
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,839
and there was clear pinpoint
bleeding in the organs.

759
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,119
That means
what they ingested was a large dose

760
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,150
of poison taken directly.

761
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,079
A lethal toxin
with no protective coating.

762
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,559
But the pills Zhao Senyao took

763
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,920
were also poisonous,

764
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:17,800
only they were

765
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,559
encased in a non-toxic outer shell.

766
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,079
After ingestion,

767
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,039
the body first digests the shell,

768
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,079
and only then does the poison release.

769
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:28,159
That is why Zhao Senyao
survived long-term use.

770
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,360
First, the dosage was limited.

771
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,280
The second, the shell weakened

772
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,119
the poison's effect.

773
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,239
But poison is still poison.

774
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,960
Taken over time,

775
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,239
death is inevitable.

776
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,559
And once the drug is cut off,

777
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:46,079
the suffering is unbearable.

778
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,199
It can even cloud the mind.

779
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,440
Taken in small amounts,

780
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,639
it creates addiction.

781
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,119
Taken in excess, it kills outright.

782
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,760
That's the essence of it.

783
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,599
Take it and you feel clear-headed.
Stop and you suffer.

784
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,440
Add the illusion of resurrection
and ghostly messengers,

785
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,239
and the scheme
becomes terrifyingly convincing.

786
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,679
Your Highness was poisoned.

787
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,559
It must have been their doing.

788
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,840
They meant to control and destroy you.

789
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,639
But you caught it early

790
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,400
and denied them the chance.

791
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,599
That ghost guard spoke
with a Nanzhao accent.

792
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,119
And Nanzhao's hidden agent, Peacock,

793
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
has never been identified.

794
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,400
This is the same group,

795
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,760
stirring chaos in our land.

796
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,660
Which means capturing
that pill-selling ghost guard

797
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,519
is now our top priority.

798
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,400
(Secures the Realm)

799
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,519
Nanzhao's methods are truly despicable.

800
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,239
You now command the Annan Army.

801
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,239
You are already
a thorn in Nanzhao's side.

802
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:46,860
Who knows how many Nanzhao spies

803
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,599
are buried in Chang'an as we speak.

804
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,599
They will stop at nothing
to strike at you.

805
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,960
General, please take every precaution.

806
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,960
My thanks, Commandery Prince An.

807
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,119
I understand.

808
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,079
If Nanzhao thinks
it can disrupt Great Tang

809
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,639
with these tricks,

810
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,360
then my Frost Halberd

811
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,190
will never allow it.

812
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:16,740
- Long live the General!
- Long live the General!

813
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:21,690
On this march to Jiaozhou,

814
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,239
as long as I draw breath,

815
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,360
Nanzhao will not set foot in Great Tang.

816
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,320
You command the Annan Army now.

817
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,159
You are already
a thorn in Nanzhao's side.

818
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,320
They will stop at nothing
to strike at you.

819
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,920
Then my Frost Halberd
will never allow it.

820
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,679
- Drive out Nanzhao!
- Drive out Nanzhao!

821
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,559
- Protect Great Tang!
- Protect Great Tang!

822
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,800
- Drive out Nanzhao!
- Drive out Nanzhao!

823
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,760
- Protect Great Tang!
- Protect Great Tang!

824
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,559
Hear me, people of the realm.

825
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,920
Hear me, my soldiers.

826
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,400
The sun stands high.

827
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,159
The auspicious hour has come.

828
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,039
The armies of Jiaozhou...

829
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,000
Are fierce as tigers and wolves.

830
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,760
Our weapons are always ready.

831
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:05,320
Beacons blaze across the horizon.

832
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,239
Our ranks stand firm and ready.

833
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,719
- Our blades reach far and wide!
- Our blades reach far and wide!

834
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:25,199
- General!
-  General!

835
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,719
A single piece of fruit.

836
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:35,280
A fruit handed over
by a five-year-old child.

837
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
And my great general is dead.

838
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,199
Good.

839
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,840
Well played.

840
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,220
The Three Judicial Offices
and the Capital Prefecture

841
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,660
have joined forces to investigate.

842
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,000
That mother and her daughter were used.

843
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,990
By the time we found them,

844
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:58,200
both had already been silenced.
