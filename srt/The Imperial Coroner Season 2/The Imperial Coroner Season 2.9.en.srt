(but an unspoken distance
seemed to grow)

(between His Highness and me.)

5
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,600
(I didn't know what to do.)

6
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,600
(I never expected that,
just to make up for my regret,)

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,479
(His Highness would drink himself
senseless before the Emperor)

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,200
(for a chance to let me to personally
examine Master Shenguan's body.)

00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,679

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

26
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,220
(This story is entirely fictional.)

27
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,900
=Episode 9=

28
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,590
Last night, you drank too much
and said you had chest pain.

29
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,800
That was when it struck me

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,080
that Master Shenguan's
heart meridian was abnormal.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,000
However,

32
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
it was too obvious.

33
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,960
If such a condition

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,439
(Post-Mortem Report)
had existed all along,

35
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,840
he would've felt unwell

36
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,840
before his sudden death.

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,370
He wouldn't have had the strength

38
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,180
to go to the Zhao Residence
and perform a ritual.

39
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,020
In other words,
the damage to his heart meridian

40
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,880
was most likely caused
by an external factor?

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,400
At first, I found no traces
of food or drink

42
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,280
in his mouth or nose.

43
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,199
And knowing that Buddhist monks

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,400
do not eat while performing rituals
outside the temple,

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,719
I rashly concluded that nothing
had entered his system before death.

46
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,520
But

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,120
I overlooked one thing.

48
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,990
Buddhists perform a full cleansing
of the body after death.

49
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,080
So

50
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,759
before we saw Master Shenguan's corpse,

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,320
it had already been prepared and washed.

52
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,280
After realizing this,

53
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,520
I conducted a complete
post-mortem examination once again.

54
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,520
I discovered a crucial clue
we had missed.

55
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,840
Before we first examined the body,

56
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,599
the stiffness of his limbs

57
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,159
was far beyond normal.

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
His kidneys and liver were swollen,

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,879
fluid had accumulated in his lungs,

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,199
and the inner walls of his esophagus
and stomach showed abnormal ulceration.

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,439
This level of rigidity

62
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,159
is highly unusual.

63
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,080
You Chen'an failed to notice it,

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,039
so

65
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
he didn't inform me.

66
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,680
He didn't notice?

67
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:03,120
Given how seriously Nanzhao regarded
Master Shenguan's death,

68
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,439
he actually made such an oversight

69
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,800
during the external examination.

70
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
This level of stiffness

71
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,639
is hard to identify
without extensive experience.

72
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,719
A misjudgment

73
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,840
would be understandable.

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,279
You mentioned

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,360
abnormal ulcerations earlier.

76
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,399
What does that indicate?

77
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,560
It means he didn't die
of a sudden heart illness.

78
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,839
He ingested a poison instead.

79
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,560
One that severely damaged

80
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,879
his kidneys and heart meridian
and caused sudden death

81
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:36,990
within a very short time.

82
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,720
This poison can't be detected
with a silver needle.

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,639
Based on the post-mortem results,

84
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,240
it appears to be

85
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,790
some plant-based poison
like the gut-breaking grass.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,990
Such poisons are extremely rare
in the Great Tang.

87
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,639
They're found only in the southwest.

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,839
Southwest?

89
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,319
By the way, in the past,
when you examined a body,

90
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,560
you would inspect every part

91
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,790
before reaching a conclusion.

92
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,720
Why did you only examine
the heart and lungs last time?

93
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,680
I...

94
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,920
I couldn't observe directly then.

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,000
So I had You Chen'an examine it for me.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
His description led me
to a wrong judgment.

97
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,759
I was also worried
that leaving unnecessary incisions

98
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,399
might cause you trouble.

99
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,639
So

100
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,839
I only had him examine his heart.

101
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,319
Chu Chu.

102
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,439
I know I was wrong.

103
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,519
As a coroner,

104
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,759
I had too many
concerns and distractions.

105
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,439
Once I enter the mortuary,

106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,519
I should cast aside
the identity of the deceased,

107
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,480
the case's human entanglements,

108
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,000
and listen only to
what the dead have to say.

109
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,040
Truth is always truth.

110
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,240
No matter how unpleasant it is,

111
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,120
no matter what pressure
bears down upon it,

112
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,860
no matter whose interests are at stake,

113
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,600
it never changes.

114
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,610
What the Three Judicial Offices must do,

115
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,519
what you and I must do,

116
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,879
is to uncover the truth
exactly as it is,

117
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,639
punish the evil by law,

118
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,879
and return justice to the wronged.

119
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,360
Re-examine the body?

120
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,519
The Ministry of Rites hasn't returned
the remains?

121
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,120
They said it was stopped by

122
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,839
Princess Consort An.

123
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,959
I thought that
with the useless fool, You Chen'an,

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,079
signing a post-mortem report,

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
we could tamper with the body

126
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,250
and then shift the blame
onto the Three Judicial Offices.

127
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,560
Who would've thought

128
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,560
they'd start examining it again
themselves?

129
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,439
They walked straight into the trap.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
This was sent
by the Eldest Prince's consort.

131
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:42,759
I looked through it.

132
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,199
They're all your usual
personal garments.

133
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,800
Well, my little sister.

134
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,879
If she has the energy to worry about me,

135
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,160
she might as well hurry up
and bear a son.

136
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,759
Her Highness is showing concern for you.

137
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,759
These roses are growing beautifully.

138
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:08,639
You're right.

139
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,839
But that's exactly why

140
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,079
something's wrong.

141
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,199
Did you find anything?

142
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,920
When Jing Yi and I

143
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:18,199
found this in the Zhao Residence's
front courtyard,

144
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,199
it was sitting under the blazing sun.

145
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,319
I found that strange right away.

146
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,519
With this recent heat,

147
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,879
it would be lucky to survive,

148
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,839
yet it's growing such thick stems.

149
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,800
So you mean

150
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,040
it's been specially tended?

151
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,000
Exactly.

152
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,720
Plants are like people.

153
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,680
Too much heat or cold, and they suffer.

154
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,319
Only when they're comfortable

155
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,279
do they thrive.

156
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,680
What's even stranger is this.

157
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,040
Jing Yi and I were away yesterday.

158
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,140
A thief broke into our home.

159
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,360
Nothing was stolen.

160
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,879
Only smashed a few flower pots.

161
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:59,199
The thief is about Jing Yi's height.

162
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,399
It's a man.

163
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,519
What kind of birth charts are these?

164
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,600
They all bring me bad luck.

165
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,319
Get lost already.

166
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,279
This one is good.

167
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,160
"Great Stream".

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,720
You benefit me.

169
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,839
You should thank your mother for
giving birth to you at the right time.

170
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,360
The thief was after this flower?

171
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,560
I'm sure of it.

172
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,440
The thing is,

173
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,799
he only knew we took the flowers.

174
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:35,799
He didn't know

175
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,920
we brought it straight to
the Three Judicial Offices.

176
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,750
That's why he went searching the house.

177
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,340
(The stamens are normal.
The petals are normal.)

178
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,759
(The stems and leaves are normal.)

179
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,360
It's just a pot of roses.

180
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,800
What secret could it possibly hold?

181
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,480
(The soil color is off.)

182
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,000
Guard.

183
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:51,080
Yes.

184
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,720
Your Highness.

185
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,840
Fetch some fish.

186
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,900
They must be alive.

187
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,480
Yes.

188
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,600
Your Highness, the goldfish are here.

189
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,799
Put them here.

190
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,400
Go get some soil
from the flowerpot in the back.

191
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,679
The goldfish are dead!

192
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,519
Your Highness!

193
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,380
What happened to His Highness?

194
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,679
Your Highness!

195
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,320
Someone said that you...

196
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,080
Chen Feng,

197
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:28,559
didn't you say

198
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,960
someone said

199
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,200
His Highness was dead?

200
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,919
Didn't you say that just now?
[*Goldfish sounds like Jinyu in Chinese.]

201
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,519
I take my leave.

202
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,559
Go, go.

203
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,759
If the soil is poisonous,

204
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,320
why is the rose

205
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,039
blooming even more luxuriously?

206
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,000
It's been sitting
under the noon sun for days,

207
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,320
yet it hasn't wilted at all.

208
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,590
Poison and medicine
have shared the same root.

209
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,879
What's poison to a person

210
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,240
may be rich nourishment

211
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,039
to a plant.

212
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,200
After poisoning Master Shenguan,

213
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,039
the murderer poured the remaining poison
into the flowerpot.

214
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,919
He thought no one would notice.

215
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,920
He never expected you
to arrive so quickly.

216
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,960
But why didn't he simply smash the pot

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
and destroy the evidence completely?

218
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,720
The killer must be very familiar
with the Zhao Residence

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,360
and likely holds a certain status.

220
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:20,260
Only then would he dare poison
Master Shenguan in public

221
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,399
and dispose of the evidence
so effortlessly.

222
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,080
He knew where the flower would go

223
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,360
and knew when you would be away.

224
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,960
He has a build similar to Jing Yi

225
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,120
and knows some martial skills.

226
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,039
- Zhao Senyao.
- Zhao Senyao.

227
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,000
Mother.

228
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,320
My son.

229
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,919
It's hot now.

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,279
Why won't you take a break?

231
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,399
What's wrong with your father?

232
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,879
What kind of post did he get for you?

233
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,159
You spend all day going through
the files of minor officers.

234
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,399
Exhausting and thankless.

235
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,399
My rank as a commandant may not be high,

236
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,120
but there's plenty of benefit to it.

237
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,639
All military officers
of the eighth rank and below

238
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,240
must first pass

239
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,200
my review.

240
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:03,919
I have this very brush.

241
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,039
If I write a few good words,

242
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:09,159
he can step onto the path
of a military career with ease.

243
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,200
If I strike out a line,

244
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,000
no matter how capable he is,

245
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,559
he'll never climb any higher.

246
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,440
Zhao Senyao murdered Master Shenguan?

247
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:17,879
But

248
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,600
what is his motive?

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,879
I'm not sure.

250
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,000
If Zhao Senyao is the murderer,

251
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:26,039
then as you said before,

252
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,600
he had repeatedly abused Qinxiang.

253
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,800
In that case, both Shenguan and Qinxiang

254
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,240
may well be Zhao Senyao's victims.

255
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:34,960
Only to different degrees.

256
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,559
Perhaps we can get the whole picture

257
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,840
from Qinxiang.

258
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,919
Qinxiang was nearly beaten to death
by Zhao Senyao.

259
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,519
She kept muttering something.

260
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,720
Master Shenguan once said
he would cure her illness.

261
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,159
What illness was that?

262
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,840
Something about a condition of the skin.

263
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,399
It's possible

264
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,240
that when Master Shenguan saw something
at the Music Office.

265
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,190
That's why he said that.

266
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,639
Yes.

267
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,919
Qinxiang is the only person

268
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,120
who links to the truth
behind Master Shenguan's death.

269
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,080
We must find a way to make her speak.

270
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
Qinxiang's illness

271
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,560
may be the link
between her and Master Shenguan.

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,759
If we follow this lead

273
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,919
and look into it carefully,

274
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,720
we may uncover the truth.

275
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,639
Junior military officers are easier.

276
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:29,480
Plenty of them

277
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,759
and rotate often.

278
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,440
Grains of sand pile into a tower.

279
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,399
Little by little adds up.

280
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,180
Young master,

281
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
someone wants to see you.

282
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,000
Do they even know the rules?

283
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,759
Show the goods first

284
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:48,759
before we meet.

285
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,320
Cousin.

286
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,120
Commandery Prince An wants to see you.

287
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,000
Why does he want to see me?

288
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,799
You'll know once you get there.

289
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,260
What does Commandery Prince An
want with me?

290
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,340
Probably nothing serious.

291
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,720
Don't worry. I'm here.

292
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,559
I'll make sure big things turn small.

293
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,759
Your Highness,

294
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,039
he's here.

295
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,900
Please have a seat.

296
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,440
Please sit, Senyao.

297
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,120
Serve the tea.

298
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,399
Have some tea, Senyao.

299
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,840
Commandery Prince An, do you meddle

300
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,090
in Ministry of War matters now?

301
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,879
Mr. Zhao, you got drunk and hurt someone
at the Music Office.

302
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,920
Does that fall under
the Ministry of War?

303
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,350
So that's what you're asking about.

304
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
I didn't hurt anyone.

305
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,480
It was just rough play.

306
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,399
Have you not been there?

307
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,519
They have

308
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,360
all kinds of games.

309
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,080
I'm all ears.

310
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,240
So that's what you want to hear?

311
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,159
You've come to the right man.

312
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,159
The tricks those women use there

313
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,879
are far more enticing

314
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,559
than any noble ladies.

315
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,559
Want me to arrange two for you later?

316
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,000
Put it on my tab.

317
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,080
I wasn't careful enough.

318
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,900
My examination methods
weren't thorough.

319
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:32,879
I overlooked this

320
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,919
and let you
and Commandery Prince An down.

321
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,480
How can that be your fault?

322
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,840
You already helped

323
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,639
under great pressure.

324
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,840
Body stiffness can vary

325
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,720
for many reasons.

326
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,320
I failed to think it through

327
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,799
and didn't remind you.

328
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,080
It's good we caught it in time.

329
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,080
But I'm puzzled.

330
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,399
Who would poison
someone like Master Shenguan?

331
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,960
Perhaps

332
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,480
someone can give us the answer.

333
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,350
Your Highness, on His Highness's order,

334
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,660
we've brought the injured person.

335
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,200
Your Highness,

336
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,480
weren't we here

337
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,159
about Mr. Zhao?

338
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,360
Why...

339
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,000
Why is there a body?

340
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,799
Did Mr. Zhao...

341
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,720
Miss Qinxiang,

342
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,039
this is Master Shenguan's body.

343
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,000
You tricked me here,

344
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,759
saying I was here to testify
for Mr. Zhao.

345
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,399
I already said yesterday

346
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,159
that Mr. Zhao is my patron.

347
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,879
It was only flirting.

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,960
Your Highness and sirs,

349
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,600
if there's nothing else,

350
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,559
please let me go.

351
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,120
Don't be afraid, Miss Qinxiang.

352
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,759
We heard Master Shenguan
once treated you for an illness.

353
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,319
What illness did he diagnose?

354
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,119
The dead is gone.

355
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,680
Why bring it up

356
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:12,920
and disturb His Reverence?

357
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:15,599
Master Shenguan passed away
in the Great Tang.

358
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,519
Only his body remains.

359
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,640
We merely wish to fulfill
his unfinished wishes.

360
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,240
Miss Qinxiang,

361
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,960
may I take a look

362
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,680
at your condition?

363
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,519
Wait.

364
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,200
Everyone else, step outside.

365
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:39,759
Chen Feng,

366
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,079
guard the door.

367
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,519
No one is allowed
to enter or see anything.

368
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:44,240
Yes.

369
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,759
I almost forgot.

370
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:50,240
Senyao, what are the characters

371
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,990
in your name again?

372
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:53,160
Three woods for Sen.

373
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,200
Three earth for Yao.

374
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,160
Wood and earth.

375
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,240
Aunt sure has high hopes for you.

376
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:00,799
What do you know?

377
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,799
My birth chart lacks wood and earth.

378
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,990
This name strengthens my fate.

379
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:05,119
Right.

380
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,440
You and Aunt believe in this stuff.

381
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,480
No wonder you invite monks
to chant at home

382
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,799
for something trivial.

383
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,880
I heard from Aunt

384
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,920
that it was your idea
to invite Master Shenguan.

385
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,880
He died so suddenly.

386
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Didn't that scare you?

387
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:27,319
This...

388
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,160
Your Highness, be careful.

389
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,160
This is syphilis.

390
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,079
If it infects you,

391
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,400
I couldn't bear the blame.

392
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:48,480
(Female injured.)

393
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:50,480
(About thirty years old.)

394
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,960
(Red sores
under arms and across shoulders.)

395
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,000
(Lesions bloom outward like petals.)

396
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,279
(Typical syphilis symptoms.)

397
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,599
(Multiple bruises on limbs.)

398
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,599
(Caused by collisions and beating.)

399
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,880
How could he strike so hard?

400
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,640
Your bruises haven't dispersed yet.

401
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,839
With this heat,

402
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,160
infection is very likely.

403
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,599
No need for your concern.

404
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:14,980
It's just how patrons

405
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,440
amuse themselves.

406
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,720
They paid for it.

407
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,680
Hold on.

408
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,990
This bite mark on the first web space
of your right hand

409
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,839
was created about half a month ago.

410
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,559
Am I right?

411
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,119
I'll take my leave.

412
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,600
Whether it's related or not,
we'll know after examination.

413
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,359
Miss Qinxiang,

414
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,039
forgive me.

415
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,559
From the angle of the bite,

416
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,160
you were likely reaching
for the person's mouth.

417
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:03,119
Your hand slipped between their lips,

418
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,200
and they bit down.

419
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:11,880
Your Highness.

420
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,700
(Syphilis, bite marks)

421
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,039
Don't worry.

422
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:27,920
I was just asking.

423
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,759
Stay calm, Mr. Zhao.

424
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,680
I've said all I needed to say.

425
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,119
Don't think I don't know

426
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,680
the rules of the prison.

427
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,119
If you dare set me up,

428
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,640
I'll report this to my aunt,
Consort Hui.

429
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,240
Insolent!

430
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,920
Zhao Senyao, I'm telling you,

431
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,300
just for stirring trouble
in the inner palace

432
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,260
and meddling with the court affairs
as an imperial relative,

433
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,599
I could have you prosecuted.

434
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
Commandery Princr An hits me!

435
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,559
Calm down, Your Highness.

436
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,260
Are you all right, Your Highness?

437
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:08,039
I'm fine.

438
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,440
Look at you.

439
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,500
You've angered His Highness badly.

440
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,640
I'll deal with you later.

441
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:13,559
Chen Feng,

442
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,279
hurry up.

443
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,510
Take His Highness back to rest.

444
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes.

445
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Stop eating.

446
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,799
Clear it away.

447
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,640
He has red sores on him.

448
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,380
(The bite marks on the pear.
The bite wound on Qinxiang's hand.)

449
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,580
That's right.

450
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,240
It's him.

451
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,920
Senyao, you know what?

452
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,990
That day when I went to
visit your residence,

453
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:48,599
Leng Yue insisted on taking a rose.

454
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,420
It wasn't because she liked it.

455
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,480
She said she saw

456
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,079
a ghost.

457
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:54,880
A...

458
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,200
A ghost?

459
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,680
Leng Yue's been around many places
and seen all kinds of things.

460
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,150
I don't believe in that sort of stuff.

461
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,400
But since that rose

462
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,160
was brought back to my house,

463
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,519
strange things kept happening.

464
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:06,920
We never have a peaceful moment.

465
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:07,799
Just last night,

466
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,839
my residence was haunted.

467
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:12,440
A whole bunch of roses got smashed.

468
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,470
I had an expert take a look.

469
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,400
Sure enough, it was that rose
causing trouble.

470
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:15,960
Where

471
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,880
is that rose now?

472
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,210
I talked it over with Leng Yue.

473
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,720
Who in Chang'an do you think

474
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,200
fears ghosts the least?

475
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,359
It's Commandery Prince An.

476
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,839
Where are ghosts most afraid to go?

477
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,519
The Three Judicial Offices.

478
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,319
So Yue and I brought the flowers here
overnight.

479
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,680
You have no idea
how wicked that flower is.

480
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,540
After its soil spilled into
a fish tank nearby,

481
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:36,599
all the fish died.

482
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:37,440
Look.

483
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,400
Hey!

484
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,599
How unlucky! Take it away.

485
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,580
Are you trying to get me hurt?

486
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:45,440
If it weren't for Aunt's sake,

487
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,119
would I even touch
something this cursed?

488
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,039
That expert said

489
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,279
that once the flowerpot breaks,

490
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
the ghost will come out
and cling tightly

491
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,759
to the one it hates most.

492
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Master Shenguan.

493
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,400
Him?

494
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,119
If you were beaten by Zhao Senyao

495
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,279
because you infected him

496
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,759
with syphilis,

497
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,440
then why did Master Shenguan

498
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,680
die?

499
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,510
Your Highness, you're suggesting

500
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,440
that Master Shenguan's death

501
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,240
may have been Zhao Senyao's doing,

502
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,440
and it's connected to Miss Qinxiang?

503
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,920
Zhao Senyao wanted revenge
on Miss Qinxiang,

504
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,039
but Master Shenguan was protecting her.

505
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,000
Even so, he didn't have to go so far
to kill him.

506
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,519
That's an enormous risk.

507
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,079
It doesn't make sense.

508
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:30,799
Exactly.

509
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,720
There must be something more to this.

510
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:34,960
Miss Qinxiang,

511
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,279
Master Shenguan gave you
a large sum of money before he died.

512
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,000
He must've shown you great kindness.

513
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,990
Are you willing to speak the truth

514
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,680
and help us catch the culprit?

515
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,950
If the Music Office finds out that I hid
my illness and still received clients,

516
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
I'd be beaten to death, sir.

517
00:23:58,359 --> 00:23:58,920
Is that so?

518
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,519
Then that would be just perfect.

519
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,519
Qinxiang of the Music Office
is infected with syphilis!

520
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,000
Please spare me, sir.

521
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,680
Oh, merciful Buddha.

522
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:18,559
Sir,

523
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:21,160
why hurt someone

524
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,720
and burden yourself with more sin?

525
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,359
Just as Your Highness deduced,

526
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,839
Master Shenguan was kind to me.

527
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,359
Seeing my misery,

528
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,119
he saved my life.

529
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,319
I just don't know

530
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,039
whether that has anything to do

531
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,680
with his death.

532
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,400
Did Master Shenguan happen
to see you being beaten?

533
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,640
Yes.

534
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:45,400
How did you come to know
Master Shenguan?

535
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,680
Years ago,

536
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,200
when he was down on his luck,

537
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,880
I helped him by chance.

538
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,680
Oh, merciful Buddha.

539
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,039
I'm cultivating at Ciguang Temple.

540
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,119
I'm truly starving.

541
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,119
My apologies for the intrusion.

542
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:06,279
Hold on.

543
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
He was kind by nature,

544
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,440
yet he remembered
that insignificant favor

545
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,920
for many years.

546
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,880
After learning
that I was in the Music Office,

547
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,960
he came that day

548
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:23,160
to persuade me
to redeem myself and leave.

549
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,440
Look.

550
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,680
Not even Commandery Prince An
can suppress it.

551
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,250
If you don't believe me,

552
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,790
keeping it around
will only bring trouble.

553
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,680
Why not smash it?

554
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,359
No!

555
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:36,790
Don't act rashly!

556
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:37,920
Go on.

557
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,839
What else did that expert say?

558
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:40,680
Not smashing it?

559
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,880
No.

560
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,440
He talked so much.

561
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,790
Surely there must be
a way to resolve it.

562
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,640
You're smart.

563
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,279
That expert did give a method

564
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
to drive away evil
and avert disaster.

565
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
What method?

566
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,730
Every grievance has its source.

567
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,200
Every debt has its debtor.

568
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:02,039
What does that mean?

569
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
I won't ask how you harmed Shenguan.

570
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,119
But I believe

571
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,680
you wouldn't kill a monk
for no reason.

572
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,230
It must've been because of someone else.

573
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,720
Tell me who it was.

574
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:14,039
With their natal chart
and residence feng shui,

575
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,519
a small ritual will do.

576
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,200
The vengeful spirit will
go after them, not you.

577
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,200
What?

578
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,519
It was you who bore a grudge
against the monk?

579
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,519
Forget it.

580
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,400
You can't help me.

581
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,200
I owe you a great debt for this.

582
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,990
There's nothing I can say to thank you.

583
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,880
Don't leave just yet.

584
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:39,240
Don't be discouraged.

585
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,920
If we put our heads together,

586
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,850
it's still better
than waiting to die, isn't it?

587
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,910
This is a medicine that promotes
blood flow and disperses bruising.

588
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,720
It may sting a little at first.

589
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,839
Bear with it.

590
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,759
It'll pass soon.

591
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:08,559
Your Highness,

592
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,359
you don't look down on me?

593
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,440
I'm a coroner.

594
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,119
Do you look down on me?

595
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:19,590
I wouldn't dare to.

596
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,410
To a coroner,

597
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,490
there are only two kinds of people
in this world.

598
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:25,839
Those who are dead,

599
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,559
and those who are still alive.

600
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,599
Both are people.

601
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,119
What's there to despise?

602
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,839
You only live once.

603
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,279
As long as you're alive,

604
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,319
you must treat yourself well.

605
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
Prince An summoned Zhao Senyao today.

606
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,160
He won't trouble you again.

607
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,559
Because of me,

608
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,680
Zhao Senyao caught the disease.

609
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,119
He beat me,

610
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,000
and I deserved it.

611
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,039
You didn't do it on purpose.

612
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,640
No.

613
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,799
I knew

614
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,839
I was sick.

615
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,279
I wanted to refuse,

616
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,839
but I never had

617
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,759
any say over my own life.

618
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,519
I was once a courtesan
in a household of a wealthy family.

619
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,640
I became pregnant by accident

620
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,759
and secretly gave birth to the child.

621
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,319
I felt pity for the child.

622
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,119
He only chose the wrong womb,

623
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,400
yet he would have to be
a servant for life.

624
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,599
So I took him and fled,

625
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,000
and came to Chang'an.

626
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,920
Later, to treat his illness,

627
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,759
(Indenture signed by: Qinxiang)
I had only one path left.

628
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,630
I borrowed someone's place of origin,

629
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,319
assumed her name,
and worked at the Music Office.

630
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:39,900
(Indenture signed by: Qinxiang)

631
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
A few months ago,

632
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:43,640
I discovered I had a syphilis infection.

633
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:45,680
I dared not tell anyone.

634
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,240
I never thought

635
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,640
I would infect Mr. Zhao

636
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,839
and make him hate me to the bone.

637
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,599
Come.

638
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,519
Come.

639
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,519
My life,

640
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,359
my body,

641
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,200
they're already rotten through.

642
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,599
At least you saved your child.

643
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,039
Child...

644
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,240
My poor child.

645
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,519
In my second year at the Music Office,

646
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:21,359
a dancer found out.

647
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:23,960
She feared I would affect business,

648
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,839
so she secretly sold my child away.

649
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,039
I don't even know
whether he's alive or dead now.

650
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't lose hope.

651
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,519
He may still be alive.

652
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:39,880
Your Highness,

653
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,279
I believe so too.

654
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:45,240
I endure this life in the Music Office

655
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,799
only to find him

656
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,319
and see him once more.

657
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,559
You've never been a mother.

658
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,759
You don't understand.

659
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,119
Thank you, Your Highness.

660
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,599
I do.

661
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,799
I lost my mother when I was young.

662
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,400
For countless times, I wished

663
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,240
she would come see me in my dreams.

664
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,559
Your child

665
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,039
must miss you too.

666
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,559
You must wait for him.

667
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,680
Borrow time?

668
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,079
Yes.

669
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,720
That wretch Qinxiang made me
catch this disease.

670
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,240
It's incurable!

671
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,759
I don't have long to live.

672
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,990
If not for the ghost guard
helping me borrow time,

673
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,279
I would already be dead.

674
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,359
Ghost guard?

675
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,519
I see.

676
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,240
How ridiculous.

677
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,039
The Three Judicial Offices handle
cases of the dead.

678
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:58,440
We've never seen a ghost,

679
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,920
let alone a ghost guard.

680
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:02,390
Lower your voice.
Don't show disrespect to the ghost guard.

681
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,000
A ghost guard from the underworld
selling you years of life,

682
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,240
yet taking payment in the human world?

683
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,290
You actually believe that?

684
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,359
If anything,
shouldn't it be paper money?

685
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,079
What do you know?

686
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:11,920
It worked.

687
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,799
I was on the brink of death then,

688
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,920
and the ghost guard gave me a pill.

689
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,079
After I took it,

690
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,000
my whole body felt light,
and my spirit revived.

691
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,359
My life

692
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,200
hangs on that pill now.

693
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,400
So when you met Master Shenguan,

694
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,480
you assumed he knew you had syphilis

695
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,200
and the secret of living
on borrowed time?

696
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:33,710
You feared he would alarm
the ghost guard

697
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,079
or subdue you,

698
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,440
so you poisoned

699
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,720
Master Shenguan?

700
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,279
He even offered to cure me.

701
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,440
I didn't want to kill him.

702
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:45,839
But that old monk

703
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,020
followed me from Qinxiang's place
all the way to my home.

704
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,720
Oh, merciful Buddha.

705
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,119
I know there's a secret medicine
in Nanzhao

706
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,400
that can cure your illness.

707
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,319
What can a monk

708
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,039
cure?

709
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,799
You just want to take advantage
of my condition

710
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,799
and swindle me out of money.

711
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,559
I won't take a single coin.

712
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,839
What do you want?

713
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,319
I only hope

714
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,799
you'll no longer trouble Miss Qinxiang.

715
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,599
I will also perform a ritual for you,

716
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,160
praying for your well-being.

717
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,230
The ghost guard found out

718
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,740
the monk was going to
perform a ritual for me and was furious.

719
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,630
He said the monk would drive away
the little spirits treating my illness.

720
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,519
If I wanted to live,

721
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,359
I had to knock the monk out
when he came to the house for the ritual.

722
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,880
Of course,

723
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,090
I accept the ghost guard's task
to keep myself safe.

724
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,880
But I never expected that,

725
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,279
after drinking the drugged tea,

726
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,400
the monk would die.

727
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,200
I was panicked

728
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:47,799
and poured the drugged tea

729
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,000
into this flowerpot.

730
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,039
Well, well. Zhao Senyao.

731
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,200
Ghost guard?

732
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,990
You were fooled by a quack
selling fake medicine!

733
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:58,359
Speak.

734
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,519
Where did you meet him?

735
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,750
I can't summon the ghost guard.

736
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,079
He comes to me.

737
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,680
But I'm certain

738
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,200
he's from Nanzhao.

739
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:06,920
What?

740
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,799
The ghost guard speaks
the Nanzhao language?

741
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,480
No.

742
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,960
But he has a strong Nanzhao accent.

743
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,990
The suspect has committed his crime.

744
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,920
Master Shenguan was killed
by Zhao Senyao.

745
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,759
Compile testimony and evidence

746
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,800
and close the case.

747
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,359
Let's go, Senyao.

748
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,880
(Nanzhao accent?)

749
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,799
(So the mastermind is from Nanzhao.)

750
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,839
(If it was ordered by Nanzhao,)

751
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,400
(Peacock...)

752
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,720
(The King of Nanzhao...)

753
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,470
Both physical evidence and witness

754
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
point to the mastermind
being from Nanzhao.

755
00:33:53,319 --> 00:33:53,759
The exhibit

756
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:54,720
and confession

757
00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:55,960
have been submitted.

758
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,440
Your Majesty, please review them.

759
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,720
The offender on the Great Tang's side

760
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,100
has already been arrested.

761
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:04,960
Zhao Senyao poisoned Master Shenguan

762
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,200
because he fell for
superstitious beliefs.

763
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,880
This has nothing to do

764
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,079
with Consort Hui or the Zhao family.

765
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:12,360
Gao Luoqian,

766
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,440
do you have anything else to say?

767
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,079
Your Majesty,

768
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,880
the examination of Master Shenguan

769
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,039
was signed by
both the Great Tang and Nanzhao.

770
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,960
How can it be overturned so lightly?

771
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:24,320
This is far too reckless.

772
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:26,890
Lord Gao, you've never handled
a case, have you?

773
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,000
Before a case is closed,

774
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,400
a second or third examination

775
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,800
is entirely normal.

776
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,239
Differences in findings

777
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,320
are not unusual.

778
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,590
If Princess Consort An hadn't braved
the pressure to re-examine the body,

779
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,559
you would still believe

780
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,159
Master Shenguan

781
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,559
died suddenly, wouldn't you?

782
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,320
You!

783
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,079
If there are things you don't know,

784
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,480
perhaps you should ask
the King of Nanzhao.

785
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,079
Regardless of what,

786
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:57,199
Zhao Senyao murdered
Master Shenguan from Nanzhao.

787
00:34:57,719 --> 00:34:58,960
He must be punished severely.

788
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:00,620
According to the Great Tang law,

789
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,199
even princes are punished
like commoners,

790
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,800
let alone someone like Zhao Senyao.

791
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,480
Vice Envoy Gao,

792
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:11,159
the Three Judicial Offices
found out that the true culprit

793
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,519
is someone from Nanzhao.

794
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:14,960
We have submitted a diplomatic request

795
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,599
to the Court of Diplomatic Affairs.

796
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,960
This matter

797
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,199
requires Nanzhao to give the Great Tang
an explanation.

798
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,599
Nonsense!

799
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,920
You fail to find the real culprit,

800
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,400
so you blame Nanzhao.

801
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,280
All you have is a criminal's confession.

802
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,559
And

803
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,599
if Nanzhao were responsible,

804
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,719
the victim was a Nanzhao monk.

805
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,719
Why would we owe you an explanation?

806
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,079
Vice Envoy Gao,

807
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:41,079
there are

808
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,400
foreign merchants

809
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,119
or envoys who have died in the capital
due to internal strife,

810
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,920
yet they push the blame
onto the Great Tang.

811
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,000
Prefect Jiang,

812
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,480
what are you implying?

813
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:55,280
Are you saying that I killed
Master Shenguan and framed Great Tang?

814
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,840
That's enough.
This matter is of great importance.

815
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,000
It's not something a vice envoy
can decide.

816
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,639
I'll issue an edict

817
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,280
ordering the King of Nanzhao
to fully cooperate.

818
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,880
Nanzhao must

819
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,239
give us an explanation.

820
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,119
I shall take my leave.

821
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,559
- We shall
- We shall

822
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,960
- take our leave.
- take our leave.

823
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:30,559
Well done.

824
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
It was Chu Chu.

825
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:35,310
She noticed the abnormalities
in Master Shenguan's body

826
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,760
and uncovered the truth.

827
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,400
What?

828
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,360
Are you seeking a reward from me?

829
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:42,960
All right.

830
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,400
I know Chu Chu suffered
some injustice earlier.

831
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,119
But you are husband and wife.

832
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:50,159
You share both honor and ruin.

833
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,719
If you care for her,

834
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,679
you should also restrain yourself.

835
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,440
From now on,

836
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:56,199
act with more caution.

837
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,960
Try not to offend

838
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,519
everyone around you.

839
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,100
- Eldest Prince.
- I want to see my father! Get back.

840
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:10,159
Eldest Prince, you can't go in.

841
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,760
Eldest Prince.

842
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:11,960
Father.

843
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,760
Your Majesty.

844
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:21,800
You're the Crown Prince.

845
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,159
Even if the sky were falling,

846
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,039
you should keep your composure.

847
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,280
Why are you so flustered?

848
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,880
This is unbecoming of a Crown Prince.

849
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,159
Father,

850
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,559
Great Tang has humiliated us
to our very face.

851
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,239
How can I stay calm?

852
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:39,719
You mean Master Shenguan's death?

853
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,790
I want to give them a taste
of their own medicine.

854
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,990
Father, please grant me permission

855
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,370
to send troops to Jiaozhou at once.

856
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:47,880
You're furious

857
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,960
about this?

858
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,719
As a subject of Nanzhao

859
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,039
and a believer in Buddhism,

860
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,150
how could I not be angry?

861
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,480
As a subject of Nanzhao,

862
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,079
of course, you would be angry.

863
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,000
Father,

864
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,880
what do you mean by that?

865
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,480
Your anger

866
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,639
is precisely the turning point
of this affair.

867
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,320
I don't mind telling you.

868
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,800
The death of that eminent monk

869
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,320
did not happen
without my hand behind it.

870
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,039
Father,

871
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:21,159
why?

872
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,039
Shenguan fancied himself compassionate
and meddled in everything.

873
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,880
His death matters little.

874
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:30,039
However, the public wrath

875
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,559
is an invisible weapon.

876
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,039
The real play

877
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,960
has only just begun.

878
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,330
Recently, the Three Judicial Offices
have been watching us closely.

879
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,599
We've lost quite a few people.

880
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:57,880
Yes.

881
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,679
(Peacock, Nanzhao's spy)

882
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:01,800
No mistake is allowed.

883
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,920
Understood,

884
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,960
Lord Peacock.

885
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,360
The plan to assassinate
key officials of the Great Tang

886
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,559
is ready?

887
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,159
This should be the list.

888
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,639
His Majesty just sent
a carrier pigeon over.

889
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,000
(Music Office)

890
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,760
Business

891
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,440
has been booming lately.

892
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:50,039
Even those from
the Three Judicial Offices come here often.

893
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,119
You know very well

894
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:58,280
there are things
you must never speak of.

895
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:01,840
As you instructed,

896
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:03,600
I didn't mention a word

897
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,400
about the drug.

898
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,000
Sir, you said you found

899
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,800
news of my child in Nanzhao,

900
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,360
you weren't lying, were you?

901
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,519
I believe you.

902
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,199
I'm counting on you

903
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,960
to look for my child.

904
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:23,719
Sir,

905
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,039
I've been thinking

906
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
these days.

907
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,119
What is so special about
this scented powder

908
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,079
that makes people crave it?

909
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,840
And why

910
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,199
can it never be revealed to the patrons?

911
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,719
As I said,

912
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,599
the scented powder

913
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,760
is a secret treasure
from the southwest.

914
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,039
Naturally, it can't be known
by the public.

915
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,199
Remember what I said.

916
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,679
No one

917
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,480
is to know about this.

918
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,639
