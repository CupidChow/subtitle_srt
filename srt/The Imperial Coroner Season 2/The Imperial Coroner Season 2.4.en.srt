1
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,750
(I never thought that Your Highness,
constantly occupied with state affairs,)

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,800
(would still remember the third year
since the day we first met.)

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,519
(And even prepare
a surprise especially for me.)

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,960
(The happiness we once shared
remains vividly etched in my mind.)

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,320
(All I ask is to stay with you,)

6
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:30,600
(year after year,
with every moment like today.)

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,359
(At the same time,)

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,000
(we also uncovered that Wu Liang)

9
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,359
(had deceived many palace maids.)

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,370
(Liu'er is one of the people
who suffered the most.)

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,679
(Shi Qing had spoken up on her behalf.)

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,759
(But she and the other palace maids)

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,690
(did not have the courage
to step forward)

14
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,479

Sir, since there is injustice,

34
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,960
the Palace Domestic Service should
retry the case and clear the innocent.

35
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:34,879
This…

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,100
Your Highness,
how should we deal with this?

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,500
Reopen the case.

38
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,120
Come.

39
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,759
If Wu Liang had been killed by my hand,

40
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:58,759
how good that would have been.

41
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,520
No.

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,599
Enough.

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,199
Liu'er.

44
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,319
Are you really going to let Wu Liang

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,199
drag Shi Qing down with him,

46
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,879
all because of your own cowardice?

51

You were waiting for them
to step forward on their own, weren't you?

52
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,080
Yes.

53
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,290
It is like someone sleepwalking.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,039
If they do not wake up by themselves,

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
but are forced awake,

56
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
then it is easy for danger to follow.

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,240
If they do not summon the courage
to step forward themselves,

58
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,360
then even if Shi Qing
dies in their place,

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,390
they will live trapped in nightmares
for the rest of their lives.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,720
This is the full account
of the palace maid Shi Qing's case.

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,920
I never imagined that among women

62
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,199
there would be someone
of such righteousness.

63
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,040
I have issued an edict

64
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,639
declaring Shi Qing innocent.

65
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:35,680
As for the others…

66
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:37,839
Your Majesty.

67
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,000
I am in charge of the inner palace,
and such an incident has occurred.

68
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,880
It is my failure
to discipline them properly.

69
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,550
I ask that Your Majesty entrust
these people to me for punishment.

70
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,040
I will strictly enforce palace rules.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,660
So be it,
as my beloved consort proposes.

72
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

73
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,630
Your Highness.

74
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,360
Wu Jiang said a prisoner
insisted on seeing me by name?

75
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,660
- Shi Qing.
- Commandery Princess Consort An.

76
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,040
Why are you here?

77
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,480
In Wu Liang's case,

78
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,800
Shi Qing requested
the strictest case closing procedure.

79
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:15,240
She took advantage of this chance
to leave the palace

80
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,160
especially to see you.

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,980
Take your time and talk.

82
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,120
It seems you really are all right now.

83
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Come.

84
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,519
Sit.

85
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,660
What about Liu'er and the others?

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,990
Here is what happened.

87
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,879
Consort Hui told His Majesty
she would expel them from the palace,

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,399
but in truth she had the palace official
suppress the matter,

89
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,990
and forbade any discussion
within the palace.

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,680
After the Chinese New Year,

91
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,079
she will let them leave
the palace together

92
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,290
with a group of older palace maids.

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,279
Consort Hui is truly a kind person.

94
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,040
You are kind as well.

95
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,730
Commandery Princess Consort An.

96
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,639
This is a gift that Liu'er and the others
asked me to give you.

97
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,120
It is not worth much,
just a small token of all our gratitude.

98
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,519
It is so beautiful.

99
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,800
I like it very much.

100
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,830
Please thank them for me.

101
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,839
It is we who should be thanking you.

102
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,000
If not for your help,

103
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,240
I fear

104
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,800
I would not be alive now.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,090
And Liu'er and the others

106
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,190
would have lived in pain
for the rest of their lives.

107
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,680
The duty of the Three Judicial Offices
is to uncover the truth of every case.

108
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,199
It was your courage in standing together
that saved yourselves.

109
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,800
The Emperor's birthday
has already passed.

110
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,590
Nanzhao submitted a memorial and sent an envoy
to the capital to offer congratulations.

111
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,439
Gao Luoqian.

112
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,860
Why has the delegation
still not arrived in the capital?

113
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,639
(Gao Luoqian, Vice Envoy of Nanzhao)
I beg Your Majesty to calm your anger.

114
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,160
To show our sincerity,

115
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,890
my king personally dispatched the Second Prince
to lead the mission and offer birthday wishes.

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,560
For reasons unknown,
contact was suddenly lost along the way.

117
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,399
Great Tang spans vast lands.

118
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,639
Anything could happen along the way,

119
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,639
could it not?

120
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,920
Vice Envoy Gao is quite skilled
at accusing others first.

121
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,319
Over the past half year, more than
ten thousand of Great Tang's people

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,980
have gone missing
near the Nanzhao border.

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,120
Nanzhao has yet to cooperate
with the investigation,

124
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,000
yet Vice Envoy Gao turns the tables,

125
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:12,000
attempting to pin the Second Prince's
disappearance on Great Tang.

126
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,790
Forgive me for speaking plainly.

127
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,920
Those people of Great Tang,

128
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,439
were they truly abducted,
or did they defect?

129
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,160
Commandery Prince An,
have you investigated this thoroughly?

130
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,990
According to findings obtained
by the Three Judicial Offices,

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,710
Nanzhao sent covert agents
who used gold mining

132
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,639
and high pay as bait,

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,879
luring Great Tang's people into Nanzhao.

134
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,590
From that point on,
they vanished without a trace.

135
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,100
Vice Envoy Gao has read the case files.

136
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,439
At a moment like this,

137
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,920
why pretend ignorance?

138
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,399
Enough.

139
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Both of you, say no more.

140
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,160
How could the Nanzhao delegation
disappear within Great Tang?

141
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:45,839
Huang Lv.

142
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,399
Explain to me what truly happened.

143
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,500
Reporting to Your Majesty,

144
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:51,839
one month ago,

145
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,040
the Nanzhao delegation
entered Great Tang through Jiaozhou.

146
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,660
However, the delegation deliberately shook off
the Vice Minister of the Court of Diplomatic Affairs.

147
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:00,790
(Huang Lv)
It is unclear what Nanzhao intended

148
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,879
(Vice Minister of Rites)
by acting in this manner.

149
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,360
By Lord Huang's account,

150
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,360
could it be that covert agents

151
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,500
deliberately obstructed
the Second Prince's entry into the capital,

152
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,690
in order to undermine relations
between our two states?

153
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,199
(Yu Luo,
maid to the Second Prince of Nanzhao)

154
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:26,759
Your Highness.

155
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,759
Have some water.

156
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,919
They poisoned us
six times along the way.

157
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,919
Now that we are
within Great Tang territory,

158
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,519
they finally seem more restrained.

159
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,440
I doubt they will strike again.

160
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,759
I only fear my dear elder brother
will act out of desperation.

161
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,200
Chang'an…

162
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,440
How could he ever allow me to enter?

163
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
Whoa.

164
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,039
Hyah!

165
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,960
Enemy attack!

166
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:07,360
Hyah!

167
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,720
Get the Second Prince out first!

168
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,000
Hyah!

169
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,679
Hyah!

170
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,440
Hyah!

171
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:21,639
Hyah!

172
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,530
(You Chen'an, Second Prince of Nanzhao)
Split up.

173
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,620
(Chief Envoy of Nanzhao)
Protect yourselves.

174
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,520
We regroup at the mountain pass.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,799
Yes.

176
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,559
Do not let him enter the forest!

177
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,519
Stop him!

178
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,940
Make sure he does not reach the woods!

179
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,799
Stay alert.

180
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,680
Split up and search!

181
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,759
Vice Envoy Gao,

182
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:43,399
do not make reckless assumptions.

183
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,600
Within Great Tang territory,

184
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,480
Commandery Prince An oversees

185
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,320
all prefectural and county offices.

186
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,399
How could the Second Prince
possibly come to harm?

187
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,600
(Jiang Daohai, Prefect of the Capital)
Well… If the Second Prince

188
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,879
were to suffer any mishap
within Great Tang,

189
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,919
I trust Commandery Prince An

190
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,039
would assume full responsibility,

191
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,930
and carry out the imperial command
without fail.

192
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,000
Then the safety of our Second Prince
will depend entirely on

193
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:13,799
Commandery Prince An.

194
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
Xiao Jinyu.

195
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,320
You will personally
investigate this matter.

196
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,200
It concerns relations
between our two states,

197
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,540
so it must be handled with utmost care.

198
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:23,960
In urgent situations,

199
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,519
you may act first and report later.

200
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:29,960
Yes.

201
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,639
Girl.

202
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,559
What you are eating

203
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,159
is far too plain.

204
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,559
You should eat better.

205
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,480
I know.

206
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,200
He.

207
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,799
You rushed to see me so late.

208
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,639
Did something happen?

209
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,120
Something did happen.

210
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,320
What is it?

211
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:55,759
It is about my business.

212
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,559
I have a partner
who opened a pharmacy in the capital.

213
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,110
He plans to return home and retire,
and sell it at a low price.

214
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,159
So I thought...

215
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,480
You might want to take it over?

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,879
I already have.

217
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,120
That is wonderful.

218
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,960
Then you will stay in the capital.

219
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,399
Where is the pharmacy?

220
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,240
Is it far?

221
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,720
Where will you live?

222
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,919
Does the pharmacy need help?

223
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,759
Slow down.

224
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,000
One question at a time.

225
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,659
He will stay at the manor.

226
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,600
Really?

227
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,720
Does Your Highness think

228
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,759
I am being a burden?

229
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,480
Chu Chu misses home.

230
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,360
If you are willing to live here,
it will ease her homesickness.

231
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,690
I should be thanking you.

232
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,279
As for anything else,

233
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,840
tell me whenever you need help.

234
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:38,080
As for the rest,
there is no need to trouble you.

235
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,320
I can handle it myself.

236
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,600
Thank you for your support.

237
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,960
Much obliged for coming.

238
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,440
The pharmacy is officially open.

239
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:09,000
(Chang Shou, Duo Fu, pharmacy clerk)
Our shop owner is kindhearted

240
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,559
and has prepared Prince An's recommended

241
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,080
secret herbal health tea.

242
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,120
For the next three days,
it is free of charge.

243
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,360
- Good.
- Excellent.

244
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,080
Everyone, please mind your safety.
Do not push.

245
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,000
There is enough for everyone.

246
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,679
Look how enthusiastic everyone is.

247
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,000
I am the elder brother of Chu Chu,
the Commandery Prince An's brother-in-law.

248
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:22,970
My word is my bond.

249
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,440
Good!

250
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:25,220
By the way,

251
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,080
anyone who knows my sister Chu Chu,

252
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,570
when buying medicine,

253
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,240
will receive a discount
without exception.

254
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,399
Good.

255
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,860
And what about those
who know Commandery Prince An?

256
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:36,450
Anyone who knows Commandery Prince An,

257
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,240
gets a bowl of cooling tea.

258
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,679
Please, everyone.

259
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,559
This way, please.

260
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,679
Inside, please, inside.

261
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,679
Qianzhou salted vegetables.

262
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,879
This flavor is one
of a kind in the capital.

263
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Whenever you crave it,

264
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,080
come by anytime.

265
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:01,200
Is it good?

266
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,480
Girl, eat more.

267
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,240
There is plenty.

268
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,360
Sir, have you finished your meal?

269
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,480
Soft murmurs linger,
tender yet unspoken.

270
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,590
Please come again
after you have finished, sir.

271
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,720
Soft murmurs linger,
tender yet unspoken.

272
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,780
When pepper blossoms fall,
the miasma begins to rise.

273
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:46,990
My Lord, what are your instructions?

274
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,450
Come with us
to the Three Judicial Offices.

275
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,559
It's nothing.

276
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,100
Your Highness.

277
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,350
It was fortunate you had me
patrol the streets on the Emperor's birthday.

278
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,519
Otherwise, we would not have
exposed this Nanzhao spy.

279
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,360
Lord Jing.

280
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:06,320
I truly

281
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,000
do not understand what you mean.

282
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,559
During the Emperor's birthday,

283
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,519
your people made far
too many small moves.

284
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,480
I was simply curious.

285
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,039
Gao Luoqian is still in Chang'an,

286
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
yet the Nanzhao delegation
has not arrived.

287
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,159
Who are you waiting for?

288
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,320
Wu Jiang.

289
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,519
Come help His Highness.

290
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,320
What are you doing?

291
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,290
Your Highness.

292
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,080
Your Highness.

293
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,600
Your Highness, I am just...

294
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,840
I am merely a common man.

295
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,660
Reporting to Your Highness.
He has confessed.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
However, he is a newly
activated covert agent of Nanzhao.

297
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,990
He only knows to take orders
from the Peacock.

298
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,919
Beyond that, he knows nothing for now.

299
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:44,879
The Peacock?

300
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,679
What should we do next?

301
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,300
Keep him under close watch for now.

302
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
Do not alert the enemy.

303
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,960
Recently, within Chang'an,

304
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,360
have there been frequent
or unusual activities by foreigners?

305
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,360
Aside from Gao Luoqian,

306
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,960
there are only Nanzhao merchants
doing business in the city.

307
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,970
Keep a close watch on Gao Luoqian
and those Nanzhao merchants.

308
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,519
Yes.

309
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,279
(Chen Feng,
guard to Commandery Prince An)

310
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,380
Your Highness.
We have located the Nanzhao delegation.

311
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,940
Our men were patrolling
the outskirts of the capital

312
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,159
and happened upon their convoy.

313
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,470
They claimed they had lost their way,
which delayed them for several days.

314
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,380
By noon tomorrow, they will reach
the outskirts of the capital.

315
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,990
Inform the Ministry of Rites.
Prepare to receive the Nanzhao envoys.

316
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,990
The Court of Diplomatic Affairs
may prepare a banquet.

317
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,759
From today onward, all offices
of the Three Judicial Offices

318
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,310
are to cooperate
with the Prefect of the Capital,

319
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
to ensure absolute security
within the capital.

320
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,120
Yes.

321
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,320
At last, they have arrived.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,360
My Lord.

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,330
A confidential letter from court.

324
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,860
(Hong Luan, maid to Gao Luoqian)

325
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,519
(Covert assets activated.)

326
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,660
(The Peacock
assumes control of the spy network.)

327
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,320
(Full cooperation is imperative.)

328
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,330
The King has ordered me
to give full cooperation,

329
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,919
yet this Peacock
still refuses to show himself.

330
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,799
How am I supposed
to cooperate fully like this?

331
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,240
Who would have thought

332
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:14,839
that the ever-stoic Commandery Prince An

333
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,839
would have such a weakness.

334
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,920
His feet are ticklish.

335
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:23,039
Your Highness.

336
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,260
Isn't the Commandery Princess
Consort An also ticklish?

337
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,720
Chu Chu.

338
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,799
I am sorry.

339
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Since our marriage,

340
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,850
I have dragged you into
the Three Judicial Offices every day,

341
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,890
and scarcely spent proper time with you.

342
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:45,160
Why are you apologizing
all the time lately?

343
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,890
Aren't you keeping me company
right now, soaking our feet together?

344
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,319
Investigating cases
and examining bodies,

345
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,990
this kind of life
is actually quite interesting.

346
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,119
Besides,

347
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,079
the palace treats me
much differently now.

348
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,070
Liu'er even said

349
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,590
that after leaving the palace, she wants
to learn to be a coroner from me.

350
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,360
It was you who changed
how they see things.

351
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,400
In a few days, the Three Judicial Offices
will recruit new coroners.

352
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,590
You will be even busier then.

353
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
That's true.

354
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,759
Time really does fly.

355
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,300
Back when the coroner selection
was held three years ago,

356
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,160
it was Your Highness
who set my examination.

357
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,839
You were exceptionally bold that day.

358
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,799
You tried to strip me
the moment you stepped up.

359
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,319
Your Highness.

360
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,720
This year's new coroners

361
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,039
must be outstanding as well.

362
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,160
I want to exchange ideas
with them properly.

363
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,000
All right.

364
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,990
Let's set official matters
aside for now.

365
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,940
Tomorrow's reception of the delegation

366
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,650
does not require you
or Leng Yue to worry.

367
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,490
The two of you can go along
and relax for a couple of days.

368
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,440
But...

369
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,960
Who exactly is coming
with the Nanzhao delegation this time?

370
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,400
Nanzhao's Second Prince.

371
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,810
The adopted son of the King of Nanzhao.

372
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,279
Vice Envoy Gao.

373
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,240
Is this truly how

374
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:55,319
the Nanzhao delegation
enters Great Tang?

375
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,780
Prefect Jiang,
please do not take offense.

376
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,079
Something must have gone wrong
on the road.

377
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,599
Why were you delayed for so long?

378
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,460
Is this all there is of your party?

379
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,400
Yu Luo?

380
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,100
Where is the Second Prince?

381
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,260
We apologize
for keeping all the lords waiting.

382
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,599
You Chen'an, Chief Envoy of Nanzhao.

383
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,200
By royal command,
he bear the state letter to Great Tang.

384
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,450
Since you bear the state letter,

385
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,400
where is the principal envoy?

386
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,039
Though Nanzhao lies in distant lands,

387
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,599
surely it cannot be ignorant
of such basic protocol.

388
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,480
Yu Luo.

389
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,599
Where is the Second Prince?

390
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,799
It is one thing for him to act
as he pleases in Nanzhao,

391
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,119
but surely he would not

392
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,990
show such discourtesy
before Great Tang as well.

393
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,160
We ask the lords
for their understanding.

394
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,359
The journey was long and exhausting,

395
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,279
and the Chief Envoy is unwell.

396
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,690
He feared his appearance
might be improper and offend protocol,

397
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,190
so he asked me to speak on his behalf.

398
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,519
According to Great Tang etiquette,

399
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,990
the principal envoy
must alight from the carriage.

400
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:49,400
Why has it taken so long to even enter?

401
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,759
They are locked in a standoff.

402
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,400
Diplomacy between states

403
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,079
is always a matter

404
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,200
of who gains the upper hand.

405
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,720
At some point, they start competing,

406
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,360
and then it turns into open quarreling.

407
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,759
You make it sound
like a brawl at the village gate.

408
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,319
That is exactly it.

409
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,359
Let me tell you,

410
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,440
this kind of wrangling

411
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,039
is best left to the Prince.

412
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,360
You need not trouble yourself.

413
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,000
Here.

414
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:14,920
Have a grape.

415
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,720
Enough, Yu Luo.

416
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,440
All this evasion and concealment

417
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,079
could it be that something has happened
to the Second Prince?

418
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,519
Lord Gao.

419
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,519
We meet again.

420
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,759
You are unharmed?

421
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,000
Did Lord Gao wish that I were not?

422
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,799
It was nothing more
than a minor chill on the road.

423
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,359
I only feared passing it
on to the lords.

424
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,990
Thank you all
for coming so far to receive me.

425
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,839
I was rushing along the journey,

426
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,880
and thus caught a bout of chills.

427
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,950
That is why I was forced
to delay for some days.

428
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,370
My father has written
in earnest sincerity,

429
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,990
hoping that Nanzhao and Great Tang
may remain in lasting amity.

430
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:44,780
He wishes His Majesty of Great Tang
long life and peace without worry.

431
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,060
The envoy has traveled a long distance.

432
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,280
If you are feeling unwell,

433
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,119
then I shall accompany the envoy

434
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,000
to rest first at the outer palace.

435
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:01,279
I presume

436
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,640
this must be Commandery Prince An.

437
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,270
I have long heard of you.

438
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,680
The palace banquet
will be held in three days.

439
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,440
The following seven days

440
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,390
are set aside for exchange between
the envoys of all regions and Great Tang.

441
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,290
The Chief Envoy's return to the capital
is scheduled for the seventh day of next month.

442
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,240
Chief Envoy.

443
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,200
Chief Envoy.

444
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,400
My Lord.

445
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,319
If there is anything,

446
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
please inform my maid instead.

447
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,160
I am weary and wish to rest first.

448
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,839
The Chief Envoy has traveled far.

449
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,519
You should indeed have a good rest.

450
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,890
Many thanks, Commandery Prince An.

451
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,319
Greetings to Commandery Princess
Consort An.

452
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:54,990
- Greetings to Commandery Princess Consort An.
- Greetings to Commandery Princess Consort An.

453
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,190
Greetings, Commandery Princess Consort An.

454
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,920
Your rooms have already been prepared.

455
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,880
Some refreshments
have also been arranged.

456
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:05,000
May the Chief Envoy uphold
Nanzhao's long-held wish on this journey,

457
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,380
to restore harmony with Great Tang

458
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,990
and secure peace along the borders.

459
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,090
Thank you, Princess Consort.

460
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,759
Thank you, Commandery Prince An.

461
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:26,160
Your Highness.

462
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,160
Careful.

463
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,359
Please.

464
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,690
Your Highness.

465
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,690
There is something wrong
with You Chen'an.

466
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,610
At first glance,
his movements seemed normal,

467
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:46,000
(Steps were unsteady)
but in truth his footing was weak.

468
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,359
(Leaning on his maid)
He was relying on that maid to support his weight.

469
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,799
His voice lacked strength when he spoke.

470
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:51,960
As for his complexion,

471
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:54,240
(Rouge and powder)
it was clearly concealed with makeup.

472
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,359
Something is clearly off.

473
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,780
Your Highness.

474
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,580
Your Highness.

475
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:00,790
Are you all right?

476
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,790
I felt something was wrong
when I saw him at the gate as well.

477
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,880
Let's go take a look.

478
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:15,799
Who is it?

479
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,319
Chief Envoy.

480
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,890
I am the Commandery Princess Consort An.

481
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,990
May I ask what brings
the Princess Consort here?

482
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,559
I believe you may need assistance.

483
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,640
Do not worry.

484
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,400
Only the Prince and I are here.

485
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,990
Great Tang will not allow the Chief Envoy
of Nanzhao to come to harm.

486
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,279
Open the door.

487
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,640
I sensed something was wrong earlier.

488
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,450
Your complexion is poor
and you need treatment immediately.

489
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,160
I am a coroner.

490
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,520
I can examine your injuries first.

491
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,279
A coroner?

492
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,839
Princess Consort, are you treating
our prince like a corpse?

493
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,559
Yu Luo.

494
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,960
Besides,

495
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,000
His Highness's body

496
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,000
cannot possibly be examined
by a strange woman.

497
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,680
Then I will give instructions,
and you may carry them out.

498
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,470
Is that acceptable?

499
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,359
Please first cleanse your hands
with hot water and strong liquor.

500
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,880
The wound was treated with great care,

501
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,640
but there is still residual poison.

502
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,440
The wound must be cleaned at once.

503
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,400
Please sprinkle this lime
over the wound first.

504
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,150
Fortunately, it has not suppurated yet.

505
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,290
Had it been delayed any longer,
it would have been fatal.

506
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,039
Why did you not seek treatment earlier?

507
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:45,880
On the road here,

508
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,960
I happened to be saved
by an old acquaintance.

509
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,640
He treated my wound.

510
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,519
As it happens,

511
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,640
he too was a coroner.

512
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,799
If not for him,

513
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,700
I would not have had the strength
to reach Great Tang.

514
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,340
Being able to see the Prince
and Princess Consort

515
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,180
was already the limit
of what I could manage.

516
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,990
Then why did you pretend
to be well just now?

517
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,799
What were you worried about?

518
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:11,660
Commandery Prince An.

519
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,759
The real danger

520
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,000
has never lain
in a relationship like ours,

521
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,240
one that only appears to be opposed.

522
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,759
It lies in the shadows,

523
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,079
in places unseen.

524
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,100
Now that I have come to Great Tang,

525
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,559
I entrust my very life

526
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,039
to the Princess Consort.

527
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,480
Your Highness.

528
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,240
Your Highness.

529
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,000
Your Highness.

530
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,839
(Hanguang Gate)

531
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:43,480
Next one.

532
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,039
What is this?

533
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,160
Open it and see.

534
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,680
All right.

535
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,359
Next.

536
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,519
Hurry up.

537
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,890
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

538
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,720
No suspicious activity
was found in the shops or inns.

539
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,190
There were no suspicious persons
on the streets either.

540
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,240
Move.

541
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:15,920
Go on.

542
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,799
Thank you, officer.

543
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Where are you going?

544
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,750
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

545
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:27,599
Talk.

546
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:29,640
Who ordered you?

547
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,720
Why assassinate the principal envoy?

548
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,300
If you want to kill me, then do it.

549
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,480
Stop wasting your breath.

550
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,079
Trying to play
fearless martyr in front of me?

551
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,079
Chen Ming, originally named An Da,
a native of Nanzhao.

552
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,020
Half a year ago, you secretly
settled your wife and child

553
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:45,690
in a private residence
outside the capital.

554
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,200
You chose your hiding place well.

555
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,960
The outskirts of the capital
are indeed hard to search.

556
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,279
But you ran into me.

557
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:54,039
I will give you two choices.

558
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,799
First, you keep your mouth shut.

559
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:59,640
I send your wife and child
to join you on the road.

560
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,359
Second,

561
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,920
you tell the truth.

562
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,300
I will report to the Prince

563
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,500
and secure Great Tang citizenship
for your entire family,

564
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,039
so you may settle here for good.

565
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:15,000
Which will it be?

566
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,600
Your Highness.

567
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,850
The remaining poison
has been forced out,

568
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,799
but he has not regained consciousness yet.

569
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,640
His injuries are severe.

570
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,200
He will need a long period of rest.

571
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,690
Thank you for your trouble, Physician.

572
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,300
What happened today
must remain strictly confidential.

573
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes.

574
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,839
Your Highness.

575
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,990
Our deepest thanks to the Prince
and Princess Consort for saving his life.

576
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,799
You may speak now.

577
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,410
What dangers did you encounter
on the way to the capital?

578
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,279
Along the journey,

579
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:48,119
we were attacked again and again.

580
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,130
The Second Prince
narrowly escaped death.

581
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,559
Fortunately, he grew up in forest lands,

582
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,260
and used the cover of the woods

583
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,160
to evade pursuit.

584
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,190
By further fortune, an old acquaintance
came to his aid.

585
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,079
After that,

586
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,980
we disguised ourselves and split
from the guards to travel separately.

587
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,680
Even so,

588
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,720
danger followed us at every step.

589
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,160
Thus, we finally reached Chang'an
after countless hardships.

590
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,880
Do you know who was behind it?

591
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,839
I fear my dear brother
was driven to desperation.

592
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,160
Chang'an.

593
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:21,319
How could he ever allow me to enter?

594
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,480
- Please.
- Please.

595
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,319
- Please.
- Please.

596
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,540
Fill the cup.

597
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,100
Please.

598
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,799
Your Highness.

599
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,519
Something about Nanzhao
feels strange to me.

600
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,039
Lord Gao seems indifferent

601
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,500
to whether the Second Prince
lives or dies.

602
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,720
And that Second Prince himself

603
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,279
is more guarded against
his own people than against us.

604
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,079
When will we see
the truth of court politics?

605
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,920
Leng Yue says this is what comes
from constant exposure,

606
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,190
that the pupil surpasses the master.

607
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,480
The Nanzhao royal court

608
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,400
is far from peaceful.

609
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,359
This Gao Luoqian

610
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,119
is the elder brother
of the Crown Princess of Nanzhao.

611
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,599
The siblings are extremely close.

612
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,090
He is a staunch supporter
of the Eldest Prince.

613
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,480
However, there are some matters

614
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,279
that only require us
to observe and wait.

615
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,210
First, this is Nanzhao's
internal affair.

616
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,079
Second, power struggles

617
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,900
will inevitably
bring disaster upon Nanzhao.

618
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,160
For Great Tang,

619
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,680
it brings benefit and no harm.

620
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,440
As for me, I will simply focus on
curing the Second Prince,

621
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,710
and make sure his life does not
bring trouble to Great Tang.

622
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,759
You're wise.

623
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,160
Good.

624
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,000
You are quite bold.

625
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,119
Daring to assassinate the Chief Envoy
of Nanzhao right under my watch.

626
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:14,840
He swallowed poison.

627
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:15,920
He is dead.

628
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,039
Your Highness.

629
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,410
The man held
in the Three Judicial Offices has awakened.

630
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,820
(See the Wind and Listen to the Rain)

631
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,239
Second Prince.

632
00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:00,310
Where is Commandery Prince An?

633
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,719
Your Highness...

634
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,960
The Prince has not yet returned.

635
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:03,880
To ensure your safety,

636
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,100
you have been secretly placed
within the Three Judicial Offices.

637
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:06,920
I am Jing Yi.

638
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,159
Vice Minister Jing.

639
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,079
The Second Prince knows me?

640
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,750
Before departing on the mission,
I familiarized myself a little

641
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,490
with the names of officials
ranked fourth grade and above.

642
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,440
How is your recovery?

643
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,199
Much better.

644
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,440
Let me show you around.

645
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,580
(See the Wind and Listen to the Rain)

646
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,400
(Discern the Bigger Picture
from Small Hints)

647
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,719
This is the coroner's room.

648
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:39,320
This is where the Commandery
Princess Consort An works.

649
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,910
Truly, seeing it in person
surpasses all I have heard.

650
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,480
Your Highness.

651
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:51,920
Second Prince.

652
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,880
You have been very attentive
toward Great Tang.

653
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,280
I have lived
between cracks since childhood,

654
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,920
long under the eaves of the royal court.

655
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,660
Lowering my head
and bending myself became habit.

656
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,559
Second Prince, you overstate it.

657
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,350
As the Chief Envoy visiting our court,

658
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,410
Great Tang must of course
treat you with propriety.

659
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,920
Thank you, Commandery Prince An.

660
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,890
As for the life-saving kindness shown
by the Princess Consort yesterday.

661
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,540
The residual poison in your body
has not been fully cleared.

662
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:16,960
Your wounds have yet to heal.

663
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,960
You should rest more and worry less.

664
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,519
Those who pursued you relentlessly,

665
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:24,840
bent on taking your life,

666
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,079
do you know who stands behind them?

667
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,119
If they were bandits of Great Tang,

668
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,639
I would spare no effort

669
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,559
to hunt down the truth.

670
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,290
I will give you an explanation,

671
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,280
so that no rift arises
between Great Tang and Nanzhao.

672
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,390
Those in Nanzhao who wish me dead

673
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,880
are hardly just one or two.

674
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,000
My apologies, Chen'an.

675
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,868
(You Longsheng, Eldest Prince of Nanzhao)
Thinking back,

676
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:02,920
(You Longsheng, Eldest Prince of Nanzhao)
you were raised in the hunting grounds as a child.

677
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,320
(You Longsheng, Eldest Prince of Nanzhao)
I carelessly confused you

678
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,039
with those beasts.

679
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,079
You labors day and night
to ease Father's worries.

680
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,730
If your eyes blur at times,

681
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,880
that is only natural.

682
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,119
Still, it cannot compare to
how deeply Father values you.

683
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,119
Such an honor as representing Nanzhao
at the Emperor's Birthday Festival

684
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,639
could even fall to you.

685
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,440
You misunderstand.

686
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,039
This mission to Great Tang

687
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,280
was long and arduous.

688
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,840
There were dangers along the road.

689
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,159
Father values you deeply,

690
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,360
so he would never send you
far from the capital.

691
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,320
Come.

692
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,639
Take a look at what I have hunted.

693
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,000
Who knows,

694
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,519
it may even be
an old acquaintance of Chen'an.

695
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:44,719
When I was ten,

696
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,590
my father took me in as his adopted son
and brought me into the palace.

697
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,639
From that day on,
I became a thorn in everyone's side.

698
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,239
That is only natural.

699
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,840
The court once balanced among factions

700
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,960
suddenly gained an unknown variable.

701
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,730
Of course they would
want me gone at once.

702
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
By your account,

703
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,880
the King of Nanzhao
was testing the waters.

704
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,000
Perhaps I was merely the stone.

705
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:10,559
Who can say.

706
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,039
In recent years,
Nanzhao itself has grown more stable,

707
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,199
yet within the court,

708
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:18,280
chaos only deepens.

709
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,599
Entangled interests,

710
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,079
countless eyes fixed on the throne.

711
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,000
My uncles and elder kinsmen,
every one of them wants a hand in it.

712
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,599
Fortunately, I have come to Chang'an.

713
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,159
They dare not act rashly for now.

714
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,180
We should thank the Second Prince

715
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,320
for speaking so frankly.

716
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,159
You have shared much
of Nanzhao's situation.

717
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,800
Even if you had not,

718
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,920
the Three Judicial Offices
would have uncovered it in time.

719
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,000
My candor

720
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,079
is meant as thanks
for your saving my life.

721
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,450
I still must prepare
for the palace banquet.
