00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,770
(Liu'er and the palace maids
finally cast aside their fear.)

2
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,559
(They step forward with courage
to testify for Shi Qing.)

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,790
(The truth of the case
is finally laid bare.)

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,160
(It is also hoped
that in the days to come,)

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,879
(they may all live without fear.)

00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,199
(The Second Prince
of Nanzhao, You Chen'an)

(enters the capital to celebrate
the Emperor's birthday.)

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,090
(Yet he suffers repeated
assassination attempts by the Eldest Prince.)

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,520
(While escorting the Second Prince,)

10
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,320
(Steps were unsteady)
(Chu Chu perceives the slightest irregularity.)

11
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:38,159
(Leaning on his maid)
(She secretly helps him neutralize the poison.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,380
(This story is entirely fictional.)

29
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,700
=Episode 5=

30
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,400
These past few days,

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
I have uncovered
every Nanzhao spy in the capital.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,660
What did you get out of them?

33
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,680
Did you find any news about Peacock?

34
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,599
Except for this Peacock,

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,639
I could not trace even a single feather.

36
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,080
However,

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,680
Nanzhao recently sent a revered monk.

38
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,719
He is Master Shenguan.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,990
The nobles of the capital hold him
in the highest regard.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,479
Even Consort Hui invited him
to conduct rituals.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,790
Keep a close watch.

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,790
Nanzhao may take advantage
of this to stir trouble.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,290
We must not let down our guard.

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,100
(Mahavira Hall)

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,159
Master.

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,879
I am a member of the household
of Vice Minister Zhao of the Ministry of Rites.

47
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,990
I wish to invite you to our residence
to conduct a prayer ritual for blessings.

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,840
(Master Shenguan, eminent monk of Nanzhao)
Benefactor need only hold sincere faith.

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,479
The Buddha will surely respond.

50
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,879
Sincere faith?

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,159
My heart is most sincere.

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,199
I heard earlier from the young monk that

53
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,680
(Jing Yuan, disciple of Shenguan)
your prayer services are already fully scheduled.

54
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,159
Benefactor,

55
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,560
my master's prayer rituals
during this visit

56
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:36,840
are indeed fully booked.

57
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,580
Knowing that master's
great virtue and renown,

58
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,000
I therefore reported this matter
to Consort Hui.

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,000
This is Her Highness's
handwritten letter.

60
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I humbly ask the Master
to grant this request

61
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,240
for Her Highness's sake.

62
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,759
Benefactor,

63
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,479
since your heart is truly sincere,

64
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,439
I shall go.

65
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,240
Thank you, Master.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,079
Master,

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,399
this is ominous.

68
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,839
Enough.

69
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,399
All is fate.

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,600
Master,

71
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,000
you sensed it
already outside the temple,

72
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,879
yet you have always
followed Heaven's will.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,120
Why did you refuse Mrs. Zhao at first?

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,879
This journey to Great Tang

75
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,199
is for one matter of utmost importance.

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,480
It concerns both our lives.

77
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,680
I wished to avoid
unnecessary entanglements,

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,600
lest they invite

79
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,160
further complications.

80
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,079
In Great Tang,
keeping exotic pets has become common.

81
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,519
There are even peacocks.

82
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,839
All are tribute animals
sent from various regions.

83
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,839
Now,

84
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,959
this peacock has flown into the temple.

85
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,079
It seems

86
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,240
there is a rather unusual
karmic cause behind it.

87
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,959
Amitabha.

88
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,360
Do not move.

89
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,480
Move again, and you will die.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,879
Someone as useless as you

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,279
cannot even bring himself
to kill a beast.

92
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,439
There is no point in keeping you alive.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,480
Get lost.

94
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:34,879
Father.

95
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,439
I have been training hard in archery,

96
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,319
hoping to contribute
to the royal ambition

97
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,680
as soon as possible.

98
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,300
(You Chongyuan, King of Nanzhao)

99
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,800
Gao Luoqian has sent word.

100
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
Chen'an has reached the outer palace.

101
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:53,519
By now,

102
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,959
he should have already entered Chang'an.

103
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,160
My second brother

104
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,839
has never truly seen hardship.

105
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,199
He caused trouble all along the way,

106
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,519
and still took so long
to reach Chang'an.

107
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,720
For nothing, he has shamed Nanzhao.

108
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,720
Whatever grievances you have with him,

109
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,800
he represents the dignity of Nanzhao.

110
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,319
Relations between Great Tang
and Nanzhao are delicate.

111
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
At a time like this,

112
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,480
you must not create further trouble.

113
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,519
Yes.

114
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,439
I understand.

115
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,959
There is no need to worry.

116
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,519
As things stand in Great Tang,

117
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:30,279
the board has already been laid.

118
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,319
Once the pieces
that must be taken are removed,

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,680
this game

120
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,920
will be ours to win.

121
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,079
Father,

122
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,959
I am willing to lead the charge

123
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,399
and fight on your behalf.

124
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,160
Longsheng,

125
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,560
everything I am doing now,

126
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,680
who do you think it is for?

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,759
Do you truly not understand?

128
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,759
I understand.

129
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,879
The chief envoy of Nanzhao
delayed the Emperor's birthday,

130
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,319
and indeed angered the Tang Emperor.

131
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,079
This welcome banquet

132
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,519
was arranged rather hastily.

133
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,800
Commandery Prince An did attend.

134
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,399
Whether it was to save face

135
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,920
or to guard against Nanzhao

136
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,519
is hard to say.

137
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,839
I heard that

138
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,000
this chief envoy has quite a background.

139
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,990
He is the adopted son
of the King of Nanzhao.

140
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,480
Sent to Great Tang
at such a sensitive moment,

141
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,800
what else could his purpose be?

142
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,439
An adopted son?

143
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,199
Only one born of blood is truly a son.

144
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:32,959
Come.

145
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
- Good.
- Good.

146
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,180
- Good.
- Good.

147
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,120
Father,

148
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,879
the plump sheep I hunted yesterday

149
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,519
was specially marinated.

150
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:48,279
It was slow-roasted
over a gentle fire for hours.

151
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,079
Please have a taste.

152
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,879
You're thoughtful indeed.

153
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,199
Come.

154
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,399
Dine with me.

155
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:21,490
The flavor is excellent.

156
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:24,279
Second Prince,

157
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
you have come from afar.

158
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,879
Though you missed
the Emperor's birthday,

159
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,720
this still represents Nanzhao's

160
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,759
gesture of sincerity toward Great Tang.

161
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,879
I am

162
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
Huang Lv, Vice Minister of Rites.

163
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,480
I gladly drain this cup

164
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,320
to honor the Second Prince.

165
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,519
Did you hear that?

166
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,879
Every word
from the Vice Minister of Rites

167
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,120
implies that Nanzhao
stands in awe of Great Tang.

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,240
This cup of wine

169
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,600
is not an easy one to drink.

170
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,080
Back then,

171
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,519
your second brother

172
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,039
was suddenly brought
back to the Nanzhao royal court,

173
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,240
and became a thorn
in many people's eyes.

174
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,399
They tripped him openly and in secret.

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,159
As his father,

176
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,799
I never intervened.

177
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,559
He clenched his teeth

178
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,759
and survived on his own.

179
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,360
This time,
he arrived safely in Chang'an.

180
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,360
That proves

181
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:23,159
his life was not meant to end.

182
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,039
Yes.

183
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,759
Nanzhao and Great Tang
border each other,

184
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,559
their fates closely bound.

185
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,639
As a prince of Nanzhao,

186
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,039
I come under royal command.

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,840
This cup of wine

188
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,400
should be offered by me
to all the honored ministers,

189
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,440
to show Nanzhao's

190
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,399
desire for goodwill.

191
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,759
Please.

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,799
Father.

193
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,000
I could also be sent as an envoy.

194
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,279
Do you really think
that is an easy assignment?

195
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,559
If you went,

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,080
the Tang Emperor would hold the knife,

197
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,320
and you would be meat
on his chopping block.

198
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,159
Besides,

199
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,519
you are a prince.

200
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,039
How could you be sent as an envoy?

201
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,879
It is an honor to meet a prince
of Nanzhao here in Great Tang.

202
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,240
A pleasure to meet you.

203
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,720
Xinluo and Nanzhao are separated
by mountains and seas.

204
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,679
I hope that one day
we may pass through Great Tang

205
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,039
to serve as envoys to Nanzhao.

206
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
How interesting.

207
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,639
It seems Gao Luoqian
shows little concern

208
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,720
for his own Second Prince.

209
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,879
More than that.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,960
He wants You Chen'an to struggle
at every step in Great Tang.

211
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,519
Sending the second one this time

212
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,879
was also meant to test

213
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,120
the Tang Emperor's attitude.

214
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,090
These foreign envoys

215
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,759
seem rather interested
in the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

216
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,360
After all, today's Nanzhao

217
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,120
is no longer what it once was.

218
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,039
I have another important task

219
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,279
that I will entrust to you.

220
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,039
Father, please give your orders.

221
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,559
Whether You Chen'an
is merely a decoy or not,

222
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,639
Nanzhao's wolfish ambition

223
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,679
is plain for all to see.

224
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,039
We wait for the right moment,

225
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,639
then strike Jiaozhou.

226
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,399
Yes.

227
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,960
Come, let me toast the Second Prince.

228
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:07,960
My lords,

229
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,990
on another day I will host a banquet

230
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,120
to properly entertain you all.

231
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,840
Are you looking down on us, then?

232
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,380
Second Prince has not yet
recovered from his cold.

233
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,360
He should not drink much.

234
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,559
You gentlemen are so eager
to show hospitality

235
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,100
that you may not have noticed.

236
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
A mere cold...

237
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,440
Lord Qin, you have had too much to drink.

238
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,279
Go back and get some rest.

239
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,759
I was too focused on watching
the Second Prince enjoy himself.

240
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,950
I drank a bit too much
and my head is aching.

241
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
My apologies. Please forgive me.

242
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,639
If Second Prince wishes to change,

243
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,480
I can have someone escort you.

244
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,519
This cup, my thanks to Commandery Prince An
for stepping in.

245
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,360
And this one,

246
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,300
to thank Your Highness
and the Princess Consort for saving my life.

247
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
What I did was simply my duty.

248
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,279
As for the Princess Consort's wine,
I will drink it in her stead.

249
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,080
I never expected
that on this mission to Great Tang,

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,039
I would meet someone
truly worth befriending.

251
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,000
What are you looking at?

252
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32,720
You're back.

253
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,399
You've been drinking?

254
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,679
Just one cup.

255
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,399
Did something happen at the banquet?

256
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,120
Why did even you have to drink?

257
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:44,879
Come.

258
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,080
I will explain it slowly.

259
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,360
There's always a sense about him,
like he's used to enduring everything.

260
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,879
Yet he is still
the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

261
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,440
How did his life end up so miserable?

262
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,559
Struggles for the throne

263
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,879
are full of brothers
turning on one another,

264
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,320
of blood ties becoming weapons.

265
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,919
What's more,

266
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,519
a Second Prince appeared out of nowhere,

267
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,679
without noble blood,

268
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,559
yet forced into a noble identity.

269
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,600
Clearly,

270
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,159
he is nothing more than a whetstone

271
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,160
the King of Nanzhao
prepared for You Longsheng,

272
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,279
or rather,

273
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,480
a shield.

274
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,230
You Chen'an must understand
the King of Nanzhao's intentions

275
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
very well.

276
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,799
He knows that at any moment,
he could be sacrificed.

277
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
That's why he struggles to survive,

278
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,450
finding a way out through the cracks.

279
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,200
You're perceptive.

280
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,919
After all I've said,

281
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,200
shouldn't I be rewarded?

282
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
You smell of wine. Go bathe first.

283
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,399
No hurry.

284
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,519
Hurry.

285
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,279
So many things
have been in chaos lately,

286
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,350
and the coroner work at the Three Judicial Offices
has been delayed again.

287
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,559
Oh, right.

288
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,679
I am on duty tomorrow.

289
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,399
I should make proper preparations.

290
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,820
(Body Preparation Room)

291
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,679
Everyone's busy.

292
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:08,480
Princess Consort.

293
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,080
You are finally back.

294
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,519
The Three Judicial Offices
have piled up many cases lately.

295
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,180
They are all waiting
for your examination.

296
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:14,799
Yes.

297
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,890
Recently, the night curfew
in the capital was lifted,

298
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:17,860
and murders have increased.

299
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:19,770
The ways people died
are all kinds of strange.

300
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:21,080
This was indeed my oversight.

301
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:21,960
All right.

302
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,159
Leave everything to me.

303
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,240
Your Highness.

304
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,200
The meal is ready.

305
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:33,960
Today's braised pork

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,200
turned out especially well.

307
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:36,900
Look at this meat.

308
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,790
Where is the Princess Consort?

309
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,240
Performing an autopsy.

310
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,679
The Princess Consort said
the body was already in pieces.

311
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,200
If she does not examine it now, it will not
even be stitched back together.

312
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,759
Vice Minister, this food
does not suit your appetite?

313
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,340
(Body Preparation Room)

314
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,840
Wash your hands.

315
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,240
What is this?

316
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,039
It is fermented tofu.

317
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,080
Does it smell unpleasant?

318
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,759
Yes.

319
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,559
But it reminds me that

320
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,890
there are still two corpses that will start
to rot if we do not examine them soon.

321
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,279
You have been examining bodies
for 18 hours straight.

322
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,320
We are short-handed.

323
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,190
Even if you exhaust yourself,
you cannot finish everything.

324
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,840
Why not solve the problem at its root?

325
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,919
At the root?

326
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:01,840
How do we do that?

327
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,990
The Three Judicial Offices
are recruiting new people these days.

328
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,400
Why not go and see
if there are suitable candidates?

329
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,830
Bring them in, and have them all placed
under your command.

330
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,519
Under my command?

331
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,840
Can I really manage them well?

332
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,320
I believe you absolutely can.

333
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,559
You have solid,
professional coroner skills,

334
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:21,559
a fair and rigorous
approach to investigations,

335
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,279
and a genuinely kind heart.

336
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,600
You are that capable.

337
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,919
Do you not want to guide more coroners,

338
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,000
and help the world

339
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,440
change how it sees this profession?

340
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,840
Mm.

341
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,919
You are right.

342
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,759
I need to recruit people.

343
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,159
More coroners, and better ones.

344
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,480
This test focuses
on reconstructing the scene.

345
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,280
We need coroners who can truly help
restore what happened at the scene,

346
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,240
not those limited to autopsies alone.

347
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:52,480
That makes sense.

348
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,160
The direction of blood flow here
runs opposite on the thigh and the calf.

349
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,079
What does that tell us?

350
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,730
It shows the deceased

351
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,560
was not standing upright
in a normal posture.

352
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,720
If the head was lowered like this,

353
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,799
then the shape
of the blood drops makes sense,

354
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,359
and the posture analysis holds.

355
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,200
This is the most basic type of scene,

356
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,240
yet not a single person

357
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,880
managed to reconstruct it fully.

358
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,240
For a coroner,

359
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,039
the autopsy itself is fundamental.

360
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,240
But to truly reconstruct a case,

361
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,990
one must possess both forensic skill
and investigative insight.

362
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,590
Perhaps my standards are too demanding.

363
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,519
But you can do it.

364
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,920
That is only because I was fortunate.

365
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,680
I had someone guide me,

366
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,720
someone who taught me patiently.

367
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,640
In truth,

368
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,599
for many coroners today,

369
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
entering this profession
at all is difficult.

370
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,559
Let alone...

371
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,240
From what you are saying,

372
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,640
you already have someone in mind.

373
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,559
Unqualified is unqualified.

374
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,920
Back when I took the examination,

375
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,839
I did not pass
the coroner selection either.

376
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,390
The reason I was able to enter
the Three Judicial Offices

377
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,680
was because I trained
under Your Highness for some time.

378
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:30,880
So,

379
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:32,640
could we also

380
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,100
first select some promising candidates
into the Three Judicial Offices,

381
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,400
guide them and teach them,

382
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,790
and let the Three Judicial Offices

383
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,759
cultivate our own group
of outstanding coroners?

384
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,180
(Two Merits Hall)

385
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,839
For today's recruitment of coroners,

386
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
no one passed.

387
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,160
Not a single one.

388
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:54,920
In truth, everyone here has more or less

389
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,880
grasped some basic knowledge.

390
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,680
What they lack is hands-on practice
and deeper training.

391
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,920
Therefore,

392
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:03,839
after discussing this
with Commandery Prince An,

393
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,160
if everyone is willing,

394
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,119
you may first enter
the Three Judicial Offices as apprentices,

395
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,119
and study
under suitable senior coroners.

396
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,390
- There is a chance.
- There is a chance.

397
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,279
On the tables in front of you,

398
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,599
are the profiles
and strengths of each coroner.

399
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,119
You may choose for yourselves.

400
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,920
Allow me to recommend myself.

401
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,039
The registration desk
in the middle is mine.

402
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,960
I also truly hope

403
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,599
to share my experience and methods

404
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,559
with everyone.

405
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,039
You may begin registering now.

406
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,559
Imperial gift.

407
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,359
The Imperial Coroner must be formidable.

408
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,640
Brother, think carefully.

409
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,300
She is, after all,
the Commandery Princess Consort An.

410
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,060
That title likely carries the weight
of Commandery Prince An's influence.

411
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,640
Exactly.

412
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,359
Get too close, and there will be gossip.

413
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,359
Keep too much distance,

414
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,519
and you learn nothing.

415
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,240
In the end,
you might gain nothing at all.

416
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,400
What is wrong?

417
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,079
You look unhappy.

418
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:34,079
I know, actually,
being a coroner is difficult.

419
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,720
Being a female coroner is even harder
to be acknowledged.

420
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,039
But when no one chose me,
it still hurts.

421
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,319
Come here.

422
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,400
We have solved so many cases together.

423
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,839
I truly feel

424
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,680
that I am quite capable.

425
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,960
Yet they still think
I am not good enough,

426
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,920
that the title of The Imperial Coroner

427
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,500
belongs to the Commandery Princess
Consort An, not to myself.

428
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,039
People are always suspicious.

429
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,279
We only need to keep doing our best.

430
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,680
One day,

431
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,880
the rivers we crossed
and the mountains we climbed

432
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:15,119
will become paths
that guide others forward.

433
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:18,920
You are right.

434
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,440
I do not need
to prove my ability to anyone.

435
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,279
I only need to do my part,

436
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,010
and help everyone I can,

437
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,839
everyone who truly wishes
to become a coroner.

438
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,759
One day,

439
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,359
they will see what I am capable of.

440
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,119
Still, it does make me sad.

441
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,410
Then let yourself feel sad
for a little longer.

442
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,519
Official matters

443
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:40,519
can wait for a moment.

444
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:43,880
I am fine now.

445
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:45,230
What were you about to say?

446
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,890
At present, the Ministry of Justice

447
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:51,160
and the local prefectures
all lack coroners.

448
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,799
Among the people,

449
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,799
there must be those like you,

450
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,599
who truly aspire to this work.

451
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,559
So I was thinking

452
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,079
of arranging a special apprentice
recruitment just for you.

453
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,160
Then let us relax the requirements
and post notices across the city.

454
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,640
Regardless of age or gender,

455
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,279
anyone who passes the basic assessment

456
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:09,640
and is determined to become a coroner
may study under me.

457
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:10,400
What do you think?

458
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,559
I agree.

459
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,880
He?

460
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,036
(Notice. The Three Judicial Offices
seek coroners. Talents wanted.)

461
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:23,400
(Positions open for reserve selection.
Generous terms.)

462
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,240
The renowned Imperial Coroner herself

463
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:27,480
is recruiting apprentices
from among the people.

464
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,359
Anyone may go and try.

465
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,480
The terms are generous.

466
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:32,640
Isn't that
the Imperial Coroner's brother?

467
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,440
That's right.

468
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,260
When my sister
first began studying as a coroner,

469
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:36,480
I was the one who guided her.

470
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,990
Anyone who wants to learn from my sister

471
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,680
must first earn my approval.

472
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,000
And how does one earn your approval?

473
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,400
The Chu Family Pharmacy ahead

474
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,740
is run jointly by me
and the authorities.

475
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,200
Come support my shop more often,

476
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,000
and my approval will come naturally.

477
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,480
Do give me your patronage.

478
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:51,880
Much obliged.

479
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:52,799
Thank you for the support.

480
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:53,340
Of course.

481
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,319
An.

482
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,240
He.

483
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,039
An.

484
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,508
(Chu Family Pharmacy)
I heard back in Nanzhao

485
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,559
(Chu Family Pharmacy)
that you were already calling the shots.

486
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,240
I never expected to run into you here.

487
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,890
Thinking back, three years ago,
when I was trading medicinal herbs,

488
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,519
I passed through Nanzhao and met you.

489
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,240
It was you who introduced me
to the King of Nanzhao,

490
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,950
which allowed me
to take on the commission

491
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,000
of supplying medicine
to the Imperial Pharmacy.

492
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,240
I never properly thanked you.

493
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,100
There's no need.

494
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,390
If you had
not looked after me back then,

495
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,920
near the Qianzhou border,

496
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,790
I would never have survived
to enter the palace.

497
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,720
Your kindness was like
a spring in drought.

498
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,390
What I returned was
but a drop in response.

499
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,960
Still,

500
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
you had been doing well
in that position.

501
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,119
Why come to Chang'an?

502
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,240
I could never quite stop worrying
about my sister.

503
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,359
I wanted to be closer to her.

504
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,560
She was alone in the capital,

505
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,680
with no family by her side.

506
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,960
I simply could not rest easy.

507
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,240
So I came without telling her,

508
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,480
all the way to Chang'an, to be near her.

509
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,839
Take it slow, everyone.

510
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,759
One at a time.

511
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:01,480
Line up properly.

512
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,200
Leng Yue.

513
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:04,759
Come here, quick.

514
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:06,720
See that?

515
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,359
All these people came because of you.

516
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,910
Where did you
even find this many people?

517
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,720
Exactly.

518
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,720
I never expected so many people
to be interested in examining bodies.

519
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,359
Are you all right?

520
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:26,720
Half the face is gone.

521
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,880
This smell is unbearable.

522
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,839
Not becoming a coroner

523
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,920
must mean my ancestors
are watching over me.

524
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,799
Let's go.

525
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,200
Mother.

526
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:42,440
Mother, I can't do this.

527
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,640
Being a coroner
is not something humans should do.

528
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,160
Um…

529
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,599
Are you all right?

530
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,720
Do you still want to take the exam?

531
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:03,720
Your Highness.

532
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,319
Could I avoid dissecting the body?

533
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,060
I could stay nearby

534
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,119
and help you instead.

535
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,540
Serving tea, running errands, anything.

536
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,119
Didn't you come to test for coroner?

537
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:12,880
I was talked into it by
the Commandery Prince's brother-in-law.

538
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:13,920
He told us

539
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,039
this was
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

540
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,920
Good monthly pay,
food and lodging included.

541
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:18,799
Who knows,

542
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,390
maybe we'd rise through the ranks
and enter official service.

543
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,680
My brother
really went too far this time.

544
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,519
He was worried about you and meant well.

545
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,559
Still, what a useless bunch.

546
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,710
- Not a single one stayed.
- He.

547
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,890
Those who gather for profit drift apart
when profit is gone.

548
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,119
Those who gather for power scatter
when power fades.

549
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,320
If you rely only on rank
and rewards to recruit people,

550
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,480
you will never find those
truly devoted to the work.

551
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,759
I understand.

552
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,720
Girl, in a few days at the pharmacy,

553
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,490
I will prepare
your favorite Qianzhou dishes.

554
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,400
Come eat then.

555
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,590
I have also invited
an old acquaintance from Qianzhou.

556
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,599
An old acquaintance?

557
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,880
You know others in Chang'an besides us?

558
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,039
An old friend of mine.

559
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,119
You know him as well.

560
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,000
Girl, I just wanted you to help An a little,

561
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:06,240
and mention a word or two.

562
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,400
It is nothing serious.

563
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,000
Why did you insist on dragging me here?

564
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,160
Come on.

565
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:13,920
What is it?

566
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,559
It concerns
the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

567
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,670
Back when my brother
was stationed near the Qianzhou border,

568
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,400
he happened to know You Chen'an.

569
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,480
You know You Chen'an?

570
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,440
When I knew him,

571
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,039
he was not yet
the Second Prince of Nanzhao.

572
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,079
What do you mean?

573
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,000
These matters,

574
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,640
I only heard from An.

575
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,119
Many years ago,

576
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,480
the King of Nanzhao
once inspected the royal stud.

577
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,440
After a banquet, the King of Nanzhao
was heavily drunk.

578
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,759
At that moment,

579
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,759
An's mother, then a stablewoman
tending the horses, passed by.

580
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,759
The King of Nanzhao dismissed everyone.

581
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:54,680
He violated An's mother by force.

582
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,240
When the King of Nanzhao sobered up,

583
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,000
he despised
the stablewoman's low status,

584
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,480
and refused
to grant An's mother any standing.

585
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:06,759
Even toward An, he showed not
the slightest fatherly affection.

586
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,000
In the end,

587
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,680
he abandoned the mother
and child at the hunting grounds,

588
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,599
and never looked back.

589
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,319
An's mother raised him there,

590
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,440
the two of them scraping by
with great hardship.

591
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,790
But life
at the hunting grounds was harsh.

592
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,880
In the end, his mother

593
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,119
sent him to relatives
in Qianzhou to be fostered.

594
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:22,920
It was during that time

595
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,079
that An and I came to know each other.

596
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,640
So that is what happened.

597
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,880
Why did you never tell me
any of this before?

598
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,839
I promised An back then
that I would keep it secret.

599
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,759
No wonder You Longsheng

600
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,279
hates him to the core,

601
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,559
and wants nothing more than his death.

602
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:39,680
And it explains why You Chen'an

603
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,519
grew up learning to endure and yield.

604
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,279
Your Highness,

605
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,960
this is no small matter.

606
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,039
The implications are enormous,

607
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,799
touching both our court and Nanzhao's.

608
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,960
It must be reported.

609
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:57,079
Blood of one's own flesh?

610
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,039
What do you all think?

611
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,759
It is said the Eldest Prince's
maternal family wields great power,

612
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,990
having encroached on the interests
of many veteran officials.

613
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,799
Those old ministers unwilling
to serve the Eldest Prince

614
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,470
now urgently need to rally behind

615
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,839
a faction of their own.

616
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:10,880
Second Prince

617
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,599
is the most suitable choice.

618
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,079
He seeks neither power

619
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:15,240
nor personal gain.

620
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,920
When the time comes, if we lend
the Second Prince measured support,

621
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,319
it will not only be

622
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,839
timely aid to him in dire straits,

623
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,240
but also serve
to restrain the Nanzhao court.

624
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,279
Indeed.

625
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,190
If turmoil breaks out
within the Nanzhao court,

626
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,920
they will have no energy left
to stir trouble along the border.

627
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,319
In that case,

628
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,839
the people of our frontier regions
may enjoy more years of peace.

629
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:37,850
Your Majesty,

630
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,870
it is rare for the Nanzhao delegation
to enter the capital,

631
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,279
and they were delayed along the way.

632
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:43,480
Why not have them remain
in Chang'an a few more days,

633
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,640
so they may properly observe
the splendor of Great Tang?

634
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,160
Xiao Jinyu,

635
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,359
what is your view?

636
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:53,359
Your Majesty,

637
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,160
I have concerns.

638
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You Chen'an does not seem

639
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,910
as helpless as rumors
from the Nanzhao court suggest,

640
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,890
someone easily bullied.

641
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,039
Explain further.

642
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:02,720
He was born of humble origin,

643
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,480
and from a young age learned
to endure and submit.

644
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,480
On the surface he appears weak,

645
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,400
seeking only self-preservation,
yet it is hard to tell for now

646
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,799
whether he harbors other designs.

647
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,400
Moreover, in recent days,

648
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,990
a large number of Nanzhao outsiders
have slipped into the city in secret.

649
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,519
In the open,
there is also Master Shenguan,

650
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,759
a figure revered by the common people.

651
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:23,839
His movements are unclear,
his intentions unknown.

652
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,240
Therefore, in dealing
with this Second Prince,

653
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,119
we must proceed with the utmost caution.

654
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,440
No matter.

655
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
He is but a prince.

656
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,340
Since the King of Nanzhao
dares to place this Second Prince

657
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,519
openly on the board,

658
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,359
we have no reason to refuse the move.

659
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,720
Let us first host the Second Prince
as a guest of Great Tang.

660
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,190
As for the rest of the game,

661
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,400
we can play it out at leisure.

662
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,440
As of today,
the Second Prince of Nanzhao,

663
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,640
You Chen'an, is noted for a gentle
and steady disposition,

664
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,630
with broad-minded conduct
and refined bearing.

665
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,519
He is hereby granted leave
to move freely within the capital.

666
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,359
He shall observe our customs,

667
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,920
and study the ways of Great Tang.

668
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,960
This decree is hereby issued.

669
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,640
Father.

670
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,599
I believe the Tang Emperor

671
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,079
harbors no good intentions at all.

672
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,240
He is clearly keeping
a hostage in Chang'an.

673
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,680
If my second brother is manipulated,

674
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,039
I fear it may
disrupt Father's entire design.

675
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,599
I have already seized the key
to breaking the deadlock.

676
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,559
Great Tang's ranks
of generals are thin now.

677
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,150
The only one
they can send against Nanzhao

678
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,480
is the Cavalry General,

679
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,519
Xie Huaiding.

680
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,519
If we pin him down,

681
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,359
then Great Tang

682
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,559
will have no commander
left capable of battle.

683
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,759
- Your Majesty is wise.
- Your Majesty is wise.

684
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,359
Not a single one was willing
to stay and learn.

685
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,759
I was too eager.

686
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,839
Perhaps

687
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,920
I was not fully prepared myself.

688
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,680
Who is there?

689
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,130
It is only that fate
has not yet arrived.

690
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,279
Why are you here?

691
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,750
Commandery Princess Consort An.

692
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,720
I originally came to thank you in person

693
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,000
for saving my life,

694
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,200
but I could not find you.

695
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,559
The guards at the gate
said I might wait here,

696
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,890
so I took the liberty of coming in.

697
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,690
I did not break any rules, did I?

698
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,680
It is fine.

699
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,190
Today's cases have already
been examined and sent away.

700
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,160
Still,

701
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,880
you waited here alone just now.

702
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,559
This is the autopsy room.

703
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:47,920
Were you not afraid?

704
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,759
At times, I feel

705
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,810
being among the dead is more reassuring
than being among the living.

706
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,880
What I mean is,

707
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,599
if there is a chance in the future,

708
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,160
I hope I may come here often.

709
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,759
He and I go way back.

710
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,200
We are as close as family.

711
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,839
He often mentions you

712
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:07,839
to me.

713
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,799
Then I suppose
he did not praise me much.

714
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,279
He always says

715
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,119
you are the pride of the Chu family,

716
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,440
one of the finest coroners

717
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,000
in the realm.

718
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,720
That is what he said?

719
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,319
Of course.

720
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,000
It was after hearing him speak of you

721
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,200
at the pharmacy that day

722
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,319
that I came up with

723
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:29,079
a rather presumptuous idea.

724
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,000
What kind of idea?

725
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,119
I wish to

726
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,360
take the Princess Consort of An
as my teacher,

727
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,160
and learn the art of a coroner from you.

728
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,160
You want to learn how to be a coroner?

729
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,000
Yes.

730
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,240
I already have some
basic knowledge of examination,

731
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,519
and I have long been interested
in this line of work.

732
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,160
It is just that before,
I never found a suitable teacher.

733
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,599
But if I could study under
one of the finest coroners in the land,

734
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,990
it would truly be
an honor beyond measure.

735
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,039
Come with me.

736
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,880
This was the test from a few days ago.

737
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,039
Take a look.

738
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,920
Try to reconstruct the scene.

739
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,420
(Techniques are professional)

740
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,700
(Steps are well structured)

741
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,020
(Observation is meticulous)

742
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,599
Bruising on the chest.

743
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,540
(Assessment is accurate)

744
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,079
The blood flow patterns
on the thigh and calf run opposite.

745
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,559
There are abrasion marks
within the bloodstains on the skin.

746
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,820
(Reasoning is clear)

747
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,119
This would only occur while squatting.

748
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,580
The victim died in a squatting position.

749
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,990
Then what about the killer's clues?

750
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,519
None of these are
the real traces left by the killer.

751
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,799
These were traps you set, weren't they?

752
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:57,960
How so?

753
00:33:59,119 --> 00:33:59,680
Here.

754
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,119
This is where the killer
truly left a trace.

755
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,480
(Eliminating distractions.)
The bloodstains here differ from all the others.

756
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,240
The droplets show a spray pattern.

757
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,319
And then?

758
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,119
And then…

759
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,599
That is as far as I can tell.

760
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,599
This is all I can see.

761
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,599
I know my brother's ability

762
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,960
to teach and guide others.

763
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,440
As for me, I have seen injuries
and mutilation since childhood.

764
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,990
I myself have never
been free of wounds, large or small.

765
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,390
You could say long illness
makes a good healer.

766
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,000
Learning more

767
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,390
was also my way of protecting myself
when it truly mattered.

768
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,440
No wonder.

769
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,800
When I watched you examine the body
just now, your technique was very clean.

770
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,119
You seem especially familiar
with the structure of the human body.

771
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,760
Do you have some special method?

772
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,159
I do.

773
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,780
(Anatomical charts of bones and organs)

774
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,119
These charts
are my most treasured possession.

775
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,920
I never lend them to anyone.

776
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,990
But if Your Highness
is willing to take me as your disciple

777
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,270
and allow me to enter
the Three Judicial Offices to learn real skills,

778
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,559
then once I have made progress,

779
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,159
as your disciple,

780
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,480
I would of course be willing
to share them with my master.

781
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,280
Very well.

782
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,310
What sort of charts are they?

783
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:28,960
Second Prince, you seem quite concerned
about the Three Judicial Offices.

784
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,360
Why not talk with me?

785
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:32,760
Commandery Prince An.

786
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,559
Your Highness.

787
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,119
May I ask what charts those are?

788
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,850
Would it be possible
for me to take a look?

789
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,030
Since I intend

790
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,310
to study coroner's techniques
under the Princess Consort,

791
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,190
it would be better
to wait for her consent first.

792
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,840
Princess Consort,
I will await your answer.

793
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,519
I shall take my leave.

794
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,199
Still thinking about those charts?

795
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,599
I have never seen anything so detailed.

796
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:16,000
Every layer of flesh,

797
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:17,239
every organ,

798
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,880
every bone,
even the blood vessels and meridians,

799
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,140
are all marked with absolute clarity.

800
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:22,320
There is so much in it

801
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,000
that I never even knew before.

802
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,679
It seems You Chen'an

803
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,880
has shown real sincerity,
just to enter the Three Judicial Offices

804
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,440
and take you as his teacher.

805
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,280
May I recruit him?

806
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,480
He is clearly gifted,

807
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,639
truly eager to learn,

808
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,270
and even understands
examination techniques

809
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
that differ
from those used in Great Tang.

810
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,000
I might even learn something
from him as well.

811
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,000
At present,
His Majesty keeps him in Chang'an

812
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,639
under the guise of cultural exchange,

813
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,490
and it is hard to say this
does not also mean

814
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:48,300
using him as leverage
over the Nanzhao King.

815
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,559
His current position

816
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,199
is extremely delicate.

817
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:55,519
I see.

818
00:36:55,639 --> 00:36:56,880
Then let us leave it for now.

819
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,760
Matters of the court come first.

820
00:36:59,079 --> 00:36:59,840
After all,

821
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,280
training coroners
is never something done overnight.

822
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,719
There will be other chances.

823
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,920
However, if you wish to study
that chart more closely,

824
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,039
I may be able to find a way.

825
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,360
I do want to see it.

826
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,679
But he seems to treasure it greatly.

827
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:15,519
Would he really lend it to me?

828
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,079
Something so precious,

829
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,559
since he already let you see it,

830
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,599
it was no coincidence.

831
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,290
Whether he lends it or not

832
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,100
(Record of You Chen'an,
Nanzhao Envoy to Tang)

833
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,920
is no longer his decision.

834
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:33,000
Vice Minister Jing,

835
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,480
these are all the recent movements
of Master Shenguan.

836
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,599
A true eminent monk indeed.

837
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:40,880
Whether rich or poor,
as long as one asks sincerely,

838
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:43,159
he personally conducts the rituals.

839
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:45,790
At most, he performs
three ceremonies a day.

840
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:49,000
Why do you not show
such diligence when on duty?

841
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:49,559
I…

842
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,920
Judging from these movements,

843
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,119
there truly seems
to be nothing suspicious.

844
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,890
I have followed him for quite some time,

845
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:00,559
and he appears
to be a genuine high monk,

846
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:02,480
thinking only of delivering all beings.

847
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,790
There seems to be no major issue.

848
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,639
Could it be that we
have been wasting our effort?

849
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,480
This still requires
the Prince's judgment.

850
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,230
He would not have us
surveil and investigate without a reason.

851
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,400
No matter the outcome,

852
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,960
there must be intent behind it.

853
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,770
Vice Minister Jing.

854
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:21,860
There is movement.

855
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:24,320
Just now, Master Shenguan
changed into plain clothes

856
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,639
and left Weiguo Temple alone.

857
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,380
Come in.

858
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,400
Where is he going?

859
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,719
Do none of you spare
even a little concern for me?

860
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,159
Concern about what?

861
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,679
I did not sleep at all last night,

862
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,840
working alone on cases
at the Three Judicial Offices.

863
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,480
Count yourself lucky.

864
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,599
These past two days,
to protect You Chen'an,

865
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:29,199
I have been sleeping on rooftops.

866
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,480
My dear has worked hard.

867
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,679
My dear is formidable.

868
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
So what did you find?

869
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,079
More than just finding something.

870
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:39,960
I uncovered something major.

871
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,440
That Master Shenguan
the Prince had me watch,

872
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:44,760
when he was young,

873
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,800
was actually a monk of Great Tang.

874
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,320
A Tang native?

875
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,639
It is said that back then

876
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,890
he had no reputation at all,

877
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,519
just a wandering monk,

878
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,000
traveling and practicing austerities.

879
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,880
For reasons unknown, he went to Nanzhao,

880
00:39:58,039 --> 00:39:58,890
and when he returned,

881
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,559
he had become
a revered holy monk admired by all.

882
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,239
However,

883
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,400
just a few nights ago,

884
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,320
Master Shenguan went to
the Bureau of Entertainment in plain clothes.

885
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:12,400
And he clearly was not there
for the first time,

886
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,980
he seemed very familiar with the place.

887
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:17,960
If this were to be discovered

888
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,719
by those in the capital who idolize him,

889
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,320
it would cause an uproar.

890
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,000
At present, devotion to the holy monk
is sweeping the capital.

891
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,640
If such influence were exploited,

892
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,090
the consequences would be unimaginable.

893
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,800
Hold on to this lead.

894
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,559
Following it through step by step,

895
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,519
we may yet uncover clues
about the Peacock.

896
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,159
He.

897
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:44,079
You're here, Chu.

898
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,140
I brought you some food, clothes,
and daily necessities from the manor.

899
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:46,870
Where should I put them?

900
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,559
Anywhere is fine.

901
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,400
Go eat first.

902
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,440
You even brought cured ham.

903
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,250
Let me have a piece.

904
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,679
Chu.

905
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,119
Chu.

906
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,599
About what I mentioned earlier,

907
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,100
about An wanting to enter
the Three Judicial Offices...

908
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:12,920
He.

909
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:13,800
Not now.

910
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,760
Eat first.

911
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,590
Matters of the Three Judicial Offices
are for the Prince to decide.

912
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,920
Then what will you do?

913
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:21,639
Commandery Prince An and I

914
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,310
have an appointment
at Guangtai Tower tonight.

915
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,199
When the time comes,

916
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,000
I will discuss it with him again.

917
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:31,100
I am deeply grateful to Your Highness
for repeatedly standing up for me.

918
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,950
I originally planned to invite you
for a drink first,

919
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,000
but someone beat me to it.

920
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,320
So tonight I borrow the occasion

921
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,639
to toast you.

922
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:38,880
First, to thank you for saving me.

923
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,790
Second, to celebrate meeting
a good friend, far from home.

924
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:44,079
It was my duty.

925
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,159
You need not dwell on it.

926
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,159
But as for friendship
with the Second Prince,

927
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,559
it is something I truly welcome.

928
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,990
Coming to the capital,
I gained two great fortunes.

929
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,880
The first

930
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:55,920
was being reunited with He.

931
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,000
The second was meeting Your Highness.

932
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,990
Hearing you say this,
truly makes me glad.

933
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,400
I heard
the Second Prince possesses a chart

934
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,159
that is remarkably detailed and precise.

935
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,199
May I borrow it for a look?

936
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:09,880
So it turns out

937
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,100
this drink is being offered
on the Princess Consort's behalf.

938
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,870
I had long heard that Your Highness
and Princess Consort are deeply devoted.

939
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,100
It seems the rumors were true.

940
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
But to be frank,

941
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:21,920
the chart is far too precious.

942
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,490
Please forgive me for not lending it out.

943
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,519
If it is truly so valuable,

944
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,239
why did you offer it of your own accord

945
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,519
as a condition for entering
the Three Judicial Offices?
