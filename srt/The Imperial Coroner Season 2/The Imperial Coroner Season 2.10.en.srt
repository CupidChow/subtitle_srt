(and Zhao Senyao's past grudges.)

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,950
(We interrogated Qinxiang separately
at the Three Judicial Offices,)

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,930
(along with Zhao Senyao.)

=Episode 10=

31
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,120
This is a deal between you and me.

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,199
No one is to know about this.

33
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you understand?

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,110
A few days ago,
the scented powder was out of stock.

35
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:41,960
Today,

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,319
as soon as it came in,

37
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,360
I hurried to deliver it to you.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,990
While the dancing girls
are not paying attention,

39
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,479
hand it out.

40
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,260

Have one.

43
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,120
Hasn't the case already been solved?

44
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,860
No matter how well the killer hides,

45
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,000
we will still uncover him.

46
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,479
I still feel somewhat saddened.

47
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,390
All because of those absurd beliefs
in ghosts and spirits,

48
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,199
Zhao Senyao
caused Master Shenguan's death.

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,390
That is precisely why
everything we are doing now

50
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,800
truly matters.

51
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,280
Right and wrong
will always be made clear.

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,319
Just like the moon,

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
it will always wax full.

54
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,919
If only we could

55
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,800
find Qinxiang's child for her,

56
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,680
then she would not be so utterly alone.

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,960
That's not right.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,479
What is it?

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,120
According to Qinxiang,

60
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,040
Master Shenguan only meant
to treat her syphilis infection

61
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,490
and had not yet prescribed anything.

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,079
Yet when she
faced Master Shenguan's body,

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,879
she was overwhelmed with despair.

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,079
Exactly.

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,079
By all reason,

66
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
Qinxiang has long been accustomed
to human indifference.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,160
Even if she were grieving,

68
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,160
it should not have been to this extent.

69
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,000
He claimed that he practiced cultivation
at Ciguang Temple

70
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,260
and merely passed through here.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,240
Leng Yue,

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,360
tomorrow morning,

73
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,800
we will go to Ciguang Temple.

74
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:50,959
Alright.

75
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,199
Master Shenguan of Nanzhao

76
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,000
first cultivated here.

77
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,920
Then do you know Master Shenguan's
background and origins?

78
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,250
Why did he first renounce
the secular world?

79
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,879
In his early years,
his wife died during childbirth,

80
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,680
and both mother and child were lost.

81
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,920
The blow devastated Shenguan.

82
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,560
He withdrew from the mortal world

83
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,959
and resolved

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,800
to contemplate life and death.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,759
He was tonsured under your guidance.

86
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,560
Then why did he go to Nanzhao?

87
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,319
Shenguan

88
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,000
possessed exceptional insight,

89
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,800
and a pure disposition.

90
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,920
Among all disciples,

91
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,480
his comprehension was the greatest.

92
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,720
I once believed

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,520
he would attain true understanding
of the Buddhist teachings

94
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,879
and succeed as abbot.

95
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,399
Yet I never expected

96
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,639
that he would secretly
meet with a woman,

97
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,780
thus bringing about
a grave transgression.

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,120
At first,

99
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,079
when I discovered that he had
been meeting that woman in secret,

100
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,000
I merely thought

101
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,360
that he was

102
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,920
young and impulsive,

103
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,279
and had

104
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,920
strayed onto the wrong path for a time.

105
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,680
Yet despite repeated admonitions,

106
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
he showed no sign of awakening,

107
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,480
but instead sank even deeper.

108
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,959
He even brought back a child,

109
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,000
and openly admitted

110
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,319
that the child was his with that woman.

111
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,000
I

112
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,959
grieved deeply over
how far he had fallen,

113
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,399
and expelled him from Ciguang Temple.

114
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,360
Please take a look.

115
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,000
The woman from those years, was it her?

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,399
Yes, it was her.

117
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,680
Though she has aged somewhat,

118
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,319
it is indeed her.

119
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,759
Please wait a moment.

120
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,839
After he returned to Great Tang,

121
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,639
he once secretly had someone
come to Ciguang Temple

122
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,560
to deliver quite a sum
in incense donations.

123
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,639
Also,

124
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:58,360
this is the swaddling cloth
he used when he carried the child back.

125
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
Do you recall, Master,

126
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,100
any distinguishing features
of that child?

127
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,639
That child

128
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,079
had a mark

129
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,480
on the back of the neck.

130
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,160
From now on, prepare meals
for Jing Yuan every day.

131
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,079
Go in.

132
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,959
The person you wish to see is inside.

133
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:07,800
Jing Yuan.

134
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,470
Jing Yuan, do not be disrespectful.

135
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,350
You still have the nerve to come here.

136
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,480
My master ended up like this

137
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:12,639
all because of you.

138
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,439
He trusted your honeyed words,

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,830
and his body was harmed as a result,

140
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,879
leaving my master
to bear a wrongful accusation.

141
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,560
Leave.

142
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,319
All of you, leave.

143
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,639
You are not welcome here.

144
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,519
I am sorry, Master Jing Yuan.

145
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,360
To prevent more people
from being harmed,

146
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,920
we must get to the bottom of this case.

147
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,340
You say you are investigating,

148
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,090
then why are you
smearing my master's name?

149
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,000
I was raised
by my master from childhood.

150
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,519
He was upright and blameless,

151
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,540
strictly observing the precepts.

152
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,090
How could he be entangled
in worldly matters?

153
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,320
Jing Yuan,

154
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,039
how old are you this year?

155
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:45,360
Twelve.

156
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,080
Madam.

157
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,879
Madam.

158
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:57,960
- Amitabha.
- Amitabha.

159
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,679
My apologies, Jing Yuan.

160
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,900
Please forgive the offense.

161
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,679
What led to today
was caused by both of you.

162
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,600
It was not your fault alone.

163
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
It was me.

164
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,320
I caused the child's master to die.

165
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,000
If I am not mistaken,

166
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,720
Master Shenguan

167
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,960
was not the child's biological father,

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,360
was he?

169
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,360
Is that true?

170
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,919
If it were not,

171
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,399
Miss Qinxiang would
have refuted me by now.

172
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,799
Why do you say so?

173
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
Judging from Master Shenguan's past,

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
he would not have fallen back
into worldly desire.

175
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,519
As for human affection,

176
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
most people seek
a return of being loved.

177
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,400
When love goes unanswered,

178
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,800
it turns either into deep resentment,

179
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,039
or into weary abandonment.

180
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,100
But you are different.

181
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,799
Even after all these years,

182
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,919
all you wished was to protect

183
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,279
Master Shenguan's reputation.

184
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,840
Toward the child's real father,

185
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,360
you held neither resentment nor blame,

186
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,790
neither thought of him nor spoke of him.

187
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,080
Yet toward the child,

188
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,320
you felt both fear and guilt,

189
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,500
daring not to acknowledge him.

190
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,399
Husband, wife, and child,

191
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,900
the natural bonds of human life,

192
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,200
none of these truly fit you.

193
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,879
I never imagined it.

194
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,960
All the grudges of the past ten years

195
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,000
were laid bare by

196
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,900
Commandery Prince An in a single remark.

197
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:46,279
Back then, to sever any tie
with Master Shenguan,

198
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,360
I lied and said I had already
given birth before meeting him.

199
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
I was of servile status,

200
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,130
and became pregnant after secretly meeting
a young master of the manor.

201
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,639
Fearing the child would be dragged down
by my fate, I fled.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,940
The manor sent people
to hunt me down everywhere,

203
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,960
but a lone woman
with a child could hardly stay hidden.

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,519
Here.

205
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,879
As my due date drew near...

206
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,590
Thank you, madam.

207
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,320
They still discovered my trail.

208
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,920
On the day
the household guards found me,

209
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,390
Master Shenguan happened
to be there seeking alms.

210
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,519
I knew that being taken back
meant certain death.

211
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,639
Come with us.

212
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,879
The child is his.

213
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,039
He is my husband.

214
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,080
I called Master Shenguan
my husband through the door.

215
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,240
After a brief moment of thought,

216
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,399
Master Shenguan acknowledged it.

217
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,000
Sirs,

218
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,600
the child is mine.

219
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:31,919
Please leave.

220
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,200
The matter soon spread far and wide,

221
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,360
tarnishing the master's good name.

222
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,919
Yet he never defended himself.

223
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,960
Instead, at my request,
he took the child away.

224
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,720
Thank you, Master.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,039
From then on,
ten years passed without a word.

226
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,279
So when Master Shenguan sought you out,

227
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,000
it was because he wished

228
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,399
to take you to see the child.

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,240
That was indeed his intention,

230
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,080
but given my own status,

231
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,120
I could not bear

232
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,519
to let the child suffer disgrace.

233
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,519
So I agreed with the master

234
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,360
to meet the child only
after I had redeemed myself.

235
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Who could have known

236
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,519
that the master
would meet such a calamity.

237
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,840
Then who is the child's father?

238
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,010
That is all in the past.

239
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,160
What meaning is there
in speaking of it now?

240
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
I only feel that

241
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,759
you seemed very fond of him.

242
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,360
It has been over ten years.

243
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,879
Whatever feelings there once were

244
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,240
have long since faded away.

245
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,759
Your Highness.

246
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,159
There is another strange matter.

247
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,990
I am not sure
whether it will be of use to you.

248
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,519
About half a year ago,

249
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,080
someone approached me
at the Music Office

250
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,039
and had me sell a kind of scented powder
from Nanzhao to the girls.

251
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,240
What was strange
about this scented powder?

252
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,919
The man who supplied it was suspicious.

253
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,039
He demanded

254
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,919
that I never speak of this to outsiders.

255
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,879
And secondly,

256
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,480
many of the girls

257
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,799
bought the powder from me,

258
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,240
and it truly made
many patrons linger and return.

259
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,399
Young Master Zhao frequented my place,

260
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,559
and he, too,
became addicted because of it.

261
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,440
(A scented powder that makes
people linger and return.)

262
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,039
(Could it be...)

263
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,890
Do you still have any
of this scented powder?

264
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,120
I did not keep any stock this time.

265
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,639
When I get more next time,

266
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,930
I will bring it to Your Highness.

267
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,200
Then what do you plan to do next?

268
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:35,000
Leave the Music Office.

269
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,960
Quietly,

270
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,159
stay near Jing Yuan,

271
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,399
do more good deeds,

272
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,399
and for the rest of my life,

273
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:45,559
treat it as atonement.

274
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:48,799
For my child,

275
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,230
I will pray for blessings.

276
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,480
Quit?

277
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,900
Do you really think
that leaving this place

278
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,100
lets you pass yourself off
as some innocent young lady?

279
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,110
You think that because the Three Judicial
Offices helped you find your child,

280
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
I can no longer touch you?

281
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,159
How did you know?

282
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,399
I have been watching you

283
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,919
every moment.

284
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,320
I only want

285
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,279
a steady life for the rest of my days.

286
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,260
After staying
in the Music Office for so long,

287
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,900
you should understand
that cutting off someone's income

288
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,799
is no different
from killing their parents.

289
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,919
We have done business together
for so long,

290
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,919
and you think you can just quit at will?

291
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,360
And still dream of a peaceful life?

292
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,039
Take one more client.

293
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,519
Use this scented powder

294
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,399
to hook him.

295
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,639
Once I find the next buyer,

296
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,919
we will be square.

297
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,919
Qinxiang.

298
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,600
Do not push your luck.

299
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,159
Otherwise, even if you
leave the Music Office,

300
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:08,320
I can still take your life,

301
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,879
along with that little monk's.

302
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,360
Fine.

303
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,440
I will take just one last client.

304
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,639
That is more like it.

305
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
Those who know
when to yield are the wise.

306
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,039
He…

307
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,039
Jing Yuan,

308
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,039
I have come this time

309
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,440
to apologize to you and to the master.

310
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:14,240
He was implicated because of me.

311
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,679
In this lifetime,

312
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:18,679
I have no way to repay him.

313
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,690
Last night, the master
appeared in my dream

314
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,240
and told me not to harbor hatred.

315
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,320
He said four words to me.

316
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:28,759
Which four words?

317
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,279
Each bears their own karma.

318
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,879
Therefore,

319
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,840
everything between the master and me

320
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,960
has nothing to do with you.

321
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,690
He has already let go
of all worldly ties.

322
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,919
The karmic bonds of this world

323
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,120
can no longer bind him.

324
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
Madam,

325
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,279
please seek your own release.

326
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,840
I still has one matter
that does not understand.

327
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,000
At a crossroads,

328
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,679
with a choice hard to make,

329
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,480
if the wrong path is chosen,

330
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,500
one may be forever parted
from those dearest to them.

331
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,880
What troubles you?

332
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,279
It concerns my own fate,

333
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:14,839
yet that person's fate

334
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,799
runs counter
to the moral duty of the state.

335
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
As the Buddha's teachings say,

336
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,930
one must repay
the four great debts of gratitude,

337
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,370
and relieve suffering
in the three lower realms.

338
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,079
One of those four debts

339
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,839
is the debt owed to the realm.

340
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,039
Before his passing,

341
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,180
the master was repeatedly
displaced and worn down.

342
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,839
Even after his passing,

343
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,370
he was still slandered by others.

344
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
But I know this well.

345
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,990
Despite all the injustices he endured,

346
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
he never harbored resentment,

347
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,319
nor would he ever blame Great Tang.

348
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,519
All he wished for
was to spare others worry,

349
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,190
to lessen their suffering,

350
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,319
and to pass this life
in peace and steadiness.

351
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,519
Though you are of servile status,

352
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,900
and have borne
the hardships of the world,

353
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,799
your convictions are unwavering.

354
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,990
You always place the greater good
of the people first.

355
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,039
How could you not
be a noble person as well?

356
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,759
Thank you, Jing Yuan.

357
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,200
I understand now.

358
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,359
Madam.

359
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,990
Of the four great debts of gratitude,

360
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,200
the first

361
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,759
is the debt owed to one's parents.

362
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,720
So you know now.

363
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,480
I, Jing Yuan,

364
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,359
thank you, Madam.

365
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,720
Your Highness.

366
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,799
The case is closed.

367
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,120
Did His Majesty not reward you?

368
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,039
Why do you still
look as troubled as a ghost?

369
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,759
There is no shortage of monsters
and madmen in the Capital.

370
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,480
Master Shenguan's case

371
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,759
may be closed in Great Tang,

372
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,039
but those from Nanzhao behind it

373
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,759
may still be hiding in the capital.

374
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,319
The scented powder Qinxiang mentioned

375
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,559
also came from Nanzhao.

376
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,060
So you asked His Majesty

377
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,890
to allow you
to keep investigating Nanzhao?

378
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,990
Given the current relations
between the two sides,

379
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,559
His Majesty instructed me
not to act rashly,

380
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,000
so as to avoid worsening tensions.

381
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,039
Wait, hold on.

382
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,359
Your Highness,

383
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,279
I think you have become
obsessed with this case.

384
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,630
You have been under
far too much pressure lately.

385
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,580
If this keeps up,
before the truth is uncovered,

386
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,660
you will have trapped yourself
in your own prison.

387
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,430
We should step back for a moment,

388
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,480
slow things down,

389
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,120
and pay attention to something else.

390
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:55,880
Like what?

391
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,240
For instance, Chu Chu.

392
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,960
When I said before that you
were tangled up in your feelings,

393
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,599
I was not talking nonsense.

394
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,759
You were right.

395
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,000
I truly did not handle things well.

396
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:12,319
Matters of the heart, you see,

397
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,279
I can spot them at a glance.

398
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,200
Alright then.

399
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,279
I will take you somewhere good.

400
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,710
Not only can you
keep investigating cases,

401
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,079
it might even cure
your troubles of the heart.

402
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,200
Let's go.

403
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,279
Where to?

404
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,000
Once the Emperor's birthday passes,

405
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,480
the night curfew will soon begin.

406
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,430
You should take advantage
of these few days

407
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,710
to get out and wander a bit more.

408
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,680
Do not keep brooding over those cases.

409
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,799
Cases can never all be solved,

410
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,799
but life still has to be lived.

411
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,200
Let us pick up where we left off,

412
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,990
- and keep chatting
- Come on, let's take a look.

413
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,839
about those fresh tidbits
from the Marquis's residence.

414
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,799
How about it?

415
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,119
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

416
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,160
Last time, we were saying that

417
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,680
(Wan Qianshan, Left Remonstrant of the Chancellery)
our young marquis here

418
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:00,680
was swamped with official duties,
working day and night,

419
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:03,079
(Miaoyu Pavilion)
and without meaning to,

420
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:05,100
ended up neglecting
his beloved wife at home.

421
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
As time went on,

422
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,200
the bond between husband and wife

423
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,400
grew increasingly precarious.

424
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,400
And just by chance,

425
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,279
at such a critical moment,

426
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
from who knows where,

427
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,400
there appeared a foreign prince
from a vassal state.

428
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,559
The first time he met the young bride,

429
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,799
the two of them immediately
caught each other's eye.

430
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,440
Doesn't this sound very much like

431
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,079
Commandery Prince An
and his wife?

432
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,880
And that foreign prince,

433
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,650
wasn't he the Second Prince of Nanzhao?

434
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:37,890
It's probably
the storyteller making things up.

435
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,260
The Princess Consort and the Prince

436
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:40,759
are famously devoted to each other.

437
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,079
They are the envy
of so many unmarried youths.

438
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,920
That's right.

439
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,200
Shall we keep listening?

440
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,799
As the saying goes,

441
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,519
great households are rife with grudges.

442
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,160
Everyone here,

443
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:57,039
think about it.

444
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,519
Married for three years already,

445
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,240
yet she has never conceived.

446
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,119
Why is that?

447
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,759
Go on, say it, hurry up.

448
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,880
What you don't know is,

449
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,279
the young marquis has
been frail in body

450
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,319
since childhood,

451
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,839
and unable

452
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,039
to fulfill marital relations.

453
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,920
The young bride,
in the prime of her life,

454
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,039
how could she endure such loneliness?

455
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,039
And with that handsome young prince

456
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,720
casting a little temptation her way,

457
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,279
it became serious trouble.

458
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,440
The two were like dry wood meeting fire,

459
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,599
and in an instant...

460
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,690
What do you think happened?

461
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,559
What happened?

462
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,839
They went up in flames.

463
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:42,079
A breach of morals,

464
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,559
a disgrace to the court.

465
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,480
If you wish to know what comes next,

466
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,440
then listen

467
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,000
to the next telling.

468
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,559
Is everything you said true?

469
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,440
True...

470
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,319
Is it really true?

471
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,400
We won't say that for now.

472
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,400
But,

473
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,880
this bit of news,

474
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,000
I paid silver

475
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,240
to pry from the mouth

476
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:07,079
of an official.

477
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,839
And I'm not afraid to tell you,

478
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,839
this official held no small post.

479
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,480
He was a Deputy Prefect.

480
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:17,900
You can't leave.

481
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,740
Come with me to the Yamen
and explain yourself.

482
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,400
Which Yamen?

483
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:22,540
Every word you said was hinting
at the Commandery Prince An's Mansion.

484
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,080
If it's false, that is slander against
a senior court official.

485
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,359
I'm just a storyteller.

486
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,680
I merely told a tale today,

487
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,920
and you merely listened today.

488
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,279
Just take it as entertainment.

489
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,480
No, you can't leave.

490
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,839
What are you doing?

491
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm telling you,

492
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,799
those filthy affairs
of the Commandery Prince An's Mansion,

493
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,559
who doesn't know about them?

494
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,680
They've already taken things this far,

495
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,920
and they're afraid I'll talk?

496
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,319
And that's not all.

497
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,240
Someone saw the two
of them with their own eyes,

498
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,519
being all affectionate
as they came out of that pharmacy,

499
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:48,559
and they even...

500
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,000
Why is she hitting him?

501
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,039
What a mouth that can really
make things up.

502
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,200
My fists have been itching for days,

503
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,359
and you came right to me.

504
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,799
See if I don't break your legs today.

505
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,640
Don't hit me.

506
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,559
Don't hit me.

507
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,519
Don't run.

508
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,920
Don't dodge.

509
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,850
If you've got guts, stop running.

510
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,640
Stop right there.

511
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,200
Make way.

512
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:24,200
Make way.

513
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,319
Leng Yue.

514
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,319
That's enough.

515
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,240
Stop.

516
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,440
I am Wan Qianshan,
Left Remonstrant of the Chancellery.

517
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,160
Madam, please restrain yourself.

518
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,500
So you are
a Left Remonstrant of the Chancellery.

519
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,119
Instead of supervising officials,

520
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,440
you stand here
listening to slanderous filth.

521
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,359
Though he may
be recklessly smearing the court,

522
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,720
he should be taken
to the Yamen for proper verification,

523
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,600
not beaten at random in the street.

524
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,240
Fine.

525
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,740
Then today I will take him
to the Three Judicial Offices.

526
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:57,590
That will not do either.

527
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,720
This tale involves Commandery Prince An,

528
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,660
the Princess Consort,
and an envoy from Nanzhao.

529
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,660
Everyone within
the Three Judicial Offices

530
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,020
must avoid any appearance of bias.

531
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,240
Wan Qianshan, got beaten again
for your loose mouth, didn't you?

532
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,900
You two young ladies,

533
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,759
this man's mouth knows no restraint.

534
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,480
If he dares to spout nonsense again,

535
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,240
you may beat him.

536
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,500
If I weren't afraid
of killing him with one punch,

537
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,590
I would have done it myself long ago.

538
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,640
Then I leave him to you, Lord Wan.

539
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,079
Leng Yue, let's go.

540
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,400
Let's go.

541
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:29,440
Alright.

542
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,559
What a pack of people they are.

543
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,640
They look so refined,

544
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,410
yet open their mouths
only to spread filth.

545
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,670
They really should all be thrown into

546
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,090
the prison
of the Three Judicial Offices.

547
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,279
It's my fault too.

548
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,170
I've been running around
with Jing Yi all this time,

549
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,960
and failed to notice such vile talk.

550
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,200
If I catch them again next time,

551
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,519
I won't let it go.

552
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,359
Enough.

553
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,290
Don't be angry anymore.

554
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,799
You see, things I never did,

555
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,990
no matter how many people
say them, they're still false.

556
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,640
Right?

557
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:03,240
Forget it.

558
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,359
This street is no fun.

559
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:05,780
How about this?

560
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,480
I'll take you somewhere new.

561
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,799
Let's go.

562
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,400
I'm almost embarrassed to admit
I come from the same place as you.

563
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,960
We were both civil and military champions
of the same year,

564
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,440
yet someone who only relies on words

565
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
is this weak and fragile.

566
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,410
Vice Minister Jing's wife could knock you
straight to the underworld with one punch.

567
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,480
What good is showing off to me?

568
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,799
If you have the ability,
go fight Nanzhao on the front lines.

569
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,920
A coward who bullies only at home,

570
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,910
does that live up to your title
as military champion?

571
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,990
You think I don't want to?

572
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,680
The moment His Majesty gives the order,

573
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,359
I'll prepare to set out at once.

574
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,039
To die wrapped in horsehide
is a man's true honor.

575
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,519
At first, when I heard Jiang Daohai

576
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,850
spreading gossip about
the Commandery Prince An's Mansion,

577
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,870
I was ready to impeach them
for fabricating rumors.

578
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,190
But today, Lady Jing struck
without hearing a word of explanation.

579
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,670
That was clearly anger
born of embarrassment,

580
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,510
which only shows
those rumors may not be entirely false.

581
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,100
Oh, come on.

582
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,319
You civil officials,

583
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,590
why are you so fond of chewing
on other people's gossip?

584
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,990
What does someone else's family
business have to do with you?

585
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,650
If you're truly that idle,

586
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:04,599
go sweep horse dung at the barracks.

587
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,759
A brute.

588
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,390
The Commandery Prince An and his consort
are both members of the Imperial Family,

589
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,100
and are especially valued
by His Majesty.

590
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,160
They are admired
by many promising young talents,

591
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,400
and should exercise restraint
and set an example.

592
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,880
Yet now, rumors are everywhere,

593
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,440
and their conduct remains improper.

594
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,599
If I do not impeach this,

595
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,500
it would be a failure of my duty.

596
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,839
Wan Qianshan.

597
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,000
So this is the "good place"
you mentioned.

598
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,839
Later, I really must discuss
this properly with Leng Yue.

599
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,559
Your Highness, don't be so impatient.

600
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,490
I truly did bring you here
to look into a case.

601
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,480
What case?

602
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,870
Which household's lady
are you arresting for grievances?

603
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,650
Or which woman's love feud
are you judging?

604
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,759
You're underestimating me.

605
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,630
Didn't Your Highness say

606
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,440
someone here was selling
that scented powder?

607
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,220
His Majesty won't allow us
to openly investigate cases,

608
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,430
but surely we're still allowed
to stroll through the Music Office.

609
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,079
We're investigating
under the guise of seeking pleasure,

610
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,910
which could even be called
risking ourselves for what's right.

611
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,500
Otherwise, I wouldn't have come at all.

612
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,319
Please, come in.

613
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,240
Miss Hua Mei.

614
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:46,480
Chu Chu.

615
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,799
(Hua Mei, Music Office Dance Master)
This is Hua Mei, the dance master of the Music Office.

616
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,690
She is also
a friend of Jing Yi and mine.

617
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,000
I knew distinguished guests were coming,

618
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,000
but I did not expect Miss Yue

619
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,790
to bring
the Commandery Princess Consort An.

620
00:29:57,079 --> 00:29:59,220
Had I known earlier,
I would have prepared more food.

621
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,119
These few modest pastries

622
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,780
hardly do justice
to such honored guests.

623
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,640
Hua Mei,

624
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,599
we came precisely

625
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,960
for your pastries.

626
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,000
Bring out whatever new treats
you have as well.

627
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,279
Go and see what else there is,

628
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,799
bring more over.

629
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,400
Yes.

630
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:15,960
Please, sit.

631
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:16,720
Here.

632
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,400
Miss Chu Chu,

633
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,920
try this.

634
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,400
Snow Jade Cake.

635
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,319
It may not be anything rare,

636
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,839
but the method here

637
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:32,920
is a little different.

638
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,559
It's good.

639
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,240
Isn't it?

640
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:36,839
Mm.

641
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,230
Guangtai House is nothing special.

642
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,200
In all of Chang'an,

643
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,410
this place has the best food.

644
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,640
As long as Miss Chu Chu does not mind,

645
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,880
there will always be

646
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,599
good pastries waiting for you here.

647
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,799
Why would I mind?

648
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,119
This really is delicious.

649
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,759
Didn't I tell you before,

650
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,039
Chu Chu has none
of a Princess Consort's airs?

651
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,680
She treats everyone the same.

652
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,400
I know.

653
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:57,960
About Qinxiang,

654
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:59,240
thank you, Miss Chu Chu.

655
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,400
She suffered for many years,

656
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,279
and at last saw the light.

657
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,319
I did very little.

658
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,359
It was Master Shenguan who helped her,

659
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,519
and more than that,

660
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,480
she saved herself.

661
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,240
Is she planning to redeem herself?

662
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,850
She has already reached
an agreement with the dancers.

663
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,990
Once her servile status
is redeemed, she will leave.

664
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Likely as early as tomorrow.

665
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,839
That is excellent news.

666
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Well.

667
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,160
Vice Minister Jing.

668
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,359
What brings you here today?

669
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,480
It has been quite some time.

670
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,200
You look much thinner than before.

671
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,160
No need for empty courtesies.

672
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,599
I am here on proper business.

673
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,680
Listen to you.

674
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,580
Any honored guest who comes
to my Music Office

675
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,319
is here for proper business.

676
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,920
As for this young gentleman,

677
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,000
so refined in bearing,

678
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,850
you must be here
on proper business as well.

679
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,870
The Music Office has recently...

680
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,920
You're just doing business.

681
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,820
Why do you talk much
than an investigator?

682
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:13,100
Careful, or you may lose money.

683
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,960
Just a few lighthearted remarks.

684
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,799
Vice Minister Jing,

685
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,290
surely you are not
taking them seriously.

686
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
All right.

687
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,559
I will not disturb you any further.

688
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,359
You all,

689
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,720
treat this place as your own.

690
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,359
Enjoy yourselves as you wish.

691
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:25,900
Please go upstairs.

692
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
This way upstairs.

693
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,000
Upstairs, please.

694
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,720
Your Highness, please do not
take her words to heart.

695
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,430
Those are merely courtesies
of such places.

696
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,990
It would be the same anywhere,
so do not take them seriously.

697
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,690
It sounds like you have
been to quite a few yourself.

698
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,359
Only by hearsay.

699
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,720
Vice Minister Jing.

700
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,759
Back again?

701
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,559
Only by hearsay?

702
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:51,480
Thank you.

703
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,120
Vice Minister Jing is here.

704
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,000
What?

705
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,480
And...

706
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,260
And he brought an honored guest.

707
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,680
He asked you to keep tonight free.

708
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,359
That distinguished guest

709
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,920
is likely not these two.

710
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,519
He told me that tonight

711
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,480
he is to do something truly virtuous.

712
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,390
That would indeed be a great merit.

713
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,119
Do not rush just yet.

714
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,640
Perhaps Jing Yi is making
discreet inquiries for a case.

715
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,359
If we go over so hastily,

716
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,119
we might ruin their plans.

717
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:18,880
Miss Chu Chu is right.

718
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Miss Yue, please wait here.

719
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,079
Allow me to take a look.

720
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,160
All right.

721
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,039
You still do not trust Jing Yi?

722
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,279
In his heart,

723
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:40,799
there is no room left
for any other woman.

724
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:44,599
That much I do know.

725
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,839
However...

726
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:51,240
If he dares to misbehave behind my back,

727
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,720
I will tear

728
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:54,960
his heart out,

729
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:56,319
and stew it.

730
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:57,519
No problem.

731
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,720
What kind of knife do you want?

732
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,000
I have every kind here.

733
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:05,799
Chu Chu.

734
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,360
Vice Minister Jing.

735
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
What took you so long?

736
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,599
You kept Hua Mei waiting.

737
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:21,920
Miss Hua Mei,
why have you changed rooms?

738
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,800
Knowing Vice Minister Jing
would be entertaining honored guests,

739
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:28,239
of course I prepared the finest room.

740
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:29,360
Please, both of you.

741
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,239
Much obliged today, Zhang.

742
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,880
Sheer recklessness
will not carry you far.

743
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:42,840
Zhao Fengming,

744
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,519
instead of talking about dying
on the battlefield day after day,

745
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,700
you would do better to first find a way

746
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,280
to set the new recruits' camp in order.

747
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,860
It has nearly become a refuge
for idle sons of noble houses.

748
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,960
Do not wait
until you reach the battlefield,

749
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,270
only to use that head of yours,

750
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,599
stubborn as a stone in a latrine,

751
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,159
to clean up after their mess.

752
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,679
You are worried about me?

753
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,159
The troops of Jiaozhou,

754
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,280
fierce as tigers and wolves,

755
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,590
stand ever watchful,
weapons at the ready.

756
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,400
Signal fires face one another,

757
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,480
their ranks stern and resolute,

758
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,310
their blades pointed
toward the world beyond.

759
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,239
As for those petty and despicable men,

760
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,290
they deserve to be struck down,

761
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,280
named and condemned.

762
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,639
These lines of your proclamation

763
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,199
sound far more compelling

764
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,280
than the overly refined verses
you usually write.

765
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,719
Rest assured.

766
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:39,280
As long as I remain here,

767
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,159
I will see to it

768
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,760
that this sharp tongue of yours

769
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,400
can still denounce the officials,

770
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,830
and speak plainly before the court.

771
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,599
Zhao Fengming.

772
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:49,880
What...

773
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,800
Qianshan.

774
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,599
Speak of someone and he arrives.

775
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,239
Enough already.

776
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,020
All the sharp tongues
have gathered in one place.

777
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:55,559
I am leaving.

778
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,679
Qianshan, you came
at just the right time.

779
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,119
Meng, what do you mean by that?

780
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,559
That proclamation you wrote
against Nanzhao

781
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,440
was forceful and stirring,

782
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:09,440
every word strong enough
to stand against an army.

783
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,119
Yes.

784
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,159
That is why we

785
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,390
specifically invited musicians
from the Music Office

786
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,159
to set the proclamation
to music as a battle anthem.

787
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:17,920
Since we have met by chance,

788
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,679
we may as well listen together.

789
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,000
My mother's teachings

790
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,599
forbid me from entering places
of revelry lightly.

791
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,480
I should not disturb
your refined enjoyment.

792
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,870
- Rest assured.
- Come along, Qianshan.

793
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,180
- Men of taste know their bounds.
- Exactly.

794
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,460
- Still, I cannot.
- Come on.

795
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:32,840
I cannot.

796
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,880
Let us go.

797
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,360
That is the carriage
of the Commandery Prince An's Mansion.

798
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,679
Indeed it is.

799
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,440
What impropriety.

800
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,559
The Prince visiting the Music Office,

801
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,900
the Princess Consort
disregarding propriety,

802
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:53,440
betraying His Majesty's trust,

803
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,790
unfit to serve
as an example to the court.

804
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,780
We must report the conduct
of the Commandery Prince An and his wife

805
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,119
to His Majesty.

806
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,519
That seems unnecessary.

807
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,280
Why involve ourselves?

808
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,239
Let it go.

809
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,260
You may fear the Commandery Prince An,

810
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,320
but I do not.

811
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,119
If you dare not submit a memorial,

812
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,039
I will.

813
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:16,840
Qianshan.

814
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,039
I do not drink.

815
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,559
Miss Hua Mei,
please do not trouble yourself.

816
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,519
In truth, we asked you here today
because of this...

817
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,119
This young master

818
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,760
wishes to inquire about certain matters
within the Music Office.

819
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,719
Concerning about...

820
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,480
A murder case?

821
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:48,320
It is said that Chang'an
has been unsettled of late.

822
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,360
It is also said
that within the past half year,

823
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,890
someone has been secretly trading
an intoxicating incense in the Music Office.

824
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,159
Have you heard of this?

825
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,599
Yes.

826
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,360
Someone approached me before

827
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:59,599
and asked me to resell it
to the other girls.

828
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,679
Do you know who that person was,

829
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,440
or did they leave any clues?

830
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,599
I did not pay
much attention at the time.

831
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,320
Thinking back now,

832
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,280
nothing about them
seemed particularly unusual.

833
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,440
Then do you know who in the Music Office

834
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,760
used this incense?

835
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,599
Most of them, I would say.

836
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,559
I heard it was bought from Qinxiang.

837
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:21,840
It did bring in
a great deal of business.

838
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,400
As for anything else,

839
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,159
I really do not know.

840
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,239
Thank you, Miss.

841
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,800
Then let us ask elsewhere.

842
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,159
No need to rush.

843
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,720
The official matter is settled,
but what about the personal one?

844
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,480
Nonsense.

845
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,480
Miss Hua Mei has been
in the Music Office for many years.

846
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,990
She has seen all kinds of people
and understands matters thoroughly.

847
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:42,400
If you speak with her properly,

848
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,440
she will surely find
the heart of the problem

849
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,599
and set things right.

850
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,000
Vice Minister Jing gives me

851
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,519
far too much credit.

852
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,480
Vice Minister Jing and Miss Yue

853
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,310
showed Hua Mei a kindness
like a second life.

854
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,679
This honored guest

855
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,480
is a friend of Vice Minister Jing.

856
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,140
Any difficulty troubling
the honored guest

857
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,719
is also Hua Mei's concern.

858
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,719
Very well.

859
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,079
I will leave him with you.

860
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,559
You must tell the physician everything.

861
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,199
Otherwise, if the diagnosis is wrong
and the medicine is misused,

862
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,550
you will bear the consequences yourself.

863
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:15,519
Be careful.

864
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,159
It is fine.

865
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,519
This way.

866
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,119
Watch your step.

867
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,400
All right.

868
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,119
My…

869
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:27,079
