00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,719

(All of these incidents
converge into one.)

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,440
(The mastermind's purpose
is unmistakable.)

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,359
(To plunge Jiaozhou into chaos.)

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,519
(Who would have the ability
to do these things)

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,440
(and then push Han Ji out)

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,240
(to serve as a scapegoat?)

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,960
(That seemingly fragile Madam Yulan)

11
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,439
(is likely far from simple.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

28
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,560
(This story is entirely fictional.)

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,240
=Episode 24=

30
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,639
Longsheng,

31
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,919
why are you annoyed with me again?

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,170
If you have something to say,
say it outright.

33
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,159
Why waste this table of food?

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,800
You lowborn!

35
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,520
Did you kill the men
I left behind in Jiaozhou?

36
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,120
If I had not found a way to escape,

37
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,980
I would have fallen
to your schemes as well!

38
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,360
To be so depraved as to use
poisonous insects to harm others...

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,639
If not you,

40
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:57,919
then who else?

41
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,439
I see now.

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,680
Longsheng, you mean those troops

43
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,360
who were trapped in Jiaozhou
because of your poor command?

44
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:06,960
You!

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,360
When you said
you had men holding Jiaozhou,

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,000
I did not even grasp it at first.

47
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,159
Longsheng,

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
you ruined Father's plan,

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
and now you fear his punishment,

50
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,039
so you want to pin the blame on me?

51
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:20,560
Nonsense.

52
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,990
Stop pretending to be innocent
in front of me.

53
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,840
Just like the lowly mother of yours,

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,599
you only know such despicable tricks.

55
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,199
Longsheng, your own methods
are hardly respectable.

56
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,039
As a child, you relied on Mother,
and now, on your wife.

57
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,199
Longsheng,

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,360
you came here to cause a scene.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Does your wife know?

60
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,319
Should you not seek her approval first?

61
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,599
You Chen'an.

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,639
We will see how this ends.

63
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,300
(Prefect's Residence)

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,990
Madam has been overly worried
these past few days,

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,120
and her health is not good.

66
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,240
Lord Han, please try
to talk some sense into her.

67
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,160
Drinking this pregnancy tonic every day,

68
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,480
what good does it really do?

69
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:53,040
Madam, please do not think that way.

70
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,720
I can see how much

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,240
you cherish this child.

72
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,240
The time is almost here.

73
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,480
Once the baby is born,

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,040
everything will be fine.

75
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,759
Madam.

76
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,759
I am pregnant.

77
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,520
Chief Clark Han,
please come up and speak.

78
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,079
Chief Clerk Han, rest assured.

79
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,439
No matter what,

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,519
I will not let him ruin your future.

81
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,680
This is bad.

82
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,160
Madam.

83
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,639
I fear our affair
can no longer be concealed.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,399
What happened?

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,959
Commandery Prince An and his wife
must have heard some rumors

86
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,079
or noticed something

87
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,199
from our dealings.

88
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,639
They summoned me

89
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,839
and kept probing just now.

90
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,399
If it was only probing,

91
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,040
they probably
haven't found any solid evidence.

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,959
You have no idea
what underhanded methods

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,319
that couple resorts to.

94
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,879
If they really find something out,

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,300
then the matter of Prefect Liu...

96
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
There's no way

97
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,480
I could ever clear my name.

98
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,879
Then, perhaps

99
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,800
we should go and confess everything
to Commandery Prince An.

100
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,560
Do not panic.

101
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
In matters like this,

102
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,199
what real evidence
could outsiders possibly find?

103
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,759
You're an upright gentleman,
Chief Clerk Han.

104
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:31,480
You get anxious as soon
as others start probing.

105
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,480
If you panic and lose your footing,

106
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,480
you will truly
be falling into their trap, right?

107
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,120
But...

108
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,279
Chief Clerk,

109
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,279
calm your heart.

110
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,560
How about this?

111
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,790
Later on, I will go
and take a look myself.

112
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,959
Commandery Prince An
is as stubborn as stone,

113
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,690
not an easy man to deal with.

114
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,160
But I hear Commandery Princess Consort An
comes from the countryside.

115
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,439
She only knows autopsies

116
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,680
and is ignorant of social graces.

117
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,199
That is indeed the case...

118
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,879
Then, that settles it.

119
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,160
You find a way to draw
Commandery Prince An away.

120
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,000
I will go and have a word with his wife.

121
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,519
Anyway,

122
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,439
Liu Shijiang is a serving Prefect

123
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,199
and also my husband.

124
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,360
Urging them to capture the culprit

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,879
is only fair and proper, is it not?

126
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,920
(So this is a poisonous insect
unique to Nanzhao.)

127
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:42,639
(The eggs enter
the human body with food,)

128
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,390
(where they parasitize and grow.)

129
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,680
(Once mature, the insects
burst out of the body.)

130
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,800
(They are highly aggressive.)

131
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,580
(They can only be lured
and controlled by a special incense.)

132
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,439
(If left unchecked,)

133
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,199
(the consequences will be endless.)

134
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,720
(They spread outward
through water and food,)

135
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,319
(seeking new hosts.)

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,580
(Then, they reproduce again,)

137
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,200
(leading to infinite consequences.)

138
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,160
Who is it?

139
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,160
Yulan.

140
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,260
Madam Yulan, it's difficult
for you to move around.

141
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,630
Is there something you need me for?

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,879
Earlier, I failed to show proper regard

143
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,600
and spurned Your Highness's kindness.

144
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,970
After calming down, the more I thought
about it, the more uneasy I became.

145
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,839
I came especially to offer my apology.

146
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,319
Please don't say that.

147
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,120
We are staying in the residence
and have relied greatly on your care.

148
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,400
Please, come in and have a seat.

149
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,799
I truly apologize, Madam Yulan.

150
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,039
I will tidy up these books
once I am finished.

151
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,600
Your Highness
holds such an exalted status,

152
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,590
yet you are so considerate
of those beneath you.

153
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,200
I am deeply moved by this.

154
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:17,600
You may not know,

155
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,770
I was raised in a coroner's household
on the Southwest frontier.

156
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,679
It is the title
of Princess Consort that is noble, not myself.

157
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,790
There is no one else here at the moment.

158
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,320
Let us put formalities aside.

159
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,120
If you feel at ease, so will I.

160
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,720
By the way, Your Highness,

161
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,170
you had someone borrow
these medical texts and pharmacopoeias.

162
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,919
Is it for the Prefect's case?

163
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,799
How is it progressing?

164
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,679
You may rest assured.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,850
With His Highness handling the matter,
the truth will soon come to light.

166
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,320
It is only that

167
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,679
the Yamen has its rules.

168
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,690
While the investigation is ongoing,

169
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,690
case details cannot be disclosed freely.

170
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,990
I ask Your Highness to forgive me.

171
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,200
But

172
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,240
it's hard for me to bear this torment.

173
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,919
Had I not been
so concerned about the baby

174
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,660
and insisted on sleeping
in a separate room from my husband,

175
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,840
perhaps this wouldn't have happened.

176
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,300
Sometimes when I think about it,

177
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,519
I truly wish to take the child

178
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,320
and follow him to the afterlife.

179
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
Please do not think that way.

180
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,559
Prefect Liu cherished you deeply.

181
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,570
If he were aware of this in the afterlife,

182
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,880
he would surely be heartbroken.

183
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:27,159
In truth,

184
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,919
the case is already clear.

185
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,600
All that remains
is to arrest the culprit.

186
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,039
Is that so?

187
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,480
Who exactly was it

188
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,440
that would strike my husband
with such cruelty?

189
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,840
Your Highness.

190
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,399
I'm begging you.

191
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,120
Madam Yulan.

192
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,799
Fine.

193
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,279
As a fellow woman,

194
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I will tell you.

195
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,080
Please sit first.

196
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,480
During the examination, I discovered

197
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,960
that Prefect Liu had been killed
by poisonous insects.

198
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,159
But these poisonous insects
do not grow naturally in the wild.

199
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,880
They were raised by human hands,

200
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,399
specifically to harm others.

201
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,690
His Highness has already deduced
where these poisonous insects were bred

202
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,720
and is preparing

203
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,500
to lead men there to make arrests.

204
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,240
Poisonous insects?

205
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
What sort of insects can be bred

206
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,320
to kill people?

207
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,720
That place must be extremely dangerous.

208
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,890
You have only just arrived here.
You must be careful.

209
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Do not fall into a villain's trap.

210
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,759
Thank you for the reminder.

211
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,560
With His Highness present,

212
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,960
nothing will go wrong.

213
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,440
You only need to wait

214
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,520
for the true culprit
to be brought to justice.

215
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,759
Madam Yulan's pregnancy

216
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,000
really is fake.

217
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,000
How did it go?

218
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,220
The snake has left its hole.

219
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,400
Chief Luo and my elder brother
have gone after them.

220
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,440
As expected.

221
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,320
Fortunately,

222
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:50,960
you discovered Madam Yulan's

223
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,919
false pregnancy.

224
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,639
When did you and Madam Yulan begin?

225
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,520
Does that have anything
to do with your case?

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,159
Why should I answer you?

227
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:58,799
This...

228
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,960
That night, after Liu Shijiang left,

229
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,639
Madam Yulan invited me to drink

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,420
and talk about some trivial matters

231
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,559
after his departure.

232
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,300
I drank too much and got drunk.

233
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,399
The next morning, I realized

234
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,559
that somehow

235
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,720
I was sleeping beside Madam Yulan.

236
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,080
After that night,

237
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,919
did you often sleep together?

238
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,919
Of course not.

239
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,759
It happened only that once!

240
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,039
I truly drank too much.

241
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,480
I cannot remember anything clearly.

242
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,600
I regret it deeply.

243
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,440
The next day, she told me

244
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,360
that the two of us had lost control,

245
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,540
and that was why we slept together.

246
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,519
She even said

247
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,830
she did not blame me
and would keep it secret for my sake.

248
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,759
Yet not long after,

249
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,200
she told you

250
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,720
that she was pregnant.

251
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:51,600
Yes.

252
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,480
After a woman becomes pregnant,

253
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
as the months pass,

254
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,120
the baby inside will gradually grow.

255
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,100
(Thoracic kyphosis, forward head posture)
The spine and pelvis

256
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,399
(Pelvis angle shift, lumbar lordosis)
change accordingly.

257
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,039
Judging by the size of her belly,

258
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,990
it did appear to be
six or seven months along.

259
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,679
(Abdominal protrusion)
Yet her spine showed no change at all.

260
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,960
And the area
between the waist and abdomen

261
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,799
(No changes of spine)
shows no signs of long-term strain.

262
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,090
When she sat or rose,
she looked as if it were difficult,

263
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,720
but the way the force was applied
was completely wrong.

264
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,879
(Wrong force application)

265
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,399
While giving her the bracelet,

266
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,000
I took the chance to feel her pulse.

267
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,720
(No sign of slippery pulse)
There was no sign of a slippery pulse either.

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,679
Therefore, from beginning to end,
she was deceiving you.

269
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,080
From the day
she deliberately got you drunk,

270
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,440
she had already planned

271
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,840
to pin the charge
of plotting Liu Shijiang's murder

272
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,320
onto you.

273
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,919
She was lying to me.

274
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:36,559
She...

275
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:37,639
How dare

276
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,759
she use such means

277
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,759
to deceive me.

278
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,879
After all these twists and turns,

279
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,360
you did not come away
empty-handed, Lord Han.

280
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,679
Like?

281
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,159
Madam Yulan

282
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,399
meticulously plotted

283
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,960
and managed affairs for over ten years.

284
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,759
You deserve the greatest credit

285
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,600
for exposing her, Lord Han.

286
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:57,279
Hearing this,

287
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,000
it hardly sounds like any merit at all.

288
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,480
Better late

289
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,519
than never.

290
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
With Liu Shijiang dead,

291
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,679
Nanzhao could first use
prophecies to stir momentum.

292
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,399
Second, with Jiaozhou leaderless,

293
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,900
panic would spread among the people.

294
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,590
Only then could Nanzhao

295
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,830
seize the opening
and move into the Southwest frontier.

296
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,360
Those poisonous insects
were their contingency plan.

297
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,500
Given the current situation,

298
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,240
things have already grown dire.

299
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,320
The threat posed by those insects
cannot be underestimated.

300
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,039
But to locate
their main breeding ground,

301
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,559
we will need Madam Yulan
to lead the way.

302
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,519
Since she is heartless,

303
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,240
she cannot blame me for being ruthless.

304
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,000
Commandery Prince An,

305
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,660
I will cooperate with you

306
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:42,159
to lure her into the trap.

307
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,480
We usually stop here

308
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,720
and never go any farther up.

309
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,240
To think it was hidden so well.

310
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,840
We should be arriving soon.

311
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:53,759
Move.

312
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:11,120
She is gone.

313
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:11,840
Go.

314
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,720
Madam Yulan is truly unfathomable.

315
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,200
Among the grass and trees,

316
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,200
there is not
a single trace of footprints.

317
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,399
So this is actually her territory.

318
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,090
Is there something
unusual about this place?

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,990
It is said that deep
in these ravines and forests,

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,250
there is a mountain god temple.

321
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:38,310
The temple is said to suppress
nothing but evil spirits.

322
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,570
A mountain god and evil spirits?

323
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,679
Has anyone ever actually seen them?

324
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,360
No, not really.

325
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,840
If even we find it hard to get in,

326
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,799
common folk
would stand no chance at all.

327
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,039
But judging by what we see now,

328
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,759
it is likely
they were just playing tricks.

329
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,230
I will head back now
and bring Tietou and the others.

330
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,639
Wait.

331
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,500
The terrain here is complicated.

332
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,400
If they have occupied
this place for some time,

333
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:59,610
they must have prepared for it.

334
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Searching by force

335
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,440
would only alert them

336
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,519
and expose us first.

337
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,160
Then, let us look around some more.

338
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,180
Who knows,
there may be another entrance?

339
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,079
Who is it?

340
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:29,799
Madam.

341
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,359
He is back?

342
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,380
(Nanzhao)

343
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,060
(Jiaozhou)

344
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,160
Greetings, Second Prince.

345
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,759
Why did you leave
Jiaozhou without summons

346
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:24,799
and rush here in the dead of night?

347
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,780
Commandery Prince An
has grown suspicious of me

348
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,590
and tightened his watch
on the Prefect's Residence.

349
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,559
I dared not send word lightly

350
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,319
for fear of exposing myself.

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,920
So I took advantage of the moment
to return here while they were tied down

352
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,340
by Liu Shijiang's death.

353
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,359
Based on what I know of Xiao Jinyu,

354
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,920
at this very moment,

355
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:50,079
you have already become his guide.

356
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,990
You mean Commandery Prince An

357
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,039
deliberately lured me out of Jiaozhou,

358
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,390
forcing me to return to the camp?

359
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,839
That man is exceedingly meticulous.

360
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,799
He clearly suspected you,

361
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,920
yet you escaped unscathed.

362
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,480
Do you not see
that this was done on purpose?

363
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,319
He was using you to test the waters.

364
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,840
It's my fault for being impatient
and falling into his trap.

365
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,759
But on my way back,
I was extremely cautious throughout.

366
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,390
I should not have left any trail.

367
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,359
In the coming days,

368
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,759
I will also have the camp
heighten their vigilance.

369
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,990
Second Prince,
there is no need to worry.

370
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:28,359
No need to worry?

371
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,200
Xiao Jinyu is extremely
difficult to deal with.

372
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
Yet you handled it so deftly.

373
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,839
That is no small feat.

374
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,759
No wonder you have managed

375
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,599
this poison camp so well.

376
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,680
Far better than when I was here.

377
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,519
Everything I have done

378
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:00,000
has been to wait for your return.

379
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:03,880
When I first heard news of your death,

380
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:06,400
I thought...

381
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,920
Thankfully, Heaven watched over you.

382
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,980
The poison camp
has returned to its rightful master.

383
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,680
I will obey all orders.

384
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,359
So,

385
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,799
are we just going back like this?

386
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:09,400
Guo.

387
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,200
Guo.

388
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,039
Guo.

389
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,440
Ch...

390
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:18,039
Chief...

391
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:19,559
Help...

392
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,400
Guo.

393
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:22,880
Guo.

394
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,440
Guo.

395
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,440
That is more or less what happened.

396
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:32,960
According to Guo,

397
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,519
(Poison outpost at the mountain god temple)
the mountain god temple is higher up the slope,

398
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:38,599
(Detention camp)
while the detention camp is deep in the forest below.

399
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,559
Security is tight.

400
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,759
If we want to get everyone out,

401
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,319
a pincer attack is best.

402
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,960
How is Guo?

403
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,759
In Guo's abdomen,

404
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,279
there is a hard,

405
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,440
moving lump.

406
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,390
It should be the poisonous insect
they forced her to swallow.

407
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,079
Thankfully, it has not been long.

408
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,700
The poisonous insect is still stable.

409
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,690
There is still a way to save her.

410
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,039
If we had been any later,

411
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,160
she would have
ended up like Liu Shijiang.

412
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,799
Those animals.

413
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,720
They even preyed on a child like Guo.

414
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,680
By the way, I saw people from Nanzhao
transporting bodies earlier,

415
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,470
right near the mountain god temple.

416
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,319
Now that we think of it,

417
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,060
they must have been
Great Tang civilians poisoned by them.

418
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:24,920
Also,

419
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,160
Guo said she slipped out
from the back of the mountain,

420
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,279
along a rugged path
that was hard to find.

421
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,599
But she was too weak then

422
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,480
and frightened out of her wits,

423
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,799
so she could not
recall anything more specific.

424
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,400
We need to search again

425
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,119
and find that path.

426
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,880
The path...

427
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,000
I think I know where it is.

428
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,960
Years ago,
when Mount Zhenyuan Abode was attacked,

429
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,759
I led them into the mountains to hide.

430
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,880
There was a path, indeed.

431
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,000
It is hardly a path.

432
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,640
It is a narrow passage between rocks

433
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,190
that winds around into the deep forest.

434
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,680
That would be a good way

435
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,190
to catch them off guard
with a surprise attack.

436
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,230
But a major battle
could break out at any moment.

437
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,920
If we move troops rashly...

438
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,900
The troops cannot be moved.

439
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,390
I will take the people
from Mount Zhenyuan Abode first.

440
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,000
Wait.

441
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,390
Relying on Mount Zhenyuan Abode alone
is too dangerous.

442
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,400
I have an idea.

443
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:15,519
What idea?

444
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,279
When Nanzhao barged into Jiaozhou City,

445
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,440
they did so under Second Prince's banner.

446
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,680
Why not do the same

447
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,160
and raise a banner of our own?

448
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,200
An eye for an eye?

449
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,519
You are officials,
so your identities are inconvenient.

450
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,240
I am a wanderer of the martial world
and a Great Tang commoner.

451
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,039
I will go provoke them
and get trapped inside,

452
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,960
then you can rescue me.

453
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,520
Would that not be fair and proper?

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,599
Chief Luo, though you were born
and raised a Great Tang commoner,

455
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,279
you are still a martial world figure.

456
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,090
You have no official
household registration as proof.

457
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,839
On paper, you are not counted
as Great Tang.

458
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:50,359
If, afterward, someone pursues the matter,

459
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,039
it will be troublesome.

460
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,400
I will go.

461
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,480
You?

462
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,559
General Xiao has to command the troops,

463
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,920
and Commandery Prince An has to oversee
the whole situation.

464
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:01,790
As the Commandery Princess Consort An,
I am the most suitable reason

465
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,980
for you to deploy the troops.

466
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,390
I will bring men to protect you
and go with you.

467
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:07,260
This...

468
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,519
Then, Chief Luo, please

469
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,680
take your men and storm
the temple with Chu Chu first.

470
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,400
Do your best to delay them

471
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,640
and draw their attention.

472
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,799
Jinli, you find an opening and lead troops

473
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,630
to sneak in through the path
to raid the poison camp.

474
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,780
Once the poison camp is taken,

475
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,870
use the excuse that
the Commandery Princess Consort An was abducted

476
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,460
to storm the mountain god temple
and rescue the people.

477
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,160
Noted.

478
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,370
Then, I will go gather
the brothers at once.

479
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,900
We leave it to you, Chief Luo.

480
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,039
You can really hold

481
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,160
your liquor.

482
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,079
When it comes to deploying troops
and arranging formations,

483
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,799
am I not

484
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,640
far superior

485
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,119
to Xiao Jinli?

486
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:53,559
Xiao Jinli?

487
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,039
He is nothing but a brainless brute.

488
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,880
He would never dare face you head-on.

489
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,119
He only dares to use
underhanded tricks from behind.

490
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,240
As for learning and talent...

491
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,680
Forget learning and talent.

492
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,890
That sort of thing is useless.

493
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:15,900
In terms of strategy,

494
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,200
am I

495
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,160
roughly on par with

496
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,319
Xiao Jinyu?

497
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,960
It is not even a matter of being on par.

498
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,590
It would be more accurate to say

499
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,400
that Xiao Jinyu

500
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,799
completely fails in comparison to you.

501
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:37,839
Eldest Prince,

502
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,240
think about it.

503
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,720
Xiao Jinyu has what he has today

504
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,119
only because of his family background.

505
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,279
When he makes mistakes,

506
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,160
his subordinates are always the ones

507
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,799
to cover for him.

508
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,130
How could he compare to you?

509
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,599
You are a prince.

510
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,599
Everything you have achieved today

511
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,079
was earned through real blades and blood.

512
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
Well said.

513
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,039
Eldest Prince.

514
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,680
Then, I will take my leave.

515
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,480
You stay.

516
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,000
From now on, in my residence,

517
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:22,279
there is nothing
you are not allowed to hear.

518
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,400
Speak.

519
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,290
I was ordered
to keep watch on You Chen'an

520
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,430
and discovered that he went to

521
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,470
the mountain god temple at the border
between Nanzhao and Great Tang.

522
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,279
The mountain god temple?

523
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,480
Isn't that place
said to be haunted by evil spirits?

524
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,440
Could it be

525
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,599
that this is also
the work of that wretch?

526
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,319
That lowborn.

527
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,240
He must be up to no good.

528
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:50,839
I need to take a look.

529
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,170
Where is my blade?

530
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,160
Eldest Prince, please do not rush.

531
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,119
If this really
is that wretch stirring trouble,

532
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,759
I would say it is a great thing.

533
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,359
A great thing?

534
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,079
Think about it.

535
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,119
At a moment like this,

536
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,640
that lowborn

537
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,680
is stirring up trouble
so desperately. Why?

538
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:14,960
Isn't it all just
to go after Xiao Jinyu?

539
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:17,440
Neither of those two
is easy to deal with.

540
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,920
If they clash,

541
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,759
both sides will be badly hurt.

542
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:24,359
You can sit back and watch them fight.

543
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,519
When they are seriously weakened,

544
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,400
make a small move of your own.

545
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,039
Effortlessly,

546
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,960
you can take them all in one sweep.

547
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,960
What you say makes perfect sense.

548
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,460
Eldest Prince,
please think it over carefully.

549
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,279
So be it.

550
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:45,640
You

551
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,519
follow me well from now on.

552
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,759
Help me

553
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,079
devise plans and strategies.

554
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:54,960
I will ensure you wealth and honor.

555
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,079
Thank you, Eldest Prince.

556
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:04,960
Luo Yan.

557
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,039
Luo Yan.

558
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,160
Wait.

559
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,190
The poison camp is dangerous.

560
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,599
If you are here to stop me,

561
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,640
there is no need to speak.

562
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:17,480
Guo

563
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,920
is lying in that room right now.

564
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,599
I do not even dare look at her too long.

565
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,260
A poisonous insect in her body,

566
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,640
how painful must that be?

567
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,680
She is still just a child.

568
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,200
And in that poison camp,

569
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,039
there are so many others like Guo.

570
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,279
How could I possibly not go?

571
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:34,759
I understand.

572
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,599
I understand everything.

573
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,359
I mean,

574
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,160
the poison camp is dangerous.

575
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,310
You must keep a clear head at all times.

576
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,319
Believe me.

577
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,559
I will bring
every one of them out alive.

578
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,839
I know.

579
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,319
Do not worry.

580
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,319
I will listen to Chu Chu,

581
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,599
and I will not act on impulse.

582
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:26,759
Is there truly nothing
you want to say to me?

583
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:27,960
What?

584
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,680
I made this decision
without discussing it with you.

585
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:34,400
I know how dangerous this is.

586
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,839
You must be worried.

587
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,519
I am worried,

588
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,400
but my worry

589
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:42,759
does not matter.

590
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,720
Your Highness...

591
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:46,680
You have never said it aloud,

592
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,240
but I know.

593
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,900
The matter of You Chen'an

594
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,279
has been lodged
in your heart like a thorn,

595
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:53,880
has it not?

596
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,190
You have been thinking
the same all along, right?

597
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,119
Using human bodies
to raise poisonous insects,

598
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,799
such a cruel method

599
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,359
is exactly his style.

600
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,680
Moreover, after Liu Shijiang died,

601
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,640
Madam Yulan never left our sight.

602
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,720
She had no chance at all

603
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:14,700
to cross over
and release the poisonous insects.

604
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,279
The one who had the chance and the motive

605
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,640
to kill You Longsheng
and trap the troops left in Jiaozhou

606
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,559
could only be You Chen'an.

607
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,359
I want to capture him

608
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,920
not only to see
an evildoer brought to justice.

609
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,440
Neither is it

610
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,839
to stop Nanzhao
from plotting against the Great Tang.

611
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,839
I just want to stand before him

612
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,319
and defeat him myself.

613
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,400
I understand.

614
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,799
A thorn buried in the heart

615
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:49,279
must be pulled out by one's own hand.

616
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,519
So even though I am worried,

617
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,680
part of me hopes you will go.

618
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,599
Follow what your heart tells you.

619
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,759
Go without fear.

620
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,920
No matter where you go,

621
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,640
I will always find you.

622
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,640
Look here.

623
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:48,279
This patch of grass
is clearly much thinner.

624
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,240
It's likely to been trampled often.

625
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,319
Judging from the direction
where we found Guo,

626
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:53,759
the path lies to the south.

627
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,500
But the mountain terrain is treacherous.

628
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,440
Based on the lay of the land,

629
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,799
they should be hiding
in the sunken ravine to the north.

630
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,190
Otherwise, daily supplies
could not move in and out.

631
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,599
Let's move.

632
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,680
There truly
is a mountain god temple here.

633
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,079
The guard is this tight.

634
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,519
They must already know Guo has escaped.

635
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,559
Even if this place is as solid as iron,

636
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,780
we will smash our way through today.

637
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:28,359
Protect Chu Chu.

638
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,559
Move.

639
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,680
We met again so soon.

640
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:29,319
Commandery Princess Consort An
and I are truly fated.

641
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,480
At the Prefect's Residence,
I was merely the prefect's wife,

642
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,450
and there were many lapses in courtesy.

643
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,519
But here,

644
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,559
I am the one in charge.

645
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,599
I will certainly give
Your Highness a proper welcome.

646
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,640
Is this how you treat our guests?

647
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,930
Don't make yourselves
a laughingstock before her.

648
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,599
All of you, lower your blades.

649
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,400
You call yourself
the master of this place.

650
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,519
Then, where is the Second Prince?

651
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,079
It has been a long time.

652
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:00,160
Chu Chu.

653
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,440
Madam Yulan went to great lengths

654
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,239
to bring this place under perfect order.

655
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,970
Calling her the master
is hardly an exaggeration.

656
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,679
So, it really is you.

657
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,760
Your guess was right.

658
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,990
Though our time as mentor and student
in the Three Judicial Offices was brief,

659
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:22,920
it

660
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:25,119
still proves
we understood each other well.

661
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,679
I only regret that months ago,

662
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,719
I did not kill you myself,

663
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,180
you faithless villain who betrayed trust
and murdered a dear friend.

664
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,990
My brother treated you
as his own flesh and blood,

665
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
yet you killed him.

666
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,360
Chu Chu.

667
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,840
You have never used a blade

668
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,800
to cut open a living person, have you?

669
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,159
Your brother was
the one person in Great Tang,

670
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,760
no,

671
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,679
in this entire world,

672
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,719
whom I least wished to kill.

673
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,719
But I struggled so hard to come here.

674
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,559
I struggled so hard
to return to Nanzhao.

675
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,960
I struggled so hard to obtain
everything I have now.

676
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,719
He wanted to ruin it all.

677
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:24,119
How could I not kill him?

678
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,600
Why are you looking at me like that?

679
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:29,960
What did I do wrong?

680
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,750
You were the one who said
that no matter the circumstances,

681
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
one must live on and keep fighting.

682
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:36,960
Right?

683
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,599
I want to live.

684
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,480
I want to crawl out
of a pile of corpses.

685
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,540
I want every person
who humiliated me to be punished.

686
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,199
Is that wrong?

687
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,800
Is it wrong?

688
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,880
Do you still remember

689
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,719
these scars on my body?

690
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,100
That's right.

691
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:12,280
This is it.

692
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,800
You once suffered torture.

693
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,480
Why then inflict that same pain

694
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:27,519
upon so many innocent people?

695
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,400
Who are you calling innocent?

696
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,039
Who is innocent?

697
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,960
You treat human lives as worthless,

698
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,910
using living bodies
to raise poisonous insects.

699
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,280
Did you not do all this?

700
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,880
I did it.

701
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,039
I did all of it.

702
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,900
That is because their lives
no longer had meaning.

703
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,119
Before they died,
they handed their lives to me.

704
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,480
At least, they were put
to some final use.

705
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,559
Those poisons
that threw Chang'an into chaos

706
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,559
were also your doing?

707
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,440
What do you think?

708
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,199
Of course.

709
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,680
Though the credit was not mine alone.

710
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,039
If not for Madam Yulan

711
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,960
keeping this place in perfect order,

712
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,910
I would never have been able
to focus fully in Chang'an,

713
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,370
crossing paths
with Commandery Prince An.

714
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:19,960
By the way, Chu Chu,

715
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,960
you ought to thank this place.

716
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,239
Every single bone
in the anatomical charts

717
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,800
you treasure so dearly

718
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,039
was meticulously drawn only

719
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,880
after the people here

720
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,199
were vivisected alive, again and again.

721
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,119
You Chen'an, you are a madman.

722
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,199
I am a madman.

723
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,079
I was born lowly.

724
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,599
I was spat upon.

725
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,679
I was despised.

726
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:46,360
Whether I am mad or not,

727
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,320
who truly cares?

728
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,320
Madam Yulan,

729
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,920
as the wife of the Prefect of Jiaozhou,

730
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,360
why would you aid Nanzhao

731
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,519
in committing so many heinous acts?

732
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,320
Because

733
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:00,800
I am from Nanzhao.

734
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,840
Liu Shijiang was utterly bewitched by me.

735
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:06,519
To marry me openly and honorably,

736
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,440
he willingly

737
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,599
altered my Great Tang identity.

738
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,480
So, you stayed with him

739
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:13,400
purely for these schemes?

740
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,599
If men can feign affection

741
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:18,000
and marry noblewomen to rise in rank,

742
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,000
why should women not do the same?

743
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,079
Compared with securing influence
at the Nanzhao court

744
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,519
and earning the trust of His Majesty,

745
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,559
what does a mere marriage alliance

746
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,719
amount to?

747
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,840
Chief Luo, you would not understand this.

748
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,400
As for you,
Commandery Princess Consort An,

749
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,280
you must understand.

750
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,599
I do not.

751
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,840
What is it that Your Highness
does not understand?

752
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,159
I would be glad to explain.

753
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,239
I do not understand

754
00:38:43,639 --> 00:38:45,119
why you are being so patient,

755
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,239
taking the trouble
to explain everything,

756
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,880
step by step, to us.

757
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,559
I said it long ago.

758
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,400
Chu Chu is smart.

759
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,159
Not easy to deceive.

760
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,310
That is right,
Commandery Princess Consort An.

761
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,599
Your people will not make it here.

762
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,039
Our surprise force

763
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,000
