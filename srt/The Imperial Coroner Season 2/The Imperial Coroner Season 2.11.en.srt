00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,198
(Qinxiang's ordeal)

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,240
(left me both heartbroken and helpless.)

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,280
(The world isn't kind.)

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,760
(It's even harder for women.)

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,440
(I hope that one day)

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,920
(those who struggle to survive
like Qinxiang)

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,039
(will have more choices.)

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,519
(Instead of being coerced by others,)

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,800
(carried along by fate,)

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,479
(onto a road of no return.)

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,679
(At the same time,)

12
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,240
(rumors about me)

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,799
(spread through Chang'an.)

14
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,359
(I remain calm,)

15
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,799
(but fear His Highness' high position)

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,399
(may be implicated.)

(This story is entirely fictional.)

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,520
=Episode 11=

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,159
Be careful.

36
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm fine.

37
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,199
This way.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,639
Careful.

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright.

40
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,560
My...

41
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,319
My dear.

42
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,680
Chu Chu.

43
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,080
What are you doing here?

44
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,319
You seem to be in a good mood.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,919
I saw you,

46
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,120
of course I'm in a good...

47
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,599
Gently.

48
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:55,879
My dear.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
Easy.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,520
Doing good deeds?

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,719
Explain it properly.

52
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,400
What good deeds exactly?

53
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,759
I have a friend.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He's gravely ill and beyond cure.

55
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
I'm here seeking medicine.

56
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,120
You're blatantly lying.

57
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,840
How is there any physician here?

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,599
This illness

59
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,919
isn't an ordinary one.

60
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,759
It concerns women.

61
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,919
Only Hua Mei's good at this.

62
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,879
Hua Mei?

63
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
So,

64
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,599
you're saying...

65
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,199
Exactly.

66
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,599
What kind of friend is that?

67
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,759
Fearless when sinning.

68
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,039
Now you back down.

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,360
Everyone has their fate.

70
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,400
This is all I can do.

71
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,120
The rest is up to him.

72
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,960
No, what are you talking about?

73
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,560
Miss Hua Mei is a physician?

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,919
No.

75
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,560
It's that kind of matter.

76
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:49,719
But don't worry.

77
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
Once Hua Mei acts,

78
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,080
the illness is cured.

79
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:54,960
Madam.

80
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,639
You really know?

81
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,039
You're indeed clever.

82
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll go take a look first.

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,960
My dear.

84
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,159
What is Jing Yi talking about?

85
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,520
Years ago,

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,360
Miss Hua Mei caught syphilis infection.

87
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,319
You know about syphilis infection.

88
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,759
They're incurable.

89
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,319
Jing Yi and I sought many remedies.

90
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,800
Only to delay it
and ease her pain at first.

91
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,839
Somehow we used the right one,

92
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,000
and she recovered.

93
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,240
This happened?

94
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
I suspect Jing Yi's friend

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,639
learned something,

96
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,279
so he asked Jing Yi

97
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,240
to seek a remedy from Miss Hua Mei.

98
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
If Miss Hua Mei can cure it,

99
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,759
will Qinxiang have hope too?

100
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,120
Yes.

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,720
Forgive my bluntness.

102
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,079
You

103
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,240
shouldn't ask me

104
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,920
how men should act,

105
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,560
but should instead ask

106
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,639
Princess Consort.

107
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,800
You recognize me?

108
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:07,920
In Chang'an,

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,240
a man so highly valued
by Vice Minister Jing

110
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,199
and so devoted

111
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,160
could only be

112
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,600
Commandery Prince An.

113
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,079
I ask you

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,040
to speak plainly.

115
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,360
Just now,

116
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,079
I heard you

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,000
list all your own faults.

118
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,839
But in my opinion,

119
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,959
it's

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
deep love that breeds fear.

121
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,000
Yet what you sought

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,959
also seems to be a good husband.

123
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,920
But Her Highness is different.

124
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,519
Her Highness

125
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,240
is a tall tree grown in nature.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
Only heaven and earth let it thrive.

127
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,560
Your blaming yourself so harshly

128
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,759
will only make Her Highness

129
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,000
feel more uneasy.

130
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,759
Thank you, Miss Hua Mei.

131
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:54,920
Bad news!

132
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,120
Someone fell into the water.

133
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,759
What happened?

134
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,560
Qinxiang fell into the water.

135
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,920
What's going on outside?

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,160
Vice Minister Huang.

137
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,970
Commandery Prince An.

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,780
Vice Minister Jing.

139
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,560
I was patrolling here today

140
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:30,399
when I heard a loud splash.

141
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,380
Someone shouted
someone fell in the water.

142
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,200
I ordered men
to enter the water immediately,

143
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,120
but

144
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,319
it was too dark.

145
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,240
The fallen one didn't struggle either.

146
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,519
We searched for about a quarter hour.

147
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,170
By the time she was brought up,
she was dead.

148
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,519
She just drowned.

149
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,199
If it was drowning,

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,160
why did Miss Qinxiang not struggle

151
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,160
and sink straight down?

152
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,480
If one falls from a height,

153
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,639
the impact on the water
may knock them out.

154
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,160
She may have already fainted.

155
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,040
And Deputy Prefect Leng
took some time to bring her up.

156
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,500
She had already stopped breathing.

157
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:06,959
That isn't our fault.

158
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,680
It was pitch black on the water.

159
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,480
And where she fell was unclear.

160
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,360
We could only
enter the water in the dark.

161
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,360
Deputy Prefect Leng
still deserves credit.

162
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,000
Where exactly

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,260
did you retrieve Miss Qinxiang?

164
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,040
There.

165
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,360
I'll escort you all
out the side entrance.

166
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,920
This way, please.

167
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,199
Vice Minister Jing.

168
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,560
You're enjoying yourself.

169
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,439
Vice Minister Jing.

170
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,680
Please step aside to talk.

171
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,879
Here.

172
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,279
Why are you here?

173
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,839
You're the friend Jing Yi mentioned?

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,919
How did this happen?

175
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,639
Your Highness.

176
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,080
Did you contract syphilis?

177
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,200
What's that?

178
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,200
The foreign envoys heard

179
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,960
that the famous poems of Great Tang

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,919
all come from pleasure houses.

181
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
They longed for it

182
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,519
and insisted on coming to see.

183
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,279
I really had no choice.

184
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,039
If Commandery Prince An
hadn't offended them repeatedly,

185
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,919
I wouldn't be in such a tough spot.

186
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I understand.

187
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,360
I'll ask just one thing.

188
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,519
No.

189
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,440
There was nothing inappropriate.

190
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,960
We're just listening to music

191
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,639
and watching dances.

192
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,759
That doesn't matter.

193
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,279
Did you know
someone fell from above just now?

194
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,440
No.

195
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,600
I just heard Miss Feng say

196
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
people from Yamen came,

197
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,360
so I thought of quickly taking them away.

198
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,720
Who fell from the building?

199
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,039
Qinxiang.

200
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,480
Does that name ring a bell?

201
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,039
(Something's definitely wrong.)

202
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,200
(The time and place don't match.)

203
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,500
(Over Two Zhang.)

204
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,720
(This wasn't an accident.)

205
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
(She didn't slip.)

206
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,639
Make way.

207
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,159
Clear the way.

208
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,120
This is causing a huge stir.

209
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,159
The Music Office is full of gossip.

210
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,639
Who knows
what rumors will spread tomorrow.

211
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,559
Deputy Prefect Leng.

212
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,799
Quickly send these onlookers

213
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,000
away.

214
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:32,720
Alright.

215
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,039
Everyone, disperse.

216
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,000
Disperse.

217
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:36,840
Disperse.

218
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,320
Move along.

219
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,000
Go home.

220
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,960
Please go home.

221
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Go home.

222
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,840
Disperse.

223
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,759
Go.

224
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:44,919
Commandery Prince An.

225
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,120
You caused such a commotion

226
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,960
for a mere performer.

227
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,639
Hurry and clear the body,

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,520
so we don't embarrass ourselves
in front of the foreign envoys.

229
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,039
This is a human life,

230
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,360
yet you think it's shameful.

231
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,720
Ministry of Rites
must mind the whole city.

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm acting for the greater good.

233
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,960
When we meet her family,

234
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,519
give them more compensation.

235
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,759
Fine.

236
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
How much will you pay?

237
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,759
Ten taels.

238
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,480
A human life is worth

239
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,960
only ten taels to you?

240
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,600
20 taels then.

241
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:25,960
This...

242
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,480
Take these 20 taels.

243
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,679
Your life

244
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,240
is now mine.

245
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,840
What are you doing?

246
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,399
Xiao Jinyu.

247
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,159
You dare...

248
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,840
You dare kill a court official?

249
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,240
A court official's life

250
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,830
is a life spent pleading for the people.

251
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,780
You called her
a mere performer again and again.

252
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:46,639
How dare you

253
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:49,080
call yourself one?

254
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,639
Your Highness, calm down.

255
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,879
Vice Minister Huang means

256
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,320
that you giving him money
would be like looking down on him.

257
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,720
We serve in the same court.

258
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,200
Even if you don't give him money,

259
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,000
he will still cooperate wholeheartedly.

260
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,320
Right, Vice Minister Huang?

261
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,519
Yes.

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,080
Assisting in cases

263
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,519
is a matter of principle.

264
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,399
I'm not someone
who forgets morality for money.

265
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,399
Then we'll count on you.

266
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,360
The deceased had an illness.

267
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,480
The body cannot be handled freely.

268
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,330
Take her back
to the Three Judicial Offices.

269
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,639
Leave this to the Three Judicial Offices.

270
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,440
Please have Deputy Prefect Leng
write a petition.

271
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,950
Let me borrow some of your subordinates.

272
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:39,600
Alright.

273
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,290
Carry her back
to the Three Judicial Offices.

274
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,360
Go back with them first.

275
00:12:58,799 --> 00:12:59,519
Be careful.

276
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,559
Almost.

277
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,399
Leng Yue.

278
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,200
Qinxiang could almost

279
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,399
(Discern the Bigger Picture from Small Hints)
leave the Music Office

280
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,679
reunite with her son,

281
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,879
and live the life she wanted.

282
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:31,480
But now...

283
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,600
Let's go.

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,790
Perform an autopsy.

285
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,440
I want to check Qinxiang again

286
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,360
to see if there's any new clue.

287
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,279
With you here,

288
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,080
Qinxiang won't suffer injustice.

289
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,080
Let's go.

290
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,080
Let's go.

291
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,180
(Discern the Bigger Picture
from Small Hints)

292
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,559
The table and bed are a bit messy,

293
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,919
but no signs of a fight are visible.

294
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,799
Qinxiang

295
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,639
very likely

296
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,879
fell in the water by accident

297
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,260
while flirting with another guest.

298
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,000
The guest panicked

299
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,159
and turned off the lights to flee.

300
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,279
Commandery Prince An.

301
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
It's late now.

302
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,120
Envoys shouldn't stay here long.

303
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:36,000
Are you trying to minimize trouble?

304
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:37,679
No.

305
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:38,840
Investigate.

306
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,840
Investigate everything.

307
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,320
Everything in this room

308
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:44,879
can't be touched

309
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:45,759
without my order.

310
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,519
You...

311
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,799
Yes.

312
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:54,279
Let's go.

313
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:57,919
Well...

314
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,080
Miss Qinxiang, don't be afraid.

315
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,639
If you have grievances,

316
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,440
you can tell me.

317
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,360
Be careful.

318
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,500
(Marks from Choking)

319
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,180
(Neck Injury)

320
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,060
(Scratch Marks on Neck)

321
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
This is blood.

322
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,340
I had checked her injuries before
at the Three Judicial Offices.

323
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,759
I remember her old injuries.

324
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:40,919
But these neck scratches

325
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,679
and bruises on her limbs

326
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:43,600
are all new.

327
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,679
So

328
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,519
she was being choked

329
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,430
and scratched at the same time?

330
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,399
No.

331
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,240
Judging by the depth and direction,

332
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:55,279
the scratches were likely self-inflicted
while she struggled to resist.

333
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,919
But judging from the length,

334
00:15:58,879 --> 00:15:59,799
one scratch

335
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,519
landed on the hand that was choking her.

336
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,840
Just flirting with a guest

337
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,159
wouldn't cause such forceful resistance.

338
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,080
With her skills,

339
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,320
this level of struggle

340
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,440
means life or death.

341
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,480
Exactly.

342
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,480
But there's another issue.

343
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:22,320
What is it?

344
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:26,879
Her most obvious bruises

345
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,480
are on both knees,

346
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,440
her elbows,

347
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,399
and her neck.

348
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,679
The one who died at the Music Office

349
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,080
was

350
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,679
the performed connected
to Master Shenguan.

351
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes.

352
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:50,279
That Peacock

353
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,200
dares to do anything.

354
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,480
He didn't inform me at all.

355
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:56,520
After he was done,

356
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,159
I still had to clean up his mess.

357
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,960
Since His Majesty ordered him
to manage the capital spies,

358
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:04,400
he must trust him completely.

359
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,599
We can't fall out with him.

360
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Of course I know that.

361
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,440
But we are now in Great Tang,

362
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,160
watched daily like crows

363
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,839
by civil and military officials.

364
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,640
One slip, and we'll be destroyed.

365
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,500
By the way,

366
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,640
any news

367
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,559
from Eldest Prince?

368
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,039
His Majesty is cautious.

369
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,279
Eldest Prince revealed nothing.

370
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,920
He only told you to act as you see fit.

371
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,359
If convenient,

372
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,279
cause some trouble to You Chen'an.

373
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:40,200
I would rather

374
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,799
kill him and be done with it.

375
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,400
Eldest Prince would be pleased,

376
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,680
and His Majesty won't blame me
because of him.

377
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:46,920
Unfortunately,

378
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,720
he got into the Three Judicial Offices,

379
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,599
clinging to Commandery Prince An.

380
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,519
(Self-Cultivation to World Order)
Qinxiang did drown,

381
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,319
but she struggled

382
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,440
before her death.

383
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,759
There are

384
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:04,200
scratches on her hands

385
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,759
and strange bruises on her body.

386
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:09,519
She was likely murdered.

387
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,559
I want to dissect her.

388
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,920
No.

389
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,480
She has syphilis.

390
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
What if you get infected?

391
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:15,880
Syphilis

392
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,119
is transmitted through sexual contact.

393
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,279
Otherwise,

394
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,319
transmission is rare.

395
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,319
The way of yin and yang

396
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,880
is just daily affairs.

397
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,039
No cutting and no blood involved.

398
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,799
But you're a coroner.

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,359
You have to cut the body open

400
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,960
and examine it inside and out.

401
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,960
That's 100 times more dangerous.

402
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,559
Postmortems

403
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,160
are often far more dangerous than that.

404
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,480
Coroners have a full set
of protective measures.

405
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,519
You know that.

406
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,680
Your Highness.

407
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,559
I don't want to repeat

408
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,980
the mistakes with Master Shenguan.

409
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,119
Alright.

410
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,720
But you must be careful.

411
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,790
Those in official service

412
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,000
can't avoid their duties.

413
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,160
Some sacrifice is inevitable.

414
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,079
But

415
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,839
because of that,

416
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,440
never sacrifice what can be avoided.

417
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,480
I understand.

418
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,190
I'll work with other coroners

419
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,480
in the Three Judicial Offices
who handled syphilis cases,

420
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,440
and devise a safe method

421
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,559
first.

422
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,079
His Majesty
should reward you both a plaque.

423
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,039
Across the entire capital,

424
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,599
there's no second couple
as dutiful as you.

425
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,880
Alright.

426
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:23,680
Leng Yue.

427
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,119
You must trust me.

428
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,160
The small kitchen
just made mung bean soup.

429
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,279
Have a taste.

430
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:42,960
Here.

431
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,440
Thank you.

432
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:48,480
I went to the Music Office today
to see Miss Hua Mei

433
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,240
to ask her something.

434
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,279
Mm.

435
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,240
I did nothing improper
at the Music Office.

436
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,279
You never do anything improper anyway.

437
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,319
This has nothing to do
with where you are.

438
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,440
Thank you

439
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,119
for trusting me.

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,519
Just as you trust me.

441
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,359
Even though you worry,

442
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,640
you still supported
my autopsy of Qinxiang,

443
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,599
instead of using concern

444
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,960
as an excuse to keep me out

445
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
like last time.

446
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,279
So what did you find

447
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,319
at the scene?

448
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,960
The killer was experienced.

449
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,400
The scene was cleaned thoroughly.

450
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:32,519
Qinxiang had just told us

451
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,990
about the drug trade
at the Music Office,

452
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,720
and she suddenly died.

453
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,240
This also involves Nanzhao.

454
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,640
I'm afraid it won't be simple.

455
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,960
We must rely on you

456
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,480
to examine her body carefully.

457
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,559
Don't worry.

458
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
I won't fail my duty.

459
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,880
(Music Office)

460
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,559
Everyone, judge this for me.

461
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:57,359
Someone come here.

462
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,759
Will anyone judge this?

463
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,200
Come take a look.

464
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,920
Brothers, will anyone judge this?

465
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,200
Come judge this.

466
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,680
Come and see.

467
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,440
A living person is gone.

468
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,000
It was right here.

469
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:09,880
Right here.

470
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,880
They killed my sister.

471
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,680
Their place.

472
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,319
My sister.

473
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,480
- My sister died here for no reason.
- Murder.

474
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,160
My own sister.

475
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,079
My poor sister.

476
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,920
Is it proper to make a racket at dawn?

477
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:20,799
Make way.

478
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,119
How unlucky this early in the morning.

479
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,690
- Who are you people?
- Judge this for me.

480
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,740
What kind of place is this?

481
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:29,160
Who will judge this for me?

482
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,559
Who will judge this for us?

483
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,519
Miss.

484
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,820
They seem to be Qinxiang's
brother and sister-in-law.

485
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,839
They rushed over
after hearing what happened.

486
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,119
Qinxiang's family?

487
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,519
You must give me an explanation
for my sister's death.

488
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,839
She was taken away
by the Three Judicial Offices.

489
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,400
You want an explanation?

490
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,759
Go to the Three Judicial Offices.

491
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:50,440
Then

492
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,279
at least give us

493
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
her belongings,

494
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,359
so we have something to remember her by.

495
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,799
Your sister sold herself.

496
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,000
Even her body wasn't her own.

497
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,640
What belongings could she have?

498
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,800
If you don't leave,

499
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,119
I will have you all tied up and sent
to the Three Judicial Offices.

500
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,279
Will you leave?

501
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,079
Will you?

502
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,500
What are you looking at?

503
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,680
Disperse.

504
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,880
Get back to your business.

505
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,319
- They're beating people.
- We cannot live like this.

506
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,440
You trample on human lives.

507
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,240
No one cares about us.

508
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,079
I can't go on living.

509
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,319
Your Highness, what are you thinking?

510
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,440
That's syphilis.

511
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,079
How could you
let Chu Chu do the autopsy?

512
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
You're far too careless.

513
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,960
What if...

514
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:42,759
How careless.

515
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,880
Thank you for your concern.

516
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:46,799
Don't worry.

517
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,079
Chu Chu will work with other coroners

518
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,440
to devise the safest method together.

519
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,359
I knew I couldn't sway you.

520
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,119
But

521
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,640
why didn't you include me
in the discussion?

522
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:00,920
I'm also Chu Chu's apprentice.

523
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,599
And I know the one who did this

524
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,640
better than you.

525
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,720
What do you mean?

526
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,559
There are some things I can't say.

527
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,000
But if they find you
harbor other intentions,

528
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,480
they'll turn on you as well.

529
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:18,920
Don't worry.

530
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,440
I never do losing deals.

531
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:23,319
Whether I speak,

532
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:24,519
I'm still in danger.

533
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,640
Just like

534
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,640
if Nanzhao
truly goes to war with Great Tang,

535
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,100
no matter who wins or loses,

536
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,100
I will die all the same.

537
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,119
Besides,

538
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
my dear elder brother

539
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,119
won't spare me.

540
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,640
Instead of that,

541
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:40,100
I might as well help you.

542
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,519
I can't let
the people protecting me fail.

543
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,160
Your Highness.

544
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Have you ever considered

545
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,240
that Qinxiang
might not be their real target?

546
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,359
Go on.

547
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,279
Qinxiang was infected with syphilis

548
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,119
and died right in front of you.

549
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,480
At a moment like this,

550
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,039
even street peddlers know

551
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,190
The Three Judicial Offices
will examine the body thoroughly,

552
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,160
especially Chu Chu.

553
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,920
If Chu Chu is infected

554
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,920
during the examination,

555
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,440
and you're with her day and night,

556
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,359
even you won't escape it.

557
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,039
Thank you for thinking this through.

558
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,680
But Chu Chu is the chief coroner
of the Three Judicial Offices.

559
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,799
Whether to examine

560
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,720
and how to examine

561
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,039
is her decision alone.

562
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,119
Your Highness, please reconsider.

563
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,400
Syphilis is highly contagious.

564
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Even physical contact

565
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,640
carries a risk of infection.

566
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,920
Let alone an autopsy.

567
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,200
Even with full precautions,

568
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,119
the risk is still too great.

569
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,390
- Let us do it instead.
- Let us do it instead.

570
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,480
Listen to me.

571
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
I examined
Miss Qinxiang's injuries before.

572
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,640
I know her physical condition best.

573
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,480
That makes it easier to spot clues.

574
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,039
We are all coroners here.

575
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,279
I have no reason to step aside.

576
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,319
Chu Chu.

577
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:53,400
Are you here to stop me too?

578
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,680
I'm here to assist you

579
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,960
and learn while I'm at it.

580
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,880
You're surprisingly calm.

581
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,200
I heard Chu Chu is performing
an autopsy on Qinxiang.

582
00:25:16,759 --> 00:25:17,640
Aren't you worried?

583
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,440
You're holding the book upside down.

584
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,119
How did the investigation go?

585
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:31,640
One piece of good news,

586
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,839
and one even better.

587
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,890
Which do you want first?

588
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,240
Your salary this month and next month...

589
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,480
I worried the girls might hold back,

590
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,119
so

591
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,640
I questioned every guard,
doorman, and maid

592
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:43,920
at the Music Office.

593
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,680
From their statements, I pieced together

594
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
the patrons
who were closest to Qinxiang.

595
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,820
After investigation,

596
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,519
only one person seems most suspicious.

597
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,319
Is this good news?

598
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,359
Who?

599
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,119
Still unclear.

600
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,000
They can't remember his face well,

601
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:01,119
but they all know
he has a small mustache

602
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,079
with a mole by the left cheekbone

603
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,319
and a large birthmark
on his right cheek.

604
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,519
With such distinct facial features,

605
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,200
he should be easy to find.

606
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,319
That's why I said

607
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,000
this is even better news.

608
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,480
Next, draft the arrest warrant.

609
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,279
Someone so obvious

610
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,000
will probably be found by tonight.

611
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,759
No rush.

612
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:20,240
Why?

613
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,240
You Chen'an warned me earlier

614
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,160
that this might be
related to Gao Luoqian.

615
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,759
Gao Luoqian?

616
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:29,500
Your Highness.

617
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,079
Vice Minister.

618
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,559
News came from the Music Office.

619
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,880
Qinxiang's brother and sister-in-law
were making a scene at their entrance.

620
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,800
They want to take back
Qinxiang's belongings.

621
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,599
Belongings?

622
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,359
Yes.

623
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,670
Did the Music Office give them?

624
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,200
No.

625
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,359
Go to the Music Office again.

626
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:44,100
Make sure to bring back all of Qinxiang's
belongings for inspection.

627
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,940
(Body Preparation Room)

628
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,359
Stop working for now.

629
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:03,480
What time is it?

630
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,480
Eat first.

631
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,480
He.

632
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,440
Why are you here?

633
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,920
You came, He.

634
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
I made you some pancakes

635
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:12,000
and brought two dishes from Deshun House

636
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,359
to improve your meals.

637
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,079
Smells so good.

638
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,119
You eat first.

639
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,480
I need to see His Highness.

640
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:19,960
Chu.

641
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:20,890
Don't wait for me.

642
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,119
What did you bring to eat, He?

643
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,440
Sliced fish.

644
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,519
Celery in vinegar.

645
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,480
Braised pork.

646
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:30,519
All Chu Chu's favorites.

647
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:31,960
Lucky you.

648
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,319
Your Highness.

649
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,920
Why did it take so long?

650
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,880
Did it go well?

651
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:48,480
I had to clean the tools

652
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,480
and get changed before seeing you,

653
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,440
so it took some time.

654
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,330
Glad to hear that it went well.

655
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,200
Any findings?

656
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,079
I did find something odd on Qinxiang,

657
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,880
but I'm not sure what it is.

658
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,880
I want to visit the Music Office again.

659
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,920
Fine.

660
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,000
Qinxiang's brother and sister-in-law
came by?

661
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:32,440
They looked like ordinary farmers.

662
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,759
Seeking nothing else

663
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,559
but to take back
Qinxiang's remains and belongings.

664
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,519
Had they been in touch before?

665
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,640
They had Qinxiang's things

666
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,599
and knew she was ill.

667
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,119
They don't seem to be lying.

668
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,680
But

669
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,000
with your orders

670
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
and Miss Feng's temperament,

671
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:52,119
they weren't allowed in

672
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,799
nor given anything.

673
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:56,720
Among Qinxiang's regulars

674
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,839
was a man with a birthmark

675
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,440
a mole,

676
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,720
and a mustache on his face.

677
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:02,000
Have you seen him?

678
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,920
I did see such a man,

679
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,480
but never dealt with him.

680
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,440
He did look for Qinxiang.

681
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,920
When did you first see him?

682
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,559
About half a year ago.

683
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:14,680
Your Highness.

684
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,319
I won't bother you two anymore.

685
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,759
Any findings?

686
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,559
I also found during the autopsy

687
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,759
marks on Qinxiang's
elbows, knees, and neck

688
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:28,960
all show signs of bruises.

689
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:33,839
You mean she struggled violently

690
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,599
before she died?

691
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,640
She has many injuries
from desperate struggling.

692
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,200
Likely all shortly before death.

693
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,079
The attacker was probably a man

694
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:44,279
with small hands.

695
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,559
During the fight,

696
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,599
Qinxiang was exhausted,

697
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,119
even fainted.

698
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,960
She was then thrown from here.

699
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,440
No.

700
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:00,640
What's wrong?

701
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,880
Look.

702
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:03,640
It's summer now.

703
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,039
The lake is full of algae and worms.

704
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,799
If the victim was alive before drowning,

705
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,759
the water in her stomach

706
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:12,920
should have a lot of algae and worms.

707
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:13,960
But

708
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,799
Qinxiang's mouth, nose, and stomach

709
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,039
show no trace of them.

710
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:18,920
Yes.

711
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,200
Indeed.

712
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,000
So it means

713
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,640
she was already drowned

714
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,160
before she drowned in here.

715
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,440
Drowned

716
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,799
but not by river water.

717
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
It means the killer planned

718
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,680
to push her down indoors.

719
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,799
But where did he

720
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,359
drown Qinxiang?

721
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:06,640
What was the wound on her neck

722
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,440
like?

723
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,839
That one was the strangest.

724
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,559
A bruise from hitting a hard object.

725
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,720
Long and narrow.

726
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:14,359
Right across the upper neck.

727
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,160
Like this?

728
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,780
(Bruise on the Knees)

729
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,340
(Impact Injury on the Elbows)

730
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,340
(Basin Rim Causing Neck Injury)

731
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,680
Yes, right here.

732
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,079
If someone pressed Qinxiang into a basin,

733
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,759
forcing her to kneel and struggle.

734
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
That explains her neck injury.

735
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,759
Using one drowning

736
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,880
to cover up another drowning.

737
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,680
Staging it as an accidental fall.

738
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:49,680
Then creating chaos

739
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,680
and slipping away.

740
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,920
Such meticulous planning

741
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,119
wasn't a spur-of-the-moment act.

742
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,240
This was a premeditated murder.

743
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:11,140
(Sixiang Chamber)

744
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,599
Deputy Prefect Leng.

745
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:19,680
You've been patrolling lately.

746
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,359
You've worked hard.

747
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
It's my duty.

748
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:23,960
You're too kind.

749
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:25,720
I heard just now

750
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,079
that there's people with syphilis
in Chang'an.

751
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,400
Is it true?

752
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,160
Would it be

753
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,400
convenient to share?

754
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,160
All who enter the guesthouse are checked

755
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:39,400
to ensure cleanliness and safety.

756
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,960
Please rest assured.

757
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,440
Thank you, Deputy Prefect Leng.

758
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:43,759
By the way,

759
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,200
I made this incense

760
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,440
with Nanzhao's formula.

761
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,240
It's best
for repelling insects in this season.

762
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,359
Deputy Prefect Leng.

763
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:52,880
Take some back to try.

764
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,359
Then...

765
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,839
Thank you, Vice Envoy Gao.

766
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,960
I have official duties.

767
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,039
I'll take my leave first.

768
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,190
Alright, I won't detain you.

769
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,799
That's right.

770
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,480
They looked exactly like this.

771
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,000
They claimed to be Qinxiang's family?

772
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,960
Not only that,

773
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,640
they also brought proof.

774
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,599
Even Miss Feng confirmed it.

775
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,960
They weren't blood relatives.

776
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,799
Judging by facial features,

777
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,680
Qinxiang had high brows and deep eyes.

778
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,759
One of her parents or grandparents

779
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,279
must have Hu people blood.

780
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:42,880
But these two

781
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,720
clearly look like locals.

782
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:47,839
It's confirmed.

783
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,590
Do you remember when Qinxiang
talked about her background?

784
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,480
Yes.

785
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,000
She said she was a performer
working for a wealthy family.

786
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,410
She accidentally got pregnant.

787
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,840
To spare the child from slave status,

788
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,400
she ran away in secret.

789
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,199
Partly true

790
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,239
and partly concealed.

791
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,750
Qinxiang was
from Ting Prefecture in Longyou.

792
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,480
Her child Jing Yuan's biological father

793
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,760
is the current Cavalry General,

794
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,039
Xie Huaiding.

795
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,960
Xie Huaiding?

796
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,480
He's upright by nature

797
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,880
and close with his wife.

798
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,079
He has no rumors of keeping performers.

799
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,500
Qinxiang's original name was Lv Ying.

800
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,159
When he met Qinxiang,

801
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,000
he was young and reckless.

802
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,400
Xie Huaiding came from a noble family.

803
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,480
His family
already arranged his enlistment

804
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,400
to earn merit and rank.

805
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,360
Before he enlisted,

806
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,280
he fell for the performer Lv Ying

807
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,480
in secret

808
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:53,920
and got her pregnant.

809
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,280
Xie Huaiding was deeply devoted,

810
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,199
wanting to elope with Lv Ying.

811
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,880
But his father found out

812
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,679
and planned to secretly execute Lv Ying.

813
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,599
You ruined the Xie family's honor.

814
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,199
Take him away.

815
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:06,639
Father.

816
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,480
Father.

817
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,480
No.

818
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,679
Father.

819
00:35:10,199 --> 00:35:12,320
His father ordered a cenotaph,

820
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,559
telling Xie Huaiding

821
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,840
Lv Ying was executed

822
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,000
to end his hopes.

823
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Lv Ying.

824
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,719
Xie Huaiding was heartbroken,

825
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,199
- got enlisted,
- Lv Ying.

826
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,880
and became today's Cavalry General.

827
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,719
Should we tell General now?

828
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,280
He has a beloved wife now.

829
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,079
Qinxiang refused to say his name
even when she's dying.

830
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,239
Whether to protect him

831
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,760
or to keep some dignity for herself,

832
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,119
we should respect her wishes.

833
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,159
But General...

834
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,039
Chu Chu is right.

835
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,239
Since Qinxiang and Jing Yuan
made their decision,

836
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,320
let this matter rest.

837
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,519
Our priority now

838
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,559
is to find Qinxiang's killer

839
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,719
and give her tragic life

840
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,079
a little justice.

841
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,159
As for the brother and sister-in-law
who appeared out of nowhere,

842
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,039
what do you think?

843
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:06,440
If they were real siblings,

844
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,320
even if they wanted to profit

845
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,599
from their sister's death,

846
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,980
they should go to the authorities
to confirm the body first

847
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:15,480
and find out what happened

848
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,119
and who was involved

849
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:19,639
before thinking of
who to ask for compensation

850
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,960
and how much they should ask.

851
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,320
Instead, these two

852
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,360
went straight to the Music Office

853
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,760
as if they knew

854
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,239
the deceased had no kin.

855
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,400
They tried to pose as family

856
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,679
to claim her belongings.

857
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,039
Qinxiang's belongings are here.

858
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:34,840
I've seen them.

859
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,760
Nothing special.

860
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,599
Just some female accessories.

861
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,350
The Music Office
didn't want to return them

862
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,480
to her family.

863
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,559
Then we'll return them ourselves.

864
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,239
Afraid of retribution?

865
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:53,360
I...

866
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,199
Give me the gold bracelet.

867
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:55,880
I...

868
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,100
The money's mine after selling them.

869
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:58,480
Retribution will be mine.

870
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,119
I was just saying.

871
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,559
Eat.

872
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,599
Hurry up and eat.

873
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,320
You can keep crying later.

874
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,900
(Three Judicial Offices)

875
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,960
Has Qinxiang's body moved here?

876
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,239
It's this one.

877
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,960
Qinxiang.

878
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:47,800
Qinxiang.

879
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,519
- My poor sister.
- Qinxiang.

880
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,880
This is my sister.

881
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,559
My poor sister Qinxiang.

882
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:54,480
Yes.

883
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,039
Qinxiang.

884
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,239
Look carefully.

885
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,559
Is this your sister,

886
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,440
Qinxiang?

887
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:02,280
What?

888
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,679
I'm her brother.

889
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,800
How could I mistake my sister?

890
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:06,679
Exactly.

891
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,599
Even in ashes, we'd recognize her.

892
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,320
My poor Qinxiang.

893
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:13,440
You left so heartlessly,

894
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,840
leaving just memories for us.

895
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,800
How are we to live now?

896
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,719
Wait.

897
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:22,000
I was wrong.

898
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,159
This isn't Qinxiang.

899
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,079
Qinxiang

900
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:27,280
is right here.

901
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,039
No worries.

902
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,760
After death, faces change slightly,

903
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,160
compared to when they were alive.

904
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,840
Especially for drowning victims.

905
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:39,440
Mistakes are understandable
under such circumstances.

906
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,280
No hurry.

907
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,599
Look carefully again.

908
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,079
Yes.

909
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:49,840
You...

910
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,920
You're right.

911
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
It doesn't quite match.

912
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,079
Yes.

913
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:54,159
I'll check that one.

914
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,719
Check if it is.

915
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,719
Qinxiang.

916
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,559
Qinxiang.

917
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,599
This is my sister, Qinxiang.

918
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,920
This is my sister.

919
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,719
Qinxiang.

920
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,519
What a pity.

921
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,199
I wasn't wrong earlier.

922
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,239
This is Qinxiang.

923
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,440
Are you done? Are you sure?

924
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,760
