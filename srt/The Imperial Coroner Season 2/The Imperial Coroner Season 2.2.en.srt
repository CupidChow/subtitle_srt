1
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:13,679
(Emperor's birthday.)

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,320
(This was my first time,
as the Commandery Princess Consort An)

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,490
(attending a palace banquet.)

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,559
(I was somewhat nervous.)

5
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:21,790
(Fortunately, everything went smoothly.)

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,920
(But I never expected)

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,380
(that a jumping human skull
would appear during the banquet.)

8
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,719
(Such a bizarre case occurred.)

9
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,079
(The deceased must be given justice.)

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,700
(Chu Chu did everything she could
to protect the skull)

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:35,870
(and preserve the evidence.)

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,799
(I also argued firmly on behalf
of the Three Judicial Offices,)

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,520
(and ultimately obtained
the authority to investigate the case.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

30
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,700
(This story is entirely fictional.)

31
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,340
=The Imperial Coroner S2=
=Episode 2=

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,199
This spot looks like
it's been rubbed by something.

33
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,280
Jinli.

34
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,199
Here.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,280
There was a fight here.

36
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:38,800
Judging by the build,

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,599
it should have been a man.

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,039
Look.

39
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,319
This bead

40
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
was very likely shaken loose
during the struggle

41
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,240
from clothing or an ornament,

42
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,520
and then pressed into the mud.

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,439
I have seen beads like this before.

44
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,599
They are not valuable,

45
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:01,520
but they look
especially nice in sunlight.

46
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,360
That is why many palace maids

47
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,639
sew them onto their clothes

48
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,599
or their shoes.

49
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,000
So among the two who fought,

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,039
one was a palace maid.

51
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,080
It's really stuck.

52
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:15,879
Your Highness.

53
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,759
Your Highness.

54
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,680
Many of the bones scattered around.

55
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:22,960
Quick.

56
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:23,680
Come help.

57
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,639
Over there.

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,319
Come here.

59
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,930
Impressive, Chu Chu. You can still piece
the shattered bones back together.

60
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,400
For Chu Chu, restoring skeletal remains
is nothing difficult.

61
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,159
Our guess yesterday was correct.

62
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,919
He did not fall into
the water by accident.

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,180
How can you tell?

64
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:56,400
If we follow this parietal bone
and look at it against the light, here.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
There is a reddish blood halo
at the center of the fontanelle.

66
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,919
And here as well.

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,599
Faint traces of blood can also
be seen near the tooth roots.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Blood marks on the fontanelle?

69
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,759
Does not the human head
already contain blood?

70
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,719
Blood is found in the flesh
or within the marrow,

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,060
but never on the surface of bone.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,240
You mean someone struck his head?

73
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:17,720
Not the head.

74
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,439
Someone struck his lower body.

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,439
The lower body?

76
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,800
(A severe blow to the lower body)
When a man's lower body is struck with great force,

77
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,759
(Sharp breath held in)
the intense pain causes him to gasp and hold his breath.

78
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,560
(Surge of blood and qi)
At that moment, blood and qi rush upward,

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,519
(Fontanelle)
reaching the fontanelle.

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,060
Injuries are therefore often found
near the tooth roots as well.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,199
And look here.

82
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,319
The deceased's pubic arch is fractured.

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,350
This could only have been caused
by an extremely strong impact.

84
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,600
The person who fought with him

85
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,879
was able to strike his lower body
when he was off guard.

86
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,720
Judging by the force alone,

87
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:45,759
this person

88
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,000
must have had some martial training.

89
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,920
Striking the lower body like this
is a particularly vicious method.

90
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,200
Whether it was vicious or not aside,

91
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,519
this deceased man

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,040
is indeed rather unsettling.

93
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,040
We have found something.

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,600
There truly is a man in the palace

95
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,150
who has been missing
for about half a year.

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,820
He was a guard, around 30 years old,
who often suffered from toothaches.

97
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:07,160
It was said he resigned
due to illness and returned home.

98
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,560
His name was Wu Liang.

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,519
Then the one in this pond...

100
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,040
General.

101
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:14,399
General.

102
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,639
A blade was dug out of the mud.

103
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,759
The number on the saber
is Bing Twenty-Three.

104
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,079
It belongs to Wu Liang.

105
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:19,740
(Bing Twenty-Three)

106
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,920
Were you close to him?

107
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,839
Everyone

108
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,720
knew him.

109
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,600
Over the past year,
no one knew where he got the money,

110
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,470
but he suddenly
became generous with spending.

111
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,279
He often said that once he made it big,
he would quit.

112
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,279
Later, he really did resign and leave.

113
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,230
Who would have thought
that he would end up here?

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,360
Did he have any enemies
or close relations?

115
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,360
He liked lively company.

116
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,879
With the others,
he generally got along well.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,660
But he was not especially
close to anyone.

118
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,079
As for enemies?

119
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,560
None that we know of.

120
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,360
Do you know

121
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:49,319
when he was on duty for the last time?

122
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,680
It was November fifteenth of last year.

123
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,079
I remember it very clearly.

124
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,759
It was his final day on duty
before stepping down.

125
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,399
And he even arrived late.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,199
I thought he was about to leave anyway,

127
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
so I did not say much.

128
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,590
I simply assigned him

129
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,519
to stand guard
by this inconspicuous rockery.

130
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,000
Do you remember what I said last night
about Consort Hui,

131
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,759
the palace official,
and those palace maids?

132
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,230
Their reactions were all rather strange.

133
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,360
Could it be that they already knew
about Wu Liang falling into the water?

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,680
Judging from their reactions,

135
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,879
they most likely did.

136
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,800
Anyone qualified to be a guard
must be highly skilled.

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
So who could have struck him

138
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,990
without making a sound
and dealt a fatal blow?

139
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,079
This carved mark

140
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
matches perfectly with the wear

141
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,590
on the metal ornament of the deceased's
belt recovered from the pond.

142
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,680
But judging from the depth
and direction of the marks on the ground

143
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,200
as well as the bead that was dropped,

144
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,600
the deceased must have fought back.

145
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:01,759
The killer had some martial skill

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,279
and quick reflexes.

147
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,790
Although they were briefly
overpowered by the deceased,

148
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,920
in the end they managed
to catch him off guard

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,680
and strike his lower body
with full force.

150
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,240
Based on the width of the footprints
left on the stone,

151
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,170
the killer's stature was far smaller than
that of the deceased.

152
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,800
And the decisive blow
to the deceased's lower body

153
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,300
is precisely the kind of strike

154
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,390
a woman is most likely to succeed
with against a man.

155
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,759
If the killer was a woman,

156
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,120
then based on our earlier deduction,

157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,620
- the garden night on November fifteenth.
- The garden night on November fifteenth.

158
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,480
All the palace maids present that night
include the killer among them.

159
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,240
Rest assured.

160
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,120
With me here,

161
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,800
as long as we narrow the scope,
we will find her.

162
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,160
Then I'll go with Leng Yue
to see the palace official.

163
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,240
All the records are here.

164
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,160
Commandery Princess Consort An.
Lady Jing. Please.

165
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,560
Chu Chu.

166
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,959
Honestly, given
His Highness's reputation as it stands,

167
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
a little extra swagger
doesn't really matter.

168
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,319
Why not let the palace official
handle this directly?

169
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,079
What are you looking at?

170
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,319
Look.

171
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,279
The older volumes here are all
from about a year ago.

172
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,959
The newer ones
are all from recent months.

173
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,559
If we sort them roughly

174
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
by how old they look,

175
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,950
we should quickly find the records
from half a year ago.

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,240
Not bad, Chu Chu.

177
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,390
As long as it does not breathe,
you can figure it out.

178
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:49,200
Your Majesty.

179
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,279
Commandery Princess Consort An
has been stirring things up

180
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:00,080
in the palace all day, digging up bodies
and questioning people.

181
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,759
The inner palace
has always been orderly and calm.

182
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,200
Now it has become a complete uproar.

183
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,580
Has it still not been resolved?

184
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,799
Your Majesty.

185
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,600
Your Highness.

186
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,620
Commandery Princess Consort An
requests an audience.

187
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,559
Let her in.

188
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:16,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

189
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,639
Greetings, Your Highness.

190
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,320
Chu Chu.

191
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,720
I hear you have caused
quite a commotion.

192
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,240
This is the imperial palace,

193
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
not a marketplace.

194
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,159
When will you allow me some peace?

195
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,120
Your Majesty,

196
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,200
I have a way to find the culprit.

197
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,000
However, I will still need
Your Highness's assistance.

198
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,039
What help do you need?

199
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,960
I wish to borrow
a few people from Your Highness.

200
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,600
Everyone, please step forward.

201
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,440
This Chu Chu

202
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,840
really does look the part.

203
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,320
Is Jing Yi trying out
some new method of solving cases again?

204
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,590
His Majesty and Consort Hui
are both watching.

205
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,200
He had better not make a mistake.

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Just set your mind at ease.

207
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,390
Jing Yi knows what he is doing.

208
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,440
Are you all right?

209
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:24,879
I am fine, my dear.

210
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,240
I was prepared.

211
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,240
Look.

212
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,759
Enough.

213
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:36,679
Your Majesty,

214
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,159
I have determined the truth.

215
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,440
Shi Qing. Will you still
refuse to confess?

216
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,919
Vice Minister Jing
struck first without cause.

217
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,310
I merely acted in self-defense.

218
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,440
What crime have I committed?

219
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:49,919
The crime of killing Wu Liang.

220
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,480
Your Majesty.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,480
On November fifteenth of last year,

222
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:57,039
(Wu Liang, a soldier of the Shence Army)
it was the garden night of Your Majesty and Consort Hui.

223
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,399
It was also Wu Liang's
final day on duty.

224
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,639
Because Wu Liang arrived late,

225
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:01,360
he was assigned

226
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,660
to stand guard near the rockery
where few people passed.

227
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,039
Wu Liang and Shi Qing
encountered each other here.

228
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,759
For reasons unknown,

229
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,919
a dispute arose between them.

230
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,390
It quickly escalated into a fight.

231
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,759
Although Shi Qing had some skill,

232
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:15,080
Wu Liang was, after all,
a Shence Army soldier.

233
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,660
Shi Qing soon fell at a disadvantage
and could only struggle to hold on.

234
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,840
The two exchanged blows back and forth
inside the rockery cave,

235
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,790
leaving behind extensive
traces of their fight.

236
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,759
However, both of them overlooked
a far more crucial fact.

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,679
Within the imperial palace,
no matter how secluded a corner may be,

238
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,320
patrol guards pass
through every half an hour.

239
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,070
The two acted
with remarkable coordination,

240
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,399
not making a single sound

241
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,039
and thus avoided the patrol guards.

242
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,559
After the guards had passed,

243
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,660
Shi Qing seized the moment

244
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,430
and launched
a surprise attack on Wu Liang,

245
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,639
delivering the fatal blow.

246
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:03,519
Consort Hui.

247
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,399
On the garden night
of November fifteenth last year,

248
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,759
Do you know

249
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,919
Shi Qing's whereabouts?

250
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:11,679
Your Majesty,

251
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,159
I killed him.

252
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,720
That day, Wu Liang spoke offensively
and humiliated me.

253
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,250
I acted on impulse and struck him,
causing his death by mistake.

254
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,159
Overcome with fear,
I dared not report it.

255
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,590
That is why I concealed it until now.

256
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,950
Her Highness knew nothing of this.

257
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
I confess my guilt.

258
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,080
I await Your Majesty's judgment.

259
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,919
Your Majesty.

260
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,000
Your Highness.

261
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,279
I have failed Your Highness's
years of guidance.

262
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,690
I only beg that Your Highness

263
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,890
for the sake of my many years
of service by your side,

264
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,799
show mercy to my family
outside the palace.

265
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,159
I would gladly serve Your Highness

266
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,300
with absolute loyalty,
even in another life.

267
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,879
Since you are willing to confess...

268
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,720
Your Majesty.

269
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,440
I have something to say.

270
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:52,240
Speak.

271
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,039
Even for an ordinary constable,

272
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
killing a person is no small matter.

273
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,159
The fear lingers in the heart for years.

274
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
Let alone a woman of the inner palace.

275
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,600
If Shi Qing were truly the culprit,

276
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,690
she attended Consort Hui
at close quarters every day.

277
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,799
Could Consort Hui
and the palace maids around her

278
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,600
really have noticed nothing amiss?

279
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,279
Shi Qing's confession

280
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,279
is vague and incomplete.

281
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,639
It does not withstand scrutiny.

282
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,320
There must be more to this.

283
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,440
Your Majesty,

284
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:15,840
do you still remember

285
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,679
Shi Qing shouting "insolence"

286
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,000
by the lotus pool?

287
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,279
We heard it clearly even from far away.

288
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,159
If, as Shi Qing claims,

289
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,519
she acted only
because Wu Liang harassed her,

290
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,919
she would surely
have scolded him loudly first.

291
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,120
Why did no one hear anything that day?

292
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,600
By your reasoning,

293
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,960
there is indeed
more hidden in this case.

294
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,559
If I am to render a judgment,

295
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,720
Chu Chu must examine one more person.

296
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,919
Examine whom?

297
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,440
This happened half a year ago.

298
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,519
Even if the suspect had been injured,
the wounds would long have healed.

299
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,840
At this point, would an examination
still be useful?

300
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:47,840
Your Majesty.

301
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,240
Wounds may heal,

302
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,000
but traces of healing always remain.

303
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,399
I am willing to examine.

304
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,960
Your Majesty.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,470
It would be better to let Chu Chu
conduct another examination.

306
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,080
This matter involves someone
close to Your Majesty.

307
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,990
Only by verifying it thoroughly
can one be at ease.

308
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,000
Very well.

309
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,360
Chu Chu.

310
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,399
Go and examine her.

311
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,120
Yes.

312
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,840
No matter how much you investigate

313
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,480
or how you examine me, to me,

314
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,080
it only ends in death.

315
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,600
How you deal with me is
for palace law to decide.

316
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,600
I am merely a coroner.

317
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:39,879
My duty is to verify the truth.

318
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,080
So that palace law
has a proper basis for judgment.

319
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,320
Therefore,

320
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,879
I will not wrong an innocent person,

321
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,399
nor will I let a guilty one go.

322
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,990
Commandery Princess Consort An.

323
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,519
So you truly come from humble origins.

324
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,840
Whether one comes from humble roots
or from a prominent household,

325
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,480
the standards for examining injuries
and deaths are the same.

326
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,480
Rest assured.

327
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,799
I am not familiar with palace affairs,

328
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,919
but whatever you have endured

329
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,960
I will determine with certainty.

330
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,000
Chu Chu.

331
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,480
Have you found anything?

332
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,639
Your Majesty,

333
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,639
there was more than
one culprit in this case.

334
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,559
What?

335
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,480
Was Shi Qing merely an accomplice?

336
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:29,919
No.

337
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,879
Wu Liang was also a perpetrator.

338
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,039
Wu Liang was a perpetrator?

339
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,279
I do not know

340
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,240
whether Wu Liang insulted Miss Shi Qing,

341
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,720
but I know

342
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,639
that Wu Liang intended to kill her.

343
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,000
There is a scar on the upper part
of Shi Qing's right arm.

344
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,279
Judging by the degree of healing,

345
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,000
it dates back about half a year.

346
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,639
From the angle and width of the wound,

347
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,759
it was caused by a palace guard's saber

348
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,240
swung upward from below.

349
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,300
Leng Yue once said

350
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,900
that those trained in martial arts
first learn how to yield in defeat.

351
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,840
For Shi Qing to shield herself
with her arm,

352
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,710
it must have been
a vital area being targeted.

353
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,950
Judging from the difference in stature
between Shi Qing and the deceased,

354
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,079
that strike

355
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,240
was meant to end her life in one blow.

356
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:12,519
In other words,

357
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,240
Wu Liang struck with lethal intent.

358
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,720
It was not Shi Qing
who intended to harm Wu Liang.

359
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,119
It was Wu Liang
who sought to kill Shi Qing.

360
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,200
So Shi Qing delivered a fatal strike

361
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,759
only to protect herself.

362
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,519
That is correct.

363
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,319
Shi Qing.

364
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,160
I will give you one more chance.

365
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,599
Explain yourself clearly.

366
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,160
Why were you in
such a secluded place that day

367
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,720
and why did you meet that guard there?

368
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:34,880
And why

369
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,559
did he attempt to kill you?

370
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,200
Tell the truth.

371
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,759
You must not conceal anything further.

372
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

373
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,180
That day, I went to fetch pastries.

374
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,470
I happened to pass by that spot.

375
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,039
He likely did not recognize me,

376
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:50,839
and besides, perhaps standing guard
all night had bored him.

377
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,599
He began to harass me,

378
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,839
treating me as amusement.

379
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,480
My resistance angered him,

380
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,160
and so he acted
in such an extreme manner.

381
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,960
In that case,

382
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,400
why did you not call
for help at the time?

383
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,799
Your Majesty,

384
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,440
at that moment, you were strolling
the gardens with Her Highness.

385
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,400
I did not dare disturb
the imperial presence.

386
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,240
I also feared that vile man
would turn the blame on me,

387
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,640
tarnishing my reputation without cause
and implicating Her Highness as well.

388
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,559
Shi Qing.

389
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,400
Did you push him into the water?

390
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,680
I did not.

391
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,880
He fell in by accident.

392
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,440
Wu Liang struck at me
with lethal intent at every turn.

393
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,079
I had no choice but to strike
his vital point to protect myself.

394
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
The pain seized him,

395
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,960
and he tried to pull away from me.

396
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,119
As he backed toward
the pond, he fell in.

397
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,880
I was terrified at the time.

398
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,559
I only wanted to tend to my wound

399
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,990
before Her Highness
returned to the palace.

400
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,200
So I lied and said

401
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,559
that in the darkness

402
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,319
I had slipped and been cut by a stone.

403
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,750
Her Highness did not suspect a thing.

404
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,790
On the contrary,
she gave me many medicinal herbs.

405
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,799
That is how it remained concealed.

406
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,559
Your Majesty.

407
00:18:57,079 --> 00:18:59,759
Shi Qing has served me for many years
with loyalty and diligence.

408
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,600
Although there was fault in this matter,

409
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,960
it was that reckless man
who first harbored ill intent.

410
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,039
I beg Your Majesty to show mercy

411
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,880
and spare Shi Qing's life.

412
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,640
A life for a life

413
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,279
is the way of heaven.

414
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:15,960
Your Majesty.

415
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,359
It was the guard
who acted improperly first

416
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,920
and then sought to silence her.

417
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,799
Shi Qing acted only in self defense,

418
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,240
with no intent to harm.

419
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,079
According to the law,
she should not be sentenced to death.

420
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,320
Commandery Princess Consort An.

421
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,519
This is the inner palace.

422
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,880
A palace maid
and a guard entangled improperly,

423
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,839
whether or not she was at fault,

424
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,119
she bears responsibility.

425
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,920
Since the evidence is conclusive

426
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,319
and she has confessed,

427
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:38,759
- then...
- Your Majesty.

428
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,660
Your birthday celebration
has not yet concluded.

429
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,370
Envoys from all directions and officials
from across the realm are still present.

430
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,390
It may be better to hand this matter
over to the Palace Domestic Service

431
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,690
and decide it after the festival.

432
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,400
Hm.

433
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,160
Grant death after the festival.

434
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,599
Thanks Your Majesty for your grace.

435
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,799
Your Highness.

436
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,480
Should we not
have investigated this case?

437
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,160
Matters have right and wrong,
cases have truth and falsehood.

438
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,960
We bear the responsibility

439
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,359
to reveal the truth impartially.

440
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,480
And guided by conscience,

441
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,799
to seek, within the law,

442
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,720
the best possible outcome
for those involved.

443
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,839
So uncovering the truth
was not your mistake.

444
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,599
Besides, this case is not yet concluded.

445
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,079
Do you remember how I asked you today
to pay attention to Shi Qing's injuries?

446
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,039
Check carefully whether Shi Qing
had suffered any violation.

447
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,039
Understood.

448
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,119
I examined her.

449
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,200
There was indeed none.

450
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,359
This shows Wu Liang did not violate her.

451
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,340
Shi Qing was the chief palace maid
in Consort Hui's household.

452
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,490
She held considerable standing.

453
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,990
And always conducted
herself with composure.

454
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,039
If it had been nothing more
than verbal provocation,

455
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,520
she would have had many ways
to extricate herself.

456
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,640
Yet it escalated
into a fight to the death.

457
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,359
She had no prior close dealings

458
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,759
with that guard.

459
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,359
So why did she rush to confess
in front of His Majesty?

460
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,400
Shi Qing was lying.

461
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,200
She was concealing something.

462
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,440
Exactly.

463
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,180
His Majesty pressed her so hard,

464
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,260
even declaring she would
be executed after the festival.

465
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,520
Yet she never changed her story.

466
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,839
What could possibly

467
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,759
be more important than her own life?

468
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
Could it be her family's lives?

469
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,400
That seems unlikely.

470
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,839
She has lived in the palace for years.

471
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,039
What could possibly happen

472
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:33,599
that would endanger her family outside?

473
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,319
Unless…

474
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,279
She was stealing valuables
within the palace

475
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,599
and then

476
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,920
having them smuggled out to be sold.

477
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,440
So the guard discovered her theft,

478
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,359
and was silenced because of it.

479
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:52,400
Today, when Leng Yue and I

480
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,480
checked the records
in the palace, we found

481
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:56,799
that items have
been going missing frequently.

482
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,470
Consort Hui had previously ordered
the palace official

483
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,890
to investigate, but nothing came of it.

484
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,720
In truth,

485
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,799
palace servants stealing valuables

486
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,000
has existed in every dynasty.

487
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,640
It has simply become especially serious
in the past half year.

488
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,960
The splendor and luxury
within the palace

489
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,359
appear dazzling,

490
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,279
but they have nothing to do
with low-ranking eunuchs and maids.

491
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,480
Especially in recent years,

492
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,960
with the treasury strained,

493
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,690
palace expenditures have
been cut again and again.

494
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,039
Naturally, they would want
to take valuables

495
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,400
to secure a way out for themselves.

496
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,400
Especially when palace maids grow older
and are released from service,

497
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,240
if they have nothing set aside,

498
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,000
they would not even know how to survive.

499
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,279
Your Highness.

500
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,240
If there were any other choice,

501
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,359
who would risk execution

502
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:42,880
to steal palace property?

503
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,240
So you suspect this
is connected to Shi Qing?

504
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,200
But

505
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,799
she is the chief palace maid
by Consort Hui's side.

506
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,570
There was no need for her to do that.

507
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,839
I know.

508
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:00,920
I just cannot understand
why Shi Qing and Wu Liang

509
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,039
would fight each other to the death.

510
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,079
Whatever the hidden truth may be,

511
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,759
His Majesty clearly does not wish
to pursue this matter further.

512
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,880
The chances to investigate it in depth

513
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,039
will likely be very slim.

514
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:19,839
Chu.

515
00:23:22,519 --> 00:23:24,200
Did you marry the Commandery Prince An,

516
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,270
or did you marry
the Three Judicial Offices?

517
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
He.

518
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
I am doing just fine.

519
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,990
From now on,
living in the Prince's Manor,

520
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,200
we will be relying on you.

521
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,240
Today, I will host.

522
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,240
You came from afar,

523
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,740
and the two of us have not yet had
the chance to entertain you properly.

524
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,519
Order whatever

525
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,440
you like today.

526
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,319
This place may not be luxurious,

527
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,839
but the flavors are truly first rate.

528
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,300
Palace matters have been many,

529
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,880
and we kept you waiting for a long time.

530
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,340
Stir-fried lamb with scallions. Qingfeng rice.
Huai-leaf cold noodles. Gourd chicken.

531
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,780
Cheese cherries. Flower-folded goose cake.

532
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,990
Crystal dragon-and-phoenix cake.

533
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,759
That will be all.

534
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,200
Wait.

535
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,500
Add two more servings of steamed cakes.

536
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,290
No problem.

537
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:07,920
He.

538
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,440
Why did you only order what I like?

539
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,990
You should order something
you enjoy too.

540
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,759
I just thought
I would try a different taste for once.

541
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,759
A different taste.

542
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,559
Please enjoy.

543
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,799
Eat more.

544
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,190
Your face has grown so thin
there's hardly any flesh left.

545
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,119
The food here
still can't compare to home.

546
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,839
This time, I brought
a lot of local specialties from home.

547
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,580
Enough for you to eat for a year or two.

548
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,160
He,

549
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,319
look carefully.

550
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,599
I'm not thin at all.

551
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,920
He is right.

552
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:38,759
You work day and night.

553
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,880
You really should eat more.

554
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:40,640
Exactly.

555
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,599
Eat.

556
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:45,359
He, this time you came to the Capital,

557
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,680
why did you bring so many things?

558
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,500
It must have been
such a hassle on the road.

559
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,079
Just tell me, do you like them or not?

560
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,200
I like them.

561
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,720
I knew it.

562
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,039
Things from home always suit you best.

563
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:57,680
Come, He.

564
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,119
This is fine Willow Leaf Wine.

565
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,400
Let me toast you.

566
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,200
Come.

567
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,880
My brother...

568
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,000
Casually

569
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,720
will do.

570
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:10,720
This bit of wine is
nothing worth mentioning.

571
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,720
Men of Qianzhou
can all handle their drink.

572
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,000
As for why I like steamed cakes,

573
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:22,759
the truth is

574
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,599
Chu Chu likes them.

575
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:25,920
She

576
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,200
did not dare tell Father,

577
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,880
so I took the blame for her.

578
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,359
Who would have thought

579
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,559
she could keep eating and eating,

580
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,000
until just smelling steamed cakes

581
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,680
made me feel sick.

582
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,720
My younger sister

583
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,799
has a stubborn nature.

584
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,279
When she likes something,
she never tires of it.

585
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,920
And when she sets her heart on someone,

586
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,480
it is for a lifetime.

587
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,720
He.

588
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,000
My brother

589
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,640
usually can't handle strong liquor.

590
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,839
One cup and he is done.

591
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,640
And it really was just one cup.

592
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,559
My Lady.

593
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,330
- Where is Vice Minister Jing?
- Right here.

594
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,599
What are you doing up in the tree?

595
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,240
Surveying the whole scene.

596
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,680
Thinking it through as a whole.

597
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,680
Skipping work
and still sounding confident about it.

598
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,230
The case is already closed.
It is just a matter of procedure now.

599
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,960
Boring as can be.

600
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,510
Let us go in and take a look.

601
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,680
This person
really lived without restraint.

602
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,440
Exactly.

603
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,039
Things were left scattered everywhere.

604
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,880
When we arrived,
it was already like this.

605
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,620
(Footprint size, gait, mulberries)

606
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,780
(All consistent)

607
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,000
That is not right.

608
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,570
Someone has searched this place.

609
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,920
More than once.

610
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:14,960
What do you mean?

611
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,799
Spring mud from the third month.

612
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,240
Spring mud?

613
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:20,240
Look.

614
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,359
These fine strands
are peach blossom stamens.

615
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:24,930
What does that tell us?

616
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,079
It means someone came here when
the peach blossoms were in full bloom.

617
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:31,680
Come take a look at this.

618
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:36,720
Bloodstains?

619
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,519
Mulberries.

620
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,990
They were abundant last month,
but the season has already passed.

621
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,559
The key point is,

622
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,759
judging from the footprint size
and the gait,

623
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,720
these two sets of footprints

624
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,000
were left by the same person.

625
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,599
The same person?

626
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,599
They came once
during peach blossom season,

627
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,519
and came again
when mulberries were ripening.

628
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,519
That means after Wu Liang died
three or four months later,

629
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,839
someone searched this place once,

630
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,160
failed to find what they wanted
and would not give up,

631
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,759
then searched again last month.

632
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,640
There must be something here
they desperately wanted.

633
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,680
That does not add up.

634
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,039
Every wall and every brick here

635
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,480
was carefully tapped and checked.

636
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,960
There was no problem.

637
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:36,400
My dear.

638
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,160
Do you not think this wall...

639
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,839
Seems off.

640
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:54,319
This is already the edge of the house.

641
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,359
This space is…

642
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,440
Is Wu Liang trying
to become a Chess Attendant?

643
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,359
He is relentlessly training in Xuansu.

644
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:17,160
But with Xuansu,

645
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:19,759
the four star points around the center,

646
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,240
why is that area worn down so badly?

647
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,820
(The chessboard mechanism.
The four star region is severely worn)

648
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,880
This is no private residence.

649
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,400
It is clearly a private treasury
of the inner palace.

650
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,990
I will report this to the Prince.
This case cannot be closed.

651
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,799
Your Highness.

652
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,400
All of these
were found in Wu Liang's home.

653
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,400
Exactly.

654
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,660
He was hidden extremely well.

655
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,000
I obtained from Consort Hui

656
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,200
(One jade hairpin. One silver hairpin)
a list of missing items.

657
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,960
These are all on that list.

658
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,079
Earlier you discovered
at Wu Liang's residence

659
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,359
that someone entered
the house twice after his death.

660
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:35,990
Has that person been identified?

661
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:37,359
We questioned the neighbors,

662
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,079
but no one saw anyone going in or out.

663
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,480
However, after thoroughly clearing out
everything in Wu Liang's home, we found

664
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,359
(Five pouches. Eight letters)
that he had no silver at all.

665
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
I suspect it was just a petty thief.

666
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,920
After succeeding once,

667
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,460
he ran short of money again,
and came back to try his luck.

668
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,599
But these are all items
used in the inner palace.

669
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,200
A mere guard like him

670
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,960
could not even enter the palace halls.

671
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,880
They could only have come

672
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,839
from palace maids or eunuchs.

673
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,440
A palace maid.

674
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,599
Could it really have been Shi Qing?

675
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,839
She was Consort Hui's chief palace maid.

676
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:13,690
She could enter every palace freely,

677
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,370
and no one would dare
search her lightly.

678
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,240
Stealing something would have been easy.

679
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:20,079
She went unnoticed at first,

680
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:22,160
until Wu Liang happened upon it.

681
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:24,950
Seeing the valuables, Wu Liang
grew greedy and tried to blackmail Shi Qing.

682
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,890
In her panic,
Shi Qing killed him to silence him.

683
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,319
That explains everything.

684
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,559
For Shi Qing to do this

685
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,240
was both to preserve
the larger situation

686
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,359
and out of fear...

687
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,150
Fear that someone with ulterior motives
would drag Your Highness into it

688
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,200
and damage your reputation.

689
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:48,400
Reputation?

690
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,240
Shi Qing is about to lose her life.

691
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,200
What reputation
do I have left to speak of?

692
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,839
Your Highness.

693
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,400
Shi Qing has already confessed.

694
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,660
There is no room for reversal.

695
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,370
If Your Highness
hesitates again and again,

696
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,190
the Three Judicial Offices
may sense something amiss

697
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,300
and pursue the matter further.

698
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,990
By then, none of the palaces
will escape implication.

699
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:07,490
At that point, Shi Qing
will have died in vain,

700
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,880
and her confession
will have meant nothing, Your Highness.

701
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,400
When Shi Qing is taken away,

702
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,440
go and see her off for me.

703
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,720
Send more silver to her family as well.

704
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,180
She has a widowed mother
and younger siblings at home.

705
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,400
I fear that in the future,

706
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,680
life will be hard for them.

707
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,839
Yes.

708
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,190
From now on,
enforce palace regulations strictly.

709
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,680
If there are any further thefts,
punish them without leniency.

710
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,200
As for what happened before,

711
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,319
I will let it pass.

712
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,799
Your Highness is kind hearted,

713
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,240
only then can such leadership

714
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,839
by example produce maids like Shi Qing,
loyal and full of feeling.

715
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,720
On their behalf,

716
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,240
I thank Your Highness

717
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,200
and Shi Qing.

718
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:46,240
You're back?

719
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,720
What did you find?

720
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:51,720
We recovered some items from Wu Liang.

721
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,100
Within the palace, clothing,
food, and daily provisions

722
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,200
are all strictly regulated.

723
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,960
But these pouches and handkerchiefs

724
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,880
are made of very coarse fabric.

725
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,359
They are rewards
given only to palace maids.

726
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,079
(To my Wu Liang, personally opened)
Yet palace maids wear uniform attire in daily life,

727
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,440
so these must have been sewn privately.

728
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,720
They are all personal items,

729
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,000
nothing of real value.

730
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,759
Shi Qing would not have stolen these.

731
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,400
Could it be that Wu Liang stole them?

732
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,680
He did have that habit.

733
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,359
More likely,
they were given to him in secret

734
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,359
by palace maids.

735
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:20,839
Yes.

736
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,839
Because we also uncovered
several private letters of affection.

737
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,390
The handwriting
differs from letter to letter,

738
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,240
so they were written
by different people.

739
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,079
Wu Liang was nothing more than a guard,

740
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,060
yet he managed
to captivate so many palace maids.

741
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,440
What?

742
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:35,480
You sound rather envious.

743
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,160
Do you want to learn from Wu Liang?

744
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,359
I despise that kind of man,

745
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,640
fickle and incapable of devotion.

746
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,640
We cannot jump to conclusions.

747
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,240
There is no evidence
that Wu Liang replied to them.

748
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,720
Among these letters and items,
is there anything from Shi Qing?

749
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:53,640
No.

750
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,160
We compared the handwriting

751
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,759
in Shi Qing's testimony with the letter,

752
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,319
and they don't match.

753
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,680
So Shi Qing never wrote to him.

754
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,519
From the way Shi Qing spoke of Wu Liang,

755
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,720
there was only disgust and hatred.

756
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,600
It truly did not seem like
she ever liked him.

757
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,639
So there are two things
we must now find out.

758
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,440
First,

759
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:16,290
how these palace maids' belongings
ended up in Wu Liang's possession.

760
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:17,079
Second,

761
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,800
who the palace maids were

762
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
that wrote these letters.

763
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,800
Shi Qing will not speak again.

764
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,320
So,

765
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,280
these items

766
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,039
are our only remaining clues.

767
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,599
You should think this through carefully.

768
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
From His Majesty

769
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,239
down to the palace maids,

770
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,800
no one wants this investigated.

771
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,320
What you are doing
may earn no gratitude.

772
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,159
Investigate it.

773
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,790
When the Three Judicial Offices
handle a case,

774
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,880
we seek only fairness.

775
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:50,960
That's great.

776
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,960
Then I'll go with Chu Chu right now

777
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,790
to track down the palace maids
who wrote to Wu Liang.

778
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:55,480
Mm.

779
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:08,599
What?

780
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,490
It's only been half a day,
and you already miss her that much?

781
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,440
Leng Yue.

782
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,960
It's already late today.

783
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,330
By the time you arrive,
the palace gates will be locked.

784
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,680
Going tomorrow will be soon enough.

785
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,480
Exactly.

786
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:21,639
I'm starving already.

787
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,440
Your Highness.

788
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,980
How about adding two more places
at the Prince's Manor today?

789
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:26,199
No.

790
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,519
How can there be none?

791
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,880
I clearly heard you tell
Wu Jiang this afternoon

792
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,239
to go to Guangtai Tower to buy...

793
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,679
Buy what?

794
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,360
Am I

795
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
supposed to know or not know?

796
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,400
I suddenly realized

797
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:44,039
that during the Emperor's birthday,

798
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,320
Chang'an has no curfew,

799
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,990
so it's inevitable that some troublemakers
might take advantage.

800
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,870
In case the Jingzhao Prefecture
are stretched thin,

801
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,679
you might as well help with patrols.

802
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,239
I really do not think that is necessary.

803
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,440
It is not that I am being lax.

804
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:56,920
I am worried Jiang Daohai will

805
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,800
like a hawk, keep staring at me again,

806
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,300
afraid I might steal his credit.

807
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,960
It doesn't matter.

808
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,000
It is all service to the state.

809
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,400
Patrol every street and alley carefully,

810
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,159
and make a detailed record.

811
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,559
Bring it to me personally
tomorrow morning.

812
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:11,840
Your Highness...

813
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,519
Go.

814
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,119
Rest assured, Your Highness.

815
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,360
Tonight I will keep my eyes on him
every step of the way.

816
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,860
Thank for the hard work, Jing Yi.

817
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,400
Not hard work.

818
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,599
Just hard on the heart.

819
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,079
Why did you suddenly punish him?

820
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,599
I am not only punishing him.

821
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,119
I am punishing you as well.

822
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,800
