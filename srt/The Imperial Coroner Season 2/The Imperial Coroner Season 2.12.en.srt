(On the night before she
was to redeem herself.)

00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:19,760

00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,920
(who it truly was)

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,519
(drove a wretched soul to this end.)

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,600
(And this sudden brother
and sister-in-law.)

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,399
(Who was behind them?)

00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,400

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

25
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,040
(This story is entirely fictional.)

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,720
=Episode 12=

27
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,639
Qinxiang.

28
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,000
This is my sister.

29
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,919
What a pity.

30
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,280
I wasn't wrong earlier.

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,280
This is Qinxiang.

32
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,639
Are you done? Are you sure?

33
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,879
That question is for you.

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,560
You cannot
even recognize your own sister?

35
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,240
We...

36
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,080
We barely met her.

37
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,360
Still trying to make excuses?

38
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:32,840
Guards.

39
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:33,400
Here.

40
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,280
Drag them out and beat them.

41
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,759
Until they tell the truth.

42
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,460
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

43
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,460
- Your Highness?
- Your Highness?

44
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,140
Quite the important person.

45
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:40,700
Your Highness.

46
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:40,919
Move.

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,420
Your Highness!

48
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,180
Mercy, Your Highness!

49
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,400
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

50
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,280
Please have mercy, Your Highness!

51
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,800
I was only trying to get by.

52
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,879
Just scraping by?

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,400
You have quite the appetite.

54
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,460
Does food tainted
with human blood taste that good?

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,270
We will not dare again.

56
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,680
Never again.

57
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:55,550
You deliberately
misled an imperial official.

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,240
That alone is enough to charge you.

59
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
If you utter a single false word...

60
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,159
- We would not dare.
- We would not dare.

61
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,599
You insist you are Qinxiang's
brother and sister in law,

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,820
yet you never sought compensation
from the Music Office,

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,919
only trying to take her belongings.

64
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,280
But among those belongings,
there is nothing of worth.

65
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,280
Which means their value

66
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,000
lies beyond the objects themselves.

67
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:16,879
Speak.

68
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,759
What are you really after?

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,719
Your Highness,
I truly had no ulterior motives.

70
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:21,960
Someone came to me.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,350
He told me to steal her belongings.

72
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,050
He offered two taels of silver up front.
Five more once it was done.

73
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,360
Why did he choose the two of you?

74
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,879
We honestly do not know.

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,300
Please see clearly, Your Highness.

76
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,670
Please judge fairly, Your Highness.

77
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,879
What did this man look like?

78
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,240
Do you remember?

79
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,599
He

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
had a wide mouth.

81
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
A rather square face.

82
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,479
And

83
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:41,159
he dressed like a ghost.

84
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,360
And spoke with a Nanzhao accent.

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,639
Your Highness.

86
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,759
How is he now?

87
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,600
He keeps shouting about seeing ghost guards
to extend his life.

88
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,950
Saying over and over
that he is about to die.

89
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,240
Neither man nor ghost.

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,599
Zhao Senyao.

91
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:08,190
The ghost guard you mentioned,

92
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,560
is he really from Nanzhao?

93
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,759
Ghost guard!

94
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,990
Bring the ghost guard here!

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,039
Let him extend my life!

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,480
Do you think he would dare come here?

97
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
You might as well tell the truth.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,519
I will talk.

99
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,319
I will.

100
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,680
It was Zhou Han. The Shence Army
commandant who died.

101
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,160
Zhou Han? It was him?

102
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,079
Then why did you not tell us earlier?

103
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,000
He is supposed to be dead.

104
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,199
A ghost.

105
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,959
What good would it have done if I did?

106
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,120
I had people look into
that fake brother and sister.

107
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,790
They are indeed con artists
from the martial world.

108
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,480
If they could identify Zhou Han,

109
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,500
they are unlikely to be lying.

110
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,590
Your Highness.

111
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,990
Have you thought of something?

112
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,500
I remembered what You Chen'an had said.

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,319
That fake Zhou Han

114
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,800
posed as a ghost guard

115
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,480
and moved frequently around Chang'an.

116
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,680
They chose the Music Office,

117
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,040
where syphilis infection spreads easily
and nobles gather.

118
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,199
Using girls like Qinxiang,

119
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,439
they drew clients
with so called incense,

120
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,839
then through intimacy

121
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,000
spread the syphilis infection.

122
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,680
Panic followed in Chang'an.

123
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,800
Qinxiang was silenced in the end.

124
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,240
From Miss Hua Mei's account,

125
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,600
the incense had appeared
half a year ago.

126
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,879
Nanzhao chose a method

127
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,800
both vicious and concealed.

128
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,480
The clues lay hidden,

129
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,240
yet danger brewed beneath.

130
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,879
Qinxiang's death
was clearly to cover it up.

131
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,519
What they meant to hide

132
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,399
must be a far greater plot.

133
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,160
Nanzhao.

134
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,399
What are they really after?

135
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,319
Do not be afraid.

136
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,040
Your Highness.

137
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,890
For the first time,

138
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,240
I feel so clearly

139
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,120
what weighs on you day and night,

140
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,800
what you worry about,

141
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,279
what you bear.

142
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,660
The war between Great Tang and Nanzhao

143
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,199
has long been burning in the shadows.

144
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,800
The Three Judicial Offices moved fast.

145
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,120
Peacock ordered me

146
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,959
to find people to pose
as Qinxiang's brother and sister-in-law.

147
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,079
I did not understand

148
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,120
why such a small matter
required me personally.

149
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,199
He meant to

150
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,519
use me as bait,

151
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,800
to draw
the Three Judicial Offices' attention,

152
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,040
and keep himself hidden.

153
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,360
Then would that not put you
in danger, sir?

154
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,920
Fortunately, I planned ahead.

155
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,240
I let his
so called ghost guard handle it.

156
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,160
But Peacock

157
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,360
never consults anyone.

158
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,180
He clearly does not
see you as a colleague.

159
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,199
A colleague?

160
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,000
You think too much.

161
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,600
In his eyes,

162
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,680
you and I are nothing but chess pieces.

163
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,240
Not even treated as people.

164
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,240
I am curious.

165
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,759
Who exactly is he?

166
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,439
And next,

167
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,920
what move will he make?

168
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,199
There is one matter

169
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,199
I would not entrust to anyone else.

170
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,000
I will need you to leave the capital.

171
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,319
Leave the capital?

172
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,759
For what?

173
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,000
Bring someone back.

174
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:34,680
(Uphold Virtue and Act with Clarity)

175
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,639
I, Wan Qianshan,
Left Remonstrant of the Chancellery,

176
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,279
have a matter to submit.

177
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:41,680
Top Scholar,

178
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,439
who do you accuse today?

179
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,079
All is stated

180
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,439
in my memorial.

181
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,220
(Memorial)

182
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,439
Wan Qianshan.

183
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,480
You have great nerve.

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,820
To slander
the Commandery Princess Consort An

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,120
and the prince of Nanzhao.

186
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,279
I only report

187
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,360
what I heard and saw.

188
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,879
I dare not fabricate lies.

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,940
Are these rumors
spreading fast among the people?

190
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,519
In streets and alleys alike,
everyone is talking.

191
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,720
I am aware of this matter.

192
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,720
I will see it thoroughly investigated.

193
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,120
Wan Qianshan.

194
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,439
Until then,

195
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,000
do not spread a word.

196
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,200
Keep your mouth shut.

197
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,240
Yes.

198
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
I take my leave.

199
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:43,320
Your Majesty.

200
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,320
Consort Hui.

201
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,240
Have a seat.

202
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:56,960
Leave us.

203
00:08:59,279 --> 00:08:59,879
Your Majesty.

204
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,399
I came today

205
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,840
out of duty.

206
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,200
There has been a rumor
among the noble ladies.

207
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,639
At first, I paid it no mind.

208
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,639
But lately,

209
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,799
it has grown louder.

210
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,360
I feared

211
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,559
it might affect court affairs,

212
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,679
so I had to report it to Your Majesty.

213
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,600
What rumor?

214
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,039
They say

215
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,200
the Commandery Princess Consort An
and You Chen'an,

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,970
have an illicit affair.

217
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,000
Lord Wan.

218
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:43,759
Lord Wan.

219
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,840
Why are you still here?

220
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,919
We were just talking about

221
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,720
the recent

222
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,240
rumors about
the Commandery Princess Consort An.

223
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,480
A tragedy for the manor,

224
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,639
and a misfortune for the state.

225
00:09:58,039 --> 00:09:59,200
You have heard as well?

226
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,240
It is all anyone is talking about.

227
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,879
Who would not know?

228
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,559
Exactly.

229
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,240
Indeed.

230
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,790
It is a pity for Commandery Prince An.

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,840
He has been blinded by his consort.

232
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,690
The Three Judicial Offices
will likely be pressed

233
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,879
to step in and suppress it.

234
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,840
To let the matter fade away.

235
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,260
The Three Judicial Offices
serve the state by imperial order.

236
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,400
They are not
Commandery Prince An's private troops.

237
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,440
Private troops or not,

238
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
His Majesty favors Commandery Prince An.

239
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,660
If he chooses not to pursue it,

240
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,679
who would dare object?

241
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,159
And what could you say?

242
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,580
As for the Three Judicial Offices...

243
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,240
Lord Wan,

244
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,039
let us not draw attention
at the palace gate.

245
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,320
Let us find somewhere private,

246
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,559
and talk over a meal.

247
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:45,919
Yes.

248
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,620
Let us go.

249
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:46,879
Go.

250
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:47,940
We will talk while we eat.

251
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,360
Wan Qianshan accuses Chu Chu
of improper conduct,

252
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,559
and of being too close to You Chen'an.

253
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,159
He also accuses you of treating
the Three Judicial Offices as private troops.

254
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:02,399
What do you say?

255
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:04,039
I have no particular view.

256
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:05,640
You Chen'an

257
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:07,990
entered the Three Judicial Offices
to study under Chu Chu.

258
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,870
Chu Chu was simply
performing her duties.

259
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,810
She is overwhelmed with work each day,

260
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,990
teaching while handling cases,

261
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,320
rising early and resting late,

262
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,100
yet still subjected
to malicious suspicion.

263
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,559
So you mean

264
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,879
that as Left Remonstrant,

265
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,759
Wan Qianshan's reports to me

266
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,759
are all groundless,

267
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,120
fabricated from nothing?

268
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,080
I would not dare.

269
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,440
Wan Qianshan is constrained
by rigid notions of propriety.

270
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,480
Your Majesty is wise and discerning.

271
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,399
You would never wound

272
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,320
the devotion of a coroner
who serves the people.

273
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
As for Chu Chu,

274
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
let us set that aside for now.

275
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,159
But what about his charge against you?

276
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,960
How do you answer that?

277
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,879
Those who impeach me
are as many as fish crossing a river.

278
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,679
Wan Qianshan is hardly the only one.

279
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,440
By royal command,
I have summoned you all.

280
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,440
From now on, orders are to be
obeyed without question.

281
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Any who defy them,

282
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,399
any who betray,

283
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,159
will be executed without mercy.

284
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,039
- Yes.
- Yes.

285
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,879
Next,

286
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,080
we will shake all of Chang'an

287
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,240
to its core.

288
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:20,799
Father.

289
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,039
What has made you so pleased today?

290
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,000
The plan is in motion.

291
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,919
We wait for a great general to fall.

292
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Congratulations, Father.

293
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,560
How goes the preparation in Jiaozhou?

294
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,440
Rest assured, Father.

295
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:38,730
Everything is ready.

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,759
All that remains

297
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,039
is your command.

298
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,840
About a month ago,

299
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:51,400
rumors began about the Princess Consort
and You Chen'an.

300
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,280
The public is always curious

301
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,160
about the private affairs
of the royal family.

302
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,120
And with the Princess Consort's status,

303
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,399
the stories

304
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,320
have grown more and more absurd,

305
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,639
and increasingly sinister.

306
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,559
In my view,

307
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,080
these rumors

308
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,919
are being pushed from the shadows,

309
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,200
quietly, by someone behind the scenes.

310
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,320
Investigate this thoroughly.

311
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,330
Bring every fabricator to
the Three Judicial Offices for questioning.

312
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,770
Those who spread the rumors
will be punished the same.

313
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:17,519
Yes.

314
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:20,720
Your Highness,

315
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,960
if we do this,

316
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,840
some may accuse you

317
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,559
in secret

318
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,590
of abusing your authority.

319
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
When I do nothing,

320
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,799
do they speak any less?

321
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,519
I once believed
that upright conduct speaks for itself.

322
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:40,879
Now I understand

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
those who spread slander

324
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,600
never care whether it is true.

325
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,440
Chu Chu serves the state,

326
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,080
and is of the imperial family.

327
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,559
They even dragged in
Second Prince of Nanzhao.

328
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,720
Their intent is unforgivable.

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,900
Without investigation,
the law cannot be upheld,

330
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,300
nor the authority
of the state protected.

331
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,559
Do they not love pinning baseless talk

332
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,679
on Chu Chu?

333
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,039
I am only enforcing the law.

334
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,279
That is mercy enough.

335
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,919
Understood.

336
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,559
We will seize a few first, as a warning.

337
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,720
Then every loudmouth,

338
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,120
one by one, will pay.

339
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,519
Is this not factionalism?

340
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,320
Qianshan,

341
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,120
that is not so.

342
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,000
We only dared speak

343
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,480
because you stirred us
to stand up to power.

344
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,519
Yes.

345
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:39,960
Yes.

346
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,519
Enough.

347
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:49,840
I am

348
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,279
Left Remonstrant of the Chancellery.

349
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:54,519
It is my duty to watch over officials

350
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,399
and keep the court clean.

351
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,679
Of course.

352
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,919
From now on,

353
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,600
if any of you are at fault,

354
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,919
I will report it

355
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
to His Majesty as well.

356
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,840
- Lord Wan.
- Lord Wan.

357
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,799
Qianshan is right.

358
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,000
He is right.

359
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,200
Look,

360
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,320
we rarely get together like this.

361
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,679
No more state matters.

362
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,080
Exactly.

363
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,320
No more state matters.

364
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,039
Since we are at the Music Office,

365
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,679
let us hear that piece of yours,

366
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:25,360
the anti Nanzhao proclamation

367
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,000
that was set to music.

368
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
It is

369
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,159
the talk of the capital

370
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,200
these days.

371
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,840
No state matters,

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,879
just music.

373
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,519
Why am I at the Music Office?

374
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:43,919
No.

375
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,200
I must go first.

376
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Lord Wan.

our fate lies ahead.

385
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,480
All affairs under heaven

follow the will of the people.

387
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,120
The armies of Jiaozhou

388
00:16:56,879 --> 00:16:58,720
are fierce as tigers and wolves.

389
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,639
Weapons at the ready, day and night,

390
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,400
signal fires face one another.

391
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,920
Formations stand grim and proud,

392
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:10,200
blades aimed at all horizons.

393
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,119
Despicable villains

394
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,599
raise their heads,

395
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,519
spread their claws.

396
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,799
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

397
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,519
Sir.

398
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,319
Bolder than mountains and rivers,

399
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,279
a loyal heart,

400
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,720
that could swallow sun and moon.

401
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,720
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

402
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,519
Don armor,

403
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,119
and press forward.

404
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,680
Why care for one's own fame?

405
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,559
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

406
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,559
He drank too much.

407
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:23,920
Sir.

408
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,519
Sir.

409
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,400
No pulse.

410
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,079
He is dead.

411
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,960
Someone is dead!

412
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,260
(Wan Qianshan)

413
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:55,980
Your Highness.

414
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,279
I will question them again.

415
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,799
Wait.

416
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,500
Another case of syphilis infection.

417
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:05,599
There are no obvious external injuries.

418
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,039
Judging by the lips

419
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:07,920
and fingernails,

420
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,759
there are no signs
of poisoning such as arsenic.

421
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,160
The most likely cause,

422
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,680
is syphilis infection,
aggravated by heavy drinking,

423
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,559
leading to sudden death.

424
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,839
Without direct contact,

425
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,039
it is hard to be certain.

426
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,300
I still want to examine him.

427
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:27,599
As you wish.

428
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,190
Reporting to Your Highness,

429
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,799
there are indeed
no visible external wounds.

430
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,319
On the skin,

431
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,559
there are dark red sores
the size of rice grains,

432
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,359
consistent with
syphilis infection symptoms.

433
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,160
However,

434
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,440
from this alone,

435
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,759
we cannot confirm the cause of death.

436
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,000
The body must be taken back

437
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,340
to the Three Judicial Offices
for full examination.

438
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:52,920
Impossible.

439
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,920
Commandant Zhao rushed over.

440
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,079
What do you mean by that?

441
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:01,000
Are you saying

442
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,000
Wan Qianshan died suddenly
from syphilis infection?

443
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,279
That has not been confirmed.

444
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,759
It requires detailed examination.

445
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:08,160
Wan Qianshan

446
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,000
was rigid and ascetic.

447
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,960
Let alone
contracting syphilis infection,

448
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,000
he never even

449
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,079
kept a woman.

450
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,300
It is impossible to have contracted
a syphilis infection.

451
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:18,880
He collapsed in public,

452
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:20,279
and died at the Music Office.

453
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,400
If you truly wish to preserve his name,

454
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,039
then let me take his body back

455
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,680
to the Three Judicial Offices,

456
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,920
to clear him of suspicion.

457
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,119
Your Highness may not know this,

458
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,030
Wan Qianshan and I
are from the same hometown.

459
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:35,039
We entered the capital in the same year.

460
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,519
He came from a poor family.

461
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,440
His family knows nothing
of court affairs.

462
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,160
His father entrusted me,
while I was in the capital,

463
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,200
to look after him.

464
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,880
Though we

465
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,319
often clashed at court,

466
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,750
and held opposing views,

467
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,160
now that Qianshan

468
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,599
has died so suddenly,

469
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,880
I must honor that promise.

470
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,799
What is past cannot be undone.

471
00:20:57,559 --> 00:20:58,359
All we know is

472
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,000
you two were bitter rivals.

473
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,480
Now Wan Qianshan has died suddenly,

474
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,240
and you block the autopsy.

475
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:05,880
Could it be

476
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,039
that his death
has something to do with you?

477
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,240
That is slander!

478
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:09,880
Commandant Zhao!

479
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,519
Second Prince,

480
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:14,990
mind your words.

481
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:19,930
Commandant Zhao,

482
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,500
this is not for you to interfere in.

483
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,079
You should know,

484
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,200
without an autopsy,

485
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,720
Wan Qianshan's death

486
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,640
cannot be handled as a homicide.

487
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:31,930
You claim you can decide for his family,

488
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,680
but if there was foul play,

489
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:35,920
the killer would go free.

490
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,160
How would you answer to his aged father,

491
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,839
or to Wan Qianshan himself?

492
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,119
Your Highness is right.

493
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,920
I will write at once

494
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,370
to seek his father's opinion
before making a final decision.

495
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,880
By then,

496
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,880
the body may already be decayed,

497
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,079
beyond examination.

498
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,039
Wan Qianshan gave his life
for the state,

499
00:21:59,240 --> 00:21:59,880
yet in death,

500
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,079
he cannot even be dressed
in proper burial robes.

501
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,780
Thank you for the reminder,
Princess Consort.

502
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,720
I will see to a proper burial

503
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,759
at once.

504
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,319
Commandant Zhao may not know,

505
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,079
burial garments are best

506
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,200
put on before death.

507
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,559
That is most fitting.

508
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,700
If it were someone already
doomed to an early death,

509
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,559
they should at least be dressed
while the body still retains warmth.

510
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,559
Otherwise,

511
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:21,559
the body stiffens,

512
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,519
the limbs swell,

513
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,720
the hands and feet cramp,

514
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,390
and no matter how fine the clothes,

515
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,799
they will not sit properly.

516
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,680
Also,

517
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,319
for such a burial,
five garments are worn as one set,

518
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,039
with fewer layers below than above.

519
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,920
Most undertakers would miss this.

520
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,290
And this is only the first rite.

521
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,160
For the final rite,

522
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:36,960
the coffin base

523
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,079
must be lined with ash to slow decay.

524
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,960
Please remember this, Commandant.

525
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:43,599
So many rites in Great Tang.

526
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,950
I have learned again today, Master.

527
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,720
This is only a fraction.

528
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,559
For an office like Left Remonstrant,

529
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,240
the burial rules could fill a book.

530
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,680
Without long experience,

531
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,960
these details

532
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,160
are easy to overlook.

533
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:58,200
This...

534
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,490
This does make things difficult.

535
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,480
Great Tang is a land of rites,

536
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,160
and scholars prize

537
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,599
propriety most.

538
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,680
Miss even one point,

539
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,599
Left Remonstrant Wan
would be mocked by his peers.

540
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:12,880
Your Highness, let us go.

541
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,950
We should not disturb
Commandant Zhao any further.

542
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:18,519
Wait.

543
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,710
Please allow the Princess Consort
to oversee the burial.

544
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,960
Her duties are already heavy...

545
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,240
I thank the Princess Consort.

546
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,759
By custom,

547
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,640
the deceased
should be dressed by family.

548
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,119
Chen Feng.

549
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,400
Go to the West Market
and buy the finest burial clothes.

550
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,799
Yes.

551
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,440
When Wan Qianshan died,

552
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,519
there must have been strangers
in the Music Office.

553
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,200
But the battle songs were playing,

554
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,160
everyone was singing along,
the place in an uproar.

555
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,490
We could not account for everyone.

556
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,599
Now I see it clearly.

557
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,039
This Music Office

558
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,440
is bad luck for us.

559
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,680
Every visit

560
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,759
means more trouble.

561
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:28,880
Your Highness.

562
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,890
The Princess Consort has examined
Wan Qianshan's clothes.

563
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,290
She asked me to deliver the report.

564
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:33,880
Where is she?

565
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,400
She said she handled
the deceased's clothing

566
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:38,240
and feared possible contamination.

567
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,610
She went to bathe and change,

568
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,940
and will stay elsewhere tonight.

569
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,390
She asked Your Highness to rest.

570
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,880
I will go see her.

571
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,440
You will not.

572
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,400
You know your own condition.

573
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,039
You are weaker than most.

574
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,359
Chu Chu handled this well.

575
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,000
She is experienced with such matters.

576
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,400
Do not involve yourself further.

577
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,880
Lately, I have truly lost my footing.

578
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,240
Your Highness.

579
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,599
That is where you are wrong.

580
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,119
Just because Chu Chu
keeps calling you the Handsome Judge,

581
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,960
does not mean you are immortal.

582
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,359
You care for Chu Chu.

583
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,640
Being stirred by joy
and sorrow is only natural.

584
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,720
If anything, these past three years

585
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,039
you have felt more alive.

586
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,279
You are starting
to resemble Senior Jing.

587
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,920
You

588
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,240
always take everything onto yourself.

589
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,440
You carried me, carried Leng Yue
and the Three Judicial Offices,

590
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,880
carried the injustice
of the Prince Consort.

591
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,519
Now even Chu Chu is not enough,

592
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,599
you want to shoulder all of Great Tang.

593
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,079
Why can you not

594
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:52,920
set us down beside you instead?

595
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,920
You must trust us.

596
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:58,400
We can be your strength,
not your burden.

597
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,279
I have never seen you as a burden.

598
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:04,839
Thank you.

599
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,039
You pulled me out of my own dead end.

600
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,319
No need for thanks.

601
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,319
If you insist,

602
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
return the silver you won from me.

603
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,119
Get lost.

604
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,200
About this matter,

605
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,880
was it Peacock again?

606
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,400
We have no word yet.

607
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,000
It is not certain.

608
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,000
If it is him again,

609
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,359
he is growing bolder by the day.

610
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:47,799
He keeps digging the pit deeper.

611
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,480
If he slips away in the dark,

612
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,079
will he leave us to fill it?

613
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,890
Any movement
at the Three Judicial Offices?

614
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,519
Zhao Fengming insisted on burial.

615
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,480
Xiao Jinyu had no choice
but to release the body.

616
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,799
There is nothing else for now.

617
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,839
In that case,

618
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,599
this misfortune
may yet work in our favor.

619
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,190
Then we should press on
while the momentum is still with us.

620
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,160
Move quickly.

621
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,319
Your Highness.

622
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,519
Chu Chu, coroner
of the Three Judicial Offices,

623
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:25,759
knowingly broke the law.

624
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,119
What is her crime?

625
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:28,480
I...

626
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,079
What did I do wrong?

627
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,839
We agreed to hide nothing.

628
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,200
To be honest with each other.

629
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,759
Yet you kept the rumors from me.

630
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,599
Is that not breaking the law?

631
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,960
So you do care about this.

632
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,839
I care about you.

633
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:43,960
Come.

634
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,279
Sit and eat something.

635
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,359
At first,

636
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,000
I was a little upset.

637
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,119
But one thing followed another,

638
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:56,599
and I forgot before I knew it.

639
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,290
Once I was back,
I was busy with the autopsy,

640
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,680
and had no time for rumors.

641
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:01,559
Thinking about it now,

642
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,119
those wagging tongues together

643
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,079
matter far less than examining a body.

644
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:08,519
Chu Chu,

645
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,880
you are a lone tree in the open wilds,

646
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,400
meant for a wider sky.

647
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:15,240
Rest assured.

648
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,359
I will get to the bottom of this.

649
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,359
A strong tree

650
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,400
fears no wind or rain,

651
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,480
but it should not be gnawed by locusts.

652
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,359
Where did you learn to say that?

653
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,359
Thank you.

654
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:30,400
Eat.

655
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,039
Here.

656
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,720
But still,

657
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,799
given my past conflict
with Wan Qianshan,

658
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,580
is it right for me
to keep investigating his case?

659
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,319
Do you think there is more to uncover?

660
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,759
The course of Wan Qianshan's illness

661
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,079
does not quite add up.

662
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,359
How so?

663
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,480
Though he was drunk,

664
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,470
there were no signs of death
from heavy drinking.

665
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,839
If he truly died
from a flare of syphilis infection,

666
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,599
the sores on his body

667
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,680
were only newly formed.

668
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,160
They were not severe enough
for alcohol to trigger death.

669
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,359
So,

670
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,160
there is only one possibility left.

671
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:09,799
What is it?

672
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,990
The medicine
he used to treat syphilis infection.

673
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,759
None of the remedies commonly sold

674
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:18,119
are known to be deadly
when mixed with alcohol.

675
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,559
Unless

676
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,759
someone tampered with his medicine.

677
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,160
Yet on his underclothes,

678
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,680
there were no traces of any ointment.

679
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,450
It is also possible
he never applied medicine at all.

680
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:32,640
But on his outer robe,

681
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,720
I found a small amount of white powder.

682
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,559
Wan Qianshan was upright and strict,

683
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,480
rigid in law and propriety,

684
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:39,319
severe with others,

685
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,799
even more so with himself.

686
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,279
He was not one
to frequent pleasure quarters.

687
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
He may not have even realized

688
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,890
that he had contracted
syphilis infection.

689
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,690
Naturally, he would not
have used medicine.

690
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,640
That is why on his undergarments,

691
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,290
there were no drug stains.

692
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,440
I compared it with

693
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,880
all topical treatments
for syphilis infection on the market.

694
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,799
None come as white powder.

695
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,480
I cannot be certain yet,

696
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,640
but death is not like a lamp going out.

697
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,079
As time passes,

698
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,920
a body continues to change.

699
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,160
And with

700
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:11,519
the heat of the season,

701
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,500
if we do not examine it promptly,

702
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:14,720
many clues

703
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,880
will vanish as the body deteriorates.

704
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:17,920
Do not worry.

705
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,759
I have already sent Jing Yi

706
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:21,720
to review his relatives
and old acquaintances.

707
00:30:22,359 --> 00:30:24,200
If anything suspicious turns up,

708
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,720
there may still be a chance
to bring his body back.

709
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,519
You also find
Wan Qianshan's death suspicious?

710
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,799
More than that.

711
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,920
I suspect his death

712
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,400
is connected to Qinxiang.

713
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,359
Your Highness.

714
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,990
Someone from the palace
summons you and Vice Minister Jing.

715
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:45,680
So early?

716
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,200
What is it about?

717
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,759
Eunuch Jin sent word.

718
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,960
It is not good news.

719
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,559
I hear you lot have been obsessed
with the Music Office,

720
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,000
going in and out constantly,

721
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,519
drowning in excess.

722
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,390
Your Majesty,

723
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,400
we went there to investigate...

724
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,519
Enough with the excuses.

725
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,519
The last time you went,
no one was dead yet.

726
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,680
Have you investigated cases for so long

727
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,990
that you are now on speaking terms
with the King of the Hell?

728
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,000
Do deaths now

729
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,720
have to notify you in advance?

730
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
If not for You Chen'an

731
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,400
clarifying matters on your behalf,

732
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:27,519
I would have sent you
to the quarry outside the capital

733
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,799
to break stones for days.

734
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,359
Your Majesty,

735
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,119
during my time
at the Three Judicial Offices,

736
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,359
I have seen with my own eyes
Commandery Prince An,

737
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,590
Vice Minister Jing, and the rest
work without rest,

738
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,490
disciplined and devoted to duty.

739
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,279
I only wish to prevent the innocent
from being wronged.

740
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:44,039
Also,

741
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,519
Chu Chu mentioned yesterday

742
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,880
that Wan Qianshan
may be afflicted with syphilis.

743
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,039
Does she realize

744
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,799
how much turmoil

745
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,519
such careless words can cause?

746
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,470
Your Majesty, Chu Chu was only performing
her duties as a coroner.

747
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,319
I will not hear this.

748
00:31:58,799 --> 00:31:59,599
All I know is

749
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:01,690
overnight the capital
filled with rumors.

750
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,359
They say Chang'an
is a den of false peace,

751
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:06,079
that countless noble houses

752
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,599
harbor unspeakable diseases,
endangering the fate of the realm.

753
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,119
Memorials accusing you
are piling up before me.

754
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,000
Your Majesty.

755
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,359
Syphilis infection is often hidden,

756
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,340
and sufferers tend to conceal it
and avoid treatment,

757
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,300
so it is hard to detect.

758
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,960
Now we have two cases, Qinxiang

759
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,359
and Zhao Senyao,

760
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,559
and one suspected case, Wan Qianshan.

761
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,319
That suggests the illness

762
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,890
is already spreading
through the capital.

763
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,690
If it alerts the public, keeps them wary,

764
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,720
and spares more from harm,

765
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,039
that is a good thing.

766
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,480
Do not argue in circles.

767
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,880
Your Majesty, I believe

768
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,300
Commandery Prince An is right.

769
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,519
Since it has already happened,

770
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,960
we should use this moment

771
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,170
and have the authorities

772
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,990
teach the people how to prevent
and handle syphilis infection.

773
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,120
The more frightened they are,

774
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,319
the more they will remember.

775
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,480
That is not wise.

776
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,759
It would only force the people

777
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,039
to keep quiet even more.

778
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,960
You Chen'an also has a point.

779
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,960
This illness spreads fast.

780
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,039
If we do not purge it,
it will remain a threat.

781
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,680
We must cut it off at the root
to contain it in time.

782
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,150
Then I will return
to the Three Judicial Offices,

783
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,000
weigh it carefully,

784
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:04,839
and draft a plan at once.

785
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:07,880
Jing Yi.

786
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,200
You Chen'an.

787
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:11,039
You two may withdraw.

788
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:11,890
- Yes.
- Yes.

789
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,780
- Young General Zhao.
- Young General Zhao.

790
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,480
You look radiant today.

791
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,039
You must be in high spirits.

792
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,440
Wan Qianshan

793
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,279
was once your peer,

794
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,990
the same year's top civil
and military laureate,

795
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:30,880
yet he

796
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,920
was so self-righteous,

797
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,759
always

798
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
pressing you down.

799
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,759
Who would have thought

800
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,759
he would die first,
struck by syphilis infection.

801
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,799
It is laughable,

802
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,759
utterly laughable.

803
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,240
Young General Zhao
truly has sharp judgment.

804
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,960
No wonder you never thought much of him.

805
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,599
You toil day and night in the army,

806
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,960
serving the country and the people.

807
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:48,880
Unlike him,

808
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,720
all talk.

809
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,640
Exactly.

810
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,400
Is that so?

811
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,780
The Three Judicial Offices
never reached a conclusion.

812
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,390
The Commandery Princess Consort An
only said it was suspected.

813
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,839
So now

814
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,119
you know better
than Commandery Prince An?

815
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,039
With nothing but ears and mouths,

816
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,190
you dare decide Wan Qianshan
died of syphilis infection?

817
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,990
- We just...
- We just...

818
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,920
Let me warn you.

819
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,360
If I hear again that you are spreading
rumors behind backs,

820
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,360
I will break your legs.

821
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

822
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,639
When You Chen'an was here earlier,

823
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,920
you held your tongue.

824
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,800
Do you have more news

825
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,559
to keep me awake at night?

826
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,199
The case of Master Shenguan

827
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,079
may conceal another scheme.

828
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,880
Zhao Senyao was also used as a blade.

829
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,199
You mean

830
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,880
from Master Shenguan,

831
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,000
to Qinxiang,

832
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,559
and then the syphilis infection,

833
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,000
it may all be tied to Nanzhao?

834
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:43,920
Yes.

835
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,920
The person behind this
is extremely careful.

836
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,280
The Three Judicial Offices

837
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,639
have yet to secure solid evidence
or key leads.

838
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,760
To cast such a tightly woven net,

839
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,239
Nanzhao must have planned
this for a long time.

840
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,239
They harass the borders on one front,

841
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,360
while at the same time
operating inside Chang'an.

842
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,910
Their ambitions are considerable.

843
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:11,800
(The map of Great Tang's territory)

844
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,000
Nanzhao's covetous intent
toward Great Tang is obvious.

845
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:17,280
Yet our people of Great Tang

846
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,960
are still dreaming amid past prosperity.

847
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:24,639
Great Tang has gone too long
without a real war.

848
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,239
Veteran generals are dead or wounded,

849
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,280
one after another.

850
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,119
Even with young men
of resolve like Jinli,

851
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:34,239
they still lack battlefield experience.

852
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,159
Your Majesty speaks truly.

853
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,610
My elder brother

854
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,199
shares this concern.

855
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,639
There is one more man

856
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,840
who has fought Nanzhao many times

857
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,159
and knows their tactics well.

858
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,840
Cavalry General,

859
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:49,920
Xie Huaiding.

860
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:52,719
I will issue an edict at once

861
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,840
sending Xie Huaiding

862
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,079
to Jiaozhou.

863
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,520
He will serve as commander in chief,

864
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,880
with Jinli as deputy commander.

865
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,650
That arrangement is sound.

866
00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:02,480
As for you...

867
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,520
Your Majesty,

868
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,679
I lack the strength

869
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:06,760
to carry or lift.

870
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,199
I fear I cannot share Your Majesty's
burdens on the battlefield.

871
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,800
Xiao Jinyu,

872
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,159
who said you were going to war?

873
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,239
I am speaking of Chu Chu.

874
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:23,360
Wan Qianshan may have been rigid,

875
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,639
but Chu Chu has recently

876
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:27,079
caused repeated trouble.

877
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,320
I hope you

878
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,920
will persuade her properly

879
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,580
to leave the Three Judicial Offices.

880
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,920
This is also for her own good.

881
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,159
I understand.

882
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But in my view,

883
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,130
Chu Chu was first appointed
by Your Majesty as a coroner,

884
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,599
and only then became my wife.

885
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,920
As a coroner,
she has fulfilled her duties faithfully.

886
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,719
As the Commandery Princess Consort An,

887
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,490
she shows compassion for the people.

888
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,079
She is a victim of these rumors

889
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,280
and should not have to
pay for them again.

890
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,920
I may not be a good husband,

891
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:58,239
but I cannot fail to be a good superior.

892
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,100
I ask that Your Majesty considers this.

893
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,840
What use is my consideration alone?

894
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,440
If you do not want Chu Chu
standing in the eye of the storm,

895
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,440
then you must think carefully

896
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,679
about how to turn the tide,

897
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:13,559
and how to redirect public opinion.

898
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,880
Yes.

899
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,280
Shopping?

900
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,000
Sure.

901
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,239
Last time, when Leng Yue and I went,

902
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,639
we saw a new pastry shop
open in the East Market.

903
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,280
The line was so long,
so we did not get to buy anything.

904
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,600
This time we can finally try it.

905
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:31,239
What is it?

906
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,790
Why are you looking at me like that?

907
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,760
Actually, today's outing

908
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,679
has another purpose as well.

909
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,280
