00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,800
(After we got married,)

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,200
(both His Highness and I
were busy with official affairs.)

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,559
(After the poison took effect,)

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:18,800
(I finally realized)

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,199
(that I was able to focus on
my career as a coroner)

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,719
(all because of his silent support.)

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,990
(Physician Qi spared no effort
to test the poison himself)

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,719
(since he's a compassionate person.)

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,119
(The antidote will be developed soon.)

10
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,079
(Seeing her sigh of relief,)

11
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,080
(I can only blame myself.)

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,079
(Not only did I fail to protect her,)

13
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:43,000
(but she was also
very worried about me.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,960
(This story is entirely fictional.)

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,640
=Episode 16=

32
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,319
This is Chang Shou's room.

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
There were no discoveries.

34
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,360
I've already asked Chu He.

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,039
He had no idea
what was wrong with Chang Shou.

36
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,970
He was totally clueless.

37
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,159
I also told him

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,639
to keep Chang Shou's case a secret.

39
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,280
The mole,

40
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,439
birthmark,

41
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,719
and your mustache,

42
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,639
all of this was just
a diversion, am I right?

43
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,800
Last year, there was

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,420
already an outbreak
of syphilis infection in Chang'an.

45
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,670
Miss Hua Mei of the Music Office
also contracted the same disease,

46
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,919
yet she unexpectedly cured
the fatal disease.

47
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,039
It wasn't because of
her unique constitution

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,919
or that there was a cure

49
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,439
for syphilis infection.

50
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,120
It was merely an attempt you guys made

51
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,719
for today's scheme.

52
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,319
You disguised yourself

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,080
as a clerk and infiltrated the pharmacy.

54
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,700
You used Qinxiang to spread
a drugged incense among the musicians

55
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,680
so that they could control
the imperial officials.

56
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,120
If anyone refused to yield,

57
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,990
or if any of them needed
to be assassinated,

58
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,279
they'd be poisoned to death.

59
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,000
Both Wan Qianshan

60
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,199
and Zhao Fengming

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,920
fell victim to your cruel hands.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,519
You found out about the past
between Qinxiang and Xie Huaiding.

63
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,560
Initially, you wanted
to use the same method

64
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,199
to poison General Xie Huaiding to death.

65
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,660
But it didn't occur to you

66
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,680
that Qinxiang was still in love
with Xie Huaiding

67
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,199
after falling into
the world of prostitution.

68
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,260
You were afraid that the news
might get leaked.

69
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,990
Thus, you had no choice
but to silence her.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
During her desperate struggle,

71
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,360
she left behind
crucial evidence of your crime.

72
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:50,300
Why don't you tell us

73
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,390
that you were scratched
by a cat while you're at it?

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,360
With all this evidence,

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,879
even if there's
no testimony against you,

76
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,560
we can also convict and sentence you.

77
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,279
It's been some days since
you joined the Three Judicial Offices.

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,800
With Peacock's info,

79
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,399
I assume you know
what we're talking about.

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,959
If His Highness instructed me

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,160
to get you out of here
without any injuries,

82
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,800
what do you think he'll think

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,959
and do about it?

84
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,000
You all!

85
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,279
Fine.

86
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,439
People say that
Commandery Prince An is a gentleman.

87
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,480
I never expected you guys

88
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,199
to resort to such underhanded means.

89
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,160
To subdue the enemy without fighting

90
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,639
is the highest form of skill.

91
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,680
How is this considered underhanded?

92
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:43,680
Commandery Prince An,

93
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,800
you found out

94
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,160
about my plot.

95
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,079
That's right.

96
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,480
All of your guesses were on point.

97
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,800
But I'm only responsible
for preparing the poison.

98
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,879
The one who came up with the plot
and issued the order to us

99
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,439
was Peacock.

100
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,360
Who exactly is Peacock?

101
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,920
I don't know.

102
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,519
He was always the one
who contacted us before.

103
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,360
We know nothing about him.

104
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,680
And, he was always wearing a mask

105
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,240
during our encounters.

106
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,079
A mask, huh?

107
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,100
So, you guys only recognized the mask
without recognizing the owner?

108
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,800
That's right.

109
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,959
The design on his mask is unique.

110
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,759
He's the only one who has it.

111
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,759
Tell us, then.

112
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,959
What does the mask look like?

113
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,959
That's right.

114
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,240
It's exactly the same.

115
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,370
Although you cannot be forgiven
for the crime you've committed,

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
you still have a chance to atone for it.

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,959
Try to think about

118
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,120
what else you can do to atone for it.

119
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,680
You'd better be quick.

120
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,759
The ghost guard next door

121
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,790
would love to write us
three masterpieces per day.

122
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
There's one more thing

123
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,000
that the fool has no idea.

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,279
What is it?

125
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,680
Peacock said

126
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,879
that the last target
I should poison to death

127
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,879
is a youngster

128
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,480
in the Three Judicial Offices.

129
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,399
Who is it?

130
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,399
I don't know.

131
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,639
He only instructed me to prepare for it.

132
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,639
He didn't tell me who it was.

133
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,839
Could it be

134
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,680
that they were trying to target you?

135
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,199
There are simply too few leads now.

136
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,759
We can't confirm it.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
Zhao Senyao is responsible for
the appointment and transfer

138
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,550
of military officers
below the eighth rank.

139
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,319
Wan Qianshan has always pushed for war.

140
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,279
A manifesto against Nanzhao

141
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,800
had raised morale significantly.

142
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,000
Zhao Fengming and Xie Huaiding

143
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,199
are both generals to be dispatched
to Jiaozhou to command troops.

144
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,160
All these people

145
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,240
are closely related to the war

146
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,639
between Nanzhao and Great Tang.

147
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,360
If so, you're surely

148
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,839
their next target.

149
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,160
There's another person
who can cause turmoil

150
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,360
in the imperial court.

151
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,519
You Chen'an.

152
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,000
That's right.

153
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,279
It's likely that they'll
kill You Chen'an

154
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,850
and use it as an excuse to initiate war.

155
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,800
No matter how shameless a nation

156
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,220
may be when mobilizing its forces,

157
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,759
it will always find
a seemingly legitimate reason.

158
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,600
If You Chen'an,

159
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,480
the second prince of Nanzhao,

160
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,319
died suddenly in Great Tang
at a time when relations

161
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,680
between the two states are this tense,

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,860
Nanzhao will have
a perfectly legitimate reason

163
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,480
to declare war against us.

164
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,799
You must immediately assign
additional personnel

165
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,480
to ensure You Chen'an's safety.

166
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,720
Yes, sir.

167
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,840
Actually, I might be at risk as well.

168
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,080
Nanzhao didn't designate
their target after all.

169
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:42,519
What if it's me?

170
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,770
Is this even a good thing?

171
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,540
Why are you trying
to take it upon yourself?

172
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,559
Jing Yi is right.

173
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,320
Peacock is unpredictable.

174
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,440
Any oversight

175
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:51,639
could become the reason

176
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,120
he takes down Great Tang.

177
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,360
Therefore, it's not just us.

178
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,639
Everyone in the Three Judicial Offices
must heighten their alertness.

179
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,840
Peacock didn't let me down.

180
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,159
Now, there's only one step left

181
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,720
before we reel in the net.

182
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,679
My King, it's because
you have discerning eyes.

183
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,960
The delegation has
stayed in Chang'an long enough.

184
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,240
Relay my order.

185
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,159
Tell Gao Luoqian
to take You Chen'an with him

186
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,679
and prepare to withdraw.

187
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,919
My King.

188
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,879
There's no issue if it's Lord Gao alone.

189
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,919
But I'm afraid Great Tang
won't let His Highness go that easily.

190
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,879
Even better.

191
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,200
With that, I have a reason
to attack Jiaozhou

192
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,519
and take down Great Tang!

193
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,759
I just fear that the current
feeble Great Tang

194
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,679
doesn't dare to challenge me.

195
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:52,900
(Dynasty For the Ages)

196
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,440
(Gao Yunshu,
Eldest Princess Consort of Nanzhao)

197
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Where are you going?

198
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,399
Come and eat.

199
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,399
I'm utterly infuriated.

200
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,519
I'm in no mood to eat.

201
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,840
What are you doing?

202
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,240
What's with the tantrum?

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,879
Father is going to summon that brat back.

204
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,960
You mean You Chen'an?

205
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,240
Who else can it be?

206
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,879
He already ran away.
We shouldn't let him return alive.

207
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,120
Just write to my elder brother.

208
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,879
Tell him to deal with You Chen'an.

209
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,039
You're right.

210
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,919
Firstly,

211
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,000
I must station troops at the border

212
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,500
to guard against Great Tang

213
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,759
from making any sudden moves.

214
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,360
Secondly,

215
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,360
even if Gao Luoqian fails,

216
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,919
I can't afford to let
my brother return alive.

217
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,639
Luoqian won't fail.

218
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:43,559
Good.

219
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,320
That's for the best.

220
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,279
Can you join me now?

221
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,240
Yes, my dear.

222
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,799
(My dear Jinyu,
let these words stand in for me.)

223
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,840
(The trip was smooth.
I've already arrived at Jiaozhou.)

224
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,799
(Please don't worry.)

225
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,320
(Lately,)

226
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,519
(while I was patrolling
the border of Nanzhao,)

227
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,970
(I encountered a strange occurrence.)

228
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,960
(I've repeatedly encountered individuals
dressed as Great Tang hunters)

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,590
(moving back and forth through
the mountain forests along the border.)

230
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,720
(Yet these hunters, in their physique,)

231
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,790
- (their movements,)
- Catch up.

232
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,279
(and their constant awareness
of the environment around them,)

233
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,640
(resembled disciplined soldiers
more than ordinary hunters.)

234
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,840
(And, the game on their carts)

235
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,120
(have already given out
a strong rotten odor.)

236
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
(I'm afraid Nanzhao is up to no good.)

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
(I'll continue to investigate them.)

238
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,080
(You may write to me
if you have any info on them)

239
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,840
(while you're in the capital.)

240
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,039
(From Jinli)

241
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,740
(Self-Cultivation to World Order)

242
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,759
I pickled some lotus roots
using our hometown method.

243
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,159
Initially, I was worried

244
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,990
that the climate here
wouldn't be suitable for it.

245
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,759
But I think they look pretty good.

246
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,039
Since Chu Chu is busy,

247
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:33,639
I...

248
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,399
He.

249
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,390
Father relayed an order to me.

250
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,320
I need to return to Nanzhao soon.

251
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,919
Please look after yourself when I'm gone.

252
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,399
Are you sure you're leaving?

253
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,519
The world is vast.

254
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,399
It's not like we won't see
each other again.

255
00:13:58,759 --> 00:13:59,559
I'm just afraid

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,879
that this trip might be my last.

257
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,440
My brother won't let me return home
in one piece.

258
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,960
To me,

259
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,440
this is a trip to the netherworld.

260
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,120
An.

261
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,080
Even if the sky falls,
I'll have your back.

262
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,200
I'll find my brother-in-law

263
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,990
and tell him to escort you
to Nanzhao safely.

264
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,700
No need for that.

265
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,560
Chu, please spare yourself
from the trouble.

266
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
Don't trouble
Commandery Prince An either.

267
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,360
Your Highness,

268
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,559
we've bought everything
according to your list.

269
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,620
As for the rest,
our servants have placed them outside.

270
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,559
This is the list.

271
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,960
Thank you.

272
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,519
An,

273
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
what are you doing?

274
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,380
(100-Year-Old Ginseng, Openwork Box
with Wind Motif, Glazed Glass Vase)

275
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:57,240
These gifts are too valuable.

276
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,519
I'll send them back.

277
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,039
We received a letter from Lord Li.

278
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,639
It's just as you've predicted.

279
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,960
His scouts found out

280
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,120
that You Longsheng has ordered
Gao Luoqian to silence you in Chang'an.

281
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,279
It doesn't matter.

282
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,240
We already have a countermeasure, right?

283
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm just afraid the commotion
might attract too much attention.

284
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:25,480
An,

285
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,399
I've already sent everything back.

286
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
You should keep the list.

287
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,639
He, to prevent my brother
from giving me a hard time,

288
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,480
I need to ask you for a favor.

289
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,279
What is it?

290
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,320
Just tell me.

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,690
Having been in Great Tang
for several months,

292
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,580
Your Majesty,
I thank you for your generosity.

293
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,399
I will always

294
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,759
remember your kindness.

295
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,679
Nanzhao embraced civilization

296
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,039
and sent you all here
to pay homage to our state.

297
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,799
I'm fully aware of your intentions
to maintain peace and friendship.

298
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,240
I've already issued a decree
to send the delegation back.

299
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:14,519
If you need anything,

300
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,410
you may request them
from the Ministry of Rites.

301
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,519
Thank you, Your Majesty.

302
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,000
But I have one more request.

303
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,879
Please grant me your grace.

304
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:22,679
Tell me.

305
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,960
Commandery Prince An
treated me graciously

306
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,080
while I was in
the Three Judicial Offices.

307
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,600
But now, he's seriously ill.

308
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,080
I have no way to repay his favor.

309
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,519
Therefore, I was thinking

310
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,590
that I should head
to Weiguo Temple for a three-day fast.

311
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,090
I would like to beseech the divine

312
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,120
to bless his health

313
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:42,840
and add years to your life
as well, Your Majesty.

314
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,519
I appreciate it.

315
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,130
But after the diagnoses
of several imperial physicians,

316
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,120
we've already confirmed

317
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,840
that his condition was misdiagnosed.

318
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,039
It was merely because
this summer was too hot.

319
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,120
Commandery Prince An
had overworked himself,

320
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,000
causing him to have some rashes.

321
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,650
Since that's the case,

322
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,840
I can rest at ease now.

323
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,359
Here,

324
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,039
I have profound gratitude
toward you, Your Majesty.

325
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:10,839
This prayer ceremony

326
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,599
is also intended as a gesture
of gratitude to you and your people.

327
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,690
It's good that an envoy like you is
trying to observe the pilgrimage fast.

328
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,839
I just don't know
if the Ministry of Rites

329
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
has arranged for that.

330
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,100
I don't know if they can make

331
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,039
the appropriate arrangement in time.

332
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,020
Observing the pilgrimage fast
and praying for blessings

333
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:26,799
are more than
just about the ceremony itself.

334
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,160
It's about one's intentions.

335
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,599
I only have the purest of intentions.

336
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,340
And, Your Majesty,
there's no need to trouble yourself

337
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,839
for the arrangements.

338
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,359
I'll be fine at the temple alone.

339
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,079
Reporting in!

340
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,319
Your Majesty,

341
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,359
Commandery Prince An seeks an audience.

342
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,759
Summon him.

343
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,400
Your Majesty,

344
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,400
my attempt to proceed with
the prayer ceremony

345
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,390
is indeed motivated
by a personal desire of mine.

346
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:52,960
What is it?

347
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,039
Master Shenguan

348
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,039
is an eminent monk of Nanzhao.

349
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,680
However, he was murdered

350
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,319
in Great Tang.

351
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,440
His devout followers
in Nanzhao couldn't bear the pain

352
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,700
and couldn't get over his death.

353
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,119
This prayer ceremony

354
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:08,400
is to perform a memorial service
for Master Shenguan

355
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,119
and comfort his faithful followers
in Nanzhao.

356
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,519
Your Highness, I can see your sincerity.

357
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,990
Why don't I bring the guards
of the Three Judicial Offices along?

358
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,350
So we can look out for each other.

359
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,920
Commandery Prince An.

360
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,480
I knew that you were busy with work

361
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,720
while I was in
the Three Judicial Offices.

362
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:28,160
Moreover,

363
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,319
you haven't fully recovered yet.

364
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,890
You shouldn't trouble yourself.

365
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,359
Your Highness, since you're doing this
to quell criticism

366
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,200
and eliminate public resentment,

367
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,920
naturally, our state
contribute to it as well.

368
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,759
When I was outside the hall,

369
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:43,960
I heard that you wanted
to chant sutras for me

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,780
to help me ward off calamities
and prolong my life.

371
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:48,799
I'm deeply grateful
for your sincere devotion.

372
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,160
Your Majesty,

373
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,880
I'm willing to head to Weiguo Temple
as our representative with His Highness

374
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,480
to pay homage to Master Shenguan

375
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,039
to demonstrate your goodwill.

376
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,880
Permission granted.

377
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,920
You two are perfectly united,
like a pair of jade and gold.

378
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,160
This is precisely why Great Tang
and Nanzhao established a friendly tie.

379
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

380
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,519
If so,

381
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,920
let me thank you, Commandery Prince An.

382
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:19,960
I shall take my leave.

383
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,640
Jinyu,

384
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:37,079
you came here
before I even summoned you.

385
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,319
It seems you understood my intention.

386
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,240
Your Majesty,

387
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,440
I'm aware that many envoys
of Nanzhao are leaving.

388
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:45,880
It seems there's an even
greater scheme afoot.

389
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,039
And, my brother wrote to me

390
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,950
that strange occurrences
have recently been frequent

391
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,670
along the border between
Jiaozhou and Nanzhao.

392
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,400
So,

393
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,000
are you heading to the temple
with You Chen'an

394
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,440
to investigate the case?

395
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:56,920
Indeed.

396
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,400
I intend to use the three-day retreat

397
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,920
to go over every detail with You Chen'an

398
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
and expose every hidden scheme

399
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
lurking in the shadows.

400
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,640
Excellent.

401
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,519
The blooming flowers look gorgeous.

402
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,759
I was too busy this summer.

403
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,640
I didn't even have time to admire it.

404
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:27,839
Close your eyes.

405
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:31,960
What are we doing?

406
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,279
Just close your eyes.

407
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,720
I'll hold your hands.

408
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:46,880
Sit down.

409
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,440
Open your eyes on the count of three.

410
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,559
One,

411
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,680
two,

412
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,599
three.

413
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,559
It's so beautiful.

414
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,640
You said you had
urgent matters to attend to.

415
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,920
You didn't even come back for dinner.

416
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,759
So you went out
to catch these fireflies, huh?

417
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,480
Do you like them?

418
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:28,720
I do.

419
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,160
They feel so endearing to me.

420
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,559
It felt like I was back at Qianzhou.

421
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,359
I hear there are lots
of fireflies on summer nights

422
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,880
in the southwestern mountain regions.

423
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,790
But there aren't
that many fireflies in Chang'an.

424
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:42,680
I was thinking
that it must've been some time

425
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,920
you've admired such a view.

426
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,960
Thus, I ran to several spots
and caught them for you.

427
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,480
Do you know which place
has the most fireflies?

428
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,119
The forest.

429
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:54,720
It's the mass grave.

430
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:58,640
In the past,

431
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,240
when I was back at Qianzhou,

432
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,119
I would secretly slip off
to the mass grave to examine corpses.

433
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,720
And, plenty of fireflies
would keep me company.

434
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,160
It was as if they were telling me

435
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,240
to hang in there.

436
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,799
And one day, I would
shine bright as a coroner.

437
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:23,640
If so, you've already achieved it.

438
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,440
Your Highness,

439
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,990
I've already given it some thought.

440
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
I must find my own path

441
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,640
as a coroner.

442
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,440
If such a path doesn't exist,

443
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,319
I'll pave it myself.

444
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,720
If so, let me join you
in paving the path, then.

445
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,920
Thank you.

446
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,759
Thank you for granting me
a piece of night sky where I can shine.

447
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,759
Actually, the night sky did nothing.

448
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,200
It's just the fireflies
trying their best to shine.

449
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,640
The night sky is merely
reaping the rewards for free.

450
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,490
But it still hopes
this beam of light will linger longer

451
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,039
than just a fleeting moment
on a summer night,

452
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,960
but rather, through all four seasons

453
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,200
and for all generations to come.

454
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,680
All right.

455
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,870
If so, it shall shine
through all four seasons

456
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,119
and for all generations to come.

457
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,020
♪Like sinking into the deep sea♪

458
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,780
♪The first breath upon awakening♪

459
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,300
♪This bond will never waver♪

460
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,780
♪So we stay together
till our hair turns white♪

461
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,799
What is this?

462
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,839
These are the ledgers of my residence
and the key to my treasury.

463
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,559
Your Highness, this won't do.

464
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,390
Wasn't everything
agreed upon at our wedding?

465
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,359
I can't figure

466
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,119
these things out at all.

467
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,759
Your bookkeepers and stewards
are doing just fine, right?

468
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,079
Listen,

469
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,119
if you leave me in charge of them,

470
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,559
we'll be left with nothing to eat.

471
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,360
I'm not telling you
to be in charge of them.

472
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,490
You should take a look first.

473
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:02,559
Look at what?

474
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
Is your household running out of money?

475
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't have too much.

476
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,759
You call this not too much?

477
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,160
Is it enough?

478
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,440
Enough for what?

479
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:23,519
I suppose it's a bit lacking.

480
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,400
That's not what I mean.

481
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,680
I mean,

482
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,680
what are you trying to do
with all this money?

483
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:35,319
I took my friend's advice.

484
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,720
After we got married,

485
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,039
your title
as the Commandery Princess Consort An

486
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,359
has given you
more restraints than luxury.

487
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,000
I wasn't able to provide you
with a peaceful and luxurious life.

488
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,359
And, telling you sorry alone

489
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,599
can't represent my sincerity.

490
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,640
After much consideration,

491
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,119
I can only use this
to make it up to you.

492
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,559
Please don't refuse it.

493
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,759
Just take it so that I can feel at ease.

494
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,079
But wealth could never reassure me.

495
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,400
It was you.

496
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,440
So,

497
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,079
you must prioritize
your safety above all else.

498
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,759
That's the best thing

499
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,480
you can give me.

500
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:38,860
(Sixiang Chamber)

501
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,440
The fake Zhou Han's base is here, right?

502
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,319
Indeed.

503
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:43,920
According to our informant,

504
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,920
there's going to be
a major move here soon.

505
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,720
The key to weaving baskets
lies in the finishing touches.

506
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
Let's get ourselves a huge catch today.

507
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:21,440
Greetings, sir.

508
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,640
You must be Hawk.

509
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,279
Indeed.

510
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,960
I'll initiate the last step
on Swan Goose's behalf.

511
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,200
If so, about the deadline...

512
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,519
Who are you all?

513
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,160
You must be Peacock.

514
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,319
Chu He?

515
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:57,799
You're Peacock?

516
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:08,200
Your Highness,
I know you're heading to Weiguo Temple.

517
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,630
I didn't want to bother you
at such a late hour.

518
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,990
You wouldn't come to me at this hour
if it weren't urgent.

519
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
What happened?

520
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,880
Is Chu Chu asleep?

521
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,200
Yes.

522
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:17,400
What's the matter?

523
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,319
We captured Peacock.

524
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:20,400
It's actually Chu He.

525
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,519
Tell me the details.

526
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,079
We captured him

527
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,920
while he was meeting his associate.

528
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,359
The mask and the pattern on it
all match up perfectly.

529
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,480
I captured him on the spot.

530
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,720
But he refused to say

531
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,000
what he was going to do

532
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,519
or when he arrived.

533
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,880
Chu He?

534
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,799
Peacock?

535
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,599
Judging from the info we received,

536
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,720
Chu He practically knew nothing.

537
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,280
It was more like he was used.

538
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,119
But he refused to tell us anything.

539
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,960
Therefore, what lies ahead

540
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,079
still remains to be seen.

541
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,480
If they wish to target
the Three Judicial Offices,

542
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,319
Chu He will be their best candidate
to infiltrate our ranks,

543
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,340
since he doesn't belong
to the imperial court,

544
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,480
and he's close with our men.

545
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,759
Right now, Peacock's identity
is no longer important.

546
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,240
What's important

547
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,480
is that we must find out
about their next step.

548
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,750
If so, will you still be heading
to Weiguo Temple tomorrow?

549
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,279
I have to.

550
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,319
We're already in the thick of it.

551
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,980
We're in the light while our foes
are lurking in the dark.

552
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,559
They'll surface soon.

553
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:33,559
We have to give them one last push
and force them to appear

554
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,000
for us to stand a chance to win.

555
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,260
If so, what should we do about Chu He?

556
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,920
Chu He's capture

557
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,079
must be kept a secret.

558
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,559
Do not let anyone know.

559
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:45,920
Make the situation messy
and hard to read.

560
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,200
We mustn't let them
know about our every plan.

561
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,640
If so, what should we do about Chu Chu?

562
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,799
Since they chose Chu He,

563
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,319
their next immediate target
must be Chu Chu.

564
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,990
You and Leng Yue should serve
as her personal bodyguards

565
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,700
so that no one can
take advantage of the situation.

566
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,200
We'll keep guard over her all the time.

567
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,090
We won't give them
any opportunities to strike.

568
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,519
Sir, we've received a letter
from Eldest Prince.

569
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,180
(You Chen'an has been in the capital
for a long time, yet he hasn't died.)

570
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:15,500
(I cannot sleep or eat. You Longsheng.)

571
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:16,960
What a fool.

572
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I can't figure it out.

573
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,200
How did he get to where he is today?

574
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,720
Sir!

575
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:26,880
Do you know what he said in the letter?

576
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,240
He said,

577
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,440
there are rewards and penalties
to You Chen'an's current assassination.

578
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,119
If I hadn't repeatedly
come up with solutions for him,

579
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,480
he'd never have realized

580
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,680
how many times he'd been
played by You Chen'an.

581
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,480
Sir, please be appeased.

582
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,440
Once Eldest Prince
ascends the throne successfully,

583
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,519
Nanzhao will be yours to rule.

584
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:53,119
Therefore,

585
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,720
this is the best opportunity for us.

586
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,799
You Chen'an

587
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:59,799
just had to go to a temple
and chant sutras there.

588
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:02,640
Even the heavens are siding with me.

589
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,720
However,

590
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,519
Xiao Jinyu is troublesome to deal with.

591
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,400
Xiao Jinyu is here to stir up trouble.

592
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,839
If he dares to do so,

593
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:12,160
we might as well

594
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,440
kill two birds with one stone
and get rid of him altogether.

595
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,140
(Weiguo Temple)

596
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,359
Your Highness,

597
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,039
thank you for joining me.

598
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,500
May this journey grant us both

599
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:30,559
what we seek.

600
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,880
Please.

601
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,420
(Weiguo Temple)

602
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,279
Chen Feng?

603
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,000
Your Highness?

604
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,559
You're so early today.

605
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,279
Are there no arrangements
for the Three Judicial Offices today?

606
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,100
It looked like you were free.

607
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,119
Vice Minister Jing said

608
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,400
that we could arrange them
after His Highness's return.

609
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:26,680
If so, could you make a trip for me?

610
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,780
Please tell me, Your Highness.

611
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,280
Go and move all the case files

612
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,950
and materials handled by
the Three Judicial Offices

613
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,119
since the Emperor's birthday

614
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,319
to the Thought Pavilion.

615
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,319
I'll wait for you there.

616
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,200
That's a lot, you know?

617
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,039
Thank you.

618
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:46,640
Your Highness, what's with the sudden urge
to review them?

619
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,790
I have the feeling

620
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,560
that there's more to You Chen'an's
prayer ceremony than meets the eye.

621
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,039
I shall take my leave.

622
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:07,559
So you were hiding in here all along.

623
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,079
What brings you here?

624
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,319
What's that?

625
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,599
I brought you some food.

626
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:12,480
I made it myself.

627
00:33:12,599 --> 00:33:13,640
You made it yourself?

628
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,359
Since when did you learn how to cook?

629
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,279
I picked it up precisely because
I didn't know how to cook.

630
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,519
In the past, you would
rather starve yourself

631
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,630
than enter the kitchen and cook.

632
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,559
What's wrong?

633
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,079
Did Jing Yi make you angry?

634
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,359
Yeah.

635
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,279
I guess I cannot hide anything from you.

636
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,039
I argued with Jing Yi today.

637
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,370
That's why I thought of coming
to seek refuge with you.

638
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,839
You two argued?

639
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,599
For what reason?

640
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:37,640
I had nothing to do today.

641
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,079
Therefore, I wanted to try cooking.

642
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,720
But he said the dishes I made
tasted like melted wax.

643
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,660
I was so angry
that I ran away from home immediately.

644
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,839
Let me try.

645
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,200
This does taste like
something you'll make.

646
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,200
Taste like melted wax, huh?

647
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,260
I think Jing Yi was already
kind enough with his remark.

648
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,400
Chu Chu!

649
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:02,079
I just did it out of kind intentions.

650
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,839
Anyway, I don't feel like seeing him
for the next few days.

651
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:09,400
Can you take me in for a few days?

652
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,320
Of course I can.

653
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,960
It's just that I'm quite busy today.

654
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,039
If you feel bored,

655
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,280
you can take a walk outside.

656
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,199
It's fine.

657
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,840
I'll stay here and keep you company.

658
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,000
That'll do too.

659
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,960
I'll proceed, then.

660
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,840
Does it taste that bad?

661
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,039
Commandery Prince An?

662
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,079
This tea is freshly brewed.

663
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:03,760
Have a seat.

664
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,880
I brought some of
this year's new tea from my residence.

665
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,079
And, I requested
Master Wunian to brew it for me.

666
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,760
Would you care to join me?

667
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,890
I will gladly oblige.

668
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,159
Please.

669
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,500
Dear guests, please enjoy your tea.

670
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,000
I shall take my leave first.

671
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:24,960
Thank you.

672
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,519
Empty days like these are hard to bear.

673
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,250
Why don't we play a round of chess?

674
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:33,880
I shall gladly oblige.

675
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,599
I'll be leaving the capital soon,

676
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,360
yet you came here to join me
for a three-day trip.

677
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,559
Aren't you afraid
that you might be implicated

678
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,100
if someone comes here to take my life?

679
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,199
You Chen'an,

680
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,159
the deadliest lie in the world is when

681
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:00,840
nine out of ten things are true,

682
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,480
and one is false.

683
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,599
It's true that you were hunted.

684
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,920
Your ties with Chu He were true as well.

685
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,679
And, you leaked Gao Luoqian's movements
in order to assist us.

686
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,160
However, as long as
one of your intentions is not pure,

687
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,119
for example,

688
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,400
the reason you approached
the Three Judicial Offices,

689
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,760
all these so-called "truths"

690
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,199
will become terrifying.

691
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,159
Just like this chess game of ours.

692
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,850
The faintest signs
foreshadow what lies ahead.

693
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,480
Before this chess piece is placed,

694
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,800
all is calm and fine.

695
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,079
But once it's placed,

696
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,119
all killing intent is revealed.

697
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,719
If you wish to frame someone,
you can frame them however you like.

698
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,079
Commandery Prince An,
I was pursued by assailants

699
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,480
and almost lost my life

700
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,760
before I arrived at the capital.

701
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,880
Joining the Three Judicial Offices

702
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,280
is merely a way to ensure my safety.

703
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:10,920
You're overthinking it.

704
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,760
If so, did you take out the chart

705
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,199
and attract my attention
and Chu Chu's attention

706
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,239
to ensure your own safety?

707
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,840
What do you think?

708
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,000
The physical appearance of the person
depicted in your chart

709
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,559
bears a striking resemblance to mine.

710
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,100
Anyone with
a basic understanding of coroner's work

711
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,280
can tell at a glance.

712
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,280
Chu Chu has asked you
about it many times,

713
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,880
yet you just played dumb.

714
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:32,880
Firstly,

715
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,039
you did it to incite doubt in me.

716
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,800
You wanted me to suspect
that someone had betrayed me.

717
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,159
Secondly,

718
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:42,000
you did it to shift my attention away.

719
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,159
You wanted me to live in
constant fear of being watched.

720
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,280
And you,

721
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,400
through such means as these,

722
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,519
conceal your actions and intentions.

723
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:54,360
Xiao Jinyu.

724
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,239
I have always been sincere

725
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:01,079
toward you and Chu Chu.

726
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,239
The key characteristic of this poison

727
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,480
is that it causes red sores to appear
within four hours after ingestion.

728
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:15,440
That night,

729
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,320
I brought you a bowl of mung bean soup.

730
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,430
Did anyone come into contact with it
before you brought it to me?

731
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,960
It remained untouched
after Lian Qiao delivered it to me.

732
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:23,760
You Chen'an.

733
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,280
If I tried to avoid suspicion,

734
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,290
it'd make me appear as if
I have a guilty conscience.

735
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,000
Why did you come to me

736
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,990
and enjoy the mung bean soup
with me that night?

737
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,320
Commandery Princess Consort An
brought you the mung bean soup herself.

738
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,159
But now, you're saying
that I used it to poison you?

739
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,880
I even gave you

740
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,079
a prescription, you know?

741
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:48,880
Indeed.

742
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,480
Too bad it was bland and unremarkable.

743
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,320
You were very cautious.

744
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,600
But too much of
a good thing can be bad too.

745
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,320
After you joined
the Three Judicial Offices,

746
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,800
you repeatedly interfered
with our judgment.

747
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,719
You silently influenced
the course of the cases

748
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,679
and the direction of the investigation.

749
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,239
Has Weiguo Temple

750
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,790
signed the relevant documentation

751
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,079
for the examination of the body?

752
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,440
Your Highness,
are you going to perform an autopsy?

753
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:19,119
You're not trying
to seek the truth here.

754
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,870
You're trying to insult
the Buddhist sect of Nanzhao!

755
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,440
Your Highness,

756
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,079
I did allow you to investigate the case.

757
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,159
Even so, you can't just
do this to Master's body!

758
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,920
Why did You Chen'an remind the
Buddhist monks of Nanzhao deliberately

759
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,199
and stop us from performing the autopsy?

760
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,639
I influenced the case?

761
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,880
Could it be that
the Three Judicial Offices

762
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:39,320
doesn't have
a standard operating procedure?

763
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,430
Or are you guys
hiding the truth from the Buddhist monks

764
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:44,960
and bullying them

765
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:46,679
because they're ignorant

766
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,079
about the ways of the world?

767
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,280
If the incision
is made below the left ribs,

768
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,280
the heart can be examined directly.

769
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,320
If so, we can prevent damage
to the eminent monk's body.

770
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,790
This also conforms to the rites
of Nanzhao's Buddhist monks.

771
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,440
There's one more possibility.

772
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,719
The summer in Nanzhao is hot.

773
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,990
The monks here have the habit
of dousing themselves in cold water.

774
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,960
Nanzhao places great importance
on the death of Master Shenguan.

775
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:15,014
How could he make such
a careless mistake

776
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,199
during the body inspection?

777
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,760
Your Majesty,

778
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,280
I think Commandery Prince An has a point.

779
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,719
Since it has already happened,

780
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,140
why don't we grab hold
of the opportunity?

781
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:24,490
The government will take
the initiative to educate

782
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,270
the public on the basics of preventing
and treating syphilis infection.

783
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,840
The more the people panic,
the more they'll remember.

784
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,760
(The suggestions you gave
may seem logical,)

785
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,039
(but in reality, they were
exaggerating the impact of the cases.)

786
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,480
(Your final goal is to...)

787
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,760
To crush the Three Judicial Offices

788
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:43,440
and disrupt the peace of Chang'an.

789
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,390
Commandery Prince An,
you've pinned a lot of blame on me.

790
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,840
I'm just a lowly hostage.
I'm not capable of any of that.

791
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,320
I assume you just want to know about

792
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,239
Nanzhao's next plans and moves
in Great Tang, right?

793
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,960
You could've
gotten straight to the point.

794
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,329
