00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:15,660
(You Chen'an petitioned Your Highness
to enter the Three Judicial Offices.)

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,039
(For this reason, he also presented)

3
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:20,160
(a remarkably delicate
and rare anatomical chart.)

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,760
(The figure depicted within)

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,280
(bore an uncanny resemblance
to Your Highness's features.)

6
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,920
(Before I could trace
the chart's origin,)

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,470
(the one Jing Yi
had long been tracking,)

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,199
(the eminent monk Shenguan of Nanzhao,)

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,520
(suddenly died at Zhao Residence.)

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,159
(The Zhao family
had their misgivings)

11
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:36,960
(and conspired with the monks
to conceal the matter.)

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,359
(Fortunately,)

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,399
(Jing Yi and I saw through it.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

30
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,220
(This story is entirely fictional.)

31
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,440
=Episode 7=

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,439
Sir, something has happened.

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,680
Commandery Prince An found

34
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,420
Master Shenguan's body
in the West Market.

35
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,639
Who?

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,960
Master Shenguan?

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,800
So the martyr was him after all.

38
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,080
Also, the Master's body,
together with several fellow masters,

39
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,190
has been taken by Commandery Prince An
to the Three Judicial Offices.

40
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,240
Just as Peacock foretold,
the opportunity has arrived.

41
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,230
I must enter the palace
to see the Tang Emperor.

42
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,080
Yes.

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,000
Your Highness.

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,480
Have you noticed anything?

45
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,520
One cannot be certain by sight alone.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,039
An autopsy will be necessary.

47
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,520
He is a member of the clergy,

48
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,759
and not a cleric of the Great Tang.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,319
That makes the matter complicated.

50
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,240
Chen Feng.

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,400
Keep watch over the body for me.

52
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,560
No one is to touch it before I return.

53
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,719
Clergy observe many taboos.

54
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,680
I will ask the junior masters
and confirm them.

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,960
If certain taboos
do not affect the examination,

56
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,280
it is better to avoid them.

57
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,700
You believe in such things as well?

58
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,360
I thought that with you,
there were no taboos at all.

59
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,960
It is not that I believe in them.

60
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,280
But examinations

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
are not easily accepted by everyone.

62
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,840
Their master has just passed away,

63
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,960
and they are in deep grief.

64
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,240
If observing these taboos
can ease their sorrow even a little,

65
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,280
and prevent further trouble afterward,

66
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,520
there is no harm in doing so.

67
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:02,719
Understood.

68
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,680
Based on what you have all said,

69
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,280
I do have my doubts.

70
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,740
Therefore, I wish to keep the eminent monk's
remains be kept at the Three Judicial Offices

71
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:10,960
for a thorough investigation.

72
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,439
Very well.

73
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,940
We shall proceed
as Your Highness wishes.

74
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,560
Envoy, you cannot go in.

75
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,820
His Highness is questioning them inside.

76
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,680
I must see him.

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,470
You may not enter now.

78
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,000
Step aside.

79
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,120
I said, step aside.

80
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,040
Step aside!

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,800
You may not enter now.

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,000
Step aside.

83
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,160
Step aside!

84
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,000
Let him in.

85
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,519
Your Highness.

86
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,860
Bringing disciples of the Buddhist order
here for questioning

87
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,680
seems inappropriate.

88
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,920
Once they enter the Great Tang,

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,680
they are bound
by the Tang laws all the same.

90
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,990
This matter involves a criminal case.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,940
There is no alternative.

92
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,100
They are subjects of Nanzhao.

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,040
And the case concerns Master Shenguan.

94
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,160
Should the Nanzhao envoy
not be informed first?

95
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,519
You already know the situation.

96
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,800
As for the case itself,

97
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,680
once a conclusion is reached,

98
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,860
the Three Judicial Offices
will provide an explanation.

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,400
What do you think, Second Prince?

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,320
Your Highness, please reconsider.

101
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,600
If an examination is conducted
before any negotiations,

102
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,959
then Gao Luoqian
will surely go before His Majesty

103
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,519
and accuse the Three Judicial Offices
from top to bottom, inside and out.

104
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,730
Your Highness.

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,110
Do you currently possess

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,360
concrete evidence
that Master Shenguan was murdered?

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,920
Not yet.

108
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,800
It is precisely because Master Shenguan
was a eminent monk of Nanzhao,

109
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,079
yet passed away within the Great Tang,
that I must pursue this to the end.

110
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,830
Otherwise, there will be
no proper explanation to Nanzhao,

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,079
or to the Great Tang.

112
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,720
Then,

113
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,639
has Weiguo Temple

114
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,879
already signed the documents
for the Permit of Autopsy?

115
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,360
Second Prince.

116
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,079
Are you speaking now
as the chief envoy of Nanzhao,

117
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,680
or as a member
of the Three Judicial Offices?

118
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,319
Since you have entered
the Three Judicial Offices,

119
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,959
I will treat you

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
as one of us.

121
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,720
You should likewise regard yourself

122
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,500
as a member
of the Three Judicial Offices.

123
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:13,839
Your Highness.

124
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,199
You intend to conduct an autopsy?

125
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,030
That is the proper procedure
in investigating a case.

126
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,970
How can that be allowed?

127
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,600
According to Second Prince,

128
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,970
we must give our consent
before any examination, is that so?

129
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,120
Yes.

130
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,660
However...

131
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,780
This is absolutely unacceptable.

132
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,940
- You cannot do this.
- Yes.

133
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,190
And this is only them speaking.

134
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,300
Commandery Prince An.

135
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,800
The Great Tang holds Buddhism
in the highest regard.

136
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,519
Nanzhao values it no less, if not more.

137
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,120
If this continues,

138
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,630
it may truly bring consequences
upon you as well.

139
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,110
Commandery Prince An,
it seems you are not seeking the truth,

140
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,740
but deliberately humiliating
the Buddhist order of Nanzhao.

141
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,680
How outrageous.

142
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,740
Our master upheld
pure discipline throughout his life.

143
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,490
As he journeys toward the Pure Land,
his body must not be desecrated.

144
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,460
Your Highness,
I asked you to uncover the truth,

145
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,920
but not at the cost of harming
our master's sacred body.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Exactly.

147
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,780
This is utterly improper.

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,199
Masters, please calm yourselves.

149
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,890
Master Shenguan's body
remains intact for now.

150
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,959
Whatever taboos
the Buddhist order observes,

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,230
so long as they do not affect
the accuracy of the examination,

152
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,279
we can discuss a proper arrangement.

153
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,570
But allow me to say one thing as well.

154
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,160
Protecting Master Shenguan's
remains is important,

155
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,520
yet only by uncovering the truth

156
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,600
can his name truly be cleared.

157
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,519
If the master truly died unjustly,

158
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,439
would you not wish to see
the culprit brought to justice?

159
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,480
Her Highness makes a fair point.

160
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,040
This matter surrounding
our master is indeed suspicious.

161
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,000
An imperial decree has arrived.

162
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,560
By His Majesty's oral command,

163
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,600
Commandery Prince An is summoned
to enter the palace at once.

164
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,560
I receive the decree.

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,279
Wu Jiang.

166
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,830
Guard the master's body carefully.

167
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,680
No one is to touch it before I return.

168
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,600
Yes.

169
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,319
Master Shenguan
was the eminent monk of Nanzhao,

170
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,060
who spread
the Buddhist teachings far and wide,

171
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,260
bringing light across Nanzhao.

172
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,439
Now he has passed away so suddenly.

173
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,120
As the Vice Envoy of Nanzhao,

174
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,439
I must take his remains back

175
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,600
to uncover the truth.

176
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,079
Only then can justice be done
for Nanzhao and for the master.

177
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,959
Yet now the body

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,300
is being withheld without cause
by the Three Judicial Offices.

179
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,600
Could there be
some unspeakable reason behind this?

180
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,959
I beg Your Majesty to render judgment.

181
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,680
Your Majesty.

182
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,199
Xiao Jinyu.

183
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,720
You brought Master Shenguan's body

184
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,200
to the Three Judicial Offices?

185
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,360
Yes.

186
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,100
The incident happened too suddenly.

187
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,240
I fear that the master's death
may conceal another truth.

188
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,399
Another truth...

189
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,559
Has Commandery Prince An
uncovered anything?

190
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,720
There are some leads,

191
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,990
but it is not yet appropriate
to disclose them.

192
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,360
Master Shenguan died suddenly
within the Great Tang.

193
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,220
If it were illness,
that would be acceptable.

194
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,590
But if he was harmed by malicious hands,

195
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,590
then the culprit
must be someone of the Great Tang.

196
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,519
When one's own people judge their own,

197
00:08:58,759 --> 00:08:59,919
where does fairness lie?

198
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,360
Vice Envoy Gao, do not forget

199
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,519
that under Tang laws,

200
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,970
foreign envoys have no authority
to conduct investigations within the Great Tang.

201
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,440
It is precisely because
the master's status is so revered

202
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,990
that the Three Judicial Offices
proceed with such caution.

203
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,360
Commandery Prince An's actions

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,140
amount to diminishing
the sanctity of the eminent monk.

205
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,039
According to
the Buddhist customs of Nanzhao,

206
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,960
within forty nine days
after a senior monk's passing,

207
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:23,759
the soul has not yet
fully departed from the body.

208
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,720
The body must be kept for seven days,
or up to twenty-one days.

209
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,300
If the remains are handled carelessly,

210
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,960
the master may fall directly
into the three evil paths,

211
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,480
or even be denied rebirth.

212
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,480
How can
the Three Judicial Offices guarantee

213
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:38,420
that the master's body
will be treated with due reverence?

214
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,159
Your Majesty.

215
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,080
Commandery Prince An

216
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,950
has long enjoyed
a reputation for integrity,

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,500
and with the assistance
of the Commandery Princess Consort An,

218
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,519
he will surely safeguard
the master's remains properly,

219
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,080
without violating the pure precepts
of Nanzhao Buddhism.

220
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,080
If Lord Jiang had not mentioned it,

221
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,600
I might not have recalled it.

222
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,960
The Great Tang
esteems ritual and propriety,

223
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,279
yet the Three Judicial Offices
handle cases in ways that defy convention,

224
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,200
even appointing a woman as a coroner.

225
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,720
This time, Your Highness,

226
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,639
do you intend once again
to defy established norms

227
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,790
and have the Princess Consort
conduct the autopsy?

228
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,000
Vice Envoy Gao,
that argument does not hold.

229
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,559
The Commandery Princess Consort An

230
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,690
was specially appointed by His Majesty
to serve in the Three Judicial Offices.

231
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,799
She is, without question,
the foremost coroner of the Great Tang.

232
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,759
Having the Princess Consort
personally examine Master Shenguan

233
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,240
only further demonstrates

234
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:34,919
how seriously Commandery Prince An
takes this case.

235
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,399
If I may speak plainly,

236
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,519
Master Shenguan
observed pure discipline in life.

237
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,519
How can his remains be handled
at will by a woman?

238
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,399
Would not
the master's lifelong reputation

239
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,919
be stained by this?

240
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,090
Lord Gao, choose your words carefully.

241
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,400
Chu Chu has worked
with me to solve many difficult cases,

242
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,070
safeguarding the peace
of the Great Tang.

243
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,200
Her talent rivals any man's.

244
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,759
As an envoy, you should not
speak of her so lightly.

245
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,679
One phrase of praise
from Commandery Prince An

246
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,639
cannot silence
the voices of all Nanzhao.

247
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,440
The eminent monk's remains

248
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:08,720
are not a tool to prove
the Princess Consort's ability.

249
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,560
Let me ask you, Commandery Prince An.

250
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,440
If something were to go wrong,

251
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,559
and public resentment were to rise,

252
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,399
could the Princess Consort
bear that responsibility?

253
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:25,720
Enough.

254
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,399
Both of you raise valid points.

255
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,200
This concerns a senior monk of Nanzhao.

256
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,440
Halting the matter halfway
would only invite further criticism.

257
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,200
The case must be investigated,

258
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,390
but the senior monk must also
be treated with due respect.

259
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,080
Xiao Jinyu,

260
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,690
you will personally oversee this matter.

261
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:43,960
One more thing.

262
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
Since this involves Nanzhao customs,

263
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,879
this case

264
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,240
is not to involve Chu Chu.

265
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Do you understand?

266
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,159
Yes.

267
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:00,560
Your Majesty.

268
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,500
What happened today

269
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,159
will soon spread throughout the court.

270
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,420
If Chu Chu withdraws from the case now,

271
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,200
would it not mean that, in the future,

272
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,700
anyone could invoke such groundless
notions of gender propriety

273
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,590
to cast doubt upon her?

274
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,470
I permitted Chu Chu to serve as a coroner
in the Three Judicial Offices

275
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,000
because I value her abilities.

276
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:17,879
But if her ability

277
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,799
cannot outweigh the trouble
she brings to the court,

278
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
then she has failed

279
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,840
both as an official and as a wife.

280
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,950
In that case, I will not allow her
to remain in the Three Judicial Offices.

281
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,399
I understand.

282
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,039
You had better truly understand.

283
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,960
Do not push Chu Chu
into the center of the storm yourself.

284
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,000
Otherwise,

285
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,519
when things collapse,
she will be the first to suffer.

286
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,940
(Clear the Mind and Contemplate the Way)

287
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,080
Your Highness.

288
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,039
Your Highness.

289
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,559
Did His Majesty agree?

290
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,840
Yes.

291
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,420
Your Highness.

292
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,420
What did His Majesty say?

293
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,360
Wu Jiang.

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,480
Summon Chen Er to conduct the autopsy.

295
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,000
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

296
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,679
Chen Er has taken leave.

297
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,290
I am confident that I can protect

298
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,500
the integrity of Master Shenguan's body
to the greatest extent.

299
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:17,120
Let me do it.

300
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,120
How can she touch our master?

301
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,720
Is this not a clear insult to Nanzhao?

302
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:22,759
Exactly.

303
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,360
If Chen Er is absent,
send for another coroner.

304
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,799
Go at once.

305
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,039
Yes.

306
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,519
Your Highness.

307
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,830
Attend to your other duties first.

308
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,759
Say no more.

309
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,039
In the Three Judicial Offices,
you follow my orders.

310
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,000
We have solved so many cases together.

311
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,440
I think

312
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,000
I am actually quite capable.

313
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
Yet they still think I lack ability,

314
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:53,000
that the title of Imperial Coroner

315
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,900
belongs to
the Commandery Princess Consort An,

316
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,799
not to Chu Chu.

317
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,679
I stand ready to obey.

318
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,200
Your Highness.

319
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,399
Think of how to praise Leng Yue and me.

320
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,720
My dear, please.

321
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,390
What is the situation
at the Zhao residence?

322
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:54,320
How should I put it?

323
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,320
Absurd, yet with a hint of sense.

324
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,559
Reasonable on the surface,
but still faintly suspicious.

325
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,639
Madam Zhao was evasive at first,

326
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,480
but after a few words
from Leng Yue and me,

327
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,519
she confessed outright.

328
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,720
Master Shenguan did indeed die

329
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,730
while conducting
a ritual at the Zhao Residence.

330
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,279
Nothing else stands out so far,
except this potted plant.

331
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,759
What is wrong with it?

332
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,399
I cannot say for sure.

333
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,799
It just seems to be growing too lushly,

334
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,200
not like an ordinary plant.

335
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,780
Send it to the evidence room
for examination.

336
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,919
That is strange, Your Highness.

337
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:33,360
Usually,

338
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,960
when I ramble on like this,

339
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,799
you would scold me
or at least glare at me.

340
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,000
Why no reaction today?

341
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,120
If you are idle,
I can assign you more work.

342
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,799
I am not idle.

343
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,039
I am swamped.

344
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,790
I will find someone
to look into the plant.

345
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,200
Leng Yue.

346
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,080
Your Highness.

347
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:58,320
What is wrong?

348
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,559
Did you quarrel with Chu Chu?

349
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,780
(Body Preparation Room)

350
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,380
(Body Preparation Room)

351
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:57,200
Chu Chu.

352
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
You were looking for me?

353
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,720
There is something
I need your help with.

354
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
No need to be formal.

355
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,920
Just say it.

356
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,000
I want to ask you

357
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,160
to conduct the autopsy
on Master Shenguan,

358
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,540
on behalf of the Three Judicial Offices.

359
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,519
You want me

360
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,680
to conduct the autopsy
on Master Shenguan,

361
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,090
on behalf of the Three Judicial Offices?

362
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:21,960
But

363
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,359
I have never examined

364
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,519
a real body before.

365
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,480
I will guide you

366
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,519
through every step.

367
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,160
I have seen you practice.

368
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,920
As long as I explain it clearly,

369
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,720
you can do it.

370
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
I have just acknowledged you
as my mentor,

371
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,790
and you trust me this much already?

372
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,400
You are close with my brother.

373
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,759
Of course I trust you.

374
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,039
Besides,

375
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,119
you are Second Prince of Nanzhao.

376
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,340
If you conduct the autopsy,

377
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,839
they will have far fewer objections.

378
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,759
I have never met someone
so straightforward.

379
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,119
Alright.

380
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,440
I agree.

381
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,980
I will be your hands.

382
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,240
Thank you.

383
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,119
You are right.

384
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,759
The Buddha saves all beings.

385
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,599
A coroner examines death and injury
to bring the truth to light.

386
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,520
That is saving lives too.

387
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,880
I will make preparations.

388
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,519
Chu Chu.

389
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,000
It is not that I doubt you.

390
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,240
But...

391
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:43,880
I understand.

392
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,519
This matter is serious.

393
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,559
You are trying to protect me.

394
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,160
But I am also a member
of the Three Judicial Offices.

395
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,640
Precisely because you are a member,

396
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,880
you need only answer
for the task I assign you.

397
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,039
I am your superior.

398
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,480
It is my duty to bear

399
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,519
all criticism and blame directed
at the Three Judicial Offices.

400
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,680
You speak,

401
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,160
and I will act accordingly.

402
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,640
Begin.

403
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,359
Alright.

404
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,440
First, examine the body surface.

405
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,119
On the body surface,

406
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,930
there are no obvious external injuries.

407
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,500
Use the Yin-yang Pestle
to wipe and examine the mouth and nose.

408
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,799
The mouth and nose are clean.

409
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,330
There are no signs of ingestion.

410
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
However, the complexion
is slightly darkened,

411
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,150
and the lips are purplish.

412
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,519
These are typical signs
of sudden cardiac failure.

413
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,480
According to his disciples' statements,

414
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,359
the deceased had no illness in life.

415
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,960
You Chen'an, prepare for dissection.

416
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,640
Understood.

417
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,960
You truly never give me
a moment's peace.

418
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:27,400
I believe that a joint autopsy conducted
by the Three Judicial Offices

419
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,260
and a representative
of the Nanzhao envoy group

420
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,960
would help ease the impact

421
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,750
of Master Shenguan's death
on both sides.

422
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
And who do you propose?

423
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,160
Gao Luoqian
harbors resentment toward you.

424
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,000
If you choose one of his men,

425
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,079
it will only cause more trouble.

426
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,359
I recommend You Chen'an.

427
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,480
He is the chief envoy of Nanzhao.

428
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,680
His rank surpasses Gao Luoqian's,

429
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,359
so he will not be swayed by him.

430
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,319
At present,

431
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,590
he also relies on the protection
of the Three Judicial Offices,

432
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,279
making him the most suitable choice.

433
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,240
Proceed as you suggest.

434
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,390
Thank you, Your Majesty.

435
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,039
I will take my leave.

436
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,599
Jinyu.

437
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,880
The times are dark and turbulent.

438
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,960
Do not disappoint me.

439
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:15,759
May we begin?

440
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,039
Mm.

441
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:19,759
Go ahead.

442
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,279
First, make an incision at the throat.

443
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:23,839
At the throat?

444
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,480
What is it?

445
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,839
Is there a problem?

446
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,599
Not exactly.

447
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,880
If we enter
through the left intercostal space,

448
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,079
we can examine the heart directly.

449
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,920
That would better preserve
the eminent monk's appearance.

450
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
It also accords
with Nanzhao Buddhist rites.

451
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:44,839
Mm.

452
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:48,660
(Three Judicial Offices)

453
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,510
The back shows signs of bluing.

454
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:02,599
Clear

455
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,880
postmortem blood pooling
is visible on the back.

456
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,839
The cardiac vessels are congested
with marked swelling.

457
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,119
All findings are consistent

458
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,690
with death caused by cardiac failure.

459
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:13,720
No prior illness,

460
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,559
yet sudden cardiac failure.

461
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,680
The most likely causes

462
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,400
would be heavy drinking and overeating,

463
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,759
or prolonged exhaustion and stress,

464
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,119
and similar harmful habits.

465
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,880
But monastic life

466
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,759
follows very strict rules.

467
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,519
There is another possibility.

468
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,559
Nanzhao summers are extremely hot.

469
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,599
Monks often bathe in cold water.

470
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,160
With the heat at its peak now,

471
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,480
sudden changes in temperature,

472
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,200
combined with Master Shenguan

473
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,839
being unaccustomed to a new place,

474
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,880
and performing
multiple rituals each day,

475
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,079
under constant strain,

476
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,119
could easily trigger a heart condition.

477
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,920
It was never a criminal case.

478
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,759
If I had thought further,

479
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,370
perhaps an autopsy
would not have been needed,

480
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,000
and the master would not bear that scar.

481
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
You are a coroner,

482
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,559
not a prophet.

483
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,400
You cannot foresee everything.

484
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,960
Then this conclusion,

485
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,559
how will His Highness
answer to Gao Luoqian,

486
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,799
especially now that you are involved?

487
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,170
Your Highness.

488
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,200
Second Prince.

489
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,580
His Majesty has issued an order.

490
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,640
Master Shenguan's remains

491
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,630
are to be examined jointly by
the Three Judicial Offices and Nanzhao.

492
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,430
Nanzhao will be represented
by Second Prince.

493
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,290
Both sides shall issue

494
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,590
a joint examination certificate
with no objections raised.

495
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,160
With His Majesty's decree,

496
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,119
everything is now on firm ground.

497
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:32,640
Gao Luoqian and the others

498
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
will no longer target you.

499
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,100
You really are impressive.

500
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,160
You saw this coming.

501
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,480
He has been chanting sutras here
for Master Shenguan

502
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:51,880
for six full hours.

503
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,799
He is an orphan as well.

504
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,799
Master Shenguan raised him
from childhood.

505
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,039
To him,

506
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:01,160
Master Shenguan was both his master

507
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:02,640
and his father.

508
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,000
Young Master Jing Yuan,

509
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,079
the examination is complete.

510
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,880
You will soon be able
to take Master Shenguan home.

511
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:26,160
The rain is heavy now.

512
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,890
You should return to the temple first.

513
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,079
If you fall ill,

514
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,960
Master Shenguan would be saddened.

515
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,750
Your Highness.

516
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:35,720
Use this.

517
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,240
Let him be.

518
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,119
This is a Buddhist custom.

519
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:47,880
After a senior monk passes,

520
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,079
sutras must be chanted
for forty-nine days

521
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,640
to help him reach the Western Pure Land.

522
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:57,680
Wu Jiang.

523
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,799
From now on, deliver vegetarian meals
to him three times a day.

524
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:01,720
Yes.

525
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,920
Losing his only family,

526
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,500
and then seeing the body examined,

527
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,000
Jing Yuan must be heartbroken.

528
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,039
Those of the Buddhist order

529
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,910
are sensitive about boundaries
between men and women,

530
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,660
so they may harbor
reservations about you.

531
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,200
Please do not take it to heart.

532
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,799
Do not worry.

533
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,630
I will do my best

534
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,390
to stitch Master Shenguan's
body properly.

535
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:50,799
The case file

536
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,480
will be submitted together with yours.

537
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,240
That should keep Gao Luoqian in check,

538
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,119
and ease the pressure on His Highness.

539
00:25:59,440 --> 00:25:59,920
Thank you.

540
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:01,839
Too soon.

541
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,100
There is one more thing.

542
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,790
I almost forgot to give it to you.

543
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,140
(Discern the Bigger Picture
from Small Hints)

544
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,039
This anatomical chart was truly a gift
from the King of Nanzhao?

545
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,599
Yes.

546
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:27,720
Yet even the most experienced coroners
would find it hard to remember

547
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,960
such details of the human body.

548
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,759
Let alone

549
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,839
recording them
with such complete accuracy.

550
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,599
What is it?

551
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,200
Is something wrong?

552
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,279
Nothing is wrong.

553
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:42,920
It is too accurate.

554
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,279
After death,

555
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,839
the skin, hair,

556
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,920
organs, and muscles

557
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,400
change drastically

558
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,880
over time.

559
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,519
Even though

560
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,920
low temperatures and dryness
can slow the process,

561
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,279
within two days,

562
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,079
the organs decay by more than half.

563
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
There is no way such detail
could be reproduced.

564
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:01,920
Unless

565
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,359
the subject was not truly dead.

566
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,319
But...

567
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,119
Perhaps

568
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,279
it was simply

569
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,119
someone examined

570
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:14,559
at the moment of death.

571
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,000
When my father gave it to me,

572
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,680
he said nothing of this.

573
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:22,880
As you know,

574
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,200
as a coroner,

575
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,960
I only grasp the basics.

576
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:27,680
Had you not asked,

577
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,740
I would never have realized
how precious this chart truly is.

578
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,799
I thought I had

579
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,160
improved a great deal,

580
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,500
yet I keep realizing
there is always someone better.

581
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,079
Just this single chart

582
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,200
already leaves me far behind.

583
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,470
Even so, you are
one of the finest coroners

584
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,359
I have ever seen.

585
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,160
I had always been curious.

586
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,000
You were so young,

587
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,440
and you only became a coroner

588
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,880
after entering
the Three Judicial Offices.

589
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,079
When Commandery Prince An
brought you into

590
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,090
the Three Judicial Offices
despite all opposition,

591
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,319
it must have been

592
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,319
because of your diligence and talent.

593
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,400
Not exactly.

594
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,519
The Three Judicial Offices

595
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:05,100
only appoint coroners

596
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,990
who are capable
of bearing the responsibility.

597
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,440
How much I wanted this post,

598
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,720
or how hard I worked for it,

599
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:13,319
has nothing to do
with whether I am qualified.

600
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,839
His Highness protects me

601
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,759
because I serve under him.

602
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,000
And anyone who serves under him

603
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,160
receives the same protection.

604
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,079
That is why

605
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,039
if His Highness ever faces trouble,

606
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,160
everyone under his command

607
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,920
would risk their life for him.

608
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,160
Including me.

609
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,319
What are you doing?

610
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,440
Chu Chu,

611
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,600
there is something about
my experience as a coroner

612
00:28:51,079 --> 00:28:52,440
that I have kept from you.

613
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,599
This is...

614
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:09,720
Judging by the direction of the scars
and the force used,

615
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,680
it looks like
they were caused by a whip.

616
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,880
But an ordinary whip

617
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,640
would not leave scars this wide.

618
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,039
Have you ever kept a cat?

619
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,599
A cat?

620
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,079
I did, back when I was in Qianzhou.

621
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,519
Then you should know

622
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,559
a cat's tongue

623
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,519
is covered in tiny barbs.

624
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:34,759
That whip

625
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,680
was much the same.

626
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,440
Where it struck,

627
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,559
it tore away flesh along with blood.

628
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,759
Before it was used on me,

629
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,960
the whip was soaked in herbal decoctions

630
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,119
to prevent the wounds from festering.

631
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:51,799
Of course,

632
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,640
it also made the pain unbearable.

633
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,720
I did not tell you the truth before

634
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,839
about how I gained
my experience as a coroner.

635
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,160
It all came from what I endured myself.

636
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,200
Endured myself?

637
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,359
I grew up near
the border hunting grounds.

638
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,000
When there was no food,

639
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,319
I fought military hounds for scraps.

640
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,599
If the guards caught me,

641
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,359
a beating was inevitable.

642
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,960
That was how

643
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,960
I survived among beasts.

644
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,400
Stealing food again?

645
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,519
Stealing again?

646
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,599
Stealing again?

647
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,319
That is worse than animals.

648
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,790
The Commandery Princess
Consort An is fierce.

649
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:33,880
That is rare indeed.

650
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,039
After you became Second Prince,

651
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,960
were they terrified?

652
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,519
That title of mine

653
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:43,440
exists in name only.

654
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,100
(Three Judicial Offices)

655
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,960
Your Highness.

656
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,390
Before leaving, Mr. Chu
prepared some hometown dishes for you.

657
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,990
He also warmed ginger soup
to ward off the cold.

658
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,400
Where is His Highness?

659
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:12,799
His Highness...

660
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,519
His Highness sent word

661
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,279
for me to escort you home.

662
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,100
Earlier, His Highness
said he wished to walk alone

663
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:23,240
and told us to take you back.

664
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,759
He came by the autopsy room just now?

665
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,119
He did.

666
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,079
He waited outside
for a while, then left.

667
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,400
Let us go.

668
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:38,270

yet I keep bringing you trouble.

He?

721

Chu.

722
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,920
It's so late. Where have you been?

723
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,679
I brought you something nice.

724
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:10,480
What is it?

725
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,800
Lotus seeds?

726
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,639
Where did you get these?

727
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,119
East of the West Market,

728
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,199
there's a pond.

729
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,559
I picked them fresh for you.

730
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,880
I was wondering
whether lotus seeds in Chang'an

731
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:23,290
taste better than those in Qianzhou.

732
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,320
They're good.

733
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,559
I knew you'd like them.

734
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,890
You've loved these
since you were little.

735
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,119
Chu,

736
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,190
why are you still up so late,

737
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:34,039
standing around here?

738
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,920
I…

739
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,400
I ate too much
and came out to walk it off.

740
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,239
Where is His Highness?

741
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,920
He's staying at
the Three Judicial Offices for work.

742
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,079
Did you argue?

743
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,400
I've heard about what happened lately.

744
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,599
That Xiao Jinyu

745
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,079
put you in an awkward spot in public,

746
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,290
then stayed out all night,
leaving you cold.

747
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,800
Our family may not be wealthy,

748
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,880
but I won't let you suffer like this.

749
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,960
His Highness did that

750
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,719
to spare me unnecessary

751
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
rumors and pressure.

752
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,239
Over the years,
he has offended many people

753
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,360
by pushing legal reforms.

754
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:13,400
Now, because of Master Shenguan,

755
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,159
the Nanzhao envoys are pressing him.

756
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,559
He doesn't want me dragged into this,

757
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:19,000
so he thought it best

758
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:21,039
that I stay away
from Master Shenguan's case.

759
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Truth is, I understand his intentions.

760
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,960
It just feels a little unfair.

761
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,660
I'm upset that he
doesn't trust me enough.

762
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,199
And I can't help wondering

763
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,079
if I were just a bit more capable,

764
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,440
maybe I could shoulder more for him.

765
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,079
You've already thought it
through so clearly.

766
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,320
Why not talk to him openly?

767
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,079
That makes sense in theory,

768
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,920
but some things
he has to realize himself.

769
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,780
So the real point
is the second part, right?

770
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,620

771
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,140
