1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,080
(My illness was ultimately reported
before His Majesty.)

2
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,690
(The Three Judicial Offices were thrust
straight into the eye of the storm.)

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,230
(Fortunately, Chu Chu
confirmed through an autopsy)

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,920
(that my condition,)

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,920
(like Wan Qianshan)

6
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,879
(and Zhao Fengming,
was caused by poisoning,)

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,360
(pulling the Three Judicial Offices
back from the brink.)

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,880
(Yet the source
of the poison remains unknown.)

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,300
(And the enemy's poisoned hand)

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,640
(has already reached toward
the pillars of the realm,)

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
(General Xie Huaiding.)

=The Imperial Coroner S2=
(Adapted from Idle Girl's The Constable's Wife)

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,960
(This story is entirely fictional.)

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,640
=Episode 15=

30
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,860
The Three Judicial Offices
and the Capital Prefecture

31
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,200
have joined forces to investigate.

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,439
That mother and her daughter were used.

33
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,080
By the time we found them,

34
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,080
both had already been silenced.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,159
Such a tightly linked scheme

36
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,800
suggests that Jiaozhou

37
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:36,560
has long been riddled
with their infiltration.

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,800
Nanzhao has coveted Jiaozhou

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,159
for a very long time.

40
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,639
Unable to confront Great Tang head-on,

41
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,240
they resorted to insidious schemes
to undermine the state.

42
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,319
This plot was laid long ago,

43
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,990
guarding against it proved impossible.

44
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,319
General Xie Huaiding
was a man of unyielding pride.

45
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,400
He fought across the battlefields
and earned illustrious merit.

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,439
In the end,

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,840
he fell to such a despicable
and sinister plot.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,280
Your Majesty.

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,639
The General's death is indeed grievous.

50
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,780
But the sudden deaths
of Wan Qianshan and the others

51
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,120
have left the people of the capital
gripped by fear.

52
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,319
What we have lost is not only a general,

53
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,120
but also morale

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,639
and the people's trust.

55
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,159
Your Highness.

56
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,970
His Majesty has been
unwell these past days.

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,759
You should mind your words.

58
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,520
Jinyu is right.

59
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,759
A thousand-mile dike can collapse
because of an ant hole.

60
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,199
It was my negligence.

61
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,680
I should have taken
your words seriously sooner.

62
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,000
Perhaps the General would not have died.

63
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,759
Investigate.

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,319
You must uncover the truth,
clearly and thoroughly.

65
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,319
Yes.

66
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,800
How is your health?

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,400
The physician and Chu Chu

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,580
are already seeking ways
to help me recuperate.

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
That is good.

70
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,599
Jinyu.

71
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,479
Nothing must happen to you again.

72
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,079
Scutellaria, six qian.

73
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,879
White cardamom, one qian.

74
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,879
Fritillaria, two qian.

75
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,800
This prescription

76
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,360
is balanced and mild.

77
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,519
The formulation is precise.

78
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,199
Yin and yang are in harmony.

79
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,800
All elements work together.

80
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,759
Excellent.

81
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,000
He, you have barely
taken over this pharmacy.

82
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,880
Why are you already
speaking in set phrases?

83
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,040
I can tell it is good medicine.

84
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,040
Physician Qi prepared
this formula with great care.

85
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,150
Of course it is effective.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,560
If His Highness recovers,

87
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,920
wouldn't you be happy too?

88
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,240
Of course.

89
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,670
After these decoctions are finished,

90
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,200
His Highness will recover completely.

91
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,480
Where did Chang Shou go?

92
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,399
Chen Feng.

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,000
Who did this?

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,720
Your Highness.

95
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,519
They are ordinary townsfolk.

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,399
Why?

97
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:44,879
His...

98
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,360
(Three Judicial Offices)
News of His Highness contracting a syphilis infection

99
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,600
somehow spread
through the city overnight.

100
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,800
There are also inexplicable
rumors smearing you and…

101
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,040
Some even say

102
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,519
the General's death

103
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,800
is tied to His Highness.

104
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
The people could not
hold back their anger.

105
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,000
Where is His Highness?

106
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,959
In the Thought Chamber.

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,560
Be careful.

108
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,060
(Three Judicial Offices)

109
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,639
Your Highness.

110
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,079
It has cooled enough now.

111
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,279
It will clear the heat.

112
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,519
Rumors are spreading all over the city.

113
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,820
The area outside the Three Judicial Offices
has been wrecked again.

114
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,260
They are inciting the people
to smear the Three Judicial Offices.

115
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,319
Most of it is groundless rumor.

116
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,759
Not entirely.

117
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,380
The people have lost faith
in the court and its officials

118
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,360
because those officials

119
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,360
have worn down that trust over time.

120
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,360
They failed to reveal the truth

121
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,079
at the very first moment.

122
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,090
Those behind it took advantage of this

123
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,000
to string together farfetched rumors.

124
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,879
Their aim is simply to restrain me

125
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,639
and stop the investigation.

126
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,120
The more they do this,

127
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,800
the closer we are to the truth.

128
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,580
But with things escalating like this,

129
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,639
those at court will seize
the chance to pressure you.

130
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,279
Do not worry.

131
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,600
I will make the culprit

132
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:00,519
answer for his crimes.

133
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,319
I am worried about you.

134
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,040
Drink some tea.

135
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,399
(Refined in Mind and Graceful in Nature)
Commandery Prince An has always been diligent.

136
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
These past days,

137
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,560
it seems

138
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,120
he personally interrogated Senyao
again and again,

139
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,839
and was accidentally infected by Senyao.

140
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,040
This is my fault.

141
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,920
If I had known earlier,

142
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,240
Commandery Prince An

143
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,639
might not have...

144
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,319
It was Zhao Senyao who caused this.

145
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,439
The Three Judicial Offices
were careless.

146
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,600
You are not to blame alone.

147
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,690
Thank you for Your Majesty's leniency.

148
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,160
These past few days,

149
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,160
I have been deeply worried
about the couple.

150
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,800
Princess Xiping is not in Chang'an now.

151
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,079
If Commandery Prince An

152
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,079
were to suffer harm

153
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,480
because of Senyao,

154
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,920
I...

155
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,399
Enough.

156
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,879
Come.

157
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:52,920
Sit down first.

158
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,439
Zhao Senyao is implicated
in a death case,

159
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,279
and he is also infected with syphilis.

160
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,990
Keeping him detained at the
Three Judicial Offices is indeed inappropriate.

161
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,279
Have your sister-in-law take him out,

162
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,560
treat the illness first.

163
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,079
His Majesty
ordered Zhao Senyao released?

164
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,959
His Majesty's meaning is that

165
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,399
Zhao Senyao's illness

166
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,839
could endanger
the health of everyone there,

167
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,759
so before judgment is passed,

168
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,879
he is to return home for treatment.

169
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,000
But

170
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,279
his case is not yet concluded.

171
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,439
His Majesty said

172
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,360
that although Zhao Senyao
may return home,

173
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,080
he must not leave without permission.

174
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,000
If summoned
by the Three Judicial Offices,

175
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,320
he must appear at once.

176
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,240
Otherwise,

177
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,679
the entire Zhao family

178
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,360
will bear responsibility.

179
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,799
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

180
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,679
We will watch Senyao closely.

181
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,600
Nothing will go wrong again.

182
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,759
This…

183
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,039
Your Highness, why press on this matter

184
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,120
without consulting Commandery Prince An?

185
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,519
You need not provoke me with words.

186
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,190
Since this is an imperial order,
it must be obeyed.

187
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,360
I will have Young Master Zhao
released at once.

188
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,759
But please keep a close watch on him.

189
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,279
Naturally.

190
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,879
I played my part well, did I not?

191
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,559
Madam Zhao could not wait

192
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,960
to take Zhao Senyao away.

193
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
Since you step in,

194
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,679
there is no room for error.

195
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,159
What we do next

196
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,559
is wait for the trap to spring.

197
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,559
Why do I run into you two everywhere?

198
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,559
Young Master.

199
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:38,799
Please understand us.

200
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,639
If we let you out today,

201
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,000
then

202
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,559
Madam will take our lives.

203
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,320
Fine.

204
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,480
I will go back.

205
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,919
Come here. I need to talk to you both.

206
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,639
What is it, Young Master?

207
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,679
If I do not get out,

208
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:00,600
I will die.

209
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,200
So he finally could not hold it in.

210
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,399
Go.

211
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,440
Come on, sir.

212
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,480
Get lost!

213
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,600
Who are you? Are you sick?

214
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:28,399
Get lost!

215
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,120
What is wrong with you?

216
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,879
Ghost Guard.

217
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,919
What?

218
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,879
Are you crazy?

219
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,559
Ghost Guard.

220
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,679
Ghost Guard.

221
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,720
Save me.

222
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,480
Ghost Guard.

223
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,000
Ghost Guard.

224
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,919
Where did you go?

225
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,399
Where is the Ghost Guard?

226
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,559
It itches.

227
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,960
It itches so badly.

228
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,759
So itchy.

229
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,639
Itches.

230
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,799
Ghost Guard.

231
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,840
Ghost Guard, I finally found you.

232
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,039
It itches terribly.

233
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,600
Medicine.

234
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,600
Give me the medicine.

235
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,639
I have money.

236
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:17,320
Let me ask you.

237
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,590
Have you been to
the Three Judicial Offices lately?

238
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,080
Yes.

239
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,039
I heard Commandery Prince An
is infected as well.

240
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,440
Will you take his soul or not?

241
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,519
Do I have a chance to outlast him?

242
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,320
Why do you talk so much?

243
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,480
Give me the medicine.

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,279
Hands off. Do not touch me.

245
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,190
Where is the silver?

246
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,759
The silver.

247
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,159
I have silver.

248
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,200
Here.

249
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,559
You sold me out.

250
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,039
Not me.

251
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:48,759
It was you.

252
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,679
So what if it was me?

253
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,080
Zhao Senyao.

254
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,399
You dared defy the imperial order
and go out on your own.

255
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,080
You could not stay at home, could you?

256
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,390
Back to the Three Judicial Offices.

257
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,519
Ghost Guard, save me.

258
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:00,679
Ghost Guard, save me.

259
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,519
Ghost Guard.

260
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,919
I would like to see for myself
what kind of Ghost Guard this is.

261
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,759
Lady Jing.

262
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,679
The one on the hillside with the hoe

263
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,919
is the man you are looking for.

264
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,159
Hyah.

265
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:36,440
Hyah.

266
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,440
Awake now.

267
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,919
This is premium pepper.

268
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,200
It is expensive.

269
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,840
Do not say I treated you poorly.

270
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:59,440
I almost did not
have the heart to tell you.

271
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,440
Two days and two nights without sleep,

272
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,799
and you still would not
utter a single word.

273
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,480
That alone means you are not Zhou Han.

274
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,519
If Zhou Han back then
had even half your resolve,

275
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,080
he would not have lived
to see Commandery Prince An's wedding.

276
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,080
So,

277
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:16,039
a fake can never become real.

278
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,120
Speak.

279
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,870
Vice Minister Jing.

280
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,240
Miss Leng is back.

281
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:27,039
She is finally back.

282
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,799
My dear.

283
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,159
I missed you terribly.

284
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,200
You stink.

285
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,639
All from interrogating
that haunted case.

286
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,919
Who is this?

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,560
Someone His Highness had me bring back.

288
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,480
His name is Laifu.

289
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,919
Laifu?

290
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,879
Here.

291
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:08,799
This…

292
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,120
What is this now?

293
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,440
(Zhou Han, Laifu,
former Shence Army commandant)

294
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,320
Vice Minister Jing.

295
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,159
You do not recognize me?

296
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:18,960
I am Zhou Han.

297
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,759
Zhou…

298
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,000
Han.

299
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:28,799
Your Highness.

300
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,399
I never thought
I would see you all alive.

301
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:32,799
No...

302
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,000
That I would still be alive to see you.

303
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,000
He does look like him.

304
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,080
He really does.

305
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,480
You are truly Zhou Han?

306
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,279
You did not die?

307
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,679
Thanks

308
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:43,159
to Commandery Prince An.

309
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,320
You earned merit
while investigating the treason case,

310
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,870
and you also gave many years
of service to the imperial court.

311
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,399
That is why His Majesty
showed you leniency,

312
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,039
granting you the chance to redeem

313
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,990
yourself through hard labor
at the Refinement Quarry.

314
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,480
Yes.

315
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,039
Yes.

316
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,759
Thank you, His Majesty,

317
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,919
for his grace.

318
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,080
Rise.

319
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,279
You have had a hard journey.

320
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,399
Why be so formal with me?

321
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,919
Had I known this earlier,

322
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,960
I would have just slept instead
of interrogating anyone.

323
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,480
I nearly worked myself to death.

324
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:12,480
Do not worry.

325
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,919
You sharing a room
with him these past two days

326
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,700
was worthwhile.

327
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,600
Laifu,

328
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,639
it suits you better than Zhou Han.

329
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,480
Yes.

330
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,919
Since His Majesty already granted mercy,

331
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,840
why were you still sentenced
to death on record

332
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,200
and ordered to change your name?

333
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,399
I had offended
too many people in the past.

334
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,240
I feared being recognized
at the Refinement Quarry.

335
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,519
For one,

336
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,600
it would put the quarry
and Commandery Prince An

337
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,600
in a difficult position.

338
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,000
So I begged Commandery Prince An

339
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,919
to grant me a chance

340
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,879
to start over completely.

341
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:51,039
His Majesty approved this,

342
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,919
though it was an exceptional measure.

343
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,279
Aside from His Majesty himself,

344
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,200
only a few who handled it
personally know any details.

345
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:57,879
Zhou Han,

346
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,480
before this,

347
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,990
had you ever left the Refinement Quarry?

348
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,639
Your Highness,

349
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,919
I have not taken a single step away.

350
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,320
I swear on my life,

351
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,360
absolutely not.

352
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,480
I have checked.

353
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,240
His work records are the most complete.

354
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,159
And I have worked
the hardest of them all.

355
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,200
After leaving behind
a life of indulgence,

356
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,200
daily labor has made him much sturdier.

357
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,990
Bringing you back
to the capital this time

358
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,080
is a chance
to redeem yourself through merit.

359
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,440
If you handle this well,

360
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,879
your sentence
may be reduced accordingly.

361
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,840
Thank you, Your Highness.

362
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:30,610
Let me ask you.

363
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,919
Do you still have any family at home?

364
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:34,500
Family...

365
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:35,799
Family members.

366
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:38,720
My parents have passed away.

367
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,759
My mother once told me

368
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,600
that I seemed to have a younger brother.

369
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,679
Then many years ago,

370
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,399
when the two of us were still children,

371
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,639
there was a famine.

372
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,000
My mother fled with us.

373
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:55,279
But she could not
raise two children alone.

374
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,559
She said she left my brother

375
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,759
outside this border region,

376
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,159
at the gate of a well off household.

377
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,279
After that, there was no further word.

378
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,559
A younger brother...

379
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,599
You are to wander around this area,

380
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,960
and do exactly as I told you.

381
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,799
Until someone comes to you on their own.

382
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,559
No matter who approaches you,

383
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,039
you must speak with a Nanzhao accent.

384
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,359
Do you understand?

385
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,980
(Music Office)

386
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,759
Sir, come in and have some fun.

387
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,230
Come in and sit for a while.

388
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,680
All these years,

389
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,640
I have not been here.

390
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,079
Everything has changed
beyond recognition.

391
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:57,440
In this quarter,

392
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,920
who would still remember me,
this old general?

393
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,200
Sir, come in and rest for a bit.

394
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,400
I have not been well lately.

395
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,160
Another day.

396
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,039
Then take care.

397
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,799
If I had money,
would I need you to call me?

398
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,000
At a moment like this,

399
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,759
why are you looking for me again?

400
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,480
I did not want this either.

401
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,559
What is wrong with your voice?

402
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,839
Blame the Three Judicial Offices.

403
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,190
They have been watching closely lately,

404
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,799
making a fuss day after day.

405
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,720
On top of that,

406
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
there is this ghost guard job
we are doing.

407
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,590
Sleeping rough and eating on the run,

408
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,400
so,

409
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,119
I caught a chill.

410
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,759
Enough nonsense.

411
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,039
Get to the point.

412
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,279
Well, the medicine,

413
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:05,720
do you still have any?

414
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,799
Could you give me a bit more?

415
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,599
You used it up that fast?

416
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:11,039
Did you take it yourself?

417
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:11,799
No.

418
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,559
That stuff is our tool to make money.

419
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:15,799
Why would I ever take it?

420
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,440
A couple of days ago,

421
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,000
I was careless underfoot,

422
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
and fell into the river.

423
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,160
You fell into the river?

424
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,780
Exactly because I fell into the river,

425
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,559
the medicine was washed away.

426
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,720
That brain of yours,

427
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,279
it is no different from the real one.

428
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,720
Look.

429
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,480
Well,

430
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,599
I brought this on myself.

431
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,559
A chill ruined my voice.

432
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:41,680
Just listen to it.

433
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,519
Get lost.

434
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,640
There are only three pills here.

435
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,640
Take them first for now.

436
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,390
I will bring you more
the day after tomorrow.

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,160
Take care.

438
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,319
I know nothing at all.

439
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,519
I am basically going alone
to bluff the enemy camp.

440
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,720
Even though I am quite clever,

441
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,279
I still feel,

442
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:16,359
at least a little danger.

443
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,880
Would you consider

444
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,000
sending a few more people to protect me?

445
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,519
If you are afraid,

446
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,480
I can send you back
to the Refinement Quarry.

447
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,240
It is safe there.

448
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,119
Lady Jing,

449
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,119
listen to you talking.

450
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,519
I am not afraid.

451
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,119
A full grown man,

452
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,319
loyal and upright,

453
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
if I cannot even handle
such small matters,

454
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,559
how could I help His Highness
shoulder his burdens in the future?

455
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,630
I never imagined that in just
a few days away from the capital,

456
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
so many bizarre things would unfold.

457
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,000
Even this medicine is highly unusual.

458
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,550
I have never encountered anything
like it in the martial world.

459
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,440
Nanzhao truly made a bold move.

460
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:51,690
Your Highness,

461
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,000
why did you not clarify to the public

462
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,839
that this is not a syphilis infection?

463
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,500
The situation is deeply suspicious.

464
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,580
It would be better to wait until Physician Qi
uncovers the truth behind this illness

465
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,690
before deciding our next step.

466
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,710
Have you arranged
the meeting place with him?

467
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,100
Reporting to Your Highness,
I followed your instructions exactly.

468
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:11,700
I told him that

469
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,300
the Three Judicial Offices and the Capital Prefecture
have tightened their investigation recently,

470
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,230
yet precisely because of that,

471
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,980
the most dangerous place,
the Music Office,

472
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,039
has become a blind spot.

473
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,039
Meeting there would be
the safest option.

474
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,039
He agreed.

475
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,980
The next stage will require
more effort from you.

476
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,910
Remain at
the Three Judicial Offices for now

477
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,870
and await further orders.

478
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,359
Yes.

479
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,640
Wu Jiang.

480
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,160
Here.

481
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,160
Let us go.

482
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,000
General Zhou.

483
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,640
Jing Yi, Leng Yue,

484
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,490
it is not appropriate for me
to appear openly at the moment.

485
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,780
The follow up on the ghost guard matter

486
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:38,790
will be entrusted to you.

487
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,380
(Three Judicial Offices)

488
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,640
Over here, Physician Qi.

489
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:46,400
Your Highness.

490
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,799
A breakthrough.

491
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,640
A breakthrough.

492
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,799
Your Highness.

493
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:51,920
Come.

494
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,640
Please have a look.

495
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,000
Your Highness,

496
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,880
at this point,

497
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
we are suffering
from the same condition as you.

498
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,400
What is going on here?

499
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,200
Someone has poisoned the two of you?

500
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,279
Your Highness, please do not panic.

501
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,400
I did it myself.

502
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,559
That medicine is truly unusual.

503
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:14,119
I could not decipher it from the texts.

504
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,039
So I followed the path of Shennong

505
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,319
and tested it on my own body.

506
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,319
Only afterward did I recall

507
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,559
that I had long been
in contact with patients,

508
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,750
which could affect the result.

509
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,440
So I had my disciple

510
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,160
test it as well.

511
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,119
You are advanced in years.

512
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,599
If anything were to happen,

513
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,319
I would never forgive myself.

514
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:34,319
Your Highness need not dwell on it.

515
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,000
For me,

516
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,839
to unravel such a strange poison

517
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,559
within my lifetime

518
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,880
would already make life worthwhile.

519
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,000
The red coating of that pill

520
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,519
is indeed a cooling tonic
that nourishes the heart.

521
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,160
But the white powder inside

522
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,319
when taken at this dosage
for the first time,

523
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:54,799
within four hours,

524
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,440
will cause eruptions like these

525
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,599
that resemble a syphilis infection.

526
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,720
My disciple and I have already
found a direction for the antidote.

527
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,920
Within three days at most,

528
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,799
we will surely discover a cure.

529
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,690
Thank you for your efforts, Physician Qi.

530
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,559
Is there anything I can do?

531
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,039
The key to this poison

532
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,279
is the rash that appears four hours
after ingestion.

533
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,920
I came this time

534
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,519
to ask Your Highness

535
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,960
whether during that period

536
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,119
you consumed anything

537
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:24,519
out of the ordinary.

538
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,590
That night I was in the Thought Chamber.

539
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,240
There was nothing unusual.

540
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:35,480
That…

541
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,119
Does not make sense.

542
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:39,690
Your Highness.

543
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:41,559
What is it?

544
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
Fearing that you and His Highness
might have excess inner heat,

545
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:48,279
I prepared some lily and mung bean soup
and brought it for you both.

546
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:49,200
You may return for now.

547
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,079
I will deliver it to him later.

548
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,640
That night,

549
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,680
I brought you a bowl of mung bean soup.

550
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,119
Mung bean soup?

551
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,720
Nanzhao

552
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,759
has already sunk

553
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,400
its roots in Chang'an.

554
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,079
They are poisoning the court's key men,

555
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,839
and even Xie Huaiding was not spared.

556
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,119
Now the people's hearts are unsteady.

557
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,240
I meant to place you
at General Xie's side,

558
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,480
as his vice general.

559
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:22,640
I beg Your Majesty

560
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,799
to let me take command of the Annan Army

561
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,160
and garrison Jiaozhou,

562
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:27,640
to secure the Southwest.

563
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,160
The King of Nanzhao

564
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,079
covets Jiaozhou's land and supplies.

565
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,519
Their forces alone
cannot match Great Tang.

566
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:37,640
Yet

567
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,480
the unrest in the north is not settled.

568
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,960
They are certain

569
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,839
we cannot afford war on two fronts.

570
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,160
I have hesitated

571
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,440
for one more reason
of the greatest weight.

572
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,260
Please say it, Your Majesty.

573
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,160
The court's strength is thinning.

574
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,359
I need your generation to bear the load.

575
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,000
I want you

576
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,799
to become, as soon as possible,

577
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,480
Great Tang's sharpest weapon.

578
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,200
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

579
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,599
If I am sent to Jiaozhou,

580
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,039
I will stake my life
and not shrink from death.

581
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,039
Jinyu.

582
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:29,839
I heard you
sets out for the frontier today,

583
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,440
so I came to see you off.

584
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,500
I was not trying to keep it from you.

585
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,720
I did not want to hinder your duties.

586
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,400
I know you were sparing me worry.

587
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,680
Truly, it is nothing.

588
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,880
Only that

589
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,440
after so long in Chang'an,

590
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,720
I have begun to miss
the southern air and waters.

591
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,640
You were born for the battlefield.

592
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,200
I hope you will,

593
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,359
amid steel and warhorses,

594
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,400
make your mark at last.

595
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,300
But going to Jiaozhou
is a long road of mountains and rivers.

596
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,880
And the neighboring states
all have their own schemes.

597
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,780
The borderlands
are perilous at every turn.

598
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,119
Jinli, you must be careful.

599
00:25:59,119 --> 00:25:59,839
Do not worry.

600
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,960
I know what I am doing.

601
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,980
You are alone in Chang'an.

602
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,160
Be careful in all things.

603
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,400
I am leaving.

604
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,000
Sir.

605
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,319
It has truly been a long time
since you came.

606
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,839
Second floor, please.

607
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:31,880
Take care.

608
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,400
Come again another day.

609
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,640
Miss.

610
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:42,440
You look very much like
someone I once knew.

611
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,839
Her name is Cuixiang.

612
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,039
Cuixiang, is it?

613
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,039
What fragrance is not fragrance?

614
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,600
Come in and listen to some music, Sir.

615
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:50,039
No.

616
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,079
Another day.

617
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,160
Why another day?

618
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,340
Better today than picking a date.

619
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,039
Today it is.

620
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,640
Another day, I promise.

621
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,240
All right.

622
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,559
Today truly is inconvenient.

623
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,680
How dull.

624
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,759
Go on.

625
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,799
I will remember you, Cuixiang.

626
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,279
Safe travels, Sir.

627
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:20,850
What are you doing?

628
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,519
Do not... Do not grab me.

629
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,160
No, what are you doing?

630
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,279
Lately,

631
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,000
you have become far too forward.

632
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,119
Did I not tell you last time
I fell into the river?

633
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:36,400
I nearly drowned.

634
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,160
But

635
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,119
I figured it out.

636
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
Li Bai wrote a poem, did he not?

637
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,759
When life is good,
one should savor the joy.

638
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,279
Do not let

639
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,240
a golden cup face the moon empty.

640
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,279
He meant that life
should be enjoyed while it can.

641
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,119
Who knows when fate will come knocking?

642
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,559
Right?

643
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,200
Enough.

644
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,319
I will not argue with you.

645
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:06,000
You are only giving this much?

646
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,559
That is not enough?

647
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,359
Do you not have

648
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,039
anything else

649
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,880
to give me?

650
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,240
What more do you want?

651
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,680
Last time,

652
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,599
the drug used to poison Xie Huaiding,

653
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,319
give me a little more of it.

654
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:23,960
Xie Huaiding?

655
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:26,359
You were the one who killed him?

656
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,200
That was my assigned task.

657
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Who ordered you to do it?

658
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,599
Was it not you?

659
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,160
Did I not fall into the river?

660
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,319
I hit my head on a rock.

661
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,039
My memory has been muddled ever since,

662
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,000
all confused.

663
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,480
It is driving me to my grave.

664
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,839
Go find some medicine and take it.

665
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,160
A mistake.

666
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,720
A complete mistake.

667
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,520
Commandery Prince An has been watching
these two tricksters for a long time.

668
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,920
Our luck is excellent today.

669
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,160
We caught them both at once.

670
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,480
We came to investigate
the syphilis infection,

671
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,950
and still stumbled upon an extra prize.

672
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,000
Seems there is
no avoiding merit this time.

673
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,470
Take them back
to the Court of Judicial Review.

674
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

675
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:09,200
Move.

676
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,000
Stay away from me.

677
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,319
You bring nothing but bad luck.

678
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,359
Since it has come to this,

679
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,680
blaming me will not help.

680
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:41,839
What matters now is

681
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,660
that the two of us
think it through quickly,

682
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,720
and get our story straight.

683
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:46,410
When Commandery Prince An arrives,

684
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,519
what should we say?

685
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,440
If we are captured,

686
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,279
the cover story was agreed on long ago.

687
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,119
Have you forgotten?

688
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,839
I remember.

689
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,440
How could I possibly forget?

690
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:00,759
You two there,

691
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,990
why are you standing so close?

692
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:03,400
Open the door.

693
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,640
Let me make this clear.

694
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,750
If either of you dares say another word,

695
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:14,839
I will have you both

696
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:16,920
tied to that chamber pot.

697
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Do you hear me?

698
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,039
We hear you.

699
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,519
Officer,

700
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,759
I am very well behaved.

701
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,759
Extremely well behaved.

702
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:24,960
That is better.

703
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:25,759
You tell me,

704
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,200
others sit in prison and so do you.

705
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,960
You are fed and watered,

706
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
and I still have to wait on you.

707
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,839
Good, is it?

708
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,880
It is good.

709
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:46,640
Good.

710
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:48,519
Then I will reward you
with another bowl.

711
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,640
Thank you, sir.

712
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:54,559
Take care, Officer.

713
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,650
Thank you for your trouble.

714
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,519
Lock it.

715
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:04,440
You are not thirsty?

716
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,279
We have been caught,

717
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,720
and you can still sleep?

718
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:53,680
I fell asleep?

719
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,440
What happened to your throat?

720
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,890
Why does your voice
sound different again?

721
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,640
I caught a chill.

722
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,440
Lost my voice.

723
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,160
Just like that?

724
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,759
You caught a chill so fast?

725
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:18,920
Something is wrong.

726
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,790
Something is wrong.

727
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,400
Who are you, really?

728
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,440
Are you ill?

729
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,160
Answer me.

730
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,599
Where did we come from?

731
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
The camp.

732
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:32,839
What are our code names?

733
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,599
You are Swan Goose.

734
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,839
I am Sparrow.

735
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,160
Every so often
I come to you for medicine,

736
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,640
and swindle money from those fools.

737
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,720
And also,

738
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,160
what drug did you give Xie Huaiding?

739
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,799
That was a direct order issued to me
by Peacock alone.

740
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,039
How did you know that?

741
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,279
Stop playing dumb.

742
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,319
You said it yourself
at the Music Office...

743
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:59,480
You said you saw me outside the cell.

744
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,319
Thanks to Swan Goose
for questioning him for me.

745
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,599
You sold me out?

746
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,640
I sold you out?

747
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,880
That was because of
what you did at the Music Office...

748
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,079
You dare hit me.

749
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,319
Let go.

750
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:21,799
Let go.

751
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:25,440
Let go.

752
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,140
I will kill you.

753
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,359
Let go.

754
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,240
I will kill you.

755
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:29,160
Shut up.

756
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,460
- Too loud.
- Let go.

757
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,240
Enough.

758
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,880
You have had your struggle.

759
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,599
Now get to the point.

760
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,440
To be fair,

761
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,480
I will give you

762
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,920
one chance to turn back.

763
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,359
You are loyal to the end.

764
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,319
A pity.

765
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,799
He already confessed.

766
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:58,440
He said you made money with that face.

767
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,759
Still not convinced?

768
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,000
Peacock ordered you to target those

769
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,960
who believed
they had a syphilis infection,

770
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:07,400
people who recognized your faces.

771
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,199
Tell them you
are underworld ghost guards and that,

772
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,920
for the sake of an old acquaintance,

773
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,360
as long as they have enough money,

774
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,480
they can buy medicine
to extend their yang lifespan.

775
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,960
As long as they keep taking it,
they can keep living, right?

776
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,639
Judging by his reaction,

777
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:24,480
you told the truth.

778
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,079
How dare you.

779
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,320
You said everything.

780
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,599
One last chance.

781
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,159
General Xie Huaiding,

782
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,559
was it you who poisoned him?

783
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,480
It was Peacock.

784
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,199
The order came from Peacock.

785
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,639
The Swan Goose plan failed.

786
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,960
Xie Huaiding had to be handled by you.

787
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,519
After it was done,

788
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,660
Wait for an opportunity
and return to Nanzhao.

789
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,960
I obeyed the order.

790
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,880
The Three Judicial Offices

791
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,119
kept Xie Huaiding
under tight protection.

792
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,119
I had no choice but to gamble
on his arrogance.

793
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,360
I poisoned an apple.

794
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,119
After Xie Huaiding died,

795
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,880
I went back into hiding
at Sixiang Chamber,

796
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,480
trying to gather money
to return to Nanzhao,

797
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,199
but walked straight into your trap.

798
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,880
Who is Peacock?

799
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,480
Peacock...

800
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,320
You despicable man.

801
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,920
Who is Peacock?

802
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,599
Peacock is extremely cautious.

803
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,280
He always met us wearing a mask.

804
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,679
I do not know.

805
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:37,880
Get up.

806
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,239
Move.

807
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,559
Chang Shou.

808
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:50,079
Do you think staying silent

809
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:51,519
means we cannot deal with you?

810
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,719
You hid in a pharmacy for so long.

811
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,920
You don't walk out
of the Three Judicial Offices'

812
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,280
prison beyond saving.

813
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,320
I never expected this.

814
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,360
They planted a spy right
beside my brother-in-law.

815
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,239
A blind spot in plain sight.

816
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,790
They have been operating
in Chang'an for over half a year.

817
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,290
Chu He only recently
took over the pharmacy.

818
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,280
He should know nothing.

819
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,790
Otherwise he would
have told Chu Chu already.

820
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,920
Keep the pharmacy under close watch.

821
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:27,360
Do not alert them.

822
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,360
Chu He does not strike me
as that clever.

823
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,599
Nothing is ever foolproof.

824
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,679
Better to be cautious.

825
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:36,679
This stays between us.

826
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:39,190
You are not telling Chuchu?

827
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,480
She is a coroner.

828
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:41,559
She cannot help for now.

829
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,159
Wait and see.

830
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,199
I mean,

831
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,840
Chu He is already involved.

832
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,320
If you do not tell Chu Chu,

833
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,920
will she be upset?

834
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
You mean this?

835
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,700
When has Chu Chu ever mixed duty
with personal feelings?

836
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,559
It is not that I kept this from her.

837
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,159
This is simply official business.

838
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:00,800
We act as duty requires.

839
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,519
As for whether Chu He
may be implicated later,

840
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,920
setting aside time and circumstance,

841
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:10,079
and all considerations
of those involved,

842
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,519
the likelihood of Chu He being involved

843
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,679
is extremely small.

844
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,320
If that day truly comes,

845
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I will speak with Chu Chu
as her husband,

846
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,280
and settle it as a family matter.

847
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,159
Your Highness draws a clear line
between duty and feeling. I admire that.

848
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,880
If I treated Leng Yue that way...

849
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,559
By the way, Your Highness,
the one we caught today

850
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,079
was only Chang Shou, the supplier.

851
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,679
The man with the birthmark
who stayed in contact with Qinxiang,

852
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,810
is still nowhere to be found.

853
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:40,159
How can someone
with such a striking feature

854
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:41,599
remain unfound?

855
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:42,920
Why is that?

856
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
He is hiding.

857
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,880
We moved quickly,

858
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,440
with eyes everywhere in Chang'an.

859
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,840
He could not vanish without a trace.

860
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,039
Exactly.

861
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,519
People do not disappear into thin air,

862
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,519
nor can they change faces

863
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,360
like street magic,

864
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,119
Disguise.

865
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,559
I will go to the pharmacy,

866
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,440
and check Chang Shou's room.

867
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,239
You question Chu He
when the chance arises.

868
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,439
See if Chang Shou
ever seemed unusual to him.
