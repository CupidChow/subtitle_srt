1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
<i>Episode 5</i>

3
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,520
You need not be nervous.

4
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800
I wasn't going to rebuke you.

5
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,160
I was just asking.

6
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,000
After all, Hua Shen didn't take much money.

7
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,840
Lord, Her Highness sent a message

8
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,160
saying that Master Zhong is here

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,600
and is looking for Mistress.

10
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
All right.

11
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,560
Let's go to my mother's residence.

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mother.

13
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
It's been a long time.

14
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you for the lychee, Mother.

15
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,160
Do they taste good?

16
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
What's wrong?

17
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
Master and Mistress really love each other.

18
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,920
We do envy that.

19
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,840
Senior, I haven't seen you for a long time

20
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,520
and was wondering what you've been up to.

21
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,240
Work has been busy

22
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,160
so I took a break today.

23
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,920
Did someone give you a hard time earlier?

24
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,160
Qian

25
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
why do you keep everything to yourself now?

26
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,440
You used to consult everything with me.

27
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,360
I managed to resolve

28
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,960
Mu Yao's hatred for me

29
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
and she doesn't want to kill me anymore.

30
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,000
However, Lord Zhong who had nothing to do

31
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
with my family before

32
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,760
is beginning to turn against us.

33
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,080
Can the original ending not be altered?

34
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,720
Where did I go wrong this time?

35
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,000
Qian.

36
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Qian.

37
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Qian!

38
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,360
You went into a daze again. Did you hear me?

39
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,040
Sorry.

40
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
The fragrance in here makes me a little dizzy

41
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,920
so I didn't hear you just now.

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,960
There's no fragrance in the carriage.

43
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,800
But I smell it.

44
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
Qian

45
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,280
you seem to have got a lot on your mind

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
after we got married.

47
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,320
You don't have to tell me

48
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,440
what's on your mind.

49
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,120
Just remember that as long as I'm here

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,320
I'll protect you.

51
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
You don't have to go to Mistress

52
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,840
even if you're angry

53
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,000
and don't want to spend time with me.

54
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,640
I won't go to you...

55
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,760
if you don't want me to do that.

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,400
<i>Am I really the one...</i>

57
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,520
<i>you want to protect?</i>

58
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,440
Miss.

59
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,480
It's late. You'd better go to bed.

60
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,120
Miss, your father asked me

61
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,120
about your situation here a few days ago.

62
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,160
Are you my maid

63
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,080
or my father's maid?

64
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,760
I'm your maid, Miss.

65
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,240
Really?

66
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,160
It doesn't seem like that way.

67
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Your father does care about you.

68
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,520
After all, you've been here for many years

69
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,440
and are about to reach the age of marriage.

70
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,760
But you're not close to Her Highness.

71
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,160
I'm afraid

72
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,200
he'll be unhappy about it.

73
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,880
I've lived in Zhong's Garden as he wanted.

74
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,320
Why is he still dissatisfied?

75
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,080
I only know a maid's life

76
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,760
is in the hands of her master.

77
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,440
If they aren't happy

78
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,280
they can beat us

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
or sell us at will.

80
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,400
I get it. You can go now.

81
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm going to bed.

82
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
All right.

83
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,320
Mistress.

84
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
Mistress.

85
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,560
Don't wake me up.

86
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,800
Let me sleep a bit more.

87
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,600
I'm not going to Zhong's Garden today.

88
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,400
What's the matter with you today, Mistress?

89
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,040
Qian Zhi has tried to wake you thrice

90
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,840
and it'll be noon soon.

91
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,760
You should get up.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,200
Oh, no.

93
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,800
You're burning up.

94
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,360
Qianzhi, get a physician.

95
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
All right.

96
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,120
Physician Xia, how's she doing?

97
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,000
Mistress probably caught a cold last night.

98
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,840
I'll prescribe some medicine

99
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,800
and aromatherapy.

100
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,480
It's my fault. I slept like a log

101
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,120
and didn't hear the wind.

102
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I saw the window

103
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,360
in Mistress's room open this morning.

104
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,280
How could you be so careless?

105
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
She's fine.

106
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,840
She only needs to take the medicine.

107
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
All right.

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,840
Be careful not to let her get cold.

109
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,720
This way, please.

110
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,840
Thank you.

111
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,480
I was going to make up some excuse

112
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
but now I have a valid reason

113
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,400
not to go to Zhong's Garden.

114
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,360
If you don't want to go

115
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,040
just don't go, Mistress.

116
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,240
You don't understand.

117
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,040
I go there so often.

118
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,520
If I don't go after what happened yesterday

119
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,920
it'd look very fishy.

120
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,080
What happened yesterday?

121
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
<i>Shende Hall</i>

122
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Master.

123
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,760
Mistress just has a cold and she'll be fine.

124
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,280
I've prescribed some medicine

125
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,760
and she only needs to keep warm.

126
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,240
I see. You may go now.

127
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
I'll take my leave.

128
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Master.

129
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,680
Are you going to see Mistress, Master?

130
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,960
I'd better not bother her now.

131
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,080
Send a message to Hua Residence.

132
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,920
She must want to see her family very much

133
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,080
when she's sick.

134
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
All right.

135
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,720
Mistress, take this before you go to sleep.

136
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,560
Is it too bitter?

137
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
I've prepared preserved fruits for you

138
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,760
Mistress.

139
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,200
No need. This is nothing.

140
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,680
Mistress, Butler Ji is here.

141
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,280
Greetings, Mistress.

142
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,640
What's the matter?

143
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,880
Mistress.

144
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,720
We were short of manpower

145
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,040
and new guards have just been recruited.

146
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,600
Here's the roster.

147
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,360
For your inspection, Mistress.

148
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,640
No need. You're experienced.

149
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,680
Just do it your way.

150
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,760
I'll take my leave then.

151
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,800
Your Highness.

152
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,720
It's already noon.

153
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,040
Why hasn't she come here today?

154
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,520
I sent someone to inquire earlier.

155
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,800
Mistress caught a cold.

156
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,560
A cold?

157
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,120
She must be very sick

158
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,760
because Master had sent for a doctor.

159
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,360
Bring me

160
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,760
the incense beads she sent a few days ago.

161
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
It shouldn't be put away all the time.

162
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,920
By the way

163
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,200
pick some nourishing medicinal herbs

164
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,680
from the storage for her.

165
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,680
She's so thin.

166
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,360
No wonder she has poor health

167
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,080
and is prone to illness.

168
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,320
Yes, Your Highness.

169
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,880
—Greetings, Lord.             —You may rise.

170
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Sit.

171
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,720
I heard that you sent for a doctor earlier.

172
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,800
What's the matter with you?

173
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,920
Are you not feeling well?

174
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,520
Nothing.

175
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,400
I just didn't sleep well last night

176
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,120
and had a headache when I woke up

177
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,040
so I asked to see a doctor.

178
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,800
What did he say?

179
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,640
He said it wasn't serious

180
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,960
and prescribed some calming medicine.

181
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,960
You're assisting my mother

182
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,640
to take care of household affairs

183
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
and it's hard work.

184
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm glad to be able

185
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,680
to share your worries, Lord.

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,040
You've lost weight recently.

187
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,000
There's too much work to do here.

188
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,560
If you feel upset

189
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,440
just invite your family over.

190
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,560
Aren't your mother and sister

191
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,880
still in the city?

192
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
My sister's birthday

193
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,120
is coming in four or five days.

194
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,680
She's young and spoilt

195
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,680
and insisted on seeing my father.

196
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,600
My mother had no choice

197
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,240
but to take her out of the city yesterday.

198
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,400
They set off to see our father in the south

199
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,520
and will stay there for a while.

200
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,920
Butler Meng has lived there for many years

201
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,080
and seldom comes back.

202
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,960
It's normal for a child to miss her father.

203
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,920
We're very grateful

204
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,160
for your trust in our family, Lord.

205
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,960
By the way, I heard Her Highness

206
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,360
asked for a physician this morning as well.

207
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,080
What's wrong with my mother?

208
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,960
Her Highness is fine.

209
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,600
She just ordered the physician

210
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,480
to prepare some nourishing herbs

211
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,760
and sent them to Mistress

212
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,880
who seems to have a cold.

213
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,880
A cold...

214
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,920
Mistress has changed a lot

215
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,320
and is more likeable

216
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
after she got married.

217
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
No wonder Her Highness treats her nicer now.

218
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
My mother chats well with her

219
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,760
so she naturally cares about her.

220
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,600
That's true.

221
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,000
Be careful, Mother.

222
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,760
Go.

223
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,000
These medicinal herbs are precious.

224
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,400
I'll watch them move it.

225
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,680
You do that.

226
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
I'll go to see my sister now.

227
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,920
Stop.

228
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,360
Don't run around.

229
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,160
This is Zhong Residence, not our house.

230
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,320
Did you hear me?

231
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,360
—Got it...                 —Behave yourself.

232
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
Let's go...

233
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,240
Go.

234
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,320
Miss.

235
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,600
Do you know

236
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,720
where your mistress's residence is?

237
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,840
We haven't been here before

238
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,000
and don't know the way.

239
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
I wonder if it's convenient

240
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,720
for you to take me there.

241
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,520
Can you?

242
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,160
Sir, I came here before

243
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,240
and I still remember the way.

244
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,480
You're the eldest son of the Hua family?

245
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,200
Do you know me?

246
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,800
Where are you going?

247
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,240
Sir

248
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
weren't you going to see your sister?

249
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,720
What's this place?

250
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,840
<i>Shende Hall</i>

251
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,080
It must be Master Zhong's study.

252
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,120
Have you noticed that the maid

253
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,120
looks a little different?

254
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,200
Sir, isn't every one of your concubines

255
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,520
different, too?

256
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,840
Stop.

257
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,120
Tell me what you mean.

258
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,280
How dare you talk to me that way?

259
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,520
Qian. Mother.

260
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,520
Didn't you leave before me?

261
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,280
Why are you so late?

262
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,440
Huang took me in the wrong direction

263
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,440
so we ended up taking the longer route.

264
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,240
Qian, I heard you got sick.

265
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,400
You seem to have lost a lot of weight.

266
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,920
Mother, you feel that way

267
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
probably because we haven't met in a while.

268
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Your father and I stayed at the clan house

269
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,280
for over a month

270
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,720
because of what happened to your cousin

271
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,280
in Zhong's Garden.

272
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,840
We just came back

273
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,800
and heard he got you in trouble again.

274
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,080
Yes, he did.

275
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,920
Very big trouble.

276
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
Qian.

277
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
You've never bought jewellery

278
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,680
since you got married

279
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,720
so I specially bought some for you

280
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,320
in the past few days.

281
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
I've got plenty of this.

282
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,760
How can you say that?

283
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,720
Your brother really cares about you

284
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,240
and bought all the good ones

285
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,840
in the jewellery store for you.

286
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,760
He didn't even get any for me.

287
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
I know you wouldn't be angry with me.

288
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,520
Foolish child.

289
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,440
You're of the same blood.

290
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,120
Of course, she'll forgive you.

291
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,520
You're right, Mother. Qian is blessed.

292
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,800
This house is really magnificent

293
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,760
and much better than our house.

294
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,360
Not just that. Even the servants here

295
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,480
look different from others.

296
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,320
When I came over

297
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,520
I saw a maid

298
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
coming out of my brother-in-law's study.

299
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,040
She looks pretty

300
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,120
but I don't think I've ever seen her

301
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,360
around you before.

302
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,200
Who is she?

303
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,720
Master's study?

304
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,000
There are enough maids in my residence.

305
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,920
Last time I went to your study

306
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I found that it was poorly staffed.

307
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,720
I'll let Mu Yao go there to serve you.

308
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,560
<i>In my previous life, both of us were friends</i>

309
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,840
<i>but she and Hua Shen never knew each other</i>

310
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,920
<i>so it's no wonder he didn't recognise her.</i>

311
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,320
Why are you asking about his maid?

312
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,040
I'm just asking.

313
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,160
Hua Shen!

314
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,440
Get your head screwed on straight!

315
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,760
You know Zhong Yelan is...

316
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
His staff

317
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,840
aren't people you can have designs on.

318
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,720
—I...        —You've always been a womaniser

319
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,480
but don't get us in trouble!

320
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,280
Qian, simmer down. I was just asking.

321
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,000
I dare not get involved with the staff here.

322
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,680
Let me shut up now.

323
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,920
Don't talk like that.

324
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,440
You know how your brother is like.

325
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,560
He just speaks whatever comes to mind.

326
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,840
By the way

327
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,840
Master now has a maid by his side?

328
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,520
Doesn't he dislike being served by maids?

329
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,200
What do you know about that maid?

330
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,640
Mother, what you should do now

331
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,560
is keep an eye on your son

332
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,160
not meddle in the Zhong family's affairs.

333
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,080
I'm just looking out for your best interests.

334
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,840
Why are you angry?

335
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,200
After all

336
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,360
you just have one sibling in him

337
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,200
and he'll be your only family in the future.

338
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,800
Even if he's a little dull

339
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,800
he still treats you sincerely.

340
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,480
Mother, you've always been partial to him.

341
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,760
Look at what he has done.

342
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Calling him dull is a compliment to him.

343
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,840
Listen.

344
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,760
When I was pregnant with you

345
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,280
he was only five.

346
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,840
He came to me every day

347
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,160
asking when you'd be born.

348
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,840
He said that he'd protect you

349
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,680
and love you.

350
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,800
Mother, please pass my father a message

351
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,280
after you go back.

352
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,160
What is it?

353
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,160
"A small leak will sink a great ship".

354
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,080
What does it mean?

355
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,200
Father knows what my brother did

356
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,680
to the shops in his charge.

357
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,680
I don't think I need to say more.

358
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,040
Tell him what my brother did today

359
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,520
and he'll understand what I said.

360
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,520
The shops belong to the Zhong family.

361
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,720
My brother needs to be disciplined.

362
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
<i>Hua Residence</i>

363
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,120
How's Qian?

364
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,520
She looks weak

365
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,560
but sounds still energetic

366
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,640
so I don't think she's seriously ill.

367
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,200
Great.

368
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,760
—You may go now.                —Yes, Madam.

369
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,640
Where's Shen?

370
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,960
He said

371
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,680
he had not finished his homework

372
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,200
so he went back to his room.

373
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,760
He went back to study?

374
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Did the sun rise from the west today?

375
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,480
He must have sneaked out again

376
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,720
to play with his cronies.

377
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,320
How can that be?

378
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,040
Qian's still sick.

379
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,880
He's worried about her.

380
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,320
So he wouldn't go out to have fun

381
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,880
at a time like this.

382
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,840
You know what?

383
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,320
I don't worry about Qian's marriage now.

384
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,400
But I do worry about Shen's marriage.

385
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,720
He's not young

386
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,760
but hasn't settled down yet.

387
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,000
There's no hurry.

388
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,600
Qian's the wife of Master Zhong now.

389
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,880
Many merchants in this town

390
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,680
want to become our relatives by marriage.

391
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,160
He doesn't need to marry down.

392
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,600
But our son has neither literacy talent

393
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,880
nor excellent martial arts.

394
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,520
In my opinion

395
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,040
it doesn't matter

396
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,360
even if the girl is from an ordinary family.

397
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
He can handle her easily

398
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,840
and won't be bullied.

399
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,120
Even if he isn't exceptional

400
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,440
he's still our only son.

401
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,200
Daughters from ordinary families

402
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,240
cannot marry into our family.

403
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,080
I know what you're saying.

404
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,320
But think about this.

405
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,560
Shen has a lot of concubines.

406
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,920
If an aristocrat's daughter marries him

407
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,520
and got to know that

408
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,960
she'll be furious.

409
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,400
You must discipline him.

410
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,760
I've never stopped him

411
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,320
from taking concubines

412
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,120
but he still goes out and fools around.

413
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,440
A man should have ambition

414
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,040
but he fools around

415
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,840
with his concubines all day.

416
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,240
When I go there

417
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,960
there's not even enough room for me.

418
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,120
All right...

419
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,040
Don't be angry.

420
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,600
You're right. I should discipline him

421
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,160
and curb his frivolous ways.

422
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,920
Wait.

423
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,400
This is strange.

424
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,080
—What?      —Don't you always side with him?

425
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,040
What happened today?

426
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,000
Why the sudden change?

427
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,760
Did he cause trouble at Zhong Residence?

428
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,120
No...

429
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,920
I...

430
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,000
I just noticed that

431
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,720
Qian had become mature

432
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
after getting married

433
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,640
and that Shen can't live up to her.

434
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,200
<i>Store ledger</i>

435
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,920
She has indeed changed a lot

436
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,240
after getting married.

437
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,960
What did she say to you today?

438
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,960
Nothing, just something trivial.

439
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,880
I'll remove these.

440
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,080
My dear...

441
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,840
My dear, don't worry about Shen's marriage.

442
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,600
—He looks so handsome.               —Right?

443
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,040
He has fair skin and long eyelashes.

444
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,200
Right?

445
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,560
You're infatuated with him.

446
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,880
What's with the racket?

447
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,560
Mistress is sick. Be quiet.

448
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,720
Qianzhi, I've told you many times

449
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,000
to be gentle.

450
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,600
Don't always behave like this.

451
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,680
I think you're the loudest here.

452
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,280
What happened?

453
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Why are you so happy?

454
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,240
Haven't you heard, Mistress?

455
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,880
Some new guards were recruited.

456
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,400
Butler Ji did mention it to me.

457
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
What's the matter?

458
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,120
One of them is so good-looking

459
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,400
that the maids have gone to check him out.

460
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Really?

461
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,960
But I don't have any impression

462
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,960
of this good-looking guard.

463
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,680
Mistress, you fell ill the day he joined us

464
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,320
so you haven't seen him.

465
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,800
Mistress, you'll be surprised

466
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,280
when you finally see him.

467
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,040
I've never seen such a good-looking man.

468
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,240
Both of you are so ignorant.

469
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
He's just a guard.

470
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
What use can be made out of his beauty?

471
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,800
If you've seen him

472
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,440
you wouldn't say such words.

473
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm not as ignorant as you are.

474
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,760
After hearing what you said

475
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,200
I'm curious to see him.

476
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,400
Mistress, you're still in recovery.

477
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,720
By the way, he's just a servant.

478
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
No one in the world

479
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,600
can compare to Master Zhong.

480
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,320
It was just a passing remark.

481
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,480
Master's birthday is in half a month.

482
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,720
What's your plan, Mistress?

483
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Birthday?

484
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
Master's birthday!

485
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,160
Have you forgotten it, Mistress?

486
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,320
<i>Zhong Yelan's birthday?</i>

487
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,560
<i>I forgot about it.</i>

488
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
<i>Wait.</i>

489
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,200
<i>Isn't that what started the relationship</i>

490
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,680
<i>between him and Mu Yao?</i>

491
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,320
Master, it's getting late

492
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,600
and it's time to go back now.

493
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,560
It's your birthday today.

494
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,720
I want to be with my mother a little longer.

495
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,240
Why are you kneeling here?

496
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,480
Did your parents punish you, too?

497
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,400
No one punished me.

498
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,800
I do it of my own will.

499
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,440
What's wrong with you?

500
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Why do you want to kneel here?

501
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,960
My mother's tablet is here.

502
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,720
My father often says

503
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,880
parents like to see their children

504
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,080
live a happy and carefree life.

505
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,680
Do you think

506
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,960
your mother wants you

507
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,760
to kneel in front of her tablet

508
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,880
with a sad face?

509
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,400
I haven't met her before.

510
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,760
On the day I was born

511
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,400
she...

512
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,240
All mothers love their children.

513
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,920
Probably your kneeling

514
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,560
has already broken her heart.

515
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,080
Do you want to go with me to see the release?

516
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
I heard this temple delivers our prayers.

517
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,080
Let's go pray together.

518
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,320
All right. Now that I've brought you here

519
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,440
I'll go to my father.

520
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,160
What's your name?

521
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
My father said

522
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,120
I shouldn't tell my name to strangers.

523
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,720
Can I see your face?

524
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,520
No. I have a rash on my face

525
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,040
so I can't remove my veil.

526
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,280
This is for you.

527
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,320
If you want to see me next time

528
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,640
just show it

529
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,560
to the abbot of this temple.

530
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,200
All right... I'll take it.

531
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,840
See you around.

532
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,520
Mother, I'll visit you another day.

533
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,040
<i>Oh, Heavens</i>

534
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,120
<i>if you'd wanted to give me another chance</i>

535
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,600
<i>why didn't you send me back</i>

536
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,520
<i>before I started impersonating her?</i>

537
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,640
<i>It's too hard to turn it around now.</i>

538
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,360
Mistress.

539
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,640
All right.

540
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,640
How will you plan the birthday banquet?

541
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,880
<i>Wait.</i>

542
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,880
<i>I remember that day</i>

543
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,320
<i>Lord would come to the banquet unexpectedly</i>

544
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,960
<i>and fall in love with Mu Yao at first sight.</i>

545
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,560
<i>He treated me like that a few days ago.</i>

546
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,800
<i>This is the perfect time to distract him</i>

547
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,240
<i>so he won't be preoccupied with</i>

548
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,680
<i>harming my family.</i>

549
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,240
Let's keep it low-key.

550
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,800
After all, it's also his mother's...

551
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,480
I don't think he'd appreciate fanfare.

552
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,760
Mistress, how about I go to the storage now

553
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,680
and retrieve the <i>guqin</i> Master gave you?

554
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
The exquisite <i>guqin</i>

555
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,040
and your excellent playing skills

556
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,680
will surely astound everyone.

557
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,800
No need.

558
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,560
Yes. Go retrieve it.

559
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Sure.

560
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Master.

561
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,480
Mistress's maid, Qianzhi, wants to see you.

562
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,200
Greetings, Master.

563
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,880
Mistress asked me to send you a message.

564
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,560
She wants you to come back early

565
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,080
after work today.

566
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,720
She has prepared a birthday banquet for you.

567
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,280
No need. I never celebrate my birthday.

568
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,880
But she started preparing for it

569
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,280
half a month ago.

570
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,840
All right.

571
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,920
<i>Shende Hall</i>

572
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,920
The <i>guqin</i> is prepared.

573
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,120
Should I bring it out now?

574
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,320
No need. Follow my lead later.

575
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,400
By the way, put another chair here

576
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,760
for Lord to sit.

577
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Is he coming, too?

578
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,160
Master didn't mention it.

579
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,200
Just trust me.

580
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,640
The quality of this batch of blood amber

581
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,040
isn't as good as the previous batch.

582
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,920
If we use it to make Jiayin Pills

583
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,440
they'll be much less effective

584
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,760
and that'd ruin our reputation.

585
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,480
If the supply is insufficient

586
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,760
I'm afraid we'll have to sell

587
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,080
fewer pills each year.

588
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,400
Senior.

589
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Senior!

590
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,840
What's the matter?

591
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,200
Have you got other things to do?

592
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,720
Lord.

593
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,600
I've got something else to do today.

594
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,760
Let's compound the fragrance another day.

595
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,240
I almost forgot.

596
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,240
Are you going to the temple this year, too?

597
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,440
No, I'm not.

598
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,360
When I went out this morning

599
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,720
Qian sent a message

600
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,440
saying that she had prepared a banquet

601
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,680
and wanted me to go back early today.

602
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,120
I'd like to attend this banquet

603
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,120
since it has piqued your interest.

604
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,240
It's just a family dinner.

605
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,880
I'd be glad

606
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,240
if you come with me, Lord.

607
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,440
Let me change into another outfit.

608
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
All right.

609
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,120
Greetings, Lord.

610
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,760
Today is my senior's birthday

611
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,840
and I'm just tagging along.

612
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
There's no need for such formalities.

613
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,680
Mistress, you were right.

614
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
Lord really came.

615
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,120
Go get ready.

616
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,360
It seems that the cook in your residence

617
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,680
is very good at making spicy meals.

618
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,760
Master loves this taste

619
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,120
so I specially told the cook about it today.

620
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,480
Master's stomach has been upset these days

621
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,760
and the physician told him to avoid spices.

622
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,360
Shall I ask the cook to make other dishes?

623
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,360
It's fine. I'm already much better now.

624
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,280
Mistress, it's ready for you.

625
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,480
It's a bit boring to just eat.

626
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,960
Previously, Master gave me a rare <i>guqin</i>.

627
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,360
Today is your birthday

628
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,280
so I took it out for you today.

629
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,760
I heard Mu Yao plays <i>guqin</i> very well.

630
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,280
I wonder

631
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,880
if you could perform a tune for Master.

632
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
Mistress...

633
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,840
Do you need anything else, Mu Yao?

634
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,000
<i>In my previous life, I played a song first</i>

635
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,840
<i>and provoked Mu Yao.</i>

636
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,840
<i>But that caused me a lot of trouble.</i>

637
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,400
<i>This time I'll help her become famous</i>

638
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,880
<i>so she won't need to make use of me.</i>

639
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,200
There are so many talents in your residence.

640
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,480
A mere maid can play such beautiful music.

641
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,160
That's amazing.

642
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,760
You're flattering her.

643
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,040
Her playing is very ordinary.

644
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,440
Not at all.

645
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,840
The music played by this woman

646
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,800
conveys the heroic spirit of soldiers.

647
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,560
Even established musicians

648
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,960
aren't as good as her.

649
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,600
It's just mediocre to me.

650
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,960
Well, then...

651
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,560
Why don't you give her to me?

652
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,120
My mother loves music.

653
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,840
She may relieve her boredom.

654
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,200
<i>Bonus footage</i>

655
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,880
The guard selection has concluded

656
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,840
Butler Ji has picked some agile ones.

657
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,080
Are there talents amongst them?

658
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,680
When I was watching

659
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,760
I noticed an agile man.

660
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,960
He didn't seem to have learnt martial arts

661
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,160
but he could handle the pros very well.

662
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,200
So that makes him a born martial artist?

663
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,880
Rather than that

664
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,960
it was more like he was risking his life.

665
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,200
No matter how powerful his opponents were

666
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,880
they'd inevitably feel a little afraid

667
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,200
when they fought with him.

668
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,760
Someone. Get him down.

669
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,480
All right.

670
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,520
You may go in and register.

671
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,000
From now, you'll live in the guardhouse.

672
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,440
Thank you,  Butler Ji.

673
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,200
Coach him later.

674
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,440
If a person with such a temperament

675
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,840
can really be used by you

676
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,920
he'll never betray you.

677
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Noted.

678
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,600
Wait.

679
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,400
What's your name?

680
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,720
Hua Rongzhou.
