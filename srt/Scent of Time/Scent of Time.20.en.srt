00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>Episode 20</i>

2
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
Miss, be careful.

3
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,000
Sure enough.

4
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,840
Feelings do fade away over time.

5
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,360
Miss, what are you talking about?

6
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,920
It's nothing.

7
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,280
I feel cold again all of a sudden.

8
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Mistress Hua, are you here

9
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,920
to look for Her Highness again?

10
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,160
Miss Qi, are you here to see Her Highness, too?

11
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,680
No, I came to see you.

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,160
Oh, right.

13
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,000
I should call you Miss Hua now.

14
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,360
—You're divorced.                     —Miss!

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,880
Miss Qi, please watch what you say!

16
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,000
Miss...

17
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

18
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,680
You have been lucky all your life.

19
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,320
Though you're divorced

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,240
there's no need to be so sad.

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,360
There are many people

22
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,520
who are in worse situations than you.

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,400
Qi Ruxin, how have I offended you?

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
You have had it too easy so far.

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,240
That's why I hate you to the core.

26
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
By the way

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
I heard that your brother died.

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
—Miss!            —Heaven is fair after all.

29
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Say another word about my brother

30
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,480
and I'll make sure you cannot speak

31
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,640
for the rest of your life.

32
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,040
What, do you think you can scare me?

33
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,880
Miss Hua, please forgive my Miss.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,640
The assassins

35
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,160
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,520
gave her a great fright.

37
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,120
She is still in a state of shock

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,360
and hence unable to think straight.

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,800
Mistress.

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,400
Miss Hua, are you here to see Her Highness?

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,480
Miss.

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,240
Yes.

43
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,080
I just came out of the study room

44
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,800
and ran into you here.

45
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,440
I guess we do have an affinity.

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,160
Come to think of it, you haven't been

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,600
to Zhong's Garden for a long while.

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,400
That's right.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,680
Miss Hua, if you come to Zhong's Garden again

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,560
please come visit me at my compound

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,320
so that I have someone to chat with

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,080
and not be so lonely

53
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
living here at Zhong's Garden.

54
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,200
Aren't you hospitable!

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,960
Sister Qi hasn't been herself lately.

56
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,960
She has been saying inappropriate things.

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
If she has offended you somehow, Miss Hua

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,120
I apologise on her behalf.

59
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,600
I hope you won't take it to heart.

60
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,080
I won't.

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,080
I tend to speak my mind.

62
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,560
For some reason

63
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,000
I felt like I liked you a lot

64
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,440
the very first time I saw you.

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
You've returned to the Hua family

66
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,880
and regained freedom.

67
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,440
I'm really happy for you.

68
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,560
Speaking of which, whenever I see you

69
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,480
I do feel a sense of familiarity.

70
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,680
Since you have extended the invitation

71
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,880
may I have the honour

72
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,040
to go to your compound today?

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
I'm more than happy!

74
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,840
Miss Hua, we haven't seen you around.

75
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,440
What were you busy with?

76
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,960
Nothing much. It's just that I have been

77
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,880
looking for my brother's murderer.

78
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,120
Isn't this what Magistrate Wang should do?

79
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,120
Miss Hua, why are you intervening?

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,400
The magistracy investigation

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,680
is constrained by red tape.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,080
It's quicker to investigate on my own.

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,920
Besides, I'm the assassin's target

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
so I'm not going to let him off so easily.

85
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,920
Miss Hua, you are so brave and wise.

86
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,880
<i>Why wasn't she surprised</i>

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,040
<i>that I was the assassin's target?</i>

88
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,160
<i>Does she know something?</i>

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,000
—Miss Meng...     —Why are you two together?

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,680
Where are you going?

91
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
Lord.

92
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,360
I met Miss Hua by chance just now.

93
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
We were having a good time

94
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,520
so I invited her to go to my compound

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
to carry on.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,480
In that case, please leave.

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,840
I need to talk to Hua Qian.

98
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,240
Yes, Lord.

99
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,480
No wonder it's been decided that

100
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,760
Miss Meng would be your wife-to-be.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,120
I see that she's polite

102
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
and has a good sense of propriety.

103
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,480
Nothing has been decided.

104
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
But why does it sound like...

105
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,560
you're jealous?

106
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,920
I heard that you were here.

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I put down what I was doing

108
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,120
and came to see you.

109
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
Why were you leaving as soon as you saw me?

110
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,880
Lord, if you wanted to see me

111
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
why didn't I see you

112
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
during the two hours I was with Her Highness?

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,680
You showed up only after Meng Yifei and I

114
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,680
made plans to spend time together. Why?

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,720
What made you angry?

116
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,760
I was rude.

117
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
Please forgive me, Lord.

118
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,280
I am leaving.

119
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,600
Qian.

120
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,600
Lately, I have many things to take care of.

121
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,760
I almost couldn't find time

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,160
to come and meet you today.

123
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,560
I thought I had made myself clear that day.

124
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,680
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

125
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,600
A little more waiting won't bother me.

126
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
After all, you have become

127
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,360
the daughter of the Hua family again.

128
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,960
Lord.

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,440
You tend to oversimplify the problem.

130
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,920
Things between you and me

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
are beyond our feelings.

132
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,880
Do you mean Lord of the Zhong family

133
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,360
is simple-minded?

134
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,520
You're also interested in me, aren't you?

135
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,480
I know. You tend to worry a lot.

136
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,840
But I meant what I said to you that day.

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,880
You can come to me any time.

138
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,880
As I said, that won't be necessary.

139
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,720
I have given orders at the Star Reaching Tower.

140
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
The employees work on fragrance formulas

141
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,160
on the ground floor.

142
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,000
No one is allowed to go to the eleventh floor.

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,920
It's exclusive to you.

144
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,520
You can go there

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,920
whenever you feel like it.

146
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,920
You can enjoy uninterrupted peace and quiet

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,400
when you are there.

148
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,720
No, thanks.

149
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,040
It's on a high floor

150
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,520
and climbing stairs is too tiring.

151
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,800
I don't want to go there again.

152
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,840
Look what the cat's dragged in.

153
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,680
It's rare that you come here, Lord.

154
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,400
Did you have a conflict with Hua...

155
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
the daughter of Butler Hua today?

156
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,240
Lord, you came here to ask about this?

157
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,880
The son of the Hua family just passed away

158
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,960
so Hua Qian is now

159
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,920
the only daughter of Butler Hua.

160
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,200
No matter what conflicts you had

161
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,680
I hope you can yield to her.

162
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,520
You want to protect Hua Qian.

163
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,720
Why bother finding an excuse?

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
What did you say?

165
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
Judging by your look

166
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,440
you probably can't get what you want

167
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,120
like me.

168
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,000
Looks like I'm not the only one

169
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
feeling miserable.

170
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
What do you know?

171
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,880
I know what I should know

172
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,480
and what I shouldn't know.

173
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,080
Why? Are you going to silence me, Lord?

174
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,840
Lord, please forgive her.

175
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Miss was scared out of her wits

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,280
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

177
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,200
and hence, she cannot think straight.

178
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,080
Keep an eye on her

179
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,120
and make sure she keeps her mouth shut.

180
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,880
I have better things to do

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,840
than to gossip about people.

182
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,560
It's fun not getting what you desire.

183
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,120
Just let me savour this pleasure alone.

184
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,240
Miss!

185
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,480
Zhong Xiwu...

186
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,720
You may be Lord of the Zhong family

187
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,400
but you're as pathetic as me

188
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,080
because you can't get the woman you want.

189
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,400
I am not like you.

190
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Chen Yuan.

191
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,640
Lord.

192
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,320
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

193
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Noted.

194
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,560
Concubine Mu, I am Banxia, your new maid.

195
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,240
The housekeeper sent me.

196
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,160
Isn't Zisu coming back?

197
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,000
The housekeeper said he couldn't contact Zisu

198
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,960
who went back to her hometown for a visit.

199
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,760
He was afraid that you would be short of maids

200
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,280
so he sent me here to serve you.

201
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,880
He'll continue sending people

202
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,480
to look for Zisu.

203
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,240
I see.

204
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,120
Miss, Huang said he had news.

205
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,000
Miss Hua, our men just sent news.

206
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
They saw a man in black

207
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,280
sneaking out of Zhong Residence.

208
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,520
Did you find the whereabouts of that man?

209
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,200
Yes, the figure disappeared

210
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,640
into a room on the second floor of an inn.

211
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
An inn?

212
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,720
It's an inconspicuous inn

213
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,000
where people of all kinds stay in it.

214
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,240
And then?

215
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,880
The guards who followed him were cautious

216
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,400
and didn't confront him

217
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,680
instead they...

218
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,720
<i>All Around Inn</i>

219
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
Sir, here's your wine. Please enjoy.

220
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,720
—Hey, Innkeeper!                       —Sir.

221
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,720
Do you have any vacant rooms?

222
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,640
Just a moment. Let me check.

223
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
We have vacant rooms

224
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,840
on both the first and second floors.

225
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,760
Which floor do you prefer?

226
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,840
I want the leftmost room on the second floor.

227
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,480
Sir, what would you like?

228
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,840
—A pot of wine.                       —Sure.

229
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,200
Unfortunately, that room is occupied.

230
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,960
When will the room be available?

231
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm used to staying in that room.

232
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,800
The guest in that room will leave tomorrow.

233
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,720
Why don't you take the room next door?

234
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,640
Can you get them to exchange rooms with me?

235
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,200
I only want to stay in that room.

236
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,800
I'm afraid this is not appropriate.

237
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
Those two guests have been staying in that room

238
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,840
for several days.

239
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,600
Why did they stay for so long?

240
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,800
Are they merchants?

241
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,720
I don't know.

242
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,320
They are probably tourists from somewhere

243
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
since they had been inquiring about

244
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,360
Donghuang Mountain in the past few days.

245
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,840
All right. You know what to do.

246
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,160
Got it!

247
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,040
Donghuang Mountain?

248
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,760
I've been reborn

249
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,960
but his escape route remains the same.

250
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,760
Are you sure it's tomorrow?

251
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,920
Have our guards been spotted?

252
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,760
Obtaining this information was effortless.

253
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Do you think the other party

254
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,800
intentionally leaked this information to us?

255
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,200
I don't think so.

256
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,400
But just in case

257
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,560
the guards who tracked down the man in black

258
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,800
split up on purpose.

259
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,960
One went to the counter to make some inquiry

260
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,560
while the other sat in the lobby

261
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,720
and pretended to be a customer

262
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,880
to observe the surroundings.

263
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,880
Nothing seemed out of the ordinary

264
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,000
so I don't think it was a trap.

265
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,200
The man in black was careless

266
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,960
and didn't realise that he was being followed.

267
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,800
Careless?

268
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,520
Is it really that simple?

269
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Never mind.

270
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,840
I'd better not forego an opportunity.

271
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,880
At worst, I'll wait there every day.

272
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,880
Now, go gather more men

273
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,440
and take as many people with you as you can

274
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,360
and set an ambush at the foot of the mountain.

275
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,680
Go in batches.

276
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,480
Remember to keep a low profile.

277
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,280
Be inconspicuous when making your way there.

278
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,480
I will be there tomorrow.

279
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Noted, Miss.

280
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
Did you prepare the carriages?

281
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Let's hurry along.

282
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Get them.

283
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,480
Miss Hua, we're making a scene.

284
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,760
I'm afraid

285
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,760
it will draw the attention of the soldiers.

286
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,760
This is my intention.

287
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,800
This will expose the mastermind.

288
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Well...

289
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,480
Don't worry.

290
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,640
He won't dare call for help

291
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,160
when the city is under martial law.

292
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,000
Master, don't worry about me.

293
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Just run!

294
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,040
Do your worst, Hua Qian.

295
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,880
Are you serious about killing me?

296
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,600
Do you think you can escape punishment

297
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,960
after murdering me?

298
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,160
You're just an escaped slave.

299
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,520
So what if I killed you?

300
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,080
Don't play games with me.

301
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,240
You clearly know who I am.

302
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,960
Do I? Who are you then?

303
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,840
I have the nerve to arrest you

304
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,400
but do you dare call for help?

305
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,480
I'll leave you to decide if you want to

306
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,480
admit to causing harm to the Hua family.

307
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,440
If you surrender now

308
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,480
I'll tell the guards to stop

309
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,520
and we can have a discussion.

310
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,560
Otherwise, we'll fight until you die.

311
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,200
Master...

312
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Don't.

313
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,360
Long time no see, Junior Lord Wu.

314
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,800
How did you know I would come here?

315
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
You told me so yourself.

316
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Nonsense!

317
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,640
I'll leave Huangcheng tomorrow

318
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,800
via Donghuang Mountain pass.

319
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,720
Go expose me as fast as you can.

320
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,160
Let's see who will believe a fugitive like you.

321
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,240
Your dull mind

322
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
won't be able to figure this out.

323
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,840
Throw them into the carriage behind mine

324
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,920
and take them back.

325
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,760
Go spread the word tomorrow.

326
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,240
I want everyone in Huangcheng

327
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,600
to hear about this.

328
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,200
The Hua family went to great lengths

329
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,600
and caught...

330
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,280
an escaped slave.

331
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Noted, Miss.

332
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,640
How dare you arrest me!

333
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Aren't you afraid of jeopardising

334
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,920
the long-term collaboration

335
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,640
between the Zhong family and the Wu family?

336
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,040
Why didn't you say this

337
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,400
when you were arrested?

338
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,000
Junior Lord Wu appeared in Huangcheng

339
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,480
uninvited

340
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,200
despite the end of his study tour.

341
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,480
If your identity is revealed

342
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,800
wouldn't that also reveal the Wu family's plot

343
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,520
of stealing the fragrance formula?

344
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,240
When that happens

345
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,440
will there still be any collaborations

346
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,720
between the Zhong family and the Wu family?

347
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Who said I wanted to steal

348
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
the fragrance formula?

349
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,760
I just...

350
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,960
stayed in Huangcheng for a few more days.

351
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,800
Is that true?

352
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,120
Then, explain why you needed

353
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,360
to lie low in Huangcheng.

354
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,480
Or should I hand you over to the magistracy

355
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,560
for investigation?

356
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,120
Hua Qian.

357
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,400
I didn't realise how ruthless you could be.

358
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,600
I'm ruthless?

359
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,400
You carried out the banquet massacre

360
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,200
and expected no one to retaliate?

361
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,720
How do you know that?

362
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,040
This wound seems to be almost healed.

363
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,560
Why don't you explain how you got hurt?

364
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,880
It seems that the person who fought with

365
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
Hua Rongzhou in the valley was indeed you.

366
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,600
I asked how you knew about it.

367
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,560
How did I know about it?

368
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,800
I'd say you gave yourself away.

369
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,760
What do you mean?

370
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,280
If it wasn't someone I knew

371
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,920
he wouldn't know that

372
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hua Rongzhou was looking for me in the valley

373
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,640
and even told him which way to go.

374
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,560
Or perhaps I should say

375
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,320
Mu Yao has betrayed you?

376
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

377
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,840
You're a devoted man. How touching.

378
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,840
I wonder if Mu Yao would be moved

379
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,200
if she knows?

380
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,480
What gift do you think I should give her

381
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,160
so she would know it's you right away?

382
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,960
A finger?

383
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,680
An eye?

384
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,640
Or one of your ears?

385
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,600
You vicious woman!

386
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,680
Why not the tongue?

387
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,040
Nothing good comes out of your mouth anyway.

388
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,600
Just take it out on me.

389
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm doing exactly that.

390
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,960
It's your tongue I want to cut off

391
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,560
and your finger too.

392
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,240
It's also your eyes I want to pierce.

393
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,680
Didn't you say that we could have a discussion

394
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,960
if I surrendered?

395
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,360
Have you given me a chance to talk?

396
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,600
It's not one of my men who killed your brother

397
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
at the banquet.

398
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,080
Then who is it?

399
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
I don't know either.

400
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,880
Are you saying

401
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,600
there was another group of assassins?

402
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Yes.

403
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,240
Why did you pose as a member of the Ge family

404
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,960
to carry out the assassination?

405
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,080
Since you know how I feel about you

406
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,640
do you trust me?

407
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,520
Trust you to do what?

408
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
I'll take you away.

409
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
Why should I leave with you?

410
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,920
Because you're the only one I love.

411
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,280
So what? You like me

412
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,840
and I must go with you?

413
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Are you sure you want to share

414
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
your husband with Hua Qian?

415
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
Shut up!

416
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,120
Don't tell me you haven't noticed

417
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,640
that Zhong Yelan has started

418
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,360
to have feelings for Hua Qian.

419
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,040
He didn't agree to divorce Hua Qian at first

420
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
because he knew you were going to

421
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,520
take down Hua Qian.

422
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,720
He wanted to make use of his position

423
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,920
to shield Hua Qian

424
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,320
from being implicated by the Hua family.

425
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Later on, he changed his mind

426
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,800
and agreed to divorce Hua Qian.

427
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,520
It wasn't because of you

428
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,000
but because Hua Qian insisted on

429
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,120
getting a divorce

430
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
so he granted her wish.

431
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,280
If you still have doubts

432
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,080
why don't we make a bet?

433
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,280
Between you and Hua Qian

434
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,720
let's see who he will choose.

435
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,920
Fine.

436
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
How do we do it?

437
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,480
I know the reason even if you won't tell me.

438
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,640
Anyway, you are in my hands

439
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,080
so let's see if Mu Yao will come find you.

440
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,760
—Leave her alone!             —Why should I?

441
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,360
There's nothing between Mu Yao and me.

442
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,920
What happens to me doesn't concern her.

443
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
Look at you.

444
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,000
You're the junior lord

445
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,240
of the largest herb supplier.

446
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,280
You should focus on your business

447
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,000
instead of doing stupid things.

448
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,920
The Wu family will decline because of you.

449
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,400
Besides, I don't care what happened

450
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,040
between the two of you.

451
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,680
Do you expect me to be moved by your devotion

452
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,520
and help you two be together?

453
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,480
So, you knew the reason.

454
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,240
Why bother asking her again?

455
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,560
So what if I knew?

456
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,800
Asking her gives me room for negotiation.

457
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,800
By the way

458
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,680
throw the other man out.

459
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,080
We shan't waste medicine on him.

460
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,280
He's not worth it.

461
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,200
You are indeed a changed person.

462
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,600
No wonder she sensed danger.

463
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,040
I shouldn't have made that bet.

464
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,920
I was never going to win.

465
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Men! An intruder in Hua Residence!

466
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
Go over there! Go!

467
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,280
—Did you see him?                       —No.

468
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,160
Let's go over there. Hurry!

469
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,880
Someone broke into Hua Residence last night.

470
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,840
Miss Hua, are you okay here?

471
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,120
Did you catch him?

472
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,160
No.

473
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,840
What?

474
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,400
The guards in this house are useless.

475
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,920
They couldn't even catch a random intruder.

476
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
How about this?

477
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,080
Go tell my father that I feel disturbed

478
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,720
due to the intruder

479
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,960
and I don't think I'm able to sleep well

480
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,200
in the next few days.

481
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,760
So, he should borrow a few guards

482
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,360
from Magistrate Wang

483
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,360
for around half a month.

484
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,400
Noted. I'll inform Butler Hua right away.

485
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,160
Your injury healed just in time

486
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
and you were able to help me with the task.

487
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,480
Rest assured, Miss.

488
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,360
No one knows what happened last night.

489
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,000
I have no doubt about your agility.

490
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,520
Magistrate Wang's guards

491
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,680
belong to the government.

492
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,160
Even if they may not be skilled

493
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,360
they're not mere guards of Hua Residence.

494
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,240
Whoever has plans to spy on Hua Residence

495
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,280
is going to think twice.

496
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,240
You look nice in this colour.

497
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,400
Thank you for coming.

498
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,720
Huang, you don't have to be so polite.

499
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,120
This way, please.

500
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,360
<i>Zhong Residence</i>

501
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,880
Who's there?

502
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,840
I let you go.

503
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,160
Why did you come back?

504
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Concubine Mu, Hua Qian captured my master.

505
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,160
Is it the escaped slave

506
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,720
that she claimed she captured?

507
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Yes.

508
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,000
Guard Cang managed to escape.

509
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,200
He sent us the information

510
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,080
so we're sure it's true.

511
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,040
Your master's whereabouts were a secret.

512
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,800
Even I didn't know.

513
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,560
How did Hua Qian find out?

514
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,760
We don't know either.

515
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,160
Why did you come to see me today?

516
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,280
Hua Residence now has

517
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,400
magistracy guards keeping watch.

518
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
If we barge in to rescue him

519
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,080
we might alert them.

520
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,880
So?

521
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,400
Master has told us repeatedly

522
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,200
not to disturb you

523
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,160
but the matter is urgent.

524
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,760
Concubine Mu, please save our master.

525
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,360
I brought it upon your master.

526
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,400
Don't worry.

527
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,880
I won't leave him in the lurch.

528
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,080
Go back now.

529
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,040
Trust me to...

530
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,240
bring your master to you in one piece.

531
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,920
Thank you, Concubine Mu!

532
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,360
Mu Yao...

533
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,680
What led you to become what you despise?

534
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Miss.

535
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,480
Magistrate Wang's guards have been here

536
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,880
for almost a week.

537
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,280
And it has been pretty peaceful in here.

538
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,360
I heard from Huang

539
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,160
that they were talking about leaving.

540
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,880
This is unexpected.

541
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,600
It was surprising how patient they were.

542
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,120
Miss, have you figured out what to do next?

543
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Miss.

544
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,480
Miss Meng sent you another invitation card.

545
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,600
<i>Meng Yifei</i>

546
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,600
Miss, are you still going to

547
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,080
decline her invitation?

548
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,880
I have nothing to do anyway.

549
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,240
Let's go out for a walk.

550
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,400
Miss Hua, please have a seat.

551
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,040
Come and taste this tea.

552
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
This is the Dragon Musk tea

553
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,160
that my father brought for me from the south.

554
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
I'm grateful that he thinks of me

555
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,920
despite being occupied with work.

556
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,480
I don't serve it to just anyone.

557
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,640
I'm so lucky.

558
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,240
After you left Zhong's Garden that day

559
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,400
I was hoping we could talk again.

560
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Unfortunately, you kept declining my invitation

561
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
saying you were busy.

562
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,120
I finally got my wish fulfilled today.

563
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,040
I'm sorry, Miss Meng.

564
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,760
I was rather busy lately.

565
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,920
Really?

566
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,480
I thought that was an excuse.

567
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,280
So, what are you busy with?

568
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,520
Coincidentally

569
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,760
I caught a fugitive a few days ago

570
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,680
when I was looking for an escaped slave.

571
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,080
And it turned out the fugitive was involved

572
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,320
in the banquet assassination that happened

573
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,560
a few days ago.

574
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,000
So, I have been busy

575
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,480
trying to find out what he knows.

576
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,520
That's good.

577
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,920
Hopefully, the murderer will get convicted

578
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
and receive the punishment he deserves.

579
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,800
I hope so too, Miss Meng.

580
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
It's rare that you come here.

581
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,600
We must have a good time.

582
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,120
People come and go in Zhong's Garden

583
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,880
but I rarely meet someone like you

584
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,240
whom I can chat with.

585
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,040
I thought you and Miss Qi were very close?

586
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,920
Sis Qi seems like a different person these days.

587
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,400
But she won't tell me what happened.

588
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,960
She must have been dealt a great blow

589
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,960
that caused her to be in this state.

590
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,360
The truth is, Sis Qi has a sharp tongue

591
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,920
and may be harsh with her words

592
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,280
but she means well.

593
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,400
Sometimes the more she feels guilty

594
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,960
towards someone

595
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,160
the harsher she is with her words.

596
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,560
Guilty?

597
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,440
I was just citing an example.

598
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,200
What about you?

599
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,960
I don't know what's special about me

600
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,400
that makes you think of me differently.

601
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,080
I can see it clearly even when others can't.

602
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,480
I felt that you stood apart from the rest

603
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,000
ever since the first time I saw you.

604
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,920
And you escaped assassination twice.

605
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,320
After bad luck comes good fortune.

606
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,160
My father is Head Butler of the Zhong family's

607
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,400
business in the south

608
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,440
while your father is Head Butler

609
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
of the Zhong family.

610
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,320
If we can look after each other in the future

611
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,560
then our standing in Zhong's garden

612
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,320
will be strengthened.

613
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,720
Miss Meng, I don't understand

614
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,960
what you are talking about.

615
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,960
You're a smart girl.

616
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,120
Surely you understand what I'm talking about.

617
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,480
Lord has feelings for you.

618
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,040
I've been there so I know.

619
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,600
There will be many opportunities

620
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,840
where you and I can work together.

621
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,400
Miss Meng, don't make fun of me.

622
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,720
All right...

623
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,440
I won't make fun of you anymore.

624
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,160
Anyway, there's a long way ahead of us.

625
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,760
Let's have tea.

626
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,600
Okay.

627
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,040
Sis Hua, come here wherever you're free.

628
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,760
It's dirty. Just throw it away.

629
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,360
Yes, Miss.

630
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:41,000
Master, I saw where Concubine Mu was headed.

631
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,800
She seemed to be going to Hua Residence.

632
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,880
Master, Magistrate Wang's guards

633
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,120
are still in Hua Residence.

634
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,760
It would be unwise for

635
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,040
Concubine Mu to go there alone.

636
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,000
With her agility

637
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
avoiding those guards won't pose a challenge.

638
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,040
I believe Concubine Mu is going there

639
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,560
to see Mistress... I mean, Miss Hua.

640
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,360
Master, are you sure you'll ignore this?

641
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,680
Why should I care?

642
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,000
It's between them.

643
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,640
No one else should intervene.

644
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,000
But...

645
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,120
When Hua Qian left

646
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,720
she only took her belongings.

647
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,680
She didn't take the zither, chess

648
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,040
ink brush and ink stone that I gave her.

649
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,120
Send them to her when you have time.

650
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Noted, Master.

651
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
Consider it done.

652
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,400
Miss...

653
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,560
Are you flustered just because I didn't take you

654
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,000
to Zhong's Garden?

655
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,480
Go and tell the chef

656
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,800
to make a few more dishes for dinner.

657
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,040
We'll eat together.

658
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Yes, Miss.

659
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,960
Miss, Mu Yao is here.

660
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,440
How did it feel to climb over walls?

661
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Where is he?

662
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,520
Who?

663
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,840
Don't play dumb with me.

664
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,320
What's the hurry?

665
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,280
You came here uninvited

666
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,040
and I just came back.

667
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,680
Can't I drink some water and catch my breath?

668
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,160
You freed his guard on purpose.

669
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
You wanted him to inform me, didn't you?

670
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,160
I don't have time to play games with you.

671
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,640
I have come as you wish.

672
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
Can you let him go now?

673
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,560
How did the cup offend you?

674
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,760
From where did you pick up

675
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,360
the bad habit of breaking cups?

676
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,920
You need to kick the habit.

677
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,280
Hua Qian!

678
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,800
Since you know that

679
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,440
you're here to beg me for help

680
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,840
shouldn't you be more polite?

681
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,520
I'm here now.

682
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,400
Do whatever you want to me.

683
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,000
Just let him go. He has nothing to do with this.

684
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,720
He has nothing to do with this?

685
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,640
Mu Yao, the cheek of you

686
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,840
to utter those word.

687
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,640
Are you saying Wu Shuomo was not involved

688
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,320
in the banquet assassination?

689
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,480
And the kidnapping incident at the cliff too?

690
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,920
I was the mastermind

691
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,800
and he was just a pawn.

692
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,880
That's true.

693
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,360
One came up with some plans

694
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,840
hoping to find an answer

695
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,600
while the other waited at the cliff foot

696
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,320
thinking he could win the heart of his beloved.

697
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,320
How should I define the two of you?

698
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,800
Ridiculous or pathetic?

699
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,920
—Why would you...                 —Next time

700
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,880
be sure to brush up your acting.

701
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,000
It is improbable for someone

702
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,640
to display no signs of shock or fear

703
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,520
upon awakening to discover herself

704
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
hanging off the edge of a cliff.

705
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,560
Fine.

706
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,800
If you want revenge, come at me.

707
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,880
Aren't you loyal to each other?

708
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,440
Both of you are vying to take responsibility

709
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,040
upon yourselves.

710
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,840
Why does it sound like

711
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,840
I'm the villain again this time?

712
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,920
Has Zhong Yelan become insignificant

713
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,480
to you now?

714
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,960
You took him from me

715
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,560
and now you think I let him down?

716
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,640
Don't be a hypocrite.

717
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,840
I took him from you?

718
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,840
I made you his concubine

719
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,200
and took the initiative to get a divorce.

720
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,160
What more do you want me to do?

721
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,200
Mu Yao, I thought you were smart.

722
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,520
How could you be so foolish?

723
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,360
Yes, I was foolish enough to think

724
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,200
I could sound him out that way.

725
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,640
Didn't you try

726
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,880
to destroy everything I owned?

727
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,080
You have succeeded.

728
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,120
He has started to develop feelings for you.

729
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,560
How stupid I must have been

730
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,200
to have lost to you previously.

731
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,040
You are proud and egoistic.

732
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
You would rather suffer

733
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,320
than lose your dignity.

734
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,760
You always blame others but yourself

735
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,080
when things go wrong.

736
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,000
Is Zhong Yelan the only man in this vast world?

737
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,840
Can't you live without him?

738
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,640
You live in such a small world!

739
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,200
Who are you to criticise me?

740
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,720
Weren't you the same?

741
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,200
Master, I've led the Hua family's guards there.

742
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Good.

743
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,560
What should I do next?

744
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,440
Nothing.

745
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Yes, Master.
