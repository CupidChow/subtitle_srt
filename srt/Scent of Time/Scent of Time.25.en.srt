<i>Episode 25</i>

3
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Senior, how long has it been

4
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,280
since we had dinner together like this?

5
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,680
—I don't remember.            —That's right.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,600
Since you came back from the South

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,120
you have become more and more taciturn.

8
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,840
When you're with me

9
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,520
we only talk about the incense workshop.

10
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,160
And you're the same even after you got married.

11
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
Senior, do you miss the days

12
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,440
when you managed the shops in the South?

13
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,560
I'm doing quite well now.

14
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,040
Senior, do you mind going back to the South?

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
Lord, what do you mean?

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,080
The Meng family monopolises

17
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,200
the shops in the South

18
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,920
and their ambitions are growing bigger.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
I need someone to counterbalance them.

20
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,560
There are many excellent butlers in the city

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,320
to choose from.

22
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,120
You handed over the operating rights

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,600
of the shops in the South to Butler Meng.

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,080
No one is more suitable than you

25
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
to take it back.

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,680
I've been away from the South for many years

27
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,280
and now things are different.

28
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm afraid that

29
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,920
I might not be a good leader if I go back.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,600
Senior, please don't underestimate yourself.

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
Although it's been a while

32
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,440
since you returned to Huangcheng

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,680
you were the one who established

34
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,000
the business in the South.

35
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,640
Everyone remembers that.

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,120
You are my father's only apprentice.

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
I know that

38
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,400
when I first took over the position of Lord

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,400
all the butlers were watching me closely

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,840
and you handed over the operating rights

41
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,280
of the shops in the South

42
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,040
in order to reassure my mother and me.

43
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
But...

44
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,760
I need you now.

45
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,480
Tell me what you want me to do.

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,280
I'd like you to have the position of Head Butler

47
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,880
in charge of the shops in the South.

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Since you worry about the Meng family

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
monopolising the business

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,280
aren't you afraid that I will do the same?

51
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,280
If you had the intention, you'd have done so

52
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,440
when I succeeded as Lord.

53
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,040
You were fully capable of that at the time.

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
Although you are kind since you were young

55
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,040
you have never been submissive.

56
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,920
I'm flattered to hear you praise me.

57
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,920
Will you help me then, Senior?

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,080
When do you want me to leave?

59
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,640
After this month's banquet

60
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
I'll make the announcement

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
in front of all the butlers.

62
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Senior.

63
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
Miss, what brings you here?

64
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
I'm here to see my mother.

65
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,360
I thought that you would never come again

66
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,080
because you were mad

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,560
at the remarks Madam made.

68
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,360
I could have done better.

69
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,960
It must have been tough for you.

70
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,200
It's fine...

71
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,960
Go in.

72
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Mother.

73
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,920
I'm here to see you.

74
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,720
I wasn't a filial daughter.

75
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,480
I caused you trouble.

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,760
But don't worry

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,400
even though Shen is gone

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,680
as long as I am still here

79
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,120
I will never let anyone hurt you.

80
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,000
Mother.

81
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,080
I miss you.

82
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,560
Qian.

83
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,360
It was my fault.

84
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,840
It was my fault.

85
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,680
I reprimanded you.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
—Mother.                —I broke your heart.

87
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,680
It was my fault.

88
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,040
It was my fault.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
Good girl.

90
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
Forgive me.

91
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,200
I heard you and your mother have reconciled.

92
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,240
Father, what are you talking about?

93
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,040
When did Mother and I fall out?

94
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
What?

95
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,960
No, you didn't.

96
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,400
It would be great

97
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
if I could get closer to my mother sooner.

98
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,160
It's not too late now.

99
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Miss.

100
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,160
Miss, you've received a reply.

101
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,400
How time flies.

102
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,000
Qian.

103
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,320
What's wrong with you?

104
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
You seemed to want to say something

105
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,160
but you held back.

106
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
Tomorrow is the fifth of the month

107
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
the day of the banquet in Zhong's Garden.

108
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,560
I think my mother had better not attend it.

109
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,400
Zhong's Garden will be crowded

110
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,360
and my mother's health isn't doing well.

111
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
That's right.

112
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,000
Anyway, the banquet in Zhong's Garden

113
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,280
isn't really interesting.

114
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,760
In the past two weeks

115
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,160
I've been handing over my duties.

116
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,080
After the banquet

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,560
I should be able to relinquish

118
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,880
the position of Head Butler.

119
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
When that happens, we can live

120
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
in the small town South of the Yangtze River

121
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,400
that you mentioned. What do you think?

122
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
That's...

123
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,360
nice.

124
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
By the way

125
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,160
do you know Junior Lord Wu on a personal level?

126
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Yes, I do.

127
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,920
The inferior agarwood incense

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,760
that even Mu Yunping couldn't tell apart

129
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,240
came from him.

130
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,560
He harboured a member of the Ge family

131
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,640
who was on the run.

132
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,760
That's impossible.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,280
Why not?

134
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,960
But the previous...

135
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,520
<i>In the previous life, Wu Shuomo did not</i>

136
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
<i>harbour a member of the Ge family.</i>

137
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,240
<i>He helped Mu Yao</i>

138
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,400
<i>and even became the mastermind</i>

139
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,560
<i>behind the downfall of the Hua family.</i>

140
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,960
<i>It's unlikely he would cooperate</i>

141
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,240
<i>with my father now.</i>

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,560
<i>What went wrong?</i>

143
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
What's the matter?

144
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
He...

145
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,000
He belongs to the Wu family.

146
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
How would he get involved

147
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
in the Zhong family's matters?

148
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,720
Precisely because he's from the Wu family

149
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,200
it's safe to work with him.

150
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,120
She is gentle by nature?

151
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,280
She is timid and cowardly?

152
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
When did you start suffering from eye disease?

153
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,720
I know my daughter.

154
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,760
You two share a strong bond.

155
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,560
If you want to get emotional

156
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,600
I can understand.

157
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,000
Look at you.

158
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,000
You look all calm and composed.

159
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,560
I can't believe you're actually threatening me.

160
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,200
Are you really not afraid that

161
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,720
I might let the cat out of the bag

162
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,000
and tell everyone about how we collaborated?

163
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,000
Between you and me

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,840
you're the one who's more worried

165
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,520
about our collaboration coming to light.

166
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,000
In order to steal the incense formula

167
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,200
the Wu family went ahead to harbour

168
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,440
the wanted member of the Ge family

169
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,800
risking being condemned.

170
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,520
You then tried to secretly

171
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
concoct fake incense pills.

172
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:56,520
I wonder if Senior Lord Wu knows about this.

173
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,400
Or did you carry out this reckless act

174
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,040
of your own accord?

175
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
I merely just provided you

176
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
with an incense formula

177
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,960
so that you could frame your colleague.

178
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,600
We made a deal.

179
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Why are you suddenly burning the bridge

180
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
and turning against me?

181
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,160
Of course, I know what you're thinking.

182
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,760
But the internal struggle of the Zhong family

183
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,760
has nothing to do with you.

184
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,560
You're not at a disadvantage.

185
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,720
And now, you're involved in their affairs.

186
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,400
Does it mean you're ready to give up

187
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,720
working with the Zhong family?

188
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:37,880
Like father, like daughter indeed.

189
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,800
You'd threaten to drag your enemies

190
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,200
down with you

191
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
and make sure your enemies

192
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,400
have it worse than you.

193
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Therefore

194
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,920
I urge you to be careful with

195
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,000
your words and actions, Junior Lord Wu.

196
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,200
If word gets out

197
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,360
I would rather hurt myself

198
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,440
than let you live in peace.

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,160
This matter poses great risks.

200
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,160
I personally contacted him

201
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,760
and no third party knew about it

202
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
so I didn't mention it to you before.

203
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,760
There's no way the investigations

204
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,080
will point to him.

205
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,680
Qian.

206
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,200
Don't worry.

207
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,680
He knows what he can and can't say.

208
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
As long as I don't mention it

209
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,080
this matter will not be found out.

210
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,240
Indeed, it won't be found out.

211
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,760
Otherwise

212
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,000
I wouldn't have just found out now.

213
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
I didn't deliberately hide it from you.

214
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Fine.

215
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
If there's something you want to know

216
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
ask away.

217
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,080
Father, can you tell me what exactly

218
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,200
did you do to the Mu family?

219
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
All right.

220
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
I...

221
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
got it now.

222
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,960
It's getting late

223
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,280
and we have to go to Zhong's Garden tomorrow.

224
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,920
Father, go to bed early.

225
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Qian.

226
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Yes?

227
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,800
All these years

228
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,360
I had neglected you and your brother

229
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,600
a great deal

230
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,320
while chasing after power and fortune.

231
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,600
You're a sensible girl.

232
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,840
Unfortunately...

233
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,880
I didn't teach your brother well.

234
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,680
Why did you say this?

235
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
Since you got married

236
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,560
the way you speak and act has changed

237
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,160
and you have become distant.

238
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,800
I noticed all that.

239
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,600
I asked you about it

240
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,760
but you refused to tell me what happened.

241
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,920
I couldn't help but wonder

242
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,600
what had happened to you.

243
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,680
Nothing of the sort. You think too much.

244
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,600
After your brother passed away

245
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,240
I finally understood.

246
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,200
I failed as your father.

247
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,640
I never considered things from your standpoint

248
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,840
so my daughter couldn't share her feelings

249
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
with me

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,520
when she met with trouble.

251
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,120
Now...

252
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,560
as long as you are safe

253
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,840
I'm relieved.

254
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,520
Father, don't say that.

255
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,120
You've done well enough.

256
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
It was my fault.

257
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,960
On the night I got married

258
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,720
I had a dream.

259
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,720
I dreamed that everyone in our family

260
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,120
died unexpectedly.

261
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,920
That dream was so real.

262
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,120
I wondered if this was a warning

263
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,480
from the heavens.

264
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,640
That's why I changed the way I behaved.

265
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,720
But it's all right now.

266
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,200
With me here

267
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,320
I will definitely protect you

268
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,840
and the entire family.

269
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,840
My good daughter.

270
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,160
Now, go to bed.

271
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,920
Oh, heavens.

272
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,200
You are so cruel.

273
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,880
You gave me a second chance in life

274
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,440
and also a big challenge.

275
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Miss.

276
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
Go get Hua Rongzhou here.

277
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Yes, Miss.

278
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,880
My father will tender his resignation soon

279
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,920
and after our discussion earlier on

280
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
we have decided to settle down

281
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,320
in the South of the Yangtze River.

282
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,880
So, help me run an errand tomorrow.

283
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,720
Find a good house there

284
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,120
for us to settle down.

285
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,920
Why do you want me to leave earlier?

286
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,360
It feels like you're sending me away.

287
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,560
It is good to make preparations earlier

288
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,640
so that it won't be a mad rush

289
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,920
when it's time to move.

290
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,000
Which is why I need you to go settle in first

291
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
and wait for us to get there.

292
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,440
Only you and Qianzhi

293
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
remain in my compound.

294
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,200
Qianzhi will stay in Huangcheng

295
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,560
so you're the only person

296
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,520
who can help me and whom I trust.

297
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,720
But I still feel

298
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
that you're trying to drive me away.

299
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,640
You'll be away for half a month at most.

300
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,280
Can this house and I escape from the city

301
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,440
in such a short time?

302
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,480
I think it's better to leave together

303
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,880
when the time comes.

304
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,640
I'm worried about leaving you alone.

305
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,560
There are so many people in the compound.

306
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,040
What's there to worry about?

307
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
I gave you a task and all I heard were excuses.

308
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,600
If you don't want to do it, just say so.

309
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,280
It's not that I don't want to do it.

310
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,440
I'll set off tomorrow.

311
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
Good. I'll wait for your news.

312
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Remember to shortlist a few houses

313
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,760
for my father to choose from.

314
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,120
Avoid crowded areas

315
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,600
but also stay away from secluded spots.

316
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,560
We're going to live there

317
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,920
so choose carefully.

318
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,360
I won't fail you.

319
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,000
But I hope you will keep your word.

320
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Don't lie to me.

321
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,360
Didn't you say that I was a bad liar?

322
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,560
So, why are you worried?

323
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,000
Then I will set out tomorrow.

324
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,040
That's strange.

325
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,600
There is no incense in my room

326
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,040
but why do I smell a familiar aroma?

327
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Can you smell it?

328
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
Yes.

329
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,320
Can you really smell it?

330
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,280
The nice aroma is emanating from you, Miss.

331
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,200
But I'm not wearing any incense.

332
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,040
But you're always emanating this nice aroma.

333
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,520
What does it smell like?

334
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,840
I can't put my finger on it

335
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,880
but it's very special.

336
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,920
Since the first time I met you

337
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,000
it's always been this nice aroma.

338
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,680
Never mind. You're leaving tomorrow.

339
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,440
Go and get some rest now.

340
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
All right.

341
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,880
Going to the South of the Yangtze River

342
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,840
and choosing our new house...

343
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,520
I guess it will at least take him

344
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,360
half a month to go back and forth.

345
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,360
Miss, what are you talking about?

346
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,320
Nothing.

347
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,920
Do you smell something on me?

348
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
No.

349
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,080
You haven't been using any incense

350
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,840
so you won't be emanating an aroma.

351
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,880
My father will go with me today

352
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,960
so you don't have to go

353
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,080
to Zhong's Garden with me.

354
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,600
My mother has just recovered.

355
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,800
Take care of her on my behalf.

356
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,760
Are you ready to set off?

357
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,280
Miss, remember to look for me soon

358
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,840
or I will come back for you.

359
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,640
All right. Be safe.

360
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,280
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

361
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,600
—Here.                  —A toast to you all.

362
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,040
Cheers.

363
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,200
Xiwu.

364
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Xiwu.

365
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
Thank you, Mother.

366
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,040
Sis Hua, what's so urgent that you had to ask

367
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,320
to see me here?

368
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,480
You look so cold and indifferent.

369
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,840
And you've been ignoring me lately.

370
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
What, did something happen?

371
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,640
Stop pretending we are close.

372
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,240
It's disgusting.

373
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,280
What's wrong with you today?

374
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,840
Have you forgotten that Lord is allergic

375
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,480
to lychee honey?

376
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,160
Is that so?

377
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,640
I only know that Lord has a sweet tooth

378
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,160
so I guess he must also like lychee honey.

379
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,400
Is that why you alienated yourself from me?

380
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
I really didn't know...

381
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,200
Don't you get tired of acting day in and day out?

382
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,560
Sis Hua, who told you

383
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,400
that Lord couldn't have honey?

384
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,360
He told me himself.

385
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,560
You thought you could get away

386
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,520
with such a clumsy trick.

387
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Did you think

388
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,840
I wouldn't ask Zhong Xiwu directly?

389
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,320
Or did you think that no one else knew

390
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,520
what you whispered in my ear that day

391
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,080
so you could pass the buck?

392
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,680
You've really wronged me.

393
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,640
Keep this up and our conversation ends here.

394
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
What do you want to talk about?

395
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,600
About...

396
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,440
why you tried to kill me.

397
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,000
—You...                       —Since I asked

398
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,360
it shows that I've verified the fact

399
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,720
so drop your act.

400
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,680
You're a cautious person

401
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,280
you must have checked the surroundings

402
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,280
when you made your way here.

403
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,960
There is no one else here, except you and me.

404
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,560
This proves I'm not trying to trick you.

405
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,560
Why would you think so?

406
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,960
You told me yourself.

407
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,680
When I mentioned that

408
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,440
I was the assassin's target

409
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,600
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

410
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,600
you didn't seem surprised at all.

411
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,800
So, you started to be suspicious of me

412
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,200
since then.

413
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,600
You've always treated me exceptionally well.

414
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,480
And I know I don't stand apart from the others

415
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,720
so I can't help but have doubts about you.

416
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,040
I merely asked a casual question

417
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,800
but I heard something I wasn't expecting.

418
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,680
Since you asked to see me alone

419
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,800
I'm guessing you don't have evidence.

420
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,320
I still haven't figured out

421
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,880
what made you want to kill me.

422
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,520
Blame yourself

423
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,720
for overestimating your capabilities.

424
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Since you already married Zhong Yelan

425
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
using some underhand means

426
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,320
why did you come and seduce Lord?

427
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,480
You're promiscuous and greedy.

428
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,760
How disgusting. I just can't stand it.

429
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,960
Look at all the people in Zhong's Garden.

430
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,400
Nobody likes you.

431
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,480
When did I seduce Zhong Xiwu?

432
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,760
Do you think I'm stupid?

433
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
After you got married, you became

434
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,640
a frequent guest at Zhong's Garden.

435
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,000
Soon, Lord started to look at you differently.

436
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,640
Lord has always valued his brotherhood

437
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,800
with Zhong Yelan.

438
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,400
If you hadn't deliberately seduced him

439
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,560
how could he ever have designs on you?

440
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,760
As you said, Zhong Xiwu had designs on me

441
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,480
but in the end, I was the one you wanted to kill?

442
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,320
What, you would only bully the weak?

443
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,240
If you were innocent

444
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,600
I would surely leave you alone.

445
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,120
But you, an abandoned woman

446
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
are still longing for a man

447
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
you could never have.

448
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,040
How could I stand by and watch you

449
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,240
create havoc in Zhong's Garden?

450
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,040
Why are you laughing?

451
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,360
I'm laughing at your duplicity.

452
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,120
You are obviously afraid that

453
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,520
I might steal your position

454
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,480
yet you said that you did it

455
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,480
for the sake of Zhong Xiwu's family.

456
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,200
Her Highness is still alive.

457
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,800
You're just a temporary resident in the house.

458
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,320
Who are you to maintain

459
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,800
the stability inside Zhong's Garden?

460
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,560
You think you're the daughter of a butler

461
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
of the Zhong family so that gives you status.

462
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,080
But the truth is, you're an abandoned wife.

463
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,600
Who are you to criticise me?

464
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,880
So what if I'm a temporary resident?

465
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,040
At least I am unmarried.

466
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,400
And Her Highness has me in mind

467
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,880
to be the future matriarch of the Zhong family.

468
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,560
You're wary of me

469
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
because you know that

470
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,480
I can trample on you

471
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,200
if I want to.

472
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,120
The matriarch of the Zhong family?

473
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,680
Get this.

474
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,120
You will never be able to assume that position.

475
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,480
You should thank me

476
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,400
for letting you off.

477
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,840
I have no interest in becoming

478
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,640
the matriarch of the Zhong family.

479
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,280
Since you did this to me

480
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,520
I was tempted to turn your fear

481
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
into reality.

482
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,440
You bitch...

483
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,320
I told you some facts and it crushed you.

484
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,920
It seems that your pampered life

485
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,240
has made you useless.

486
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,760
Such a slow reaction.

487
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,440
Are you waiting for me to turn my face

488
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,760
so you could slap me?

489
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,040
Let go...

490
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
Go on screaming

491
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,360
if you want your face to be disfigured.

492
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,440
—I dare you!                          —Sure!

493
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,680
Do you think that I'm a kind soul?

494
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,840
Now, get this!

495
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
It's because I have no interest in becoming

496
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,760
the matriarch of the Zhong family

497
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,960
and not because I'm afraid of you.

498
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,120
I look down

499
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,680
on the position you cherish so much.

500
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,080
Are you crazy?

501
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,360
Aren't you afraid that I will ask Lord

502
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,760
to dismiss Butler Hua

503
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,200
and drive you out of Huangcheng?

504
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,240
I'm afraid you won't have a chance to do so.

505
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,920
You did this to me

506
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,640
even Lord won't be able to protect you!

507
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,200
Believe it or not, whatever I do today

508
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Zhong Xiwu will suppress it

509
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
and not pursue the matter.

510
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,680
Don't think that you will be safe and sound

511
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,800
just because your bastard brother

512
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,520
shielded you from the sword attack.

513
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,680
You and your family will die a horrible death

514
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,960
sooner or later!

515
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,240
You...

516
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,560
Blood...

517
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,160
If it wasn't for Zhong Xiwu

518
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,520
I wouldn't let you off so easily.

519
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,240
A scar in exchange for my brother's life.

520
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,880
That's a bargain for you.

521
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,120
One more toast to you.

522
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,600
Come on, Butler Zhang.

523
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,800
Master, tell Lord...

524
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Lord...

525
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
Eat this.

526
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
This mushroom is rare.

527
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
Try it.

528
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,960
If you don't like these dishes

529
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,640
I'll take you out to eat something else

530
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,000
on our way home.

531
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm afraid we won't have the chance.

532
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Father, no matter what I do later on

533
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,080
I'm doing it to protect the Hua family.

534
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,000
Qian.

535
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,080
What are you doing?

536
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,080
Lord, Your Highness.

537
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,400
I have something to report.

538
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
What's the matter?

539
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
I plead guilty.

540
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
What crime did you commit?

541
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,560
The case of Mu Yunping's embezzlement

542
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,880
a year ago.

543
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,720
He was framed by my family.

544
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Qian...

545
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,000
The confession letter of the missing Broker Qian

546
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,440
the contract between her and my family

547
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,960
and the signatures of the people involved...

548
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
I have them all here with me.

549
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,360
Bring them to me.

550
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,120
What's going on?

551
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,400
Concubine Mu, do you know about it?

552
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,640
Lord.

553
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,480
I'm just a woman

554
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,960
and don't know much about business.

555
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,960
Thanks to your benevolence

556
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,440
my father has left the city.

557
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,240
That matter is water under the bridge.

558
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,800
Butler Hua.

559
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,560
What do you have to say

560
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,920
about framing Butler Mu Yunping?

561
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
I plead guilty.

562
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,240
Detain Hua Wen'ang

563
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,480
and we will investigate this matter later.

564
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Hua Qian.

565
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,760
I know you are a sensible person.

566
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,080
I'm right indeed.

567
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,800
You have set an example for women

568
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,440
by placing righteousness before family

569
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,200
so I will not punish you.

570
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,760
—In Zhong's garden...                 —Xiwu.

571
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,640
Lord, I have something else to say.

572
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,520
My father and Butler Mu were both

573
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,640
the butlers of the Zhong family.

574
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
They had worked together for a long time.

575
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,960
They cherished their relationship.

576
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,760
My father knew nothing.

577
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,440
I was behind it all.

578
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,560
All this happened because of my jealousy.

579
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,720
I used to be in love with Master.

580
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,000
I was petty and unwilling to share him

581
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,200
with someone else.

582
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,120
I hated Mu Yao and wanted to harm her.

583
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,960
So, I came up with a vicious scheme

584
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
to eradicate her family.

585
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,760
What nonsense are you talking about?

586
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,960
Everything I said is true.

587
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,680
I secretly bribed the men who worked

588
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,080
at the incense workshop

589
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,600
to replace agarwood incense

590
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,160
with inferior ones.

591
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,800
And with the help of the broker

592
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,200
whom I introduced to Mu Yao

593
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,720
I sent the furniture with agarwood wood incense

594
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,800
into Mu Residence.

595
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,760
Both Master and Mu Yao knew about this.

596
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,960
As they're benevolent, they let the matter slide.

597
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,480
But I couldn't rest at ease

598
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,000
holding on to the evidence

599
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
of my mistakes.

600
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,200
I've been eaten up with guilt

601
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,040
so I came here to plead guilty today.

602
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,720
Since you pleaded guilty voluntarily

603
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,280
we will detain you

604
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
and question you another day.

605
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,120
Are you going to question the Hua family here?

606
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,160
My father has been upright all his life

607
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,880
but no thanks to his good-for-nothing children

608
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,080
he got dragged down.

609
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,200
Lord, Your Highness. Please consider

610
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,200
my voluntary confession today

611
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,440
and not implicate my father.

612
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,040
I'm ready to bear all the punishment alone.

613
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,520
Silly girl.

614
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,520
How can I let my daughter

615
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,000
bear the mistakes I made?

616
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,440
Lord.

617
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,040
Your Highness.

618
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Since Mu Yunping

619
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,480
the former butler of the Zhong family

620
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,680
was transferred from the north to Huangcheng

621
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,240
I became wary of him.

622
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
I was worried that

623
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,720
he might threaten my position.

624
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,840
Besides, we couldn't see eye to eye

625
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
about how we managed the shops.

626
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,040
So, we fought a lot.

627
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,360
And his workshops became increasingly

628
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,160
competitive against mine.

629
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,120
As time went by, I bore grudges against him

630
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,720
and couldn't get over them.

631
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,520
When I found out

632
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,800
that my daughter and Mu Yuping's daughter

633
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,880
were on close terms

634
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,480
I started from there.

635
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,160
Later on, I got someone

636
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,720
to expose the agarwood pills fraud

637
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and instigated the regular customers

638
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
who bought them

639
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,240
to take Mu Yunping to the magistrate court.

640
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,080
Father, you...

641
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,080
Lord, I have been a butler for decades

642
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,880
but in the end, I was blinded by greed.

643
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,280
I disregarded right and wrong

644
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,720
and only focused on eradicating my enemies.

645
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,560
I couldn't careless about righteousness.

646
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,160
Even as a child

647
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,440
she understands the basic principles of ethics.

648
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,840
Qian had warned me several times

649
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,920
but I went ahead with my scheme.

650
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,400
She's kind-hearted

651
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,560
so she took the initiative to confess.

652
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,680
She intends to take the fall for me

653
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,080
out of filial piety.

654
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,480
No! It's not like that!

655
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,880
All the other butlers

656
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,280
knew about the frequent disputes

657
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,520
between Mu Yunping and I.

658
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,600
Now that I've come clean

659
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,920
please do as you deem fit, Lord.

660
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,640
No! It's not like that!

661
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
My father has nothing to do with it.

662
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,840
I fell in love with Master

663
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,920
and disliked Mu Yao

664
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,360
so I framed her and her family.

665
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
I was behind it all!

666
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,840
Lord, she's just a girl.

667
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
How could she set up such a meticulous trap?

668
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,600
You couldn't do it.

669
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,720
<i>Bonus Footage</i>

670
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,560
This is the busiest street in this town.

671
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,960
Look at the pond

672
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,280
and the flowers.

673
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Here we are.

674
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,280
Take a look.

675
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,840
There are many knickknacks here.

676
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,720
Sir, what do you think of this house?

677
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,400
It's too noisy. She prefers a quieter place.

678
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,040
All right. Let me take you to another house.

679
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,680
Sir, this way, please.

680
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,440
This is the quietest house in this town.

681
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,880
What do you think?

682
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
Not good.

683
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,080
She's fond of gardening.

684
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,720
I think this place is remote, cold and dry.

685
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,880
Plants and trees cannot survive.

686
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Are there more?

687
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,640
Yes. Let's go to the next one.

688
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,040
This won't do either.

689
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,720
She loves fresh fruit.

690
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,000
It's better if the house has a backyard

691
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,360
where fruit trees can be planted.

692
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
Are there more?

693
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,760
Are there more?

694
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,640
I'll bring you to view more.

695
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,600
How about this house?

696
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,640
This tree is really good.

697
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,360
It provides shade so she can sit under it.

698
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,880
She enjoys sitting in a reclining chair

699
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,200
under the eaves to daydream.

700
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,520
I can tie a swing for her under the tree.

701
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,360
It'll be more comfortable than a reclining chair.

702
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,760
Sir.

703
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,560
What do you think of it?

704
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
That is it.

705
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
All right.
