<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Episode 17</font></font></i>

2
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,600
Brother Zhuqing.

3
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
I embroidered this myself.

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
Don't worry.

5
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,560
Her Highness doesn't care about me anymore.

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
Sooner or later, she will let me leave.

7
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,440
My father has arranged a marriage for me.

8
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,080
I want you to move on.

9
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,360
And I wish you wealth

10
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,880
and happiness.

11
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
You...

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,120
You're getting married?

13
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,560
Yes, next month.

14
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,040
When I asked you to take me away

15
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,480
you said you didn't want to leave your family

16
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,840
and was afraid to.

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,600
And now you've come to rub salt in my wound.

18
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,800
Zhuqing...

19
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,600
Why did I fall in love with someone like you?

20
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,880
Forget it.

21
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,520
Forget it.

22
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,960
I misjudged you.

23
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,440
I was unlucky to have met you.

24
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
You're in charge of the delivery

25
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,360
to Huangcheng this time.

26
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,520
Is it true?

27
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,400
Yes

28
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,640
but the purpose of you going

29
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,880
is to make Ruxin forget you completely.

30
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,840
She is not young anymore.

31
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,880
One of her maids sent me a message

32
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,760
saying that she still has feelings for you

33
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,960
after all these years.

34
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,800
This time

35
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,880
you will go

36
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,560
and make her forget you completely.

37
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
What if I don't want to do that?

38
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Then you will never see her again.

39
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,400
Don't forget

40
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,920
you and your family

41
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,280
are my slaves.

42
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,640
Spare a thought for her.

43
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,520
Between the son of a servant

44
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,560
and Lord of the Zhong family

45
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,080
in Huangcheng,

46
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,120
who is the better choice?

47
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,560
It's obvious.

48
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Do as I say

49
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,000
and I will return your indentures to you

50
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,200
so that you and your family will be free.

51
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,040
But if you insist on not doing it

52
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,000
you will never see Ruxin again.

53
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,760
You can take this chance

54
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
to say goodbye to her.

55
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,840
Ruxin

56
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,320
I sincerely hope

57
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,760
you will live

58
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,040
a life of wealth and glory.

59
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,600
Miss...

60
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Miss...

61
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,360
Miss, calm down.

62
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,160
Miss...

63
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,840
I agreed to come to Zhong's Garden

64
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,960
because I didn't want my father to punish him.

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,600
—Miss...                —But what did I get?

66
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,440
—Miss...                    —What did I get?

67
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,040
Miss.

68
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,840
Miss, Jin Lin is a servant.

69
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,480
You have better choices.

70
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
I'm sure your father did the right thing.

71
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
Better choices?

72
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,720
What other choices do I have?

73
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
I suffered for so long

74
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,520
and got this outcome.

75
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,200
—Tell me.                              —I...

76
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,200
Why am I the only one feeling miserable?

77
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,240
Calm down, Miss...

78
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,120
Love is the most worthless thing

79
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,680
in the world.

80
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,640
Since nothing is going right for me

81
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,040
I shall make the rest feel what I'm feeling.

82
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,800
Take a seat, Second Aunt.

83
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,200
Did you come alone, Second Aunt?

84
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,920
Yes.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,320
We hadn't seen each other for a long time

86
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,680
and I heard you missed us

87
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,360
so I made my way here immediately.

88
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Zhong's Garden is amazing.

89
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,920
Everything here is of much better quality

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,840
than what your uncle's using.

91
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,840
I'm grateful to Her Highness for her care.

92
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,560
Your mother had praised your sister

93
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,520
for being sensible when she was in the city.

94
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,000
In my opinion, you're much more sensible

95
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,480
than her.

96
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,320
She lives with my sister.

97
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
It's only right that she thinks

98
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
my sister is more likable.

99
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,760
Not at all.

100
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
How can your sister compare to you?

101
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,840
You have spent so much time with Her Highness.

102
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,440
It's highly possible that

103
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,680
you'll be the Zhong family's...

104
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,600
Anyway, our family

105
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,120
will be depending on you.

106
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,360
How are my cousin and uncle?

107
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
I haven't seen them for a while

108
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,800
and I miss them a little bit.

109
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,560
It's all right. I'll tell them

110
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,160
to come to see you.

111
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
That will be great.

112
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,360
I have something to ask my uncle.

113
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,880
After all, my father often communicates

114
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
with him through letters.

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
That's true.

116
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,960
Have some tea, Second Aunt.

117
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,160
All right.

118
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,920
How have you been doing?

119
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,760
Can you tell

120
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,240
what kind of incense it is today?

121
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,600
It's a little familiar to me

122
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,360
but I can't put my finger on it.

123
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,200
Mother, be careful.

124
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,160
It's the Mid-Autumn incense.

125
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,560
—Butler Hua.     —You're indeed Head Butler.

126
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,760
You could tell from afar.

127
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
Come, my dear.

128
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,560
Mother, I'll take a seat over there.

129
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,360
—It's been a long time.             —Indeed.

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,520
How's your business?

131
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,640
—What happened?               —Here, please.

132
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Eat your food and be good, all right?

133
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,920
Is he going to eat more?

134
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,120
He can't even pass through this wide aisle.

135
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Doesn't he know how fat he is?

136
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,040
Keep it down. Isn't he your son?

137
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,360
All right.

138
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,520
The Mid-Autumn incense is very expensive.

139
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,120
Ordinary butlers like us can't afford it at all.

140
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,560
We can only smell it here.

141
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,000
No wonder I didn't recognise it.

142
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,960
Yes. Hua Residence must have a lot of it

143
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,720
that's why he could identify it.

144
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,360
That's why people say

145
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,720
the Hua family is second

146
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,960
to the Zhong family in wealth.

147
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,480
There are some paintings and calligraphy.

148
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,760
May I have you appraise them?

149
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
Sure...

150
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,800
Hello, everyone.

151
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,240
It's been a long time.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,840
Father. Mother.

153
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
Qian...

154
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Come...

155
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,280
Qian.

156
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,760
Princess Royal has arrived.

157
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,400
Greetings, Lord, Your Highness.

158
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Take a seat, everyone.

159
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,400
Thank you, Lord.

160
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Wish all of you a happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

161
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,160
You have worked hard in the past year.

162
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Let me offer you a toast.

163
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,280
Make yourselves at home.

164
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

165
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,200
—Please, sir.              —Let me help you.

166
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,440
Why are you sitting here, Qian?

167
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,960
Eat your food.

168
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,440
I just want to talk to you.

169
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,440
I haven't seen you for a month.

170
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,160
You seem to have lost weight again.

171
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,280
Let's talk after the banquet is over.

172
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,280
The last time you were in my room

173
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,520
you told me you would come to see me

174
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,040
but you didn't.

175
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,600
The nerve of you to bring this up.

176
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,200
Think about what you did

177
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,360
and cause me less trouble

178
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,840
I don't have to be so worried.

179
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,400
I-I-I didn't screw up anything this time.

180
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,760
What? Isn't that the way it's supposed to be?

181
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,120
You want me to praise you for this?

182
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,920
Say another word and I'll be done with you.

183
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All right.

184
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,560
Qian, we're at a banquet.

185
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,360
Can you be nicer to him?

186
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,000
It's been a month

187
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,120
I'm still waiting for your reply, Father.

188
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
So, I'm now asking you in person.

189
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,240
Have you made up your mind, Father?

190
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,680
It wasn't easy for us

191
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,920
to reach where we are today.

192
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,200
Don't mention this matter again.

193
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,400
All right. I understood.

194
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,480
Father, I have tried my best.

195
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,760
Qian, you worry too much.

196
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,480
Why not go home

197
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,040
and get a few days' rest?

198
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,160
That won't be necessary.

199
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
Where are you going?

200
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Qian!

201
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,480
Who did she get her temper from?

202
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,520
Are you going to leave, Miss Hua?

203
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,200
Lord.

204
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
The divorce letter will be sent

205
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,440
to your residence later.

206
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,120
—The divorce letter?                   —Yes.

207
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,440
It has my seal on it

208
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,000
so it can take effect

209
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,120
without you signing your names.

210
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,040
Thank you, Lord.

211
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
I'll go back and wait for it.

212
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
Hua Qian...

213
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,000
Lord, we're in Zhong's Garden.

214
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,280
Many people are going through here.

215
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,400
No one knows about the divorce yet.

216
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,480
I don't want rumours to spread.

217
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,640
That will ruin your reputation too.

218
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Who is he?

219
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,640
He is Hua Rongzhou

220
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,800
a guard of Zhong Residence.

221
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,000
He's like a block of wood.

222
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,320
He offended you out of concern

223
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,600
for my reputation.

224
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
His surname is Hua?

225
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,160
We share the same surname

226
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
but we are not related.

227
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,640
My father told me not to go too far.

228
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,520
Lord, I'd better get back.

229
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,960
Does he look familiar to you?

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,800
He's Mistress's personal guard.

231
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,280
I have seen him several times before.

232
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,600
I think I have seen him way back.

233
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,400
Get Lin Jiang to check his identity.

234
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,640
Yes, Lord.

235
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,440
I know you're at an age

236
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,880
when you're quick to stand up for justice

237
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,880
but you must consider who you are dealing with.

238
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,840
If you offend Lord

239
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
even I may not be able to save you.

240
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,280
Mistress, Guard Hua did that

241
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,080
to protect your reputation.

242
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
After all, the news of your divorce

243
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
hasn't been known.

244
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,640
If someone were to see that

245
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
tongues will wag.

246
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
I know.

247
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Here's to you.

248
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,320
All right. Let's drink it together.

249
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,560
Kill Zhong Xiwu to avenge our family!

250
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Protect Lord!

251
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Xiwu!

252
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Run!

253
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,360
Let's go, Miss! Hurry!

254
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,520
Let's go, Miss!

255
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,200
Let's go, Your Highness!

256
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,440
Let's go, Your Highness!

257
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,200
—Qian...Shen...!                  —Let's go!

258
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Qian, let's go!

259
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,880
—My dear...                —Hurry! Let's go!

260
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
—Hurry!                               —Shen!

261
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,800
Mother...

262
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
My dear...

263
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,120
—Come on.          —What are you looking at?

264
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,560
—Go!                                 —Hurry!

265
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,560
—Hua Rongzhou!                   —Go! Quick!

266
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Let's go!

267
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,320
—Shen...                           —Brother.

268
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Get up. Quick!

269
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,240
—Father.                            —Qian...

270
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,520
—Qian!                              —Father!

271
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Go.

272
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Go protect Cuizhu.

273
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,440
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Am I their target?</font></font></i>

274
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Watch out!

275
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,720
—My dear...                           —Shen!

276
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Hurry.

277
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,720
Qian!

278
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,000
Brother!

279
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,120
—Shen!                                —Shen!

280
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,240
Brother.

281
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,360
Qian...

282
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,160
Did it hurt this much

283
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,200
when you got hit by an arrow?

284
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,760
Why did you take the blow for me?

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,560
Qian, you also shield me from Master

286
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,880
didn't you?

287
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,000
I... I am your elder brother.

288
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,400
How could I stand by and do nothing

289
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,720
when I saw you were in danger?

290
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,120
Brother...

291
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,400
Qian, don't be afraid...

292
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,800
I-I'm fine.

293
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,960
I'll protect you.

294
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,200
I'll protect you.

295
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,760
I'm with you. I'll...

296
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,120
I'll take you home.

297
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,120
No, Brother. You'll be fine.

298
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,800
I'll take you to...

299
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,480
Qian...

300
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Qian!

301
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,480
Qian!

302
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,800
Qian...

303
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,160
Qian...

304
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,160
Lord.

305
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,800
The reception hall has been cleaned up.

306
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
Have the assassins been caught?

307
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,280
There were many women in the hall

308
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,760
which made it hard for the guards to catch them.

309
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,280
Most of the assassins fled

310
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,480
and the few we caught

311
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,200
took poison and committed suicide.

312
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,600
They also took a few ladies

313
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,400
as hostages as they fled.

314
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
Who are they?

315
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,080
Butler Li's eldest daughter

316
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,840
Butler Wu's wife

317
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,600
Concubine Mu...

318
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,520
and Mistress.

319
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,000
Magistrate Wang has ordered a lockdown

320
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
and Master is searching for them.

321
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,120
Go assist Master.

322
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,320
No, we can't, Lord.

323
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,040
We are your private guards.

324
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,920
We don't show up until we have to.

325
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,720
Otherwise, we're like ordinary guards.

326
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,840
Saving them is the priority.

327
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,200
—Lord!                           —Yes, Lord.

328
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,240
Let's go there. Come on!

329
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Nothing here, Master.

330
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
—Search.                       —Yes, Master.

331
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Get out of the way.

332
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,080
No suspicious people are found, Master.

333
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,400
—Keep searching.               —Yes, Master.

334
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,360
Nothing here either, Master.

335
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,880
—Keep searching.               —Yes, Master.

336
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,400
—Nothing here either.   —Carry on searching.

337
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,520
Yes, Master.

338
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,760
Master, there are no suspicious people nearby.

339
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,000
Search more thoroughly.

340
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Yes, Master.

341
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,120
Master, are you all right?

342
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,600
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">If you want to save Hua Qian and Mu Yao</font></font></i>

343
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,480
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">come to the cliff at Eastern Town alone</font></font></i>

344
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,480
—Nanfeng.                         —I'm here.

345
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,960
Continue the search with the men.

346
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,960
Where are you going, Master? I'll go with you.

347
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,920
No. You carry on with the search.

348
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,400
—Keep searching.                  —Yes, sir.

349
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
Mu Yao.

350
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,040
Mu Yao.

351
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,520
Mu Yao.

352
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,600
You finally woke up.

353
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,720
Who are you?

354
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,880
What's the point of tying me up

355
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,080
if you want to kill me?

356
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,560
It's not us who want to kill you.

357
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,120
What do you want?

358
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,360
Do you have a grudge against me?

359
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,040
You'll know later.

360
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,040
How is my brother?

361
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,600
Mu Yao, you finally woke up.

362
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,440
Come on. Can you be like a normal person?

363
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,920
Look down. It's a cliff!

364
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,520
—Zhong Yelan.                         —Stop!

365
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,000
Zhong Yelan, how's my brother?

366
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,520
How is he, Zhong Yelan?

367
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,200
You came here really quickly.

368
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,240
But you'd better stay back.

369
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,280
How dare you!

370
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,800
Do you know who you have kidnapped?

371
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,320
We did it. Of course, we know.

372
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,320
I came alone.

373
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,560
Tell me. What do you want?

374
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,040
Zhong Yelan, pick one.

375
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,480
What nonsense are you talking about?

376
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,480
What exactly do you want?

377
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,480
We don't want anything.

378
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
We just want to see you and your family suffer.

379
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,800
Are you from the Ge family?

380
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,960
Yeah. You destroyed my family

381
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,840
so today you shall have a taste

382
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,320
of losing your beloved ones!

383
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Stop!

384
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,040
You did it to yourselves.

385
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,760
And if you want to take revenge

386
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,760
wouldn't it be easier to just kill Zhong Yelan?

387
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,880
Why did you abduct us?

388
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,360
I heard you love your wife

389
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,120
and concubine very much

390
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
so it must be difficult for you

391
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,560
to make a choice, right?

392
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,080
Yes. Their lives are in your hands now.

393
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,000
Pick one

394
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,280
and we will release the other one.

395
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,040
But the unchosen one will be food

396
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,360
for the fish in the lake.

397
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,360
The lake?

398
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,840
Which one will you pick?

399
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,720
Why don't you pick none?

400
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Save yourself from self-blame

401
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,560
for only picking one.

402
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
Who choreographed this act?

403
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,240
You did all this just to make a joke?

404
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,600
Is this your first time kidnapping?

405
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
Don't you know you should conduct a frisk search

406
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,520
before holding someone hostage?

407
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,160
You owe me one, Mu Yao.

408
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,960
—Mistress!                            —Qian!

409
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Qian!

410
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,120
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I never expected that one day I would be glad</font></font></i>

411
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I was once exiled.</font></font></i>

412
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,520

413
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,160
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I can't stay here.</font></font></i>

414
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,960
Beasts will come out at night.

00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,560
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">When I was in Lingnan</font></font></i>

416
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,320

417
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480

419
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,000
What are you trying to prove?

420
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,840
You should have stayed on the cliff

421
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,000
and wait for Zhong Yelan to make a choice.

422
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,880
He could be so nervous

423
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,680
that he made the wrong choice

424
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,200
and I wouldn't be the one he gave up.

425
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,600
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">The terrain here is extremely rugged.</font></font></i>

426

428

<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I doubt it's them.</font></font></i>

429
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,600
I finally found you.

430
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,760
I'm so glad it's you!

431
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,160
I was freaked out just now.

432
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
I didn't expect you to find me.

433
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,840
I finally have someone by my side.

434
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,480
I gave you this bracelet

435
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,000
for your self-defence

436
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,000
not for you to kill yourself.

437
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,200
Are you Hua Rongzhou?

438
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,840
No bone fractures.

439
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,280
You would need some ointment.

440
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
I'll carry you on my back.

441
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I can walk.

442
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,160
We've walked a long distance.

443
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,600
Why don't I see anyone around?

444
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,520
By the way, my brother...

445
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
Get on my back.

446
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm all right.

447
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
Get on my back.

448
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Hurry.

449
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,200
I can't hold my liquor well.

450
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,120
I'm afraid I'll do something embarrassing later.

451
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,240
I need you to carry me downstairs.

452
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,240
Mistress, you know you can't hold your liquor.

453
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,880
—Hurry and go.          —Then why did you...

454
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,840
What's the matter?

455
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,440
How did you know I was there?

456
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,480
What happened later?

457
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,040
How is my brother?

458
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,720
After you and Concubine Mu were taken away

459
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,920
I followed Master to the top of the mountain.

460
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,360
I don't know much about what happened

461
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,480
after the banquet

462
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,080
and the condition of Young Master Hua.

463
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,160
My brother must be fine, right?

464
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,720
You said you followed Master

465
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,960
to the mountain top

466
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,480
but I didn't see you.

467
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,800
You never pay attention to me.

468
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,720
I'm used to it.

469
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
No, that's not true.

470
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,720
I was dizzy from being hung up on the cliff

471
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,920
so I didn't notice you.

472
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,400
Then, do you remember...

473
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,640
when was the first time you met me?

474
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,200
Was it at the ancestor worship ceremony?

475
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,560
As I expected.

476
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,000
What do you mean?

477
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,600
Mistress, do you remember

478
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,320
you asked for my name four times?

479
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,560
No way, I...

480
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,800
Why do I smell blood?

481
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Are you hurt?

482
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,680
Just a small scratch.

483
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,000
A scratch? Did you get hurt in the woods?

484
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,960
Put me down. I can walk by myself.

485
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,200
I have medicine on me.

486
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,400
By the way, how did you get here?

487
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,000
And why were you alone?

488
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
Who else did you expect to see?

489
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,440
Watch your tone!

490
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,680
How dare you talk to me like that?

491
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,000
How disrespectful! I'm your mistress.

492
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,920
You're divorced now, aren't you?

493
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I...

494
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,360
I am older than you

495
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,880
so you still have to respect me.

496
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,720
What should I call you...

497
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,000
after your divorce?

498
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,200
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Right.</font></font></i>

499
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,240
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">When they leave Huangcheng with me</font></font></i>

500
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,720
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">should they call me Miss?</font></font></i>

501
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,960
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">But I would like them to be free</font></font></i>

502
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,480
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">and live their own lives.</font></font></i>

503
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,480
Or did it never cross your mind

504
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
to take me with you

505
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,920
when you leave Zhong Residence?

506
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
That's not true.

507
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
For Cuizhu's sake

508
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,240
I'll take you away from Zhong Residence.

509
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,480
Why did you stop? Are you tired?

510
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,720
I said I could walk by myself.

511
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,240
Get some rest. I'll...

512
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,760
Don't match me up with Cuizhu again.

513
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,040
Be it playing in the yard

514
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,080
or when you were attacked

515
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,320
I didn't want you to push me to Cuizhu.

516
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,000
I told you to rescue Cuizhu. You heard me.

517
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
Then, why didn't you...

518
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,440
Because I have a crush on someone.

519
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,080
Who is she?

520
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,120
Is she someone in my compound?

521
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,440
Yes.

522
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,120
It's not Cuizhu. Is it Qianzhi?

523
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,200
—No.                               —Yinxing?

524
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,200
No.

525
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,680
I've named all the people in my compound.

526
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,720
Don't tell me it's me.

527
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,600
Say something.

528
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,840
Did you say something?

529
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,320
Did you say something just now?

530
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,680
You are a good-looking man

531
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,720
but just to be clear

532
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,240
I no longer care about worldly pleasures

533
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,600
and don't have the mood to fall in love

534
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
not to mention

535
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,040
I don't like men who are younger than me.

536
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,160
If there was someone like Hua Rongzhou

537
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,400
in the previous life

538
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,520
who protected me like his life depended on it

539
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,480
would I have not made all those mistakes?

540
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,600
Mistress, can I quit being your guard

541
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,600
after I help you get what you want?

542
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,800
Sure you can. You're a free man.

543
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,840
But how do you know what I want?

544
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,880
Why are you keeping silent again?

545
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
Say something.

546
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,200
Isn't this my room in Hua Residence, Qianzhi?

547
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Yes, it is.

548
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,400
Hua Rongzhou brought me back here?

549
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Yes.

550
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,360
Thank goodness. I panicked for a while.

551
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,880
I thought I got reborn again.

552
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,280
By the way, how is my brother?

553
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,720
I believe he wasn't too badly hurt.

554
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
Qianzhi.

555
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,240
Why are you crying?

556
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,720
Mistress, Young Master Hua...

557
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,520
Mistress!

558
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,040
Stop.

559
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,680
Stop.

560
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,360
Where's my brother?

561
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
He...

562
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,280
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">Bonus footage</font></font></i>

563
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,840
Tell the cooks to prepare

564
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,440
some bamboo shoot soup for Qi Ruxin.

565
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,920
It's her favourite dish.

566
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,560
I see that she hasn't eaten anything.

567
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,440
Yes, Your Highness.

568
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
Throw it away.

569
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Yes.

570
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,000
What happened to that girl?
