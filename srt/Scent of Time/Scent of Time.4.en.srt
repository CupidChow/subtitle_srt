1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,720
<i>Episode 4</i>

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,640
Mistress.

4
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,320
Your brother got in a fight in a tea house.

5
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,440
What is it this time?

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,720
Someone from your family came

7
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,080
and said that he got in a fight

8
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,320
in a tea house over a woman.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,440
They asked you to go take a look.

10
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,360
A woman again?

11
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,320
Why did they come to me?

12
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Where's my father?

13
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,840
Your parents went to visit your grandparents.

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,320
They can't make it back.

15
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,360
So the servants came to you.

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,600
I see.

17
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,000
No wonder he's out of control.

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,160
You're dead meat. Let me tell you.

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
You'll all die here.

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,840
Sir, my father has long been ill.

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,480
He depends on the money I make here.

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,080
I can't go with you. I beg you.

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,400
Please let me off.

24
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,080
I told you. I'll take care of him

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,080
as long as you come home with me.

26
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,440
Is there anything else you want?

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,240
She's trying to be indirect.

28
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,360
Do you need her

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,600
to tell you that she doesn't like you?

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,640
Great. You just upset me.

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
Just you wait and see.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,600
Brother, haven't you had enough?

33
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Qian, my dear sister.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
Thank god you came.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,800
Are you here to help me?

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,320
They're so ignorant

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,320
that they had the audacity to beat me.

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,960
Qian, how many men did you come with?

39
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,360
Give them hell!

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,360
What makes you think I'm here to help you?

41
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,360
How dare you ask your family for help

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,320
when you are being the bully.

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,080
Do you think your family own the city?

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
You...

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,680
This gentleman here, you're exaggerating.

46
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,400
What makes you think

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,680
I'm here to help him?

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,360
We all heard him calling you sister.

49
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,000
Master Zhong is a brilliant man.

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,680
But he's ruining his reputation

51
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,360
for being unable to control his family now.

52
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,680
There must be some misunderstanding.

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,000
Not really.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,360
I merely speak my mind.

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,440
It's a pity that the brilliant Master Zhong

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,480
passed off fish eyes for pearls

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,360
and got trapped by a woman.

58
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,600
You... I...

59
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,160
<i>I've never seen them before.</i>

60
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,760
<i>They look like passersby</i>

61
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,760
<i>but they sound like they knew</i>

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
<i>how I married Zhong Yelan.</i>

63
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,160
<i>Who did my brother mess with?</i>

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,760
—Qian, careful.                  —Who is he?

65
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
That's...

66
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,120
Who the hell are you?

67
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,600
Are you out of your mind?

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,440
There are so many guards here.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I don't see why they need

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
a tea house waiter to help them.

71
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,720
Men, tie him up!

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Who are you to tie me up?

73
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,760
Well, you maligned the Zhong family.

74
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
I didn't!

75
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
And tie him up, too.

76
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
Take them to the courthouse.

77
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,720
Qian, are you making a mistake?

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,080
I'm pointing at you.

79
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,760
Spending some days in jail

80
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,080
will help you fix your fault.

81
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I...

82
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,520
And you.

83
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm not the magistrate

84
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,400
so I can't judge this case.

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,440
But you offended me repeatedly.

86
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,600
My temper isn't exactly great myself.

87
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,160
So

88
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,320
you can explain yourselves to the magistrate

89
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,520
together.

90
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Qian...

91
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,800
What's your name?

92
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,600
Rongzhou...

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,600
Rongzhou...

94
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Zhou Yong, right?

95
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,280
Thank you for your kindness.

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
You look young.

97
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,840
Remember to protect yourself

98
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,680
before helping others.

99
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
Nothing can be more important

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,280
than yourself.

101
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,240
The Zhong family will pay for your treatment.

102
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,280
No matter if you were just going with the flow

103
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,560
or trying to leave an impression

104
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,880
I know you did it to protect me

105
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,680
and I appreciate your kindness.

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,320
But you should know

107
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,440
that not everyone

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,840
would do what I'm doing for you.

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,840
Qian... I was wrong.

110
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,120
I'll never do that again.

111
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,960
I don't want to go to the courthouse.

112
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
—Get off me.                     —No. Never.

113
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,680
Hold on, Mistress.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
I apologise on behalf of my brother

115
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,080
for offending you.

116
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,320
He's outspoken and forthright

117
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,840
which makes him easily misled.

118
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't let him get to you, Mistress.

119
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,240
Don't apologise to me.

120
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
I'm staying out of this.

121
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
Just explain to the magistrate.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,880
How about this?

123
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,680
The two of us will apologise to you

124
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,480
and let this matter slide.

125
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
This was just an argument.

126
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,240
It's better not to take it to the courthouse.

127
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Exactly.

128
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,360
I think the gentleman makes sense.

129
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,840
I can let it slide.

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,080
But it is not your choice to make.

131
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,520
It depends on the person involved.

132
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,800
If Mr Hua stops badgering me

133
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,160
I-I-I'll let it go.

134
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,920
I won't badger you.

135
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,560
Never. Go... hurry up.

136
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,600
Send my brother back

137
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,960
and ground him

138
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,440
before my parents return.

139
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,600
—Yes, Mistress.                —Qian, you...

140
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,680
Sir, please.

141
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
Go.

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,080
<i>Who are they?</i>

143
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
Qianzhi.

144
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,840
Send someone to follow them and see...

145
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,280
You impressed me, Mistress.

146
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,680
Lord.

147
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
I was watching you from upstairs.

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
You're different

149
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,000
for being so decisive.

150
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,400
You're too kind, Lord.

151
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,480
A girl changes after getting married.

152
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,800
Why didn't my senior come with you?

153
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,120
This is my family matter.

154
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,240
It's better that he doesn't come.

155
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
I see.

156
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,080
I've been out for so long.

157
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,320
Time to get back.

158
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,600
Can you give me a ride home?

159
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
What?

160
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,040
My carriage is too small for two.

161
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,360
If you're not averse to the humble carriage

162
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,200
this way, please.

163
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,040
Did you go out alone today, Lord?

164
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,040
On foot?

165
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,840
<i>Stop embarrassing yourself.</i>

166
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,720
<i>Come on. Not a single word?</i>

167
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,080
<i>How odd.</i>

168
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,080
<i>I'm his sister-in-law, to some extent.</i>

169
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,920
<i>Isn't it inappropriate to share my carriage?</i>

170
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,760
<i>What does he want?</i>

171
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Sister-in-law.

172
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Sister-in-law.

173
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,040
Excuse me.

174
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,720
For what?

175
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,480
We've arrived at Zhong's Garden.

176
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,120
Thank you for the ride, Sister-in-law.

177
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,760
He'd fall for Mu Yao in the future.

178
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,720
What was I thinking about?

179
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Let's go.

180
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,680
Have you ever seen the two men before?

181
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,760
No.

182
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,360
They may be passersby in the city.

183
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,000
Sure doesn't look like it.

184
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,520
Do we need to arrest them?

185
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,440
What for?

186
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
They did nothing wrong today.

187
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,080
<i>Why are there so many people and things</i>

188
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,680
<i>that had never appeared before?</i>

189
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,200
<i>Did my life change</i>

190
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,000
<i>along with my new choices?</i>

191
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,040
<i>But the important things may not change.</i>

192
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,360
Wouldn't you like some more food, Mistress?

193
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,840
Housemaid Li

194
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,240
when will the ancestral worship take place?

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,360
It's over two months away.

196
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,280
Is there anything you need, Mistress?

197
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,800
<i>Fortunately</i>

198
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,520
<i>it's not too late for me</i>

199
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,120
<i>to make my plan.</i>

200
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,840
Mistress, Master Zhong's here.

201
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Master.

202
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,600
I told you not to be so formal with me.

203
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,800
Her Highness ordered me

204
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
not to break the rules.

205
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,840
I just came back and haven't had dinner.

206
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,480
Perfect timing.

207
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,840
Why are you eating so little?

208
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,880
I've had some food

209
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,600
before you came.

210
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,000
Have I neglected you these days?

211
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,520
Why didn't you come to me

212
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
for your brother's problem today?

213
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
You have to get on

214
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,440
with a lot of things every day.

215
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,440
I won't trouble you

216
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,840
as long as I can handle it.

217
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,520
We're husband and wife.

218
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,600
Why treat me like a stranger now?

219
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,000
His problem was too absurd

220
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,960
for you to handle it personally.

221
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,480
Or others would regard us as bullies.

222
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,440
He listens to me.

223
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,040
So, I can handle it myself.

224
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,880
Qian.

225
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,680
You seem distant

226
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,400
since we got married.

227
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,160
You're overthinking this, Master.

228
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,680
Now that we're married

229
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,800
I should fulfil my duties.

230
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,800
It was my fault

231
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,000
to have ignored you since our wedding.

232
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,800
I'll be nicer to you from now on.

233
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,920
What about Mu Yao?

234
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,520
How would you treat her?

235
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,680
I'll bear my responsibilities

236
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,680
since I've married you.

237
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,720
I'm not asking for that.

238
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,200
Why not take your time to think

239
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
instead of making a decision hastily?

240
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,760
Or it may be unfair for all of us.

241
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,600
—Qian...                 —It's getting late.

242
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,600
Have an early night, Master.

243
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,320
Master Zhong wanted to stay.

244
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
Why did you drive him away?

245
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,560
You know it.

246
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,000
He's thinking of someone else.

247
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,320
Mistress, you're married

248
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,880
to him.

249
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,560
You can't require him to think about you

250
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,960
every minute.

251
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,160
Being a wife is different from being a girl.

252
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,960
You must weigh the pros and cons

253
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,240
instead of your feelings.

254
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,920
I understand what you said.

255
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,440
But I don't want to...

256
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,040
<i>make the same mistake.</i>

257
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,520
You're getting more skilful at being a maid.

258
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,760
Thank you for taking me in, Master.

259
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,520
How long are you going to stay?

260
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,520
Don't tell me you like being a maid.

261
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,280
Until I find the one who set my family up.

262
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,560
You insisted on staying

263
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,800
only to investigate the case of your family?

264
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,080
Qian doesn't want to be involved

265
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,560
in disputes.

266
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,680
You were good friends.

267
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,040
Why can't you let her go?

268
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,160
Did I say Hua Qian was the one

269
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,440
who framed up my father?

270
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,760
You know it better than anyone else

271
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,360
and are just lying to yourself.

272
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,920
I won't argue with you.

273
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,000
Qian's my wife.

274
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,840
She's innocent.

275
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,000
If you insist on being against her

276
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
then I can't let you stay here anymore.

277
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,360
I took the risk

278
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,120
and took you in

279
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,600
on account of the old days.

280
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
Now you can say whatever you want

281
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,240
to others when you leave.

282
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,240
I was once deceived

283
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,800
by the innocence you claimed she has.

284
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Now I have seen her true colours

285
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,480
but you haven't.

286
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,800
For me

287
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
Hua Qian is as vicious as a snake.

288
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,280
—You...                       —Three months.

289
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,120
If I can't prove that

290
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,880
my father was set up in three months

291
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,520
I'll leave Huangcheng

292
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,080
and never come back.

293
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,680
And I won't say anything bad

294
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,440
about you or her.

295
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,240
If you trust her

296
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,920
why would you worry about my investigation?

297
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,920
I also want to know

298
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,480
whether she set me up

299
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,800
or that I've misunderstood things.

300
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,920
I did investigate.

301
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,920
No one from her family

302
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
was involved in your case.

303
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,320
The one who brought the case has nothing

304
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,120
to do with her and her family.

305
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,960
Of course, you have no idea what she said

306
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,200
between me and her.

307
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,240
And you won't believe me even if I told you.

308
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,720
I can't let you stay around her

309
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
with a mind like this.

310
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,160
I swear

311
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
I only want to uncover

312
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,440
the truth of my family's case.

313
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,720
I'm not trying to frame her.

314
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,400
If she has nothing to do with the case

315
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,680
I won't hurt her.

316
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,080
If I should break my vow

317
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,600
I'll die and rot in hell.

318
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,560
Fine.

319
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,720
I'll give you three months.

320
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,560
This Qianhua perfume

321
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,680
smells different this time.

322
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
It was newly made with

323
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,400
the same fresh jasmine flowers.

324
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,560
It's a bit different from

325
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,080
what we're issued with.

326
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,640
I'll stop using this one

327
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,320
if you don't like it.

328
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,920
No, it's okay.

329
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,600
How long have I been married?

330
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,400
About a month.

331
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,920
Time passes by so slowly.

332
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,800
How so?

333
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,840
I think this month just flashed by.

334
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
You won't understand.

335
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
When is the ancestral worship?

336
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,880
There're 49 more days to go.

337
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
It's the 24th time

338
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,520
that you've asked me, Mistress.

339
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,400
So slow.

340
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
How slow it is.

341
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,320
Why so eager to attend the ceremony

342
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,080
this time, Mistress?

343
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,640
You'd always faked being ill

344
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,240
to avoid it.

345
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,600
It's different.

346
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,840
The ceremony this year is a big deal.

347
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,960
It was their chance to pledge their love.

348
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,240
But now

349
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,640
it's my only opportunity

350
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,240
to correct the mistake.

351
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,680
Pledge their love? Who?

352
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,120
Secrets mustn't be revealed.

353
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,080
You worry about all things

354
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,760
except for what's truly important, Mistress.

355
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,160
It's been a month since your wedding.

356
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,120
But the master sleeps at the study every day.

357
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,800
If this gets out...

358
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Mistress, Nanfeng is here.

359
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,800
Greetings, Mistress.

360
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,000
What do you want this time?

361
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,120
Mistress, the master ordered me to send it here.

362
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
What is it?

363
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,560
A <i>guqin</i>.

364
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,640
It's late.

365
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,360
Why aren't you staying here, Master?

366
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
Did Mistress tell you to leave?

367
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,480
That's understandable.

368
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,400
After all, you didn't come back

369
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
on the wedding night.

370
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,560
And you left her alone to visit her family.

371
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,680
Did you just learn how to talk?

372
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,160
Master, I didn't ask for that.

373
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,760
Why not take your time to think

374
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,640
instead of making a decision hastily?

375
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,000
Or it may be unfair for all of us.

376
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,240
Tell me. How can I make it up to her?

377
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,040
You finally see sense, Master.

378
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,640
Well, it's simple.

379
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,960
Mistress is a kind person.

380
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,000
You can do it

381
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,160
by finding out her hobbies.

382
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
Find out her hobbies...

383
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,440
The <i>guqin</i> was made by Chang Jing

384
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
the best craftsman.

385
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,000
It's the only one in the world.

386
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,000
You're well-known for your <i>guqin</i> skills.

387
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,960
Master managed to find it for you as a gift

388
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,520
since you can make the best use of it.

389
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,360
Help me thank him for that.

390
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Yinxing, put it in storage.

391
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,000
Won't you try playing it, Mistress?

392
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,240
I'll try it another day.

393
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,120
I'll take my leave.

394
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,720
You used to get so excited

395
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,400
when you see a great <i>guqin</i>.

396
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,560
It seems that

397
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,360
you're not interested in it at all.

398
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
I noticed that

399
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,040
you seem to dislike Nanfeng.

400
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,640
Because he always brings bad news.

401
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,000
Once on your wedding night

402
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
and the day you visited home...

403
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,240
Qianzhi, that's ridiculous.

404
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,600
I think he's a nice guy.

405
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,000
Mistress

406
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,640
this board is made of fine torreya wood.

407
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,720
Both the pieces and the box

408
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,960
are made of natural jade.

409
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,880
Master managed to find it for you as a gift

410
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
since you can make the best use of it.

411
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,560
Mistress, Master took great effort

412
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,680
to find this hare-hair brush.

413
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
You have great handwriting

414
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,360
and will make the best use of it.

415
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,840
It's the best paper and inkstone in the city.

416
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,400
You can paint with it

417
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,040
and make the best use of it.

418
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,720
Put them in storage.

419
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,120
Put them in storage.

420
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,240
Put them in storage.

421
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,760
Mistress, Master is so nice to you.

422
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,400
He knows that you're good at literary arts

423
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,120
and prepared these for you.

424
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
Just put them in storage.

425
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
She put everything I sent in storage?

426
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,320
—Yes.           —She didn't even touch them?

427
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,720
Yes.

428
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,960
You said she would calm down

429
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,080
if I found out her hobbies.

430
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,320
Maybe it was

431
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,000
because you acted too late.

432
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,760
Yes. After all, it's been a month

433
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,920
after the wedding.

434
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Maybe all she needs is to see you

435
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,480
instead of these gifts.

436
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,200
I don't even know

437
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,920
why I sought your advice.

438
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,480
Not bringing anything with you, Master?

439
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,240
—I don't need to.  —Bring something, Master.

440
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,400
Take something with you.

441
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,080
I remember you have a sweet tooth.

442
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,600
So I brought you some dessert.

443
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,760
She suffered from toothache before marriage.

444
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,080
The physician said she shouldn't

445
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,400
eat dessert any more.

446
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,760
You're so kind, Master.

447
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,360
I'll put it on the table right now.

448
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,400
Is there anything wrong

449
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,520
that brought you here, Master?

450
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,600
Don't you...

451
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,840
like those gifts?

452
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,120
Of course, I do.

453
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,160
Then, why...

454
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,480
I cancelled the workshop inspection today.

455
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,280
Is there any place you want to go?

456
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Work is more important.

457
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,760
You should take care of

458
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,520
official matters first, Master.

459
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,320
You always stay here in the residence.

460
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,440
I'm afraid you'd feel bored.

461
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,720
No, I won't.

462
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,240
I often hang out when I'm free.

463
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,240
Then, where do you want to go today?

464
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,360
I'll go with you.

465
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,320
I'm good.

466
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
What?

467
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,600
Is there any place I can't visit?

468
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,240
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

469
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,280
Your Highness, Mistress is here.

470
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,480
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

471
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,200
Why did you come to visit me?

472
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,160
Did anything happen between you and Yelan?

473
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,960
It's been a long time

474
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,000
and I miss Your Highness so much.

475
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,240
So, I came to visit you.

476
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,680
Take a seat.

477
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
Yes, Your Highness.

478
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,600
Your Highness, Lord's here.

479
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,680
Greetings to you, Mother.

480
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,280
Come. Sit here.

481
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,760
You called in a physician yesterday.

482
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,200
Are you feeling ill?

483
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,440
It's nothing.

484
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,240
I just had indigestion.

485
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,160
You watch your health.

486
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,880
As the lord

487
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,240
you should

488
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,520
eat dessert in moderation.

489
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,600
Mr Gao

490
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
you once worked

491
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,760
in the palace before coming here with me.

492
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,760
You don't need me

493
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,440
to remind you that, right?

494
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,920
Yes, Your Highness.

495
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,480
I understand, Mother.

496
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Your Highness

497
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,920
Yaxiang has something to report.

498
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,240
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

499
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,480
What is it?

500
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,880
The spices sent by the comprador

501
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,120
have been sorted.

502
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,400
Here's an inventory for you to go over.

503
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,680
I remember that you had reported

504
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,320
on this matter yesterday.

505
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,040
Why are you here again with the inventory?

506
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Additionally

507
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,000
the gale these past few days

508
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
has damaged flowers in the courtyard.

509
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,800
Shall we buy some more flowers

510
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
of the same species?

511
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,680
You can ask the butler about these trifles.

512
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,680
Leave if there's nothing important.

513
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,880
Yes, Your Highness.

514
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,320
My courtyard

515
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,720
becomes lively every time you come.

516
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,680
Your Highness, Miss Hua Man is here.

517
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,680
You rarely visit me these days.

518
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,440
So I sent someone this morning

519
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,000
to invite her over

520
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
so I can speak with her.

521
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,120
Since you're here

522
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,240
I shall tell her to leave.

523
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,840
Let her come in since she's here.

524
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,640
Let her come in.

525
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Yes, Your Highness.

526
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,920
Why so stubborn?

527
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,400
<i>It seems that</i>

528
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,400
<i>Father has given up on her.</i>

529
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,560
<i>Or she won't be acting unusual</i>

530
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,920
<i>and appear meek.</i>

531
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,360
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

532
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,720
Aren't you Mistress' cousin?

533
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,040
But I rarely see you visit each other.

534
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,240
She used to live with my uncle in town.

535
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,680
We only visited each other during festivals.

536
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,960
Now that she has become

537
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,680
a maid of the lord

538
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,480
I can't bother her shamelessly.

539
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,680
Qian, it feels estranged for you to say so.

540
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,720
Why do you seem distant from your cousin

541
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,040
Mistress?

542
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,800
Of course not.

543
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,240
We're family

544
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,600
no matter how estranged we feel.

545
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,640
By the way, you can let me know

546
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,800
if you need anything here

547
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,040
in Zhong's Garden.

548
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,160
I'll do my best to help you

549
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,520
if you need me.

550
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,440
Mistress, she's just the daughter

551
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,960
of Butler Qi who works in Zhong's Garden.

552
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,440
But she seems to have made it her home.

553
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,080
How rude she was.

554
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Don't mess with her.

555
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,120
One of these girls

556
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,720
may become the Lady here one day.

557
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,000
What a silly girl.

558
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,560
Do you think Her Highness

559
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,120
keeps these girls here

560
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,440
only because she feels bored?

561
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,160
Miss, Mistress was so bold

562
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,000
to claim connections with Hua Man

563
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,920
in front of Her Highness and the lord.

564
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,000
That's the clever bit.

565
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,560
Have a look. Incense burners.

566
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,080
—Show me this one, please.            —Sure.

567
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,000
Are you tired, Mistress?

568
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,720
Of course, I am.

569
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,480
I even had to cover my mouth when I laugh

570
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,080
in front of Her Highness.

571
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,560
Why did you decide

572
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,240
to go to Zhong's Garden today?

573
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,000
It was rare that the master was nice to you

574
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,080
and even wanted to hang out with you.

575
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,640
I'd rather stay with Her Highness.

576
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,800
Why?

577
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,960
Her Highness was from the palace.

578
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,600
She's reasonable.

579
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
There's no harm

580
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,800
if I can gain her favour.

581
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,560
I thought about it.

582
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,320
The courtyard of Princess Royal

583
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,240
is the only place that Master can't go with me.

584
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,640
I see! Is it what you said

585
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
about loosening the reins

586
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,120
only to grasp him better?

587
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,080
You're so smart.

588
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,160
He'll miss you even more now.

589
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,080
No wonder Nanfeng told me

590
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,320
secretly before we go

591
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,000
that Master will take half a month off

592
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,000
to spend more time with you.

593
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,360
Half a month?

594
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,480
Your Highness.

595
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,520
Mistress is here.

596
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,800
Greetings to you, Your Highness.

597
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,280
Lord, Mistress is here.

598
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,200
Your Highness

599
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,600
Mistress is here again.

600
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,240
Greetings, Your Highness.

601
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,720
Your Highness, how's your day?

602
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,600
Lord, Mistress is here.

603
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,560
—Your Highness...               —Mistress...

604
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,760
I'm here to see you again.

605
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,400
What are you up to?

606
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,600
Let me help you.

607
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Lord.

608
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,360
Lord, Mistress is here again.

609
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,840
Again?

610
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,320
<i>Yiyang Hall</i>

611
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,240
Mistress, these beads were made from

612
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,840
a block of incense

613
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,640
that was consecrated by a senior monk.

614
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,920
Do you like it?

615
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,080
That's thoughtful of you.

616
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,360
What's going on with you

617
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,920
for these two weeks, Mistress?

618
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,360
Why did you come here every day?

619
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,640
Master always said that Her Highness

620
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,840
treated him as her son when he was young.

621
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,080
He's busy now.

622
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,760
It's my duty to spend time with her

623
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,160
on his behalf.

624
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,840
What a nice couple.

625
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,000
You're making the rest of us jealous.

626
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,800
Yelan has been too busy these days.

627
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,480
I'll tell him

628
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,440
to care more

629
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,600
about his family.

630
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,080
He should pay more attention to his career.

631
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,520
Don't bother yourself, Mistress.

632
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
Do you mean it?

633
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Sure, I do.

634
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,600
Please don't tell him to do otherwise.

635
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Your Highness, the queen mother ordered people

636
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,120
to send these lychee from the south.

637
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,200
It must have taken time and energy

638
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,520
to deliver these lychee

639
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,520
in this season.

640
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,400
The queen mother dotes on Your Highness.

641
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,720
Not me.

642
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,480
Her grandson loves lychee.

643
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,600
Send them to Xiwu.

644
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,360
Yes, Your Highness.

645
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,240
Su Wuniang seems busy.

646
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm free now.

647
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,080
So I can take them to the lord.

648
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,520
You do avail yourself of every opportunity.

649
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,800
How dare you take credit

650
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,560
for Her Highness' offer?

651
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,760
Miss Qi, you've wronged me.

652
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,000
I-I just want to help Her Highness.

653
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,720
<i>Sure enough, the bigger the residence</i>

654
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,360
<i>the more schemes there'll be.</i>

655
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,000
Mistress, you're free now.

656
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,480
Why don't you help me deliver the lychee?

657
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
Me?

658
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,400
<i>What a smart move.</i>

659
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,240
<i>Her time in the palace taught her well.</i>

660
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,080
<i>She solved their conflict in just one action.</i>

661
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,760
Yes, Mistress.

662
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Lord.

663
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,000
Lord, Her Highness ordered me

664
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,360
to bring the lychee.

665
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,800
Do you know how to read ledgers?

666
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,800
Have a look at them.

667
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,800
It keeps cash withdrawal records

668
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,760
your brother made from the shop

669
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,840
in your father's name.

670
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,400
Do you think your father knows?

671
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,080
I also heard other butlers say

672
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,400
that your brother often spends lots of money

673
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,800
at brothels.

674
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,120
Did your father not educate him properly?

675
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,000
Or does your father do the same thing, too?

676
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,080
Lord, my brother has been frivolous since young.

677
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,000
My father has been busy working at the shop.

678
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
So he's failed to educate him properly

679
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,520
and let him slip through the cracks.

680
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,560
How do you think

681
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,520
I should punish him for what he did?

682
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,840
Shen's my elder brother.

683
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
He's my family.

684
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,760
Even if he made many mistakes

685
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,240
I don't know how to punish him

686
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,800
since he's my elder

687
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,360
and I'm just a woman.

688
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,440
You're wise and know what to do.

689
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,920
It's improper of me to make any suggestions.

690
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,960
Butler Hua always boasts

691
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,520
that his daughter's perfect.

692
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,280
Why are you so restrained before me?

693
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,800
Parents would regard

694
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,640
their children as the best.

695
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,960
It's inevitable that they exaggerate.

696
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,200
<i>Bonus footage</i>

697
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,080
You're back, Lord.

698
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,480
Mistress asked about you earlier.

699
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,840
I went out secretly.

700
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,240
You caught me again.

701
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,440
Keep it a secret for me.

702
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,440
Did you go buy desserts for your mother?

703
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,640
That's the only excuse

704
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,000
I get to wander out.

705
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,880
How could you go out alone?

706
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,600
You should have brought some guards along.

707
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,240
I did have guards.

708
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,080
They were hidden.

709
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,200
I won't be free

710
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,400
if I'm with a group of guards.

711
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,800
Okay. I shall make my way home.

712
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,240
See you, Senior.

713
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Senior.

714
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,600
Your new wife has changed a lot.

715
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,520
I met her today.

716
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,800
She reminds me of her father now.
