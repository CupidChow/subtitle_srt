00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,840
Episode 11

3
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,360
Why don't you take the carriage?

4
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,800
I have something to ask you, Master.

5
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
What?

6
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
What did you mean

7
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,480
when you said what you said in Zhong's Garden?

8
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,360
Anyway

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,640
thank you for not sending me

10
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,880
to the Junior Lord of Wu family.

11
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,440
But you already have a wife.

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,920
You can ask me to do anything in return

13
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,560
except marrying you.

14
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
What if I don't have a wife?

15
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,640
I married Hua Qian because she drugged me.

16
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
I was forced to take responsibility.

17
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
I had no knowledge of me being drugged.

18
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,000
I've never touched her.

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,360
She admitted to it herself.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,880
That sounds like something she would do.

21
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,920
Now I know what I want.

22
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,920
Give me some time.

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,800
After your father's case is settled

24
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,360
I will formally divorce her.

25
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,640
After all...

26
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,240
this is her wish as well.

27
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,720
Her...

28
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,200
wish?

29
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,600
Do you know the Junior Lord of Wu family?

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,520
No.

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,240
I just met him once

32
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,440
and I didn't know his identity then.

33
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,120
I never thought we would see each other again.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
How is the investigation

35
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,920
into your father's case?

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,640
In addition to mentioning

37
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,160
how the Ge family committed the fraud

38
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,000
my father told me in a letter

39
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,120
that when he was in prison

40
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,240
he received an anonymous letter saying

41
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,480
"There is ample time ahead.

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,720
Take care of yourself."

43
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,880
This person must know

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,320
some inside information

45
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,080
but I haven't found out who he is yet.

46
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,360
Why didn't I hear you mention it before?

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
I...

48
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,760
You thought I wasn't worthy of your trust?

49
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,760
By the way, I managed to reach

50
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,240
a former maid of mine a few days ago.

51
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,760
She provided me with a lot of information

52
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,960
but most of it is useless.

53
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,120
Your maid?

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,920
She used to be a servant of my family

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,320
but was sold to someone else.

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,040
It took me a lot of effort to find her

57
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,240
but she refused to be my maid again.

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,240
Why?

59
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Who knows?

60
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,280
After all, to each their own.

61
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
Nothing can be forced.

62
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,480
Forced?

63
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
That's right.

64
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,240
It's me.

65
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Can we talk first?

66
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,600
I have nothing to say

67
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,800
to the Junior Lord of Wu family.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,440
Are you angry

69
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,320
because of my identity

70
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,480
or because I kept my real identity from you?

71
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
What do you mean?

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,960
Aren't they the same?

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Nothing.

74
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
I was just teasing you.

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,720
What's your motive for coming to me?

76
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,160
I swear

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,880
I fell in love with you at first sight

78
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,840
and can't stop thinking about you.

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,080
Stop that!

80
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,280
I'm serious.

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,800
It's like fate.

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,120
I can't forget you since our first meeting.

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,800
If this is all that you want to say today

84
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
then I suggest you leave now.

85
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,000
You really want to be with Zhong Yelan?

86
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,400
It beats being with you.

87
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,000
He already has a wife.

88
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,920
Are you leaving or not?

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What if I told you

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
I could clear your father's name?

91
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,520
Do you think I will believe you?

92
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,200
I'll count to three.

93
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,880
If you don't leave, I'll scream.

94
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,120
Are you really going to do this?

95
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
One.

96
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,880
Haven't you wondered why I keep pestering you?

97
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Two.

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,440
You will come to me in the future.

99
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Three.

100
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,960
Master.

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,800
Do I still need to send the invitation card

102
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,160
to Mistress Zhong?

103
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
Seems like she really doesn't know.

104
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,880
Yes. Send it to Zhong Residence

105
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
early tomorrow morning.

106
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
What? Is there anything else?

107
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,400
Master.

108
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,880
You have found out the truth.

109
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,200
Are you still going to take her away?

110
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,600
Yeah. She intrigues me

111
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,320
more and more.

112
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,200
But Mistress Zhong is a married woman.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm afraid she won't come out to meet you.

114
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm sending her a proper invite

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,840
and she's not an unmarried woman.

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,480
There's no reason why she won't meet me.

117
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Just send the card.

118
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,520
What if she ignores it?

119
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,040
Then keep knocking on her door

120
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,480
until she agrees.

121
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,840
After all, she and I have the same goal

122
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,160
not to mention how Zhong Yelan embarrassed her

123
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
at the banquet that day.

124
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,400
I don't think she will turn down

125
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
an ally like me.

126
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Go on.

127
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,680
Mistress, the Junior Lord of the Wu family

128
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,320
sends another invitation card.

129
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,080
Just ignore him and toss the card aside.

130
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,640
Mistress

131
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,880
why does he keep trying to cotton up to you?

132
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,360
Maybe he thinks

133
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,160
we suffer the same fate

134
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,520
and that we can do something together.

135
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,920
Don't listen to him, Mistress.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,360
He seems scheming.

137
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,640
Of course not.

138
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
How can I not see it

139
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
since even you have realised it?

140
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,560
I have rejected him so many times

141
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,240
but he just won't give up.

142
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
No one loved him in the previous life.

143
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,920
Serves him right.

144
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Mistress.

145
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,240
Is that medicine for your skin?

146
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,080
But it smells a little different.

147
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,160
Don't get so close.

148
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,560
Look how ignorant you are.

149
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,760
Qianzhi.

150
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,320
Mistress made it herself

151
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,520
so, of course, it's different.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
You're amazing.

153
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
You are good at everything, Mistress.

154
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,760
By the way, Mistress, have you heard?

155
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
What?

156
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,360
I heard Hua Man and a low-rank maid

157
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,120
at Zhong's Garden made a blunder

158
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,320
and Lord gave them away to a coachman.

159
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,440
They left the city quietly

160
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,560
early yesterday morning.

161
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,280
I guess they won't be able to come back ever.

162
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,120
Even the maid?

163
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Yeah.

164
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,440
It seems that they made the blunder together

165
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,000
so they were both punished.

166
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,640
I heard the coachman came from

167
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,880
a nomadic tribe far away from here.

168
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
This is his last delivery here

169
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,840
and he will not come back again.

170
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,280
Mistress, what's wrong?

171
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,160
Don't you hate Hua Man the most?

172
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,720
Get back to work.

173
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,680
Mistress

174
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,280
Hua Man has herself to blame for attacking...

175
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Lord.

176
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,280
She deserves it.

177
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
Otherwise, she would be kicked out at most.

178
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,120
I'm going inside.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
It's a bit cold here.

180
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Lord.

181
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,120
After the incense banquet was over

182
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,760
all the butlers left one after another

183
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,920
within ten days.

184
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,840
But the Junior Lord of the Wu family

185
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,520
remains in the city

186
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,200
and pays a visit to Mistress Zhong every day.

187
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,320
She refused to see him

188
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,760
but that didn't stop him.

189
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,120
His intention is unclear.

190
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,280
He asked for a maid at the banquet

191
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,680
and now he's trying to approach Mistress Zhong.

192
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,680
He is a hard-to-read character.

193
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,920
Lord, should I...

194
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,120
How many days will Wu Shuomo be staying?

195
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,000
Lord, he originally planned to come here

196
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,760
for a one-month study tour.

197
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
But ten days have passed.

198
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,440
Ignore him then.

199
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,720
I want to see what he's up to.

200
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,840
—Five.                  —Mistress, let's go.

201
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,040
Seven. Eight.

202
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,400
Mistress, don't stay in the room all day.

203
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
You should go out for a walk.

204
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,400
—Eleven.                        —As you know

205
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,680
that Junior Lord Wu is waiting outside

206
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,720
eager to form an alliance with me.

207
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm afraid to go out.

208
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
I don't want to run into him.

209
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,120
But you can't sit in the room all day.

210
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,240
Why not kick the shuttlecock with us?

211
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,800
Maybe it will cheer you up.

212
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,400
Seeing you depressed every day

213
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,680
makes us feel terrible.

214
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

215
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,160
Join us.

216
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,280
—Right?                —Let's play together.

217
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,960
Join us, Mistress.

218
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,720
Come on...

219
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,200
Do it, Mistress.

220
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Over here.

221
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,600
Are you all right, Guard Hua?

222
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,120
—Yeah.                                  —Go!

223
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Let's go.

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,080
Are you sweating?

225
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,640
It's a scorching day today.

226
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,960
Mistress, if you feel hot

227
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,760
go inside and rest.

228
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,200
I've been staying in the room for too long

229
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,560
and my body is getting weaker.

230
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,880
It's good for me to enjoy the sun here.

231
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,960
All right then. Let me put this in there.

232
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
All right.

233
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,680
Can one of you get Hua Rongzhou over here?

234
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Let me...

235
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,920
Let me do it.

236
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,680
Greetings, Mistress.

237
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,720
Make yourself comfortable.

238
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,760
You don't have to bow to me

239
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,040
when there are only us.

240
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,400
Nothing much.

241
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
It's just I see you

242
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,480
guarding the entrance here every day

243
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,040
and no one takes turns with you.

244
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
I just want to tell you

245
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,680
that you can come here once every other day.

246
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,520
I am the guard of your compound, Mistress.

247
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,680
How can I leave my post without authorisation?

248
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
It's all right.

249
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,400
There are so many guards coming and going.

250
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,720
Nothing bad will happen.

251
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,800
Life is short.

252
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,120
And you are so young.

253
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,520
There must be something that you want to do.

254
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,120
Don't waste your time working as a guard.

255
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,440
Something I want to do?

256
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Yeah. Do what you want to do.

257
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,120
If I'm in need, I'll send for you.

258
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,880
How rare!

259
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,760
I didn't expect to see him here.

260
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
Yeah.

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,360
I thought he was too afraid to come here.

262
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,680
He already looks like a woman

263
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,720
and he hangs out with women every day.

264
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
—Want to spar?                 —Sounds good.

265
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Bring it on.

266
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,760
Care to join them?

267
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,000
—Yeah. Easy does it.                  —Stop!

268
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,480
Not me. I'm not going to spar with you.

269
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,440
Nice moves!

270
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,160
I knew that you were good during recruitment.

271
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,800
Let me spar with you

272
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
and see how much progress you have made

273
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
in the past few months.

274
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,360
Yes, Chief.

275
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
The needle should go in here.

276
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,040
Make the snitch smaller.

277
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,640
Mistress, how about taking a rest

278
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,840
and carrying on another day?

279
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,560
Mistress.

280
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,800
Mistress.

281
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,960
I heard a fight went down at the training ground

282
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,440
and Guard Hua was so skilful

283
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,640
that he even defeated the veterans.

284
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
Really?

285
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,520
He's only been here for half a year, no?

286
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,960
You will be surprised, Mistress.

287
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,880
Even Master praised him today

288
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
saying that he drew with Nanfeng

289
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,520
after learning just a few moves from him.

290
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,000
The moment I laid eyes on him

291
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,840
I knew he was an extraordinary man.

292
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,040
That was because Nanfeng held back.

293
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,360
You're an unmarried girl.

294
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,120
Don't you feel embarrassed saying those words?

295
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,600
Nanfeng is the highest-ranked guard

296
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,680
so he must be good at martial arts.

297
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Yeah.

298
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,960
So it means Guard Hua is really outstanding.

299
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,360
How shameless.

300
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,880
—Don't say that!         —You are shameless.

301
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,200
—Don't say that!         —You are shameless.

302
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,840
—Stop saying that!                 —You are!

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,680
You... that's not true at all.

304
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,040
Hua Rongzhou, come here.

305
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,520
Mistress.

306
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,080
Did something good happen?

307
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,720
You seem to be in a good mood.

308
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,960
You finally remember my name, Mistress.

309
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,560
Have I ever forgotten it?

310
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,280
I heard from Cuizhu

311
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
that you drew with Nanfeng

312
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
in a sparring session.

313
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,880
I think that was because the chief held back.

314
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,520
Not only are you talented in martial arts

315
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,160
but you're also modest.

316
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,760
Cuizhu has good taste.

317
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,000
Mistress.

318
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,600
Do you know

319
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,760
where the best artisan shop in the city is?

320
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,400
I heard that there was a female craftsman

321
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,120
named Wei Xian.

322
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,840
She was the most skilled.

323
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,000
A female craftsman?

324
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,160
I have never heard of this person.

325
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
You don't know her, Mistress?

326
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,000
All the girls admired her.

327
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,160
Unfortunately, she passed away a while ago.

328
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,600
I don't know about other stores.

329
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,560
Shall I ask Guard Hua to ask around?

330
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,280
No. Don't tell him.

331
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,040
Go and ask around yourself

332
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
and be quick.

333
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
All right.

334
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,160
You're back from the training?

335
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,480
We're eating and drinking.

336
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,520
Do you want to join us?

337
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Are you sure you don't want some?

338
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,960
—Have some.              —Have some with us.

339
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,640
Look at how defiant he is.

340
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
What else can we do?

341
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,400
He's proficient with martial arts.

342
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,000
I'd say it was because the chief was lenient.

343
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,000
He held back, that was how it ended up in a tie.

344
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,560
I feel it's unclear who held back.

345
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Let's drop it.

346
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,240
Enough about that grumpy man.

347
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,520
Come on. Drink up.

348
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,720
Speaking of the chief

349
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,640
have you heard the rumour?

350
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,160
You mean the one related to Mistress?

351
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,120
—Lower your voice.                 —No need.

352
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,120
Everyone in the house knows about it.

353
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,080
—Keep it down.                     —But yes.

354
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,000
When Master ordered to cut spending

355
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,680
the chief immediately went to Butler Ji

356
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,840
to reason with him.

357
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,000
He's Master's personal guard. How could he...

358
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,120
It's really unbelievable.

359
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,320
Enough...

360
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,880
It's not a good thing.

361
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,520
Don't talk about it anymore. Let's drink.

362
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,240
She still won't see me?

363
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,320
No, she won't.

364
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,720
Mistress Zhong says she's not well enough

365
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,880
to receive guests.

366
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,360
She's unwell?

367
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,560
But she looked energetic when I saw her.

368
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Before coming to Huangcheng

369
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,840
you swore that you would just come here

370
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
for the formula

371
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,640
of the Zhong family's Jiayin Pill.

372
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,640
Half a month has passed.

373
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,320
Instead of searching for the formula

374
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,080
you're searching for someone.

375
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,320
If the Senior Lord knows about this...

376
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
Don't use my father to threaten me.

377
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,360
Who is your master?

378
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,360
Of course, it's you.

379
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,120
But we have to go back in ten days

380
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
so let's just forget it.

381
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,520
I'll find someone else who can lend me a hand.

382
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,960
Enjoy and drink as much as you like.

383
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,520
This is my treat.

384
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,880
Your generosity befits your status

385
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,480
as the son of the butler of the Zhong family.

386
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,040
I'm the only son of my parents

387
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,600
and everything my father owns

388
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,800
will be mine.

389
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Treating you to a meal is nothing to speak of.

390
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,800
That's right.

391
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,840
It's really rare to see Miss Jiaojiao.

392
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,480
You're incredible! I'm impressed.

393
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Jiaojiao.

394
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,840
You haven't been around. This is nothing.

395
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,160
What audacity! Who are you?

396
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,720
It's you, Junior Lord Wu.

397
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,880
It's really you, Young Master Hua.

398
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,360
I thought I heard it wrong

399
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,840
when I was standing at the door.

400
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,640
This is the Junior Lord of the Wu family.

401
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,800
—Nice to meet you.        —Nice to meet you.

402
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
—Please take a seat.                —Please.

403
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Be quick.

404
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,480
Young Master Hua

405
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,880
you left a deep impression on me

406
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,920
at the incense banquet.

407
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,560
I wanted to make friends with you

408
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,400
but couldn't find a good way to approach you.

409
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,760
Oh, I'm flattered.

410
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,520
I also felt like you were an old friend

411
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
at the first meeting.

412
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
Exactly.

413
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,040
—Yes... glad to meet you.           —Cheers.

414
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Come on.

415
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,680
Jiaojiao, go serve Junior Lord Wu.

416
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,720
—No need.                   —Junior Lord Wu.

417
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,080
This kind of uncultured woman

418
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,400
is not my type.

419
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Go back to where you were.

420
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,080
Come on, let's drink.

421
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,600
Junior Lord Wu, are you saying

422
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,600
you can't forget

423
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,240
the maid of Master Zhong?

424
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,720
It was a pity

425
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,640
that someone stopped me.

426
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,640
I think

427
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,240
my brother-in-law went too far.

428
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,640
She's just a maid.

429
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,120
Why can't he give her to you?

430
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,000
He already has my sister as his wife.

431
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,960
Why does he still think about other women?

432
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,120
Exactly.

433
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
Mistress Zhong is the most talented woman

434
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,400
in the city

435
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,600
and is famous all over the world.

436
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,920
Master Zhong has bad taste.

437
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,880
It's a pity I came here late

438
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,120
and she's already married to him.

439
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,080
Otherwise, I would compete with him.

440
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,320
I couldn't agree more.

441
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,960
My sister is the prettiest girl in the world.

442
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,440
Who can compare to her?

443
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Can you?

444
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,400
You're stating the obvious.

445
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,960
Anyway, if my father hadn't stopped me

446
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,400
I would have rushed into Zhong Residence

447
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,200
and give Master Zhong a beating.

448
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,160
My sentiments exactly!

449
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
Speaking of which

450
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,360
I want to talk to Mistress Zhong.

451
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,040
If she allows me to take away the maid

452
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,760
that will pull out the thorn in her side

453
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,480
and she will live more comfortably

454
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,720
in Zhong Residence. Am I right?

455
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,240
My sister is smart

456
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,320
but I don't think she can make decisions

457
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,920
for my brother-in-law.

458
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,480
It's not hard

459
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,560
to find a way to satisfy both of them.

460
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,080
But Mistress Zhong has been

461
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,520
staying in the house for some time.

462
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,160
I wonder, Young Master Hua...

463
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,280
Brother Hua...

464
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,360
if you can introduce me to her.

465
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,520
Look at your face. It's so red.

466
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Furong is quite pretty.

467
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,520
I beg to differ.

468
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,720
—She's mine.       —There are prettier ones.

469
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,960
She's mine.

470
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,200
Junior Lord Wu

471
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,520
are you really not going to my house?

472
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,560
No.

473
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,680
We're leaving then.

474
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,080
—Goodbye.                          —Goodbye.

475
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,200
—Goodbye.                          —Goodbye.

476
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,320
—Go...                      —I'm telling you

477
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Huang has prepared dinner for us.

478
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,920
Let's continue drinking.

479
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,000
—Let's drink!               —Furong is mine.

480
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,360
—Right. She's yours.                —Master.

481
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,920
—How is it going?               —She's mine.

482
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,000
Brother Hua, could you introduce me to her?

483
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,520
I can't make decisions for her.

484
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,280
She is a very independent woman.

485
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,920
If I do it without telling her

486
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,680
she will be angry.

487
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,200
She isn't an ordinary woman.

488
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,080
If Jiaojiao is angry

489
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,240
all I need to do is buy her some makeup.

490
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,200
But my sister is different.

491
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,040
If I make her angry

492
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,000
she'll ignore me

493
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,080
no matter how much jewellery I buy her.

494
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,440
He looks stupid

495
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,320
but actually, he's not.

496
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,560
If there is no other way

497
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,240
I'll have to sneak into Zhong Residence myself.

498
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,080
Zhong Residence

499
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,520
Since you are here today

500
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,800
let's spar another round.

501
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,960
This time I won't show mercy.

502
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,560
He is Master's personal guard. How could he...

503
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,680
It's unbelievable.

504
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
All right.

505
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Remember.

506
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,800
We will stop before going too far.

507
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
No.

508
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,120
Well done.

509
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,360
Just as I expected.

510
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,760
You didn't give it your all the last time.

511
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Why?

512
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,800
Please forgive me, Chief.

513
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,760
Tell me. Why did you hold back

514
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,120
the last time you sparred with me?

515
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
The person

516
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,840
who taught me martial arts

517
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,000
told me to do that.

518
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,080
Your martial arts teacher?

519
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,160
What does he do?

520
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,400
Forget it. I'm going to tell Master right now

521
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,680
that he has recruited a martial arts prodigy.

522
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,640
Come on! Welcome back, our victor!

523
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,520
Welcome back...

524
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,280
You're awesome, Guard Hua.

525
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,080
All right.

526
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,600
Mistress, you have something to tell me?

527
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,880
Yes. We all heard

528
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,760
that you defeated Nanfeng today.

529
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,800
Yeah. So we're celebrating for you.

530
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,480
—Qianzhi.                    —Yes, Mistress.

531
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,280
Mistress.

532
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,080
This is a reward for you.

533
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,240
Open it.

534
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,880
This is custom-made

535
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,120
from the best store in the city.

536
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,120
I noticed you were still using

537
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,800
a house-issued sabre.

538
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,960
You're now the only guard in my compound

539
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
not to mention

540
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,160
that your skills are on par with Nanfeng's

541
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,200
so we can't have you using an inferior weapon.

542
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,600
You work for me

543
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,160
and I promise you won't be disappointed.

544
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,120
You can get whatever you want.

545
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,280
What did you do? Who did this?

546
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,200
Why are there so many petals on the ground?

547
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,400
I merely went out for a while

548
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,040
and you turned this place upside down.

549
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Hurry up and clear up the mess.

550
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,640
—Right away!               —We'll do it now.

551
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Get a broom.

552
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,320
Go, go. A broom.

553
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,880
Yeah. Be quick.

554
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,480
These girls...

555
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,240
are really a pain in the neck.

556
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Thank you.

557
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,800
Thank you, Mistress.

558
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,440
It's all right. Hope you like it.

559
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,000
This is the first time I received a gift.

560
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I like it very much.

561
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,960
Nothing has changed in the last half month?

562
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,680
Yes.

563
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,280
It seems that Master and Mistress

564
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,760
haven't spoken much to each other these days.

565
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,120
They are still angry with each other.

566
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,120
I don't know.

567
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,800
Go tell Qian

568
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,320
to come over tomorrow.

569
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,600
I'll ask her about it.

570
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,560
Your Highness, didn't you say

571
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,160
it was Master's own business?

572
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,760
Are you going to do something about it now?

573
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Your Highness.

574
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,840
Is the wedding banquet over?

575
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,840
I heard Master got drunk

576
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,400
and slept in his study last night.

577
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,920
He can't blame that on anyone.

578
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,760
He was pretty dumb to fall for that trick.

579
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,800
Since you know about it

580
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
why didn't you tell him, Your Highness?

581
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,080
Maybe he would change his mind.

582
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,680
It's his own business

583
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
and he is convinced that

584
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,280
the daughter of the Hua family

585
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,240
is innocent and kind.

586
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,000
I have no evidence

587
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,000
so what can I say?

588
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,680
It is not going to be easy for Master.

589
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,640
Let's hope that Hua Qian will stop

590
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,680
doing things like that

591
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,880
and will not bring us trouble again.

592
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,240
How did a young lady like her

593
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,600
learn these dirty tricks?

594
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,200
Now that they are married

595
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,840
I suppose she will gradually

596
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,120
become more mature and demure.

597
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,080
We shall see.

598
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,680
When they come here to greet me tomorrow

599
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,920
I will see how mature she has become.

600
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,560
Most people come to my place

601
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,040
because they want something.

602
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,640
There's rarely someone

603
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,000
who doesn't want anything.

604
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,200
All she does is talk with me.

605
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,200
I can speak freely with her.

606
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,080
All right.

607
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,400
I will get someone to tell her.

608
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,520
Go ahead.

609
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,560
Is this piece of news reliable?

610
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Master, yes it is.

611
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,320
That's great.

612
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,960
I guess she has nowhere to run this time.

613
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,880
Greetings, Mistress.

614
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Take a seat.

615
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Yes, Mistress.

616
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,720
I heard that you hadn't been

617
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,840
out of the house in the past few days.

618
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,080
I felt tired

619
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,160
so I just stayed in the house.

620
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,600
That's not good.

621
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,600
As Mistress of the Zhong family

622
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,640
you have the duty to enhance Yelan's reputation

623
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,720
so you should go out and socialise more often.

624
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,360
A mistress

625
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,560
should not stay confined to her compound.

626
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,320
She should often interact

627
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,560
with the wives of other distinguished men.

628
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,440
Yes.

629
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,640
One more thing.

630
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,080
You should pay more attention

631
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,880
to what Yelan did

632
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,520
at the incense banquet.

633
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,480
You are too young.

634
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,000
There are many things you don't understand.

635
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,720
Feelings of love or gratitude

636
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,440
between a couple

637
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,640
tend to fade over time.

638
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,760
Holding power firmly in your hands

639
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,880
is key to a long-lasting marriage.

640
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,800
Thank you for your advice, Mistress.

641
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,680
That maid is called Mu Yao, right?

642
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,360
How are you going to deal with her?

643
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,200
Master likes her.

644
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,440
I don't wish to go against his will.

645
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,720
You have to keep a close eye on things at home.

646
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,280
Otherwise, even a maid

647
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,440
could crawl onto her master's bed.

648
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,200
Mu Yao is not that kind of person.

649
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,280
Your Highness, you have no idea.

650
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,920
Mu Yao has never once seduced Master.

651
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,320
You'll stop thinking this way

652
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
once you meet Mu Yao.

653
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,760
Why are you still taking her side?

654
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,080
I'm just stating the facts.

655
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,880
I don't want you to misjudge anyone.

656
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,080
How come you have become so soft?

657
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,040
That's the reality.

658
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,560
There's no point in me putting up a fight.

659
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,040
You almost lost your life saving Yelan.

660
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,440
He went too far this time.

661
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,000
You are his legitimate wife

662
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,600
so he shouldn't have done this to you.

663
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,080
If you feel you can't speak up

664
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,080
I'll talk to him for you.

665
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,520
Mistress, you know how

666
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,240
I managed to marry Master, don't you?

667
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
You...

668
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,080
Don't change the subject.

669
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,240
I'm talking about the maid.

670
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,160
As his legitimate wife

671
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,080
you should assert your authority.

672
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,600
You shouldn't just stand by and do nothing.

673
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,760
Mistress, may I ask you to pass down an order?

674
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
What order?

675
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,600
Master and Mu Yao are in love with each other

676
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,480
so could you give the order

677
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
to make her Master's concubine?

678
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
You...

679
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Do you...

680
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,760
Do you really mean that?

681
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Yes.

682
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,440
She will just be a concubine.

683
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,600
You're his legitimate wife.

684
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll leave it to you to decide.

685
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,600
But could you please do it for me?

686
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:55,880
Otherwise, Master might get the wrong idea.

687
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,480
All right.

688
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,600
Your wish is granted.

689
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,640
I'll send someone to Zhong Residence tomorrow

690
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
to pass down the order.

691
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,240
Thank you very much, Mistress.

692
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,280
Have some of this.

693
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,240
You have a good appetite today, Your Highness.

694
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,440
A weight has been lifted off my shoulders

695
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,560
so I feel much better.

696
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Since she suggested that

697
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,400
Yelan marries a concubine

698
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,960
it means

699
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,080
she wants to get back together with him.

700
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,440
That's true.

701
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,480
Mistress is truly giving.

702
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,040
She has to figure out

703
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,480
how to run the household by herself.

704
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,320
We all learn from painful experiences

705
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,040
I can give some advice at most.

706
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,360
I'm glad she heeded my advice.

707
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,040
Yes. Your Highness, you offered her

708
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,440
invaluable advice.

709
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,560
Stop buttering me up.

710
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,320
Mistress, why did you ask Her Highness

711
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,920
to take a concubine for Master?

712
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,800
You're too kind to Mu Yao.

713
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,880
It just occurred to me

714
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,600
that there was a simple and direct way

715
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,280
to make Zhong Yelan understand something.

716
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,080
Understand what?

717
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,960
There's no room for two of us.

718
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
I'll even make it a grand wedding

719
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,640
when he takes her as his concubine

720
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,400
then he will know

721
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,600
he cannot avoid the problem.

722
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,400
He knows that

723
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,520
Mu Yao and I can never share a husband.

724
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
So if he wants to live a chaotic life

725
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,400
he can continue to keep me in Zhong Residence.

726
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,640
Mistress, why don't you just drive her away?

727
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,800
Why must you take it lying down

728
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,960
and make her happy?

729
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,120
Drive her away?

730
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,960
It's easier said than done.

731
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,640
They are like two magnets.

732
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,320
The more you try to separate them

733
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,680
the tighter they get.

734
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,920
Is it Mistress Zhong in the carriage ahead?

735
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,360
Lord, they've been dealt with.

736
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,600
Go to the physician and get me

737
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,200
another bottle of Jinhua Powder.

738
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,840
Do you feel unwell, Lord?

739
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,360
I'm fine. It's just...

740
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
for emergencies.

741
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,400
Give Lin Jiang my order.

742
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,280
Steward Gao, are you sure about this?

743
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,960
Lord has made up his mind

744
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,960
and we should not question him.

745
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,280
Just do it.
