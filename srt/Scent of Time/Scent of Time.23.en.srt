1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>Episode 23</i>

3
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,440
I was fine with being sold.

4
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,920
Ever since my mother passed away

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,400
it made no difference to me where I was.

6
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,160
My father would bring up

7
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
my late mother from time to time

8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,520
and that woman got jealous

9
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,240
so she sold me to the notorious

10
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,560
rich merchant Master Li.

11
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,000
Notorious?

12
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,840
The Li family would buy a new batch of children

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,800
every once in a while.

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,000
Those they previously bought

15
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
all ended up being rolled up in a grass mat

16
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,400
and thrown into mass graves.

17
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
Stop looking around! Move!

18
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,640
Did they abuse the children?

19
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,160
Not only did they abuse them

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
but they also treated them like animals.

21
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,200
Come on, more rouge for you.

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,120
He treated the servants like dogs.

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,760
When he was in the mood

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,600
he would make us fight with one another

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,440
and only the last one standing could have food.

26
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,080
If we didn't fight with one another

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,320
he would whip us.

28
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,280
The louder we cried and screamed...

29
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Run!

30
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
the more excited and happier he would be.

31
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,760
More often than not, the servants weren't fed

32
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,320
while suffering from serious injuries.

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,840
When they finally died

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,000
they would be thrown out.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,360
Is that where you got those scars?

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,560
You need not know the details.

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,600
Just know that I eventually escaped.

38
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,200
Master Li called the shot in that household.

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,280
He was advanced in age

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
so he wasn't able to move fast.

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
That was how I managed to escape.

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
I was afraid they might come after me

43
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,560
so I set the house on fire.

44
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Put out the fire...!

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,000
—Hurry up!                —Put out the fire!

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Come on, get some water!

47
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,280
—Hurry!                            —Quickly!

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
—Hurry! Over there!        —Water is coming.

49
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,120
Be careful.

50
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
You again!

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,520
You're an able-bodied person. Go work for food.

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,560
Go! Don't interrupt my business.

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
Get out of here!

54
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,400
After I escaped, I ended up on the streets.

55
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,120
—I became a beggar.                     —Go!

56
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,520
I didn't want to go back there anymore.

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,600
One day, a craftsman named Wei Xian

58
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,960
saw me on the street

59
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,120
and said that I was talented.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,760
She wanted to take me as an apprentice.

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,480
I realise

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,320
the richer they are

63
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,920
the more likely they are unreasonable.

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
I made it according to their requirements

65
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,400
and now, they told me it didn't fit.

66
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,560
Do they think they can walk all over me?

67
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,800
They can forget about me

68
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,040
taking their orders again!

69
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,520
You wretched boy!

70
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,480
I should have left you to be a beggar.

71
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,640
Keeping a dog is better than keeping you.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,200
At least a dog knows

73
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,200
how to roll over and make me happy.

74
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,680
What can you do?

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,920
What, are you dumb?

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
Have you lost the ability to speak?

77
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,240
Say something!

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,520
All you do is show me that glum face!

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,920
Are you asking for a beating...?

80
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,400
Wei Xian wasn't a kind soul.

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,400
She was abusive.

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,760
She never regarded us as human beings.

83
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,160
She often lectured those who had a quick temper

84
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
and those who were stubborn.

85
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,280
Work hard.

86
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,360
Yes, Madam.

87
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Hold it with your hands.

88
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,360
What are you looking at?

89
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,440
I said, hold it with your hands.

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,360
Are you longing for more beatings?

91
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,760
Hold it.

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,320
This is interesting.

93
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,960
Hold it. Hurry up!

94
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
Hold it!

95
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,960
Hurry up!

96
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
Work hard! Hold them with your hands!

97
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,640
She kept me restrained

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,880
with her hidden weapon and chains.

99
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,640
She only gave me a meal once a few days.

100
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
She did that to keep me under her control.

101
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,960
Remember, I'm the one who feeds you

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,960
so you are my dog.

103
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,120
If you ever try to escape again

104
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,480
you can forget about removing that thing

105
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,440
around your neck.

106
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,800
Even so, I didn't bow down and beg for mercy.

107
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,960
I tried relentlessly

108
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
to pick the lock hoping to escape.

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
One day

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,480
I finally managed to break the lock

111
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
and escaped.

112
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,320
I hate it when I hear people say

113
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,280
that I am good looking

114
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,880
because I know they have ill intentions.

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,240
But when you said that I was good looking

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,200
I felt very happy

117
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,280
because I knew you were praising me.

118
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
What about this bracelet...

119
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,280
and the craftsman?

120
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,560
I saw that

121
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,800
you were unarmed and nearly got injured

122
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,360
at the ancestor worship ceremony.

123
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,480
That made me think of

124
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,760
Wei Xian's immaculate craftsmanship.

125
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,360
I went to her disregarding the past.

126
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,040
I wanted to buy a hidden weapon

127
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,480
that's suitable for ladies.

128
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,800
Where is it?

129
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,920
Since you are here

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
why are you in a hurry to leave?

131
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,960
In any case, I was once your master.

132
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,240
And I looked after you for a few years.

133
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,720
How did I raise such an ungrateful dog

134
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,000
like you?

135
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,200
If it wasn't for me

136
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,600
you would've starved to death a long time ago.

137
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,760
Now that you are back

138
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,760
shouldn't you repay your debt of gratitude?

139
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
You should know this.

140
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,640
Those who betrayed their master

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,840
won't get any attention

142
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,280
even if they're beaten to death by their master.

143
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,040
There's no way you can unlock

144
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,560
the mechanism I designed.

145
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,840
But if you kowtow to me and show remorse

146
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,080
I might show you mercy on account of

147
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,840
our master and disciple relationship.

148
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm not who you used to know.

149
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,360
Open the door or I'll kill you.

150
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,320
Open the door.

151
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,880
She launched a sneak attack at me

152
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
with her hidden weapons.

153
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,520
I managed to dodge them by instinct

154
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
in turn, she was injured by the hidden weapons

155
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,280
and became the victim of her own evil deeds.

156
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,320
You've never mentioned

157
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
that your hometown is in Huiyang County.

158
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,160
You said you'd never go back again.

159
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,720
Then, why didn't you say a word

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,720
when I gave you the task?

161
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,880
Hua Rongzhou, I'm sorry.

162
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Miss...

163
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,600
Miss, don't...

164
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,640
Miss, don't cry.

165
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,600
I know I did something wrong.

166
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,760
—But don't worry about me.            —No...

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,240
It was my fault.

168
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,560
It wasn't all your fault.

169
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,040
Don't worry.

170
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,520
I won't leave you in the lurch.

171
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,560
All right.

172
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,120
I don't care who is in charge here

173
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,240
but my guard hasn't been convicted.

174
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,480
If you torture him again

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,120
I will make sure those involved in

176
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
unlawful physical punishment won't be spared.

177
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,440
Miss Hua, the person in there

178
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,800
was not cooperating.

179
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,920
Moreover, it's not up to us.

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We're just following orders.

181
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,360
Tell the man in charge what I just said

182
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,920
and he will assess the gravity of the situation.

183
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,400
They disappeared without a trace?

184
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,640
After you came home and gave me the order

185
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
I sent someone to guard

186
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,920
outside the gate of Magistrate Wang

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,400
but there was no sign of that couple.

188
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,200
I've also searched almost all the tea houses

189
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
and inns in the past few days

190
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,920
but there were no clues.

191
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,520
Maybe our guards are incapable.

192
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
But our hands are tied

193
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,120
as we could only do it secretly.

194
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,840
Miss Hua, why don't we ask

195
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,400
Magistrate Wang for help?

196
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,240
He is supposed to investigate this case

197
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,400
to begin with.

198
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,920
He's capable of a more thorough search.

199
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,360
Magistrate Wang won't take my orders.

200
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,960
Qianzhi, come with me to Zhong's Garden.

201
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Yes, Miss.

202
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,160
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

203
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,840
Lord, Miss Hua is here.

204
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,080
Qian!

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
Lord.

206
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,280
Can you help me find

207
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,840
the rich merchant Master Li?

208
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,440
It is rare that you come to see me.

209
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,160
I thought you came for me.

210
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
There's more to Hua Rongzhou's matter

211
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,120
than meets the eye.

212
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,840
The Li couple has vanished into thin air.

213
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,200
Clearly, they have something to hide.

214
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,440
This shows that what they said is not all true.

215
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,720
I told you. His name is Qi Rongzhou

216
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,680
yet you still call him Hua Rongzhou.

217
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,160
Are you showing me the stand you're taking?

218
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,520
He is my guard.

219
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,840
He saved me from danger many times.

220
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I can't just watch him

221
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,680
be falsely accused and mistreated.

222
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,360
Guard?

223
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,760
The way he looks at you

224
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,320
is nothing like what a guard should be.

225
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,800
So you knew

226
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,600
yet you allowed him to stay by your side.

227
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,360
Who am I to you?

228
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,920
I was merely reporting to you

229
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
the truth about Qi Rongzhou.

230
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
Lin Jiang's investigation did not completely

231
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,320
align with the truth.

232
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,440
Lord, don't you want to hear me out?

233
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,080
It's his words against theirs.

234
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,880
You believe what your guard told you.

235
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,760
And why can't I believe what my guard told me?

236
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,480
I see that

237
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,280
you bear a grudge against Hua Rongzhou

238
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,120
so it's understandable that

239
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,280
you're skeptical of my words.

240
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,280
It's all right.

241
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,280
I will gather evidence on my own.

242
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,600
You'll see who is right and who is wrong.

243
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,560
But before he's convicted

244
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,160
I hope you will not give orders

245
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,600
to give him unlawful physical punishment.

246
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Qian.

247
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,560
Could you...

248
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,960
come see me

249
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,080
because you simply want to

250
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,360
at least once?

251
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,120
Lord.

252
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,800
In future, could you spare a thought for me

253
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
before you act?

254
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,280
There are several ways to convey your message.

255
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,320
Why did you do it that way?

256
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
What are you looking at, Miss?

257
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,360
<i>Zhong's Garden is too big for me.</i>

258
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Qianzhi.

259
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,440
I have something to tell you.

260
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,000
I have told you what I had to say, Master.

261
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,520
We're on a busy street.

262
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,520
I don't want to be seen talking to you.

263
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,880
Then I'll wait for you at the tea house ahead.

264
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,480
If you want to help your guard

265
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,280
please come.

266
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,000
Go to the tea house ahead.

267
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Yes, Miss.

268
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
Go to the tea house ahead.

269
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,200
Go guard the door

270
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,320
but leave the door open

271
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,680
so as to observe the proprieties.

272
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Yes, Miss.

273
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,200
I heard from Nanfeng

274
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,640
that you were fine with him marrying Qianzhi.

275
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,600
This is between the two of them.

276
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,200
I didn't intervene.

277
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,960
I merely granted Qianzhi her freedom.

278
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,360
She's free to choose her own path in life.

279
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,960
Master, you mentioned

280
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,840
about helping my guard just now.

281
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,400
Can you tell me more now?

282
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,160
I heard about your guard.

283
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,960
I know that you're trying to find out

284
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,680
the whereabouts of that merchant couple.

285
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,840
It took me a while

286
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,600
but I managed to find out their current address.

287
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,000
Where are they?

288
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,640
On what condition? Say it.

289
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,960
I investigated the couple's whereabouts

290
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,600
not to take advantage of you.

291
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,240
This matter is not that simple.

292
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,760
That day, Nanfeng happened to see

293
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,600
Lord Zhong escorting you back.

294
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
That's how I found out that

295
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
he has feelings for you...

296
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,960
If it's just because of a guard

297
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,720
you'd better not get involved further.

298
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,080
Master, are you asking me

299
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
to turn a blind eye to a wronged man

300
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
in order to protect myself?

301
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,440
Your guard did commit murder.

302
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,880
He's not wronged.

303
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,040
It depends on who got killed.

304
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,640
If you were him

305
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,440
can you still say such words?

306
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I have just come to realise

307
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,720
that you are so eloquent.

308
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,480
Where is the couple now?

309
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Fine. You should go and meet them yourself.

310
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,600
Five miles to the south of the city

311
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,320
there is a compound that had been deserted.

312
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,720
It became occupied a few days ago.

313
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,920
Thank you, Master.

314
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,640
I'll repay your kindness one day.

315
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,760
No need. Take this as repaying you

316
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
for saving my life.

317
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
All right.

318
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,920
We're even now.

319
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,080
I'm not in a position

320
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,680
to say such words.

321
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,960
It's just that Zhong's Garden

322
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,400
has too much going on.

323
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
If you are after a quiet life

324
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,240
you should not go anywhere near it.

325
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,200
When did I say I would go near it?

326
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,600
You and I can be regarded as...

327
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,520
acquaintances.

328
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Since you're certain

329
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
you don't want my protection

330
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,120
I won't force you anymore.

331
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,480
I respect your choice.

332
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,960
If you ever need my help

333
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,400
feel free to come to me

334
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
and I will not say no.

335
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,160
Thank you, Master.

336
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
Qian.

337
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,200
See you.

338
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,080
Miss, it's getting late.

339
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,600
Why don't we go tomorrow?

340
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
No.

341
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,440
Tell Huang to bring some men with him.

342
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,920
We'll act as fast as we can

343
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,200
to avoid trouble.

344
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,040
Don't worry. I have told her the address.

345
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
I didn't ask about her.

346
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,480
Knowing her character

347
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,760
she won't let her guard stay in prison

348
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,040
longer than he needs to.

349
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,040
She's probably on the way out of the city now.

350
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Do you want to go meet her?

351
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,880
I...

352
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,720
Why would I do that?

353
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,400
Every time you meet each other

354
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,400
you end up in a conflict.

355
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,560
You probably don't have much chance

356
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,120
to talk to each other again.

357
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,400
You two hold a grudge against each other.

358
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
I suggest you clear up the air once and for all.

359
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,400
Otherwise, the grudge may intensify over time.

360
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,000
She has already released him

361
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
but I haven't been able to give her

362
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,160
a satisfactory answer.

363
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,920
Even though I've given her

364
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,080
a piece of useful information

365
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,200
it may not be enough

366
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,360
to dispel her hostility towards me.

367
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
If I go see her now

368
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
she might hurl insults at me.

369
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,720
Since she released him without being asked

370
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
it shows that she is not dissatisfied

371
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,480
with the results of your investigation.

372
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,400
Master, is your horse still capable of running?

373
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,480
Of course.

374
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
I've taken good care of it.

375
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,880
Running this distance shouldn't pose any issues.

376
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,840
Miss, this should be it.

377
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,840
I couldn't find their whereabouts before

378
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,040
because they were hiding

379
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,520
in an abandoned house.

380
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,240
Surround the house and knock down the door.

381
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,560
Yes, Miss!

382
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Get them!

383
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,240
Yes, sir!

384
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Come out!

385
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Come out!

386
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,760
—What are you doing?                    —Go!

387
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,080
—Don't move! Go!              —Let go of me!

388
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,280
Let go of me!

389
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
Miss.

390
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,920
Why are you here in the middle of the night?

391
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,080
Are you here to kill us?

392
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,600
If I am here to kill you

393
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,960
do you think you still have a chance

394
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,520
to kneel here and talk to me?

395
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,160
You slandered my guard on the street

396
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,560
for no reason that day.

397
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,480
Then you fled when I wasn't paying attention.

398
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,920
Now I'm here to clear the air with you.

399
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,120
Miss, everything I said is true.

400
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,880
I didn't slander him.

401
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,120
If everything you said is true

402
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,800
you'd be in court

403
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,960
instead of hiding in this abandoned house.

404
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,240
Tie them up and break their legs

405
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,400
in case they try to run away again.

406
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,800
They slandered a member of the Hua family.

407
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,880
I can't take this lying down.

408
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,880
—Yes, Miss!       —Miss, please hear me out.

409
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,160
We don't have the nerve

410
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,440
to offend the Hua family, Miss.

411
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,080
You don't have the nerve?

412
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,560
Qi Rongzhou is my guard.

413
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,520
You're ruining my reputation by slandering him.

414
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,440
What are you waiting for? Do it!

415
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,400
—Miss, please spare me!         —No, please!

416
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,120
—Miss, please spare me!              —Don't!

417
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,040
That Qi rascal did an evil deed first.

418
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,440
Shut up!

419
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,200
—Someone told us to come here.     —Shut up!

420
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,240
I knew someone told you to come here.

421
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,640
You don't have to try and cover that up.

422
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,840
I won't ask about that.

423
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,040
You shouldn't have slandered him

424
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
when you did wrong in the first place.

425
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,960
I'm here to seek justice for Qi Rongzhou.

426
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,160
Everything we said is true.

427
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,480
It's really not a slander.

428
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,360
It's true that that Qi little bastard...

429
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,160
No... I mean, that Qi kid set the house on fire

430
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,120
and killed my father-in-law.

431
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,520
The cheek of you to mention this.

432
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Don't you know what kind of man

433
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
your father-in-law was?

434
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,680
Do I have to tell you

435
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,080
the number of servants and children he killed?

436
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,800
Qi Rongzhou didn't pursue the matter

437
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,120
yet you came here to accuse him.

438
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,200
You should be glad that

439
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,200
your father-in-law is dead.

440
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,320
Otherwise, he would suffer

441
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,640
a worse fate than death.

442
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,520
What your father-in-law did wasn't your fault

443
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,520
but you have to go to the <i>yamen</i>

444
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,960
to explain yourselves

445
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,640
and withdraw the letter of indictment.

446
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,400
Admit your mistake

447
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,800
and I will let the matter slide.

448
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
Well...

449
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,920
What, are you hesitating?

450
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Do you think you can tell lies in the <i>yamen</i>

451
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
and brush me off?

452
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,080
Your hometown is in Huiyang County.

453
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,960
Believe it or not, I can capture

454
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,440
your whole family right now

455
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,520
chop all of you into pieces

456
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,120
and throw you into the river to feed the fish.

457
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,160
No, Miss...

458
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,640
But I doubt the truth is of any help.

459
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,000
Don't talk nonsense...

460
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,240
This is the second time

461
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,760
you stopped your wife from talking.

462
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,120
Do you really think I'm blind?

463
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,880
Miss, your men were threatening to kill us

464
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,040
the moment you came in.

465
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,520
It didn't seem like

466
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,000
you were looking for the truth.

467
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,600
Whatever we say makes no difference.

468
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,880
I already knew the truth

469
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,280
so why should I ask?

470
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,760
The two of you deceived others

471
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,880
for your own selfish motives.

472
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,680
You've been given an opportunity

473
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,520
to come clean

474
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,920
and to save yourselves.

475
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,320
But if you insist on saying nothing

476
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,120
I don't mind using some means

477
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,400
to make you go to the <i>yamen</i>

478
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
to withdraw the lawsuit.

479
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,680
These nobles are all the same.

480
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,640
They refuse to listen to anyone.

481
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,000
They act according to their own wishes.

482
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,280
What do you mean?

483
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,440
If we tell you the truth

484
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,440
will you really let bygones be bygones

485
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,200
and leave our family alone?

486
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,640
You have my word.

487
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,880
We had a good life in Huiyang County.

488
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,960
As you said, my father was...

489
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,360
We knew what he was like.

490
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,400
Even though we hated Qi Rongzhou

491
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,600
and later found out his whereabouts

492
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,840
we wanted to hide from him

493
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,080
instead of finding him.

494
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,640
We wouldn't come all the way here.

495
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,160
We cherish our lives.

496
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,200
We made it clear right from the start.

497
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,400
We weren't going to pursue the matter.

498
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,120
But now, we're forced to testify against him.

499
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,720
We wanted to leave Huangcheng

500
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,040
but fearing for our family's safety

501
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,360
upon returning home

502
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,720
we went into hiding.

503
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,120
We thought we would wait

504
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,520
for the matter to blow over.

505
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
But now...

506
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,080
It doesn't matter if we tell the truth or not.

507
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,960
Ordinary folk like us don't have a say.

508
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,040
It's not up to us to go back there

509
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,320
and withdraw the lawsuit.

510
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,440
You mean, after you told the truth

511
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,680
you were still forced to come here?

512
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,920
You just need to answer yes or no

513
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:15,680
and I will deal with the rest.

514
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,240
I will send you away

515
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,800
as if I had never seen you.

516
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,600
I'll also ensure the safety

517
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,840
of you and your family.

518
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,840
But if you lie to me

519
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
I will round up all of you including

520
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,200
your family members in the border town

521
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
for questioning.

522
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,000
I swear to the heavens

523
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,480
everything I said just now is true.

524
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,640
This is... it?

525
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
Who knows?

526
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,120
Let's go back to our hometown.

527
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,240
We can't afford to offend the people here.

528
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,240
If I had known, I wouldn't have sent anyone

529
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,200
to investigate that little bastard.

530
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,920
We have brought trouble upon yourselves.

531
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,800
I was waiting for you.

532
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
What's the matter?

533
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
What's wrong with you?

534
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,720
Nothing.

535
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,040
Tell your people to keep a distance.

536
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,600
I came here to tell you this.

537
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,720
I know you've already released him.

538
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,560
Although I didn't write much in my letter

539
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,720
and couldn't provide you

540
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,360
with substantial evidence

541
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,440
I went to great lengths

542
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,560
to gather the information.

543
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,480
I understand that you might be upset

544
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,000
but since you've released him

545
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,400
I came here to see you.

546
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
Are you listening to me?

547
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,720
What kind of incense are you wearing?

548
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,720
Why does it smell so familiar?

549
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,240
I'm not wearing any incense.

550
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Hua Qian.

551
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,840
Please pay attention to what I have to say.

552
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,240
I'm not feeling well.

553
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,880
I'm afraid I have to go.

554
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,160
I want to avoid further interaction with you

555
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,720
so let's sort it out once and for all.

556
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,240
Then, we won't have to see each other again.

557
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,680
I've thought it through.

558
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,040
Even if Zhong Yelan still likes you

559
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,880
I will not choose to run away.

560
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,440
I will prove to him

561
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,320
and show him who truly cares for him

562
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,120
so I don't need you to let me have him.

563
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,360
Why haven't you gotten past this?

564
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,960
I didn't let you have him.

565
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,920
He chose you.

566
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,440
He did so on our wedding night.

567
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,080
He did it again

568
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,320
on the day I returned to my maiden home.

569
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,440
He did the same on the cliff as well.

570
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,000
And even now, he hasn't changed.

571
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,040
I was the one who lost my head

572
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,120
and did something wrong

573
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,160
but your brother has done wrong too.

574
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,800
Now I understand.

575
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,160
Many aspects of this world entail shades of grey.

576
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Everyone has their own opinions

577
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,440
about what is right and what is wrong.

578
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,320
Although the Mu family has declined

579
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,720
I won't do any more harm to the Hua family.

580
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
As long as you don't step on my toes

581
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,840
I will treat you as a stranger.

582
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
All right.

583
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,560
Lastly, I want to give you a piece of advice.

584
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,160
I don't know how you got involved with him

585
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,280
but since we're acquaintances

586
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,880
do heed my advice.

587
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,000
I couldn't find any evidence despite my effort.

588
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,200
There's no way to prove that he did it.

589
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,800
Also, even if you've chosen to divorce Lan

590
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,040
for the sake of your family

591
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,840
but high places are precarious

592
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,840
you may die before you can enjoy the benefits.

593
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,120
Let's go.

594
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,280
Go to the prison with me tomorrow.

595
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
Yes, Miss.

596
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,520
Miss, why are you here again?

597
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,520
It's filthy in here.

598
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
I have met the Li couple.

599
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,000
I got you into this.

600
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,280
But don't worry

601
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,040
I promise I'll get you out of prison

602
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,960
no matter what price I have to pay.

603
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,360
Are you saying...

604
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,480
I mean a lot to you, Miss?

605
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,360
Yes, you mean a lot to me.

606
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,400
I drove Cuizhu away.

607
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,040
It's none of my business.

608
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,440
Why are you telling me this?

609
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,600
You became upset at the drop of a hat.

610
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,840
Qianzhi is about to get married.

611
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,440
I may only have you

612
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,280
by my side in the future.

613
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,320
When you're released

614
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,000
my parents and I

615
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,720
will probably leave Huangcheng.

616
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,400
We're not returning to our hometown in glory.

617
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,440
We won't be bringing many servants with us.

618
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,280
We don't have much money either.

619
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:55,240
And maybe we won't even have a place to stay

620
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,400
or sufficient food to eat.

621
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,000
Do you still want to come with me?

622
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,000
Miss, I'm not after glory or money

623
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,320
working for you.

624
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,280
So, no matter what

625
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,320
I won't leave

626
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,120
even if you decide to dismiss me.

627
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,600
Tell me something.

628
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,560
Say there is a path ahead

629
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,440
which is full of uncertainties and hardships

630
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,280
and everyone told me not to continue on

631
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,520
shall I stay put

632
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,080
or pick a different path?

633
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,880
Silly me. Why am I telling you this?

634
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,440
Since it's a path full of uncertainties

635
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,200
it's better to turn around while you can.

636
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,800
I said that

637
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,240
because I don't want to see you suffer.

638
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,280
No matter which path you choose

639
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,240
I will always be with you.

640
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,320
<i>Hua Residence</i>

641
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,320
Put them all away.

642
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,400
Aren't these from Young Master Hua?

643
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,920
Miss, are you not going to wear them anymore?

644
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Put them in the chest for now.

645
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,000
I have some jewellery on the dressing table.

646
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
I will wear these...

647
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,320
someday.

648
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,800
Miss, Huang sent this just now.

649
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,960
Huang said that this is the money

650
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,480
from selling the last shop.

651
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,640
He completed the task quicker than I expected.

652
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,160
How are you and Nanfeng getting along?

653
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
I plan to leave

654
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,720
only after seeing you get married.

655
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,920
Don't make fun of me, Miss.

656
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,600
I merely asked a question.

657
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,800
Why are you running away?

658
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Do you have a crush on anyone?

659
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,320
No... I don't.

660
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,520
Qianzhi has a sharp tongue

661
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,200
and tends to make things difficult for others.

662
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,400
Cui...

663
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,720
The rest are also troublemakers.

664
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,160
I worry about them all the time.

665
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,920
Among my maids

666
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,720
you are the most composed.

667
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,520
I can always rely on you to get things done.

668
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,280
Do you have any plans for your future?

669
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,000
I'm happy if I can serve you, Miss.

670
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,720
You can't marry me, can you?

671
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,840
How can you be with me

672
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,080
for the rest of your life?

673
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
Don't worry. Whatever I gave Qianzhi

674
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,200
you will get them too.

675
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,400
It hasn't been easy for you girls

676
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,320
the whole time you've been with me.

677
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,200
I know this may be sudden

678
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,400
but there's still time. How about this?

679
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,160
I'll give you two days to think about

680
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,120
what you want.

681
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,000
Tell me after you've given it some thought.

682
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,000
If I'm able to fulfil your wish, I will.

683
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,200

Miss...

686
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,120
You don't have to worry about Hua Rongzhou.

687
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,200
I'll take care of it.

688
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,360
When we get home

689
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,720
go and look for the housekeeper.

690
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,040
Take the money and your indenture

691
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
and leave.

692
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,960
I can let you off the hook for what you did

693
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,320
but I can't keep you by my side anymore.

694
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,320
Miss, I did wrong.

695
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,040
And I'll receive any punishment.

696
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,480
I don't want any money or my indenture.

697
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,080
Just let me stay until I see Guard Hua

698
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,240
return home safe and sound.

699
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,280
After that, you can even sell me away.

700
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,400
Miss...

701
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,280
Do whatever you want.

702
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,760
