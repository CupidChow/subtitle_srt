00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
<i>Episode 19</i>

2
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,960
Qian.

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm here for you.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,160
Give the nod

5
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,600
and I am right here for you.

6
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,120
<i>Can I hold this hand?</i>

7
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Mistress!

8
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,880
Mistress!

9
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
Mistress!

10
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Mistress!

11
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,600
Please go and see Guard Hua.

12
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,200
He is bleeding profusely.

13
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,680
Tell me, what happened to Hua Rongzhou?

14
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,240
Just go and see him, Mistress!

15
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,600
Lord, thank you for coming

16
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
to deliver the divorce letter to me.

17
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,960
I will pretend I didn't hear what you said

18
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,720
and I hope you'll never bring this up again.

19
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
Let's go.

20
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,640
Lord.

21
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Well

22
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,440
I have been waiting for so long

23
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,200
but now I'm getting anxious like a kid.

24
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,360
Physician, how is Hua Rongzhou?

25
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,960
Mistress, he is fine

26
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,600
but his wound ruptured the second time

27
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,040
so it is hurting him a lot.

28
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,440
He has taken some medicine

29
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,880
and fallen asleep.

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,000
His wound ruptured the second time?

31
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,360
—Qianzhi.                        —Yes, Miss.

32
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,800
What's going on?

33
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,080
Mistress, don't you know?

34
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,240
Miss Hua, Guard Hua was injured

35
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,000
when he jumped off the cliff that day.

36
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,360
Maybe Master's attack yesterday

37
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,360
made the wound rupture again.

38
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,200
Jumped off the cliff?

39
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,520
That day, Guard Hua followed you

40
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
into the valley

41
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,720
and brought you back the next morning.

42
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
We saw a wound around his waist.

43
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,400
He probably got scratched

44
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,360
by a branch when he fell.

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,160
But he didn't say much to us.

46
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,120
He fell into the valley after me?

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,400
Mu Yao, you owe me one.

48
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,880
—Mistress!                            —Qian!

49
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,680
Qian!

50
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,760
Why didn't anyone tell me about his injury?

51
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,840
Mistress, you have been feeling down

52
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,800
and keeping to yourself in the past few days.

53
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
You wouldn't listen to anything we say.

54
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,800
After all, he's just a guard

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,000
and he doesn't listen to us.

56
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,600
How dare we talk about it at this moment?

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,600
Guard Hua insisted on guarding the compound

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
even though he was injured.

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,040
And he took a blow from Master yesterday.

60
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,240
Despite that, he didn't say a word.

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,600
I didn't know how badly he was hurt

62
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,720
until he passed out in front of me.

63
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,840
But, Mistress, you didn't care about him.

64
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
—Cuizhu!                       —Guard Hua...

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Miss Hua.

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
The physician prescribed him some medicine.

67
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,560
We're supposed to collect it.

68
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,000
We shall do it now.

69
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,440
You said that I was prone to ignore you

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,920
and I refused to admit.

71
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,360
Now it seems

72
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,440
you've all been very kind to me

73
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
and I've been nothing

74
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,200
but selfish and self-absorbed.

75
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,280
I did that to you

76
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,200
and to my brother.

77
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Fortunately, it isn't too late to know now.

78
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,240
What is he dreaming about?

79
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,760
He's gripping on so tightly.

80
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
You're awake. Does the wound still hurt?

81
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,880
Can you let go of it now?

82
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,560
You pulled me close

83
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,040
before I even had time to talk to you.

84
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,560
I am so sorry. Please punish me.

85
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,240
Why do I want to punish you?

86
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
You're seriously injured.

87
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
You'd better go back to bed and get some rest.

88
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,720
Get up and put on some clothes

89
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,320
and I will come and see you later.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,480
I didn't sleep well last night

91
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,800
so I'll take a nap.

92
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,920
Wake me up if anything happens.

93
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,520
I was guarding the entrance

94
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,760
of the compound last night.

95
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,160
Miss, you were in Guard Hua's room.

96
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,920
He fell asleep and couldn't wake up

97
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,200
so I stayed for a while.

98
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Don't worry, Miss.

99
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,160
Fortunately, I made it look like

100
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,160
you had gone to bed last night.

101
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,040
It should be able to cover this up.

102
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,880
Why should I worry?

103
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,840
Men and women should observe the proprieties

104
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,400
not to mention between the master and servant.

105
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,120
It's better for you to be more careful.

106
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
If this gets out

107
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,040
I'm afraid it will ruin your reputation.

108
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,280
I know gossip is a fearful thing

109
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,560
but Hua Rongzhou was seriously injured

110
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,840
because of me.

111
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,880
It's only right that I serve him tea and water

112
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,360
in his room.

113
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,360
If it were you, I would do the same.

114
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,840
Now you are no longer servants to me

115
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,320
so don't say such words in the future.

116
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,280
Perhaps it is not suitable

117
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,160
to talk about this right here right now

118
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
but I still want to ask

119
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,360
if you would like to be with me.

120
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
If you have a little affection for me

121
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,240
leave everything to me.

122
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,960
And I'll have you stand rightfully beside me.

123
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,200
Qian.

124
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm here for you.

125
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,120
Give the nod

126
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
and I'm here for you.

127
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,560
Miss just fell asleep. What do you want?

128
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,400
If you're not in a hurry, talk to her later.

129
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll kneel here as punishment.

130
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,880
She doesn't need to know.

131
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,280
Why are you kneeling here?

132
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,880
Your medicine is ready.

133
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,960
—What are you doing?     —Get out of my way.

134
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
—I want to talk to Mistress.            —No!

135
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,040
Miss is sleeping. You can't go in.

136
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,160
—Get out of my way.                 —Cuizhu!

137
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
—Mistress....!             —You can't go in.

138
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,440
—I need to talk to you, Mistress!       —No!

139
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,720
—Cuizhu!                          —Mistress!

140
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,680
—Qianzhi...                       —Mistress!

141
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,960
—Cuizhu!           —What's going on outside?

142
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
—I need to talk to you. —Cuizhu, I told you.

143
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,040
—You can't come in.           —Let go of me.

144
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,600
Miss is sleeping.

145
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,240
Mistress.

146
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,200
Guard Hua was seriously injured

147
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
and unconscious yesterday.

148
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Please...

149
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,440
Please don't punish him

150
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,680
since he's such a loyal servant.

151
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,680
When did I punish him?

152
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,880
Guard Hua is kneeling outside now.

153
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,360
Qianzhi, help me comb my hair.

154
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,880
Cuizhu, go and bring Hua Rongzhou in.

155
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,960
Yes, Mistress.

156
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,000
Get up.

157
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,240
You are still injured.

158
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,480
Why are you not in bed resting?

159
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
Who punished you?

160
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
I have offended you

161
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,760
and should be punished.

162
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,280
You're honest to a fault.

163
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,200
As I said, it was nothing serious.

164
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,920
I wanted you

165
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,160
to rest for a while before asking questions.

166
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,000
I think it's better to do it now

167
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,440
and not let your imagination run wild.

168
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,880
Leave us. I have something to ask him.

169
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,840
Tell me.

170
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,400
You found me so quickly in the valley.

171
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,560
Did you jump off the cliff after me?

172
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Yes, I did.

173
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,240
Was your abdomen injury caused by the fall?

174
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,240
No.

175
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,640
When I came ashore from the river

176
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,880
I saw a man in black.

177
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,560
I thought it was the man in black

178
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,760
who followed us

179
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,000
so I attacked him.

180
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,200
He injured me during the fight.

181
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
Wait.

182
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,400
If we continue this fight

183
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,480
the woman you are looking for

184
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,720
will be even harder to find.

185
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,760
Did you see his face?

186
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
His face was masked.

187
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,680
I probably made a mistake.

188
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,160
The man in black

189
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,680
didn't seem to want to fight me.

190
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,800
So, after we both got injured

191
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,240
he left in a hurry

192
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,880
and I didn't chase after him.

193
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,920
I'm afraid you didn't make a mistake.

194
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,800
You jumped off a cliff and were injured.

195
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,840
Why didn't you tell me about these incidents?

196
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,760
Because you never asked.

197
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,120
I had been depressed for the past few days

198
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,440
but you must tell me everything from now on.

199
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Is that clear?

200
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm always busy with my own affairs

201
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,400
and cannot take care of everything.

202
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,760
I know you usually don't talk much

203
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,120
but you have done so much for me

204
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,680
and you have to learn to speak up.

205
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,240
And I have never regarded you as a servant

206
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,400
so you can speak freely.

207
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,640
I won't think you're asking for credit

208
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
or showing off.

209
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Understood.

210
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
One more thing.

211
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,760
Since you're injured, you need rest.

212
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,600
You shouldn't have fought against Zhong Yelan.

213
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,240
You need to learn how to protect yourself

214
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,920
before you can protect others.

215
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is that clear?

216
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,160
Miss, you have said this to me before

217
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,520
but I thought about it long and hard.

218
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,480
You treat me...

219
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,520
I mean, us very well.

220
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,720
I don't care about myself.

221
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,400
I just can't watch you get hurt.

222
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,440
All right.

223
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,040
You can go back and have a rest.

224
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Take a break from guarding the compound

225
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,400
for a couple of days. You need a good rest.

226
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,960
If you need anything, just tell Qianzhi.

227
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Yes, Miss.

228
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
By the way

229
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,320
I have poor eyesight.

230
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,000
Refrain from wearing black.

231
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,560
It's not noticeable if you get injured.

232
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,440
All right.

233
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
<i>Zhong Residence</i>

234
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,880
Make your decision. Choose neither

235
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,160
and they will both die!

236
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,360
That will help you avoid guilty

237
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
for making the choice to save only one.

238
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,200
Mu Yao, you owe me one.

239
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,760
—Mistress!                            —Qian!

240
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,200
Qian!

241
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,400
Are you okay?

242
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,680
Master.

243
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,040
Gather all the men in Zhong Residence.

244
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Conduct a thorough search for Mistress.

245
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
Yes, Master!

246
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
Let's go!

247
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,960
I attended Hua Shen's funeral yesterday.

248
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,120
People should hear about

249
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,520
the divorce between Hua Qian and me today.

250
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
It's so sudden. What happened?

251
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,120
Is it sudden?

252
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
I thought you couldn't wait for it to happen.

253
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

254
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
By the way

255
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,880
Hua Qian told me to pass you a message.

256
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
What message?

257
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,640
She said you owed her...

258
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,960
two lives.

259
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,800
Yao.

260
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,240
You said that I trusted Hua Qian blindly

261
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
and she made used of this

262
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,680
and lied to me repeatedly.

263
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,160
Indeed. That was what she did.

264
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
But what about you?

265
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Stop!

266
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,120
—Documents.                 —H-Here you are.

267
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,640
Go!

268
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
What's in your bag?

269
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,280
Clothes.

270
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Go!

271
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,680
Check thoroughly!

272
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
—Go!                             —Thank you.

273
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,880
Wait.

274
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Next.

275
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,400
Hey, stop. Routine check.

276
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Stop!

277
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,360
—Have you seen him?                     —No.

278
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,720
Wait! Did you see anyone suspicious?

279
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
No.

280
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Why are there so many soldiers on the street?

281
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,720
Master, the enforcement of the martial law

282
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,240
has become even stricter.

283
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
People getting out of the city

284
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
people who behave suspiciously on the street

285
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,560
and individual travellers in inns

286
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,040
are all being questioned one by one.

287
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,880
Although you change inn every few days

288
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,360
I'm afraid that you will inevitably

289
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,880
attract attention after a while.

290
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,040
Have you found a way to get out of the city?

291
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,040
The main exit is out of the question.

292
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,960
It is strictly guarded.

293
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,000
To the east of the city lies Donghuang Mountain.

294
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,680
The road there is rugged and steep.

295
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,560
Usually, no one will pass through there.

296
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
Security is weak there.

297
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,840
Sometimes there are even no guards at all.

298
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,520
We can give it a try.

299
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Are we going to exit by force?

300
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,280
No, there are not many of us in the city now.

301
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,080
If you want to leave

302
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
the rest of our men

303
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,440
will create a distraction at the main exit.

304
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
When that happens

305
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,200
Leaving the city from the east secretly

306
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,560
shouldn't pose much of a challenge.

307
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,600
Master.

308
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,360
The longer you stay

309
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,720
the more difficult it is to leave.

310
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,680
What was I thinking?

311
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,240
In the end

312
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,680
I have got nothing.

313
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,880
But that was my parrot

314
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,920
and she should be mine.

315
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
I fell in love at first sight

316
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,840
but I just gave an excuse

317
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,960
and said I would test her out.

318
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,440
If I had known better

319
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,360
I might as well abduct her and leave.

320
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Master.

321
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,960
Never mind.

322
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,920
Just do as you said.

323
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
Shen

324
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,560
brought me this tea when he was alive.

325
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,240
He knew that I liked tea

326
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,760
so he spent a lot of money

327
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,360
to buy these fragrant tea leaves.

328
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,240
I reprimanded him many times for this

329
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,520
but he turned a deaf ear to it.

330
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
I...

331
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,160
wanted to keep the tea to myself.

332
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,200
Why don't you try the tea?

333
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,960
How is Mother holding up?

334
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,320
She stopped crying and making a fussing.

335
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,520
Her mood is much more stable now.

336
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,600
If you can, go and see her more frequently.

337
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,000
You are her only child now

338
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
and she won't fight with you again

339
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,440
when she's thinking more clearly.

340
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,240
What's wrong?

341
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,600
I'm fine.

342
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,600
I think it's the sequelae of the arrow injury.

343
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,920
Soon

344
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,440
I'll send your brother's memorial tablet

345
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,720
to the ancestral hall in our hometown.

346
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,320
Only after that

347
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,240
will I resign from my position as head butler

348
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,000
lest the old stubborn folk of the clan

349
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,160
see that they no longer have someone to rely on

350
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
and try to stop me.

351
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,840
It's all up to you.

352
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,680
Qian.

353
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,120
Is there somewhere you want to go?

354
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,200
After we settle the matters here

355
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,880
we shall not rush to return to our hometown.

356
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,680
Let's go travelling

357
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,480
so that your mother can forget her troubles.

358
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,800
All these years in Huangcheng City

359
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,200
I realised I had never taken the family out.

360
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,520
I had neglected you all.

361
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,040
Father, can you lend me some men?

362
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,920
Did you get into some trouble?

363
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,360
My guard is injured

364
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,560
and now I want to investigate something.

365
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,520
Unfortunately

366
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
I don't have people whom I can deploy.

367
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,160
Tell me the problem.

368
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,720
I'll see if I can help.

369
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,040
It's nothing serious.

370
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,960
I can do it myself.

371
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,440
Qian.

372
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,320
You can deploy anyone in this house.

373
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,520
You don't need my permission.

374
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,680
Just let me know

375
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,840
if you run into a roadblock.

376
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,960
Thank you, Father.

377
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,000
Why are you being so polite to me?

378
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,800
Go on. Have a sip of the tea.

379
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,920
—Miss Hua.                        —Miss Hua.

380
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
I have picked a few men for you.

381
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,400
They are agile and clever.

382
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,000
There are too few men.

383
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,840
I will bring a few more later.

384
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,680
All right.

385
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,480
You don't need to bring them to me though.

386
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,280
Just do as I said

387
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,520
and have them get ready.

388
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,360
At the command of you.

389
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,120
Six of you will guard

390
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,960
the perimeter of Zhong Residence.

391
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,360
You have two main tasks.

392
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,760
One of them is to pay attention

393
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,560
to every move of Concubine Mu.

394
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,480
Follow her whenever she goes out.

395
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,160
But make sure she doesn't notice you.

396
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,760
Report to me whom she meets.

397
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,160
The other task is to look out for night visitors

398
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,280
at Zhong Residence.

399
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,480
If there is, find out his whereabouts

400
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,080
and report to me.

401
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,480
Noted, Miss Hua.

402
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,560
Don't panic if you're caught.

403
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,720
Just say that you are the guards

404
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,880
of Hua Residence

405
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
and that you're under my orders

406
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,360
to monitor Mu Yao's movements.

407
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,920
Don't bother about what they might say.

408
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,080
Noted.

409
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
—You may leave.              —Yes, Miss Hua!

410
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,120
Miss Hua.

411
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,320
They may be agile

412
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,960
but monitoring all movements

413
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,160
in Zhong Residence could pose a challenge.

414
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,360
After all, there are many capable people

415
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,600
in Zhong Residence as well.

416
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,360
I know that.

417
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,960
That's why I only need them

418
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,600
keep an eye on Mu Yao.

419
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
Get six more men

420
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,160
to take turns with the six of them just now.

421
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,640
Bear this in mind. Remain focused.

422
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,760
Now that Huangcheng is under martial law

423
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,000
there's no way he can escape.

424
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,720
Knowing his temperament

425
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm sure he will bid Mu Yao farewell

426
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,280
before he leaves.

427
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,840
So you must pay close attention

428
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,040
to Mu Yao's movements.

429
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,640
Don't confront her

430
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,120
unless it is absolutely necessary.

431
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,280
I don't want to confront Mu Yao right now.

432
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,640
She won't believe a word I say.

433
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Miss Hua, don't worry.

434
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,160
I'll be sure to remind them again.

435
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,320
Just do your best.

436
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,960
After all, they can run but they cannot hide.

437
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Yes, Miss.

438
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,360
Time is running out.

439
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
I can't just sit and wait.

440
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,600
Send a message to Zhong's Garden later.

441
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,200
Tell them that I will go there tomorrow

442
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,840
to thank Her Highness.

443
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Yes, Miss.

444
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,280
Yinxing.

445
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
You have always been

446
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,080
in charge of my jewellery.

447
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,680
Do you remember the white jade bracelet

448
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,160
that Her Highness gave me when I got married?

449
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,640
Yes, I remember.

450
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,080
Help me find it.

451
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,840
I'm going to Zhong's Garden tomorrow.

452
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,720
I should return it.

453
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,160
Got it, Miss.

454
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Master.

455
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,640
I just came back from outside

456
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
and I noticed there were people

457
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,120
snooping around.

458
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,960
I secretly observed them for a while.

459
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,120
They seem to be monitoring

460
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
the movements in Zhong Residence.

461
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Whose men are those?

462
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,760
They seem to be...

463
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,160
from the Hua family.

464
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,240
Get changed and run an errand for me.

465
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Yes, Master.

466
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,680
Mistress is here, Your Highness.

467
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

468
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,240
Sit down.

469
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,320
Yes, Your Highness.

470
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,240
I haven't seen you for a few days

471
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,080
and you have lost a lot of weight.

472
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,000
I didn't get out of the house these days.

473
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,960
I wouldn't have lost weight.

474
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,760
Your Highness, besides thanking you

475
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,080
I came to return this bracelet to you.

476
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,720
After all, I have not met your expectations.

477
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,080
It is yours since I have given it to you.

478
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,000
You don't have to return it to me.

479
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,200
The late emperor gave this to you.

480
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,680
I'm only an outsider.

481
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,160
I dare not accept it nor should I.

482
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,400
There is no outsider here.

483
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,040
Even though you and Yelan are not meant to be

484
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,560
you don't have to keep a distance from me.

485
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,720
Just take it as a gift from an elder.

486
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

487
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,560
Since you were married

488
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,920
I bore witness to your actions and conduct.

489
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,200
I know that you are sensible

490
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,360
and know what you should do.

491
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,440
Yelan is not fortunate enough

492
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,600
to stay married to you.

493
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,880
I'm not some foolish old lady

494
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,120
who only favours her own child

495
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,320
so you don't have to keep a distance from me.

496
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,320
If you want to come to Zhong's Garden

497
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,120
feel free to come and see me

498
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,320
so that I won't be so lonely.

499
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,040
Are your parents okay?

500
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,200
Those Ge family members

501
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,360
completely disregard the law.

502
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,080
The assassination was executed in public

503
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,600
and they did not show

504
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,120
the Zhong family any respect.

505
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,080
In a way, we brought upon your brother's death.

506
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,360
Lord has been overwhelmed with

507
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,360
the investigation in the past few days

508
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,320
and he seems to have lost a lot of weight too.

509
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,560
My brother was destined to suffer an ill fate.

510
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,640
<i>He was unlucky to have me as his sister.</i>

511
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,160
Speaking of which

512
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,080
I realised two days ago

513
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,800
that I forgot about passing down the order

514
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,560
to approve the divorce between you and Yelan.

515
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,840
When I remembered it

516
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,080
I heard that Lord had already given the order.

517
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,000
Your Highness, thank you for remembering.

518
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,360
I couldn't wait any longer

519
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,880
so I asked someone to send a message

520
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,200
to Zhong's Garden.

521
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,360
That reminded Lord of the matter

522
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
and then he passed down the order.

523
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,800
Lord is so occupied

524
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,600
with the assassination investigation

525
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,160
that he rarely comes to my compound

526
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,160
and I haven't seen him much.

527
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
I was worried about him

528
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
the day before yesterday

529
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,200
so I sent someone to bring him some food

530
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,400
but, in the end, no one was there.

531
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,880
He has a stable personality

532
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,120
so I wonder

533
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,080
why he slipped out of Zhong's Garden secretly

534
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,320
without informing me.

535
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,480
If you're talking about the day before yesterday

536
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,640
Lord had gone to look for me.

537
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,520
The Lord showed sympathy towards me

538
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,720
due to my brother's recent death.

539
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,200
And he also took into account my father's

540
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,480
long-term contribution to the Zhong family

541
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,200
so he personally delivered

542
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,240
the divorce letter to me.

543
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Lord has overstepped the boundary

544
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,080
with regard to this matter.

545
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,160
Please don't take it to heart.

546
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,000
I will make sure he leaves you alone

547
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,480
in the future.

548
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,320
Your Highness

549
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,640
when the truth about the Zhong's Garden

550
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,640
assassination comes to light

551
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,560
my father will tender his resignation

552
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,800
and return to our hometown

553
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,960
and I will go with him.

554
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,000
I suppose I'll never return

555
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,880
to Huangcheng ever again.

556
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,240
Why?

557
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,280
My brother grew up in Huangcheng.

558
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,920
It is too painful for me

559
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,160
and my parents

560
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,400
to continue living here.

561
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,480
Right...

562
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,320
That's right.

563
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,640
Don't blame me.

564
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
The Zhong family has always

565
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,160
valued its reputation.

566
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,400
Xiwu and Yelan have been as close as brothers

567
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,160
since childhood.

568
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,440
But they may turn against each other

569
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,840
because of you.

570
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,280
And if word got out

571
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,800
I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to protect you.

572
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,280
Your Highness, thank you for the reminder.

573
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,680
<i>Bonus footage</i>

574
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,000
Mother, I want to fly the kite myself.

575
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,960
Wait a minute. I'll fly it higher for you.

576
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,080
I want to fly it myself.

577
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,720
You want to fly it yourself?

578
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,800
Wait a minute. I'll fly it higher.

579
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,400
I want to fly it myself.

580
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,560
Come and catch me then.

581
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,520
Mother, I want to fly it.

582
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,880
Mother, give it to me.

583
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,840
I want to do it myself.

584
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,840
I'll do it myself.

585
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,560
I'll do it myself.

586
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Here you are.

587
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,000
If you like the kite, then hold it tight.

588
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,160
Okay?

589
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,520
Go on and play with it.

590
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,760
If you like it, then hold it tight.

591
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,680
What is he dreaming about?

592
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,080
He's holding on so tightly.
