1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,720
<i>Episode 8</i>

3
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,600
Lord, although I'm just a woman

4
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,920
I know that

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
a person has only one life.

6
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,200
Even if I have evil intentions

7
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,000
I won't risk my life.

8
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,640
What do you mean?

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,560
You brought the physician with you today.

10
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,800
Wasn't it just to check

11
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,640
if my injury was real?

12
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,240
I know that you're prejudiced against me.

13
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,520
But Physician Wu also said that

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,200
this arrow could've killed me.

15
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,760
Because I'm so afraid of pain

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,520
I resort to using fragrance to relieve it.

17
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,720
Do you still think that I don't fear death?

18
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,320
At the ancestral worship

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,880
I don't know what I did

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,360
to raise your suspicion

21
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,400
but I value the safety of Master

22
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,680
more than my own life.

23
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,240
Isn't that enough to prove my sincerity?

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,640
I made a slip of the tongue.

25
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,120
Lord. Mistress.

26
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,680
Master's maid, Mu Yao, is here.

27
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,080
Are you the <i>guqin</i> player from that day?

28
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,080
Yes, Lord. That was me.

29
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
Master heard that you have come to visit

30
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,080
so he sent me to invite you over.

31
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,480
Take a good rest.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
I shan't bother you.

33
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,760
Mistress.

34
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,280
Is your wound hurting too much?

35
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,680
Your eyes are red.

36
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes. It hurts too much.

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
Shall I top up on the fragrance?

38
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,680
No.

39
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,680
Put it away from now on.

40
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,560
Aren't you afraid of the pain?

41
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
As the doctor said

42
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,800
excessive use of this sleep-aiding fragrance

43
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,880
will damage the mind.

44
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,520
From now, regardless of how much it hurts

45
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,480
I must quit it.

46
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,120
I can't lose my head again.

47
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,920
I don't know

48
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,400
why some people can easily

49
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,400
win the love and trust of others.

50
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,240
With just one look

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,720
others will fall for them.

52
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,040
While some people

53
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,400
who go all out of their way

54
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,720
still receive hostility and suspicion

55
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,560
despite all their effort

56
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,360
and aren't viewed differently from before.

57
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
Mistress, who are you talking about?

58
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
Mistress.

59
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,040
Master said he's busy

60
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,680
so he can't come over.

61
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
Where's everyone?

62
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
You've been confined to your bed

63
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,840
and Master hasn't been visiting

64
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,560
so the staff started slacking.

65
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
Mistress, why don't you go back

66
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
and I'll clean it up?

67
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Mistress.

68
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,200
Your brother has sent you jewellery again.

69
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,840
Didn't I tell you to stop him from doing it?

70
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,360
My closet is almost full.

71
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
I did.

72
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,160
But he doesn't listen.

73
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,080
He sends me stuff all the time

74
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,600
yet never visits.

75
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,160
He visited with your mother this morning.

76
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,320
But...

77
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,120
What?

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,040
Just...

79
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,600
It's just that Master stopped them

80
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,080
and seemed to have said something to them

81
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,720
so they're afraid to show up anymore.

82
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,680
Mistress.

83
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,160
Are you going out?

84
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,640
I'm going to see Zhong Yelan.

85
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,440
I need to talk to Master.

86
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,840
Please inform him I'm here.

87
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,440
Master said...

88
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
he doesn't want to see you.

89
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,480
But I have something to tell him.

90
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
Mu Yao.

91
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,440
As I've said before

92
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,720
many choices weren't made by the current me

93
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
but I no longer harbour

94
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,040
any evil intention towards you.

95
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,760
What I owe you

96
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,800
I promise I'll pay you back little by little.

97
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
Won't you trust me for once?

98
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm dealing with work

99
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,600
and don't have time to see anyone.

100
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,840
I, Hua Qian

101
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,600
am here to ask for a divorce.

102
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,360
What I said is

103
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,880
after much careful consideration.

104
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,240
I hope Master will seriously consider it.

105
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,880
I shall leave and wait for your response.

106
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,360
You two silly girls.

107
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,040
Why are you so sad?

108
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,440
I have my own plan.

109
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,160
Don't worry about it.

110
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,760
Do you think I would be bullied?

111
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,840
Cuizhu, get me some snacks.

112
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I didn't have breakfast.

113
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,760
Now I can't even walk properly.

114
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,520
I guess I was too presumptuous again.

115
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,680
Mistress, are you all right?

116
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,960
Young man, you're promising.

117
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,120
You're that young man

118
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,360
that saved me

119
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
during the ancestral worship, right?

120
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,640
Mistress.

121
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,280
Yes, that was me.

122
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,240
I couldn't hear you clearly then.

123
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,600
What's your name again?

124
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,520
My name is...

125
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Hua Rongzhou.

126
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,760
How dare you look directly at Mistress...

127
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
Qianzhi!

128
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,880
You saved my life.

129
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,800
I'll remember your name.

130
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,120
Coincidentally, we share the same surname.

131
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,160
I guess we're destined to meet.

132
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
How old are you?

133
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,200
I'm 16.

134
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,360
Then, I'm older than you.

135
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,360
One year older. Yes, I'm 17.

136
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll remember that you saved my life.

137
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,360
Work hard.

138
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,680
Thank you so much, Mistress.

139
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,960
Lord, regarding the assassination

140
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,760
I've looked into it several times

141
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,760
and discovered something fishy.

142
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,760
What's that?

143
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,280
In the past year

144
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,200
all traces of the Ge family were wiped out

145
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,680
and they've never shown up once.

146
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,560
That didn't stop me from the investigation.

147
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,720
After all, the people here still hate them

148
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,400
for using fake and inferior fragrance

149
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,840
to harm people.

150
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,680
Once they find out

151
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,040
they'll report it to the authorities.

152
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
It's plausible

153
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,160
if there are only a few Ge's people

154
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,280
who are hiding here.

155
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,880
But there's no way

156
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,240
a bunch of them would show up out of nowhere.

157
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
Really?

158
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,880
I feel that the attack

159
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,040
was aimed at stealing our secret formula.

160
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
The Ge family and the Zhong family

161
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,560
are evenly matched.

162
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Besides them, who else would have

163
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,720
the nerve to launch the attack?

164
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,320
The attackers

165
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,520
may indeed be from the Ge family.

166
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,640
There may be people

167
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,760
in our city

168
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,200
who are helping to cover their tracks

169
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,840
so that a large number of them

170
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,280
can remain undetected here.

171
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,640
Or maybe someone...

172
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,040
from other forces is helping them

173
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,160
so that they can sneak into the city so quickly.

174
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,720
That is to say

175
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,360
either there are covert traitors in the city

176
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,600
or it's the work of outsiders?

177
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,800
Our guards shall step up effort to search

178
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,240
and patrol

179
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,480
to find out the culprits.

180
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,840
You and Her Highness can be assured of that.

181
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,360
I'll speak to my mother about this

182
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,880
but I suggest

183
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,720
not to beef up the number of guards

184
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,280
except at the city gates.

185
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,080
Make sure it remains the same strength.

186
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,600
How can we find out

187
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,360
if we don't increase the number of guards?

188
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,280
The incense banquet is about to begin.

189
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
At this critical point

190
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,720
we can't lose face

191
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,080
in front of out-of-town merchants.

192
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,200
Anyway, we didn't incur heavy casualties

193
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,040
and now the civilians are watching us.

194
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I think what needs to be done now is

195
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,760
reassure our people

196
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,280
and keep a close watch covertly

197
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,760
instead of adding on more guards

198
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,200
which could cause people to panic.

199
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,720
After all, the Ge family case

200
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,920
caused so many disturbances

201
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,080
and many were deeply harmed by their actions.

202
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,760
Lord, you're so thoughtful.

203
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,600
Lord.

204
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,320
What's the matter?

205
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,280
Just now when you were busy

206
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
Chief Lin left a message with me.

207
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,800
What is it?

208
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
Mistress Hua wants a divorce.

209
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
Divorce?

210
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,320
Master, it's mealtime.

211
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Master?

212
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,960
I saw that you didn't eat much

213
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,600
so I cooked this as a gift for you.

214
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,000
I hope you enjoy it

215
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,440
and appreciate the thought behind the gift.

216
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,360
Because I see him as the only one in my life

217
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,920
so, by hook or by crook

218
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,600
I also want to be

219
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,240
the only one in his eye.

220
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,800
I guess I loved him so much

221
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,200
that it helped me understand this.

222
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,760
I'd do anything to make him happy.

223
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,640
I, Hua Qian

224
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,200
am here to ask for a divorce.

225
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,080
What I said is

226
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,080
after much careful consideration.

227
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,440
I hope Master will seriously consider it.

228
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,960
Your hair is dry now.

229
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,440
Mistress, you should watch your injury

230
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,040
and have an early night.

231
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,560
How long has that Hua Rongzhou

232
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,760
been working here?

233
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,360
Almost a month.

234
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,480
Do you find something wrong with him?

235
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,880
Yes.

236
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,560
What's wrong?

237
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,320
He's so beautiful.

238
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,400
An ordinary guard in our household

239
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,600
with such a pretty face

240
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,720
and the same surname as mine.

241
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,520
Yet, I don't remember seeing him before.

242
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,880
Mistress.

243
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,080
—I heard what you did...      —Housemaid Li.

244
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,240
Does my father have any extramarital affairs?

245
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,040
What are you talking about, Mistress?

246
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,640
Or does he have any illegitimate children

247
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
that are abandoned?

248
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,240
Butler Hua acts upright.

249
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,600
He only cares about his business.

250
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,400
He has never even taken a concubine.

251
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,320
How would he do such a thing?

252
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,640
Then what about my brother?

253
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,880
Mistress.

254
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,240
How can you speculate

255
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,120
about your family like this?

256
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,960
Sir is only 23.

257
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,000
He's still a child!

258
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Mistress...

259
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,280
I think she's not in a good mood today.

260
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,880
You should stop now.

261
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,080
Mistress.

262
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,560
Take the soup while it's still hot.

263
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,200
You'd better have an early night.

264
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't think too much.

265
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,800
Take good care of her.

266
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,840
Regardless, he doesn't look like a nobody.

267
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,960
Mistress, please go to bed early.

268
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,040
There are countless beautiful people around.

269
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,080
Please take care of your health.

270
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,680
Don't brood over this.

271
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
That's right.

272
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,520
Anyway, this situation

273
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,080
is different from the past.

274
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,360
It's not odd that I see someone

275
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
I have not met before.

276
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,720
Just let it go.

277
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,360
It seems quite valuable

278
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,960
but they look so cumbersome.

279
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,760
Wearing them on my head

280
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,720
will hurt my neck and annoy me.

281
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,440
I'd better sell them tomorrow

282
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,520
and save up the money.

283
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,760
I remember there are more.

284
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,040
What are you doing?

285
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,160
Packing my luggage.

286
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,960
Light the candle.

287
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,400
Master, why are you here?

288
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,720
The maids didn't inform me of your visit.

289
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,120
Did you come

290
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,360
with an answer to my question?

291
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,360
You expect that I'd drive you out

292
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,800
so you're packing your luggage here, right?

293
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,680
That's not it.

294
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,960
I couldn't sleep

295
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,640
and thought to myself that

296
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,480
I'd yet to check out

297
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,920
the jewellery my brother sent me

298
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,640
so I got up to sort through them.

299
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,400
In that case

300
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,080
don't try to read my mind in the future.

301
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,840
In the future?

302
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,960
What?

303
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,080
Are you in such a hurry to leave?

304
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,240
No, I just...

305
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,640
Lately, something's been puzzling me.

306
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,120
Did you save me at the ancestral worship

307
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
just to redeem yourself

308
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,800
and then leave?

309
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,360
Why do you say that about me, Master?

310
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,200
My love for you is so true

311
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
that no one can judge me.

312
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,280
But I was misguided

313
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,440
due to my obsession.

314
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,560
Now that my mind is clear

315
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,680
I should ask for a divorce to let you and...

316
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,560
Fine. Since you love me so much

317
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,440
I'll fulfil your wish

318
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,560
and let you stay.

319
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,800
That's not a good idea.

320
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,000
I've done so much wrong.

321
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,960
—I can't forgive...      —Owning up is good.

322
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,240
You almost died to save me

323
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,880
and I'm not an ungrateful person.

324
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,240
Besides, our household

325
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,040
can afford to support an idler.

326
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,040
Master, it's not what you think.

327
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,680
I just didn't manage to...

328
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,680
push you away.

329
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,920
Your father is the butler here.

330
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
Even I have to show him some face.

331
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,560
If you're truly sorry

332
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,480
you can redeem your wrongs

333
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
in the days to come

334
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,160
by staying here

335
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,440
and living a peaceful life.

336
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,080
Master, you're a figure of authority here

337
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,760
and my father is merely a butler.

338
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Master...

339
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,600
Master?

340
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,240
Master, you can leave

341
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,120
but can you light the candlestick?

342
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,240
I can't see anything.

343
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,840
Master, I'm not kidding you.

344
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,800
I really can't see anything.

345
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,960
Master?

346
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
Master?

347
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,680
Zhong Yelan.

348
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,160
You're so ungrateful and inhumane.

349
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
Didn't Qianzhi close the window?

350
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,680
It doesn't matter. I won't freeze.

351
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,720
If I go to close the window

352
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,240
I might get knocked a few more times.

353
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,360
Butler Ji.

354
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,520
This is your business.

355
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,240
You can't leave it to me.

356
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,560
Master told you to do it.

357
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,400
How dare I do it? This is...

358
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,200
I must give it to you anyway though.

359
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Or you should do it yourself.

360
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,440
It's so much trouble going back and forth.

361
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,280
It's okay. I don't mind the trouble.

362
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Hey, Ji!

363
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,640
Why are you so ruthless?

364
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,360
You really let go.

365
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,320
Hey, don't you always like to go

366
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,320
to the Mistress' compound?

367
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,920
This is a great opportunity.

368
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,080
You can have it. How's that?

369
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,080
It's none of my business. I can't take it.

370
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,960
Hey, Ji.

371
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,160
Listen to me.

372
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,440
The maids working for her

373
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,560
look so sullen when they see me.

374
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,400
If I go there again today

375
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,720
I'm afraid they'll chase me out.

376
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,480
As a man of honour

377
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,880
and head of the guards

378
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,880
how can you be so unconfident?

379
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,640
Look at you. You're young...

380
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,240
and handsome.

381
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,600
Those maids would be thrilled

382
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,080
to see you.

383
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
Hey, Ji!

384
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,120
Ji!

385
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,120
Why do you want to take it?

386
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,400
Master told me to.

387
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,600
So? We're at Mistress' compound.

388
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,960
She's seriously injured.

389
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,720
Let Master come do this himself.

390
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,240
Miss Qianzhi.

391
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,840
If he were to do that

392
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,480
it'd be really awkward.

393
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,040
Why?

394
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,440
There's no good reason in this world

395
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,960
why a husband would treat his wife so coldly.

396
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Exactly.

397
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
What's the noise so early in the morning?

398
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Qianzhi.

399
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,840
Qianzhi.

400
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,880
Mistress.

401
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,320
What's wrong?

402
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,120
Nanfeng is here and said he's going to...

403
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,280
Speak properly.

404
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,560
He said that he was told to remove

405
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,880
the housekeeping token.

406
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,720
Mistress, you're still injured

407
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,160
but Master doesn't care about your kindness.

408
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Just give it to him.

409
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,760
But you just started to take over housekeeping

410
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,440
and haven't fully grasped it, how can you...

411
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,040
I learnt to do it

412
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,760
not to take over the Zhong household.

413
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,400
Now that I know the process of housekeeping

414
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,600
it doesn't make any difference

415
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,200
whether I keep this token or not.

416
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,600
I don't care for their money anyway.

417
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
But, Mistress, how could Master...

418
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Qianzhi.

419
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,520
Zhong Yelan knows the truth about the temple

420
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,360
and the ploy I set up to marry him.

421
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,320
But you took the arrow for him

422
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,920
which almost killed you.

423
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,800
He can't be so ruthless, can he?

424
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,640
Well, if there's someone

425
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,560
who tricks me into believing his lies

426
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,680
all day long

427
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,720
how would you treat him?

428
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,760
Who has the nerve to trick you, Mistress?

429
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,560
I'll teach him a lesson.

430
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,160
Now, to Zhong Yelan

431
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm such a person.

432
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,400
So, even taking the arrow for him

433
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,160
can't change the facts of

434
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,560
what happened in the past.

435
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,480
This is what I've come to understand now.

436
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,480
Go, give Nanfeng the token.

437
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,200
Yes, Mistress.

438
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,240
Here you go...

439
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
Happy now?

440
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,880
Miss Qianzhi, please hear me out.

441
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,400
Save it. You don't have to explain anything.

442
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,760
Don't come here anymore.

443
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,880
You're such a jinx.

444
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,240
Bad things happen every time I see you.

445
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,800
M-M-Miss Qianzhi...

446
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,040
—Miss Qianzhi...      —Just get out of here.

447
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,480
—Miss Qianzhi.         —Didn't you hear her?

448
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,600
She doesn't want to see you.

449
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
—Leave us alone.            —Miss Qianzhi...

450
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,440
Jinx! You always bring bad luck!

451
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,800
—Get lost!                       —Qianzhi...

452
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
Go on!

453
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
Get lost!

454
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,000
How did it come to this?

455
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,360
Mistress spoke of divorce

456
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,360
in front of many servants and maids

457
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,240
at Zhong Residence that day

458
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,840
so now almost everyone knows of it.

459
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,080
Although Qian wasn't very lovable at first

460
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,480
she isn't someone

461
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,360
who throws petty temper tantrums

462
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,920
and Yelan isn't an unreasonable person.

463
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,720
What's wrong with them?

464
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,320
Maybe he realised

465
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,960
he didn't marry the one he wanted

466
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,320
and she felt she married the wrong guy

467
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,480
so the two of them had a rift.

468
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,720
They're already married.

469
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,720
How can they take that lightly?

470
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,120
Send someone there

471
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,480
to invite Hua Qian over tomorrow.

472
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,080
I want to ask her

473
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,400
what's going on between them.

474
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,200
Yes, Your Highness.

475
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,880
Wait.

476
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,000
These few days

477
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,840
she's probably still recovering.

478
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,800
Wait another five days

479
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,120
and then send someone to invite her.

480
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Noted.

481
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,160
Qianzhi?

482
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,800
Yinxing?

483
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,080
Cuizhu?

484
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,400
Housemaid Li?

485
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,560
Where's everyone?

486
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,720
Greetings, Mistress.

487
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,160
Why are you the only guard around?

488
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,400
The household is short-handed

489
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,440
so I'm the only one left to guard this place.

490
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,800
What about my staff?

491
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,880
The maids went to collect

492
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,400
some daily necessities.

493
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,320
Did all of them go? What about the rest?

494
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,000
The household is short of staff

495
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,160
so in these days...

496
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,720
some of your staff

497
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,120
have been dispatched to other places to help.

498
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,160
There used to be no shortage of staff.

499
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,120
But, right after I fell out with Zhong Yelan

500
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
the shortage begins.

501
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,720
Oh, well.

502
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,840
That just means I don't need to

503
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,320
remember so many names now.

504
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,680
Since everyone else has left

505
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,000
why are you still here?

506
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,600
I was assigned to serve you

507
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
so naturally, you're my priority.

508
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,120
I must tell you this.

509
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,080
Master and I won't get back together

510
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,440
so you have no future here.

511
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,880
Get another job while you're still young.

512
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,600
Mistress, why are you out here?

513
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,720
I didn't see anyone in the house

514
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,920
so I came out to look for you.

515
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,320
I went to collect your meal.

516
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,680
You can have your meal now.

517
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,480
Why do you need to collect it?

518
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,240
The cook used to bring it here.

519
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,200
I get it. They're short-handed, right?

520
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,680
The cook was instructed by Master

521
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,640
to reduce expenses for the household

522
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,360
so we only have these dishes.

523
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,600
It's fine. At least we still have two dishes.

524
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,960
When I was in exile...

525
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,600
Where were you?

526
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,160
I went to collect your new outfits.

527
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,560
Butler Ji said that

528
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,480
Master had ordered to cut spending

529
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,960
so you won't get

530
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,480
any more new outfits, Mistress.

531
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,920
It's okay. I have more than enough

532
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,480
to go around.

533
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,720
Mistress.

534
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,200
What did you get?

535
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,640
The stewards in the house are over the line.

536
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
They said Master ordered to cut spending

537
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,360
and sent me away with these cheap incense.

538
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,440
It's fine. I won't use it from now on.

539
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,840
Anyway, I didn't like

540
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,960
the ones they issued anyway.

541
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,160
I'll make some myself some other day.

542
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,120
Tell me. Master ordered to cut spending

543
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
and what's being reduced now?

544
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,760
Please take a look.

545
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,440
That's too much!

546
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,640
He even lowered the quality of the walnuts.

547
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,840
They're good for my brain.

548
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,520
How'd he make it up to me if I become stupid?

549
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,280
Mistress...

550
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,720
Mistress...

551
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
The walnuts look smaller but they're edible.

552
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,040
—Yes, Mistress.                         —No!

553
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,600
Calm down...

554
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,760
Mistress.

555
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,480
You can't fight with Master anymore.

556
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,240
After all, you're still living in his house.

557
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Take a seat.

558
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,560
Fine.

559
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,800
He ordered to cut spending, right?

560
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,120
Then I'll go out and buy my own supplies.

561
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,960
It's not like I have no money.

562
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
But, Mistress

563
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,000
you can't show yourself in public.

564
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
That's right.

565
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,040
But you can.

566
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Well...

567
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
every reputable shop in Huangcheng

568
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,320
knows who your maids are.

569
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,680
It's not a good idea for them

570
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,480
to go out and buy stuff every day.

571
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,600
<i>Bonus footage</i>

572
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,040
My senior.

573
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,600
Lord, why didn't you tell me you're visiting?

574
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,240
Mother's worried about Hua Qian's injury

575
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,800
so she had me bring the physician over to her.

576
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,880
Senior.

577
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,800
I heard from Sister-in-law's maids

578
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,560
that in the past few days

579
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,440
you haven't shown her any concern

580
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,320
despite her serious injury.

581
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,720
This is my family's business

582
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,560
so you don't have to worry about it.

583
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,480
Well...

584
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,120
great.
