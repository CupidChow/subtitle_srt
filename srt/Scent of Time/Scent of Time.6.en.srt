1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,720
<i>Episode 6</i>

3
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Senior, you have so many talents here.

4
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Even a mere maid can play such beautiful music.

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,240
Amazing.

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,240
I think even established musicians

7
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,800
can't match up to her.

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,440
It's just mediocre to me.

9
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,240
Since you think so

10
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,720
why don't you give her to me?

11
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,200
My mother loves music

12
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,000
so perhaps she can relieve her boredom.

13
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Sister-in-law?

14
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,080
Sister-in-law?

15
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,800
What's up?

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
Mistress, Lord Zhong is calling you.

17
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,960
What are you giggling about?

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please pardon me, Lord.

19
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,920
Mu Yao's music was so beautiful.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,160
I was engrossed

21
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,840
so I didn't hear your question.

22
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,960
I said there are many talents in this household.

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Even a mere maid

24
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,480
can play such beautiful music.

25
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,120
I've long heard that

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
you're one of the best in the city too.

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
I wonder who's better.

28
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,560
What?

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,760
Having studied under a famous master

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,360
Hua Qian's skills are exceptional.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Really?

32
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,400
I wonder if I could have the honour of

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,640
hearing you play today?

34
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,440
Mu Yao's music really put me to shame.

35
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
My senior just said you play well.

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,520
You shouldn't belittle yourself.

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,080
I'll play for you another day.

38
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,440
Today is Master's birthday.

39
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,360
I'd better not steal the show.

40
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,520
Put the <i>guqin</i> away.

41
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,920
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,880
Since you value his birthday so much

43
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,760
you must have prepared

44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,640
some kind of remarkable gift, right?

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,560
I didn't...

46
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,600
No wonder he was in such a hurry

47
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,400
to return home.

48
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,840
Now that you won't even showcase

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
your beautiful music

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,120
this birthday gift must be extraordinary.

51
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,240
Lord, Master. Please wait for a while.

52
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,360
I'll be back in a moment.

53
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,440
Qianzhi.

54
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,360
I was just wondering why

55
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,680
you let Mu Yao play the <i>guqin.</i>

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
Turned out that you prepared something else.

57
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,200
I prepared nothing.

58
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,840
I'd thought they wouldn't talk about me

59
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
after hearing Mu Yao's music.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,520
Let me see what I can do now.

61
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,200
Mistress is back.

62
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,720
Longevity noodles is a must for birthdays.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,760
I noticed you ate very little

64
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,480
so I cooked this as a gift for you.

65
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,960
I hope you'll enjoy it

66
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
and can see the thought behind the gift.

67
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Thank you.

68
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
But I heard that

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,680
the Hua family pampers their daughter

70
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,480
frees her from household chores.

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,040
Sister-in-law, when did you learn how to cook?

72
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,560
I learned it secretly

73
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,760
to give Master a surprise.

74
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
<i>I never thought that</i>

75
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,760
<i>the skills I learnt during my year of exile</i>

76
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,920
<i>would help me so many times.</i>

77
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,760
<i>But how come Mu Yao's music did not cause</i>

78
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,560
<i>a rift between Zhong Yelan and Zhong Xiwu?</i>

79
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,480
<i>Could she not show her excellence</i>

80
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,560
<i>without a comparison to me?</i>

81
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,240
<i>Why is he still here...</i>

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,200
I rarely visit

83
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,400
so I'd like to stay a little longer.

84
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,240
I hope that's not a bother.

85
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,720
Absolutely not.

86
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,920
Lately, some shops reported that

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,880
many have tried to uncover

88
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
the production method of Jiayin Pill.

89
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,120
I don't know who they are

90
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,040
but they make me feel a bit uneasy.

91
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,840
Every year

92
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,080
you and I make the Jiayin Pill personally.

93
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,240
No outsider has ever watched us.

94
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,240
This is a well-kept family recipe

95
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,480
so their curiosity is normal.

96
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,400
Lord, you don't need to worry too much.

97
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,360
Even the Ge family, who's great at imitation

98
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,280
has failed to replicate it.

99
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,400
It doesn't hurt if people pry

100
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,120
but even the shops in the north and south

101
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
have experienced this

102
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,440
so I'm sure it's no ordinary person.

103
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
By the way

104
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,040
you used to be stationed in the south.

105
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,640
Do you still have the map of the southern city?

106
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,200
Take it out and study the situation of

107
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,480
the shops in the south, shall we?

108
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,880
Sure. The map is in the study.

109
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,160
Let me bring it over.

110
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,320
Sister-in-law, what are you thinking?

111
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,960
You're absorbed in your thoughts.

112
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
Where is the master?

113
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,720
We just talked about the shops in the south.

114
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,360
He went to the study to get the map

115
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
and will be back shortly.

116
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,480
I guess our chat was so boring

117
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,000
that your mind wandered off.

118
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm not clever enough

119
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,560
to understand all this work chat.

120
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,400
Lord, please forgive me.

121
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,160
When Butler Hua pleaded for the Mu family

122
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,640
he spoke much about the shops in the north.

123
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,200
As his daughter, I assumed

124
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,600
you'd be interested in those from the south.

125
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,280
Lord, I guess you're wrong.

126
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,400
Does being here in your own home

127
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,920
give you the courage to speak like that?

128
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,840
Lord, I don't understand.

129
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,120
Are you really Hua Qian?

130
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,600
Put away your petty thoughts.

131
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,560
Don't think you can do as you wish

132
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,640
during the lord's stay here.

133
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,040
If he knows who you are

134
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,000
you'll only end up

135
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,760
being expelled from the city.

136
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
You're overthinking.

137
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,200
What can I do now?

138
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,280
You don't even believe me.

139
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
How can I expect the Lord

140
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,760
whom I've only met once, to believe me?

141
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,400
Hua Qian is definitely not as you say.

142
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,720
It is you who's blinded by hatred

143
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,560
and cannot see the truth.

144
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Yes.

145
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,960
Hua Qian is delicate

146
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,240
and innocent.

147
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,320
She did not set me up

148
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,360
nor did she frame my father for embezzlement

149
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,400
causing him to be exiled.

150
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,520
But, Zhong Yelan

151
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,480
do you think I'm the kind of person

152
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,240
who barks up the wrong tree freely?

153
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,480
How many times have I told you that

154
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
I don't want to hear these words again?

155
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,680
I've never volunteered them.

156
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,360
But you doubted her in your heart

157
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,120
so you questioned me again and again.

158
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,480
<i>Given that you don't believe me</i>

159
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
<i>and you know you'd hurt her</i>

160
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,720
<i>then why did you risk helping me</i>

161
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,960
<i>by leaving on your wedding night</i>

162
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
<i>and letting Hua Qian visit home alone?</i>

163
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,880
Zhong Yelan

164
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,040
between us

165
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,360
who's the one that's confused?

166
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,960
Of course, I'm her.

167
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,600
The Hua Qian I know

168
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,760
won't tolerate

169
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,400
any other woman around my senior.

170
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,520
But...

171
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,440
you just praised another woman before him.

172
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,080
I seem to have told you before that

173
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,560
a married woman acts differently.

174
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,400
Tell me more about it.

175
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,080
As a daughter

176
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,880
my parents did a lot for me

177
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,720
so I could focus on one person

178
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,200
without any worry.

179
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,320
I view Master as the only one in my life

180
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,600
so, by hook or by crook

181
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,280
I also want to be

182
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,080
the only one in his eye.

183
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,720
Having got married, I found that

184
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,320
I have a lot more responsibilities now

185
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,440
and must consider the good of the whole.

186
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,960
So, while I still love the master

187
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,840
I don't want to have him

188
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,120
all to myself like before.

189
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,080
My love for him is so great that

190
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,360
it made me understand

191
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,080
that I'd do anything to make him happy.

192
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,080
This confession turns me green with envy.

193
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Are you moved, Senior?

194
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,280
—You...    —I'm ashamed of what I just said.

195
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,760
Qianzhi.

196
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,880
Mistress.

197
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,640
Watch out. Be careful.

198
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,200
Qianzhi, close the door quickly!

199
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
All right.

200
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,960
No one can match you in terms of charm.

201
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,280
Thank you.

202
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,360
—Mistress, wait up.  —You're up early today.

203
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,520
Where are you heading to?

204
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
I've been married for such a long time.

205
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,200
I'd like to visit my parents.

206
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,960
Why the sudden urge to do so?

207
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,760
Did you inform them already?

208
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,120
I'm leaving out of embarrassment.

209
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,640
Mistress, wait!

210
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,200
What's wrong with her?

211
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,320
Ask someone else.

212
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,760
I have to catch up with her.

213
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,160
Mistress, wait!

214
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,120
Mistress, wait!

215
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,920
Mistress!

216
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,920
Master.

217
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,600
I just saw Mistress

218
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,040
leaving for her home with her bags packed.

219
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,280
Won't you go after her?

220
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
No.

221
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,640
Understood.

222
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,600
Lord

223
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,760
the maid is indeed Mu Yunping's daughter.

224
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,240
He has left the city

225
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,200
leaving her alone in Zhong Residence.

226
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,160
Did my senior know who she is?

227
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,520
The spy reported that before getting married

228
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
he knew the first daughter of the Mu family

229
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,120
so he should know her identity.

230
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,080
I know him well.

231
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,640
He always cold-shoulders

232
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,480
those unmarried girls.

233
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,560
Since they're old friends

234
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,600
their relationship should be different.

235
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,240
But he didn't intervene in her family's case.

236
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,880
He only took in their eldest daughter.

237
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,520
The Ge family won't be involved with him.

238
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,120
After all, they hated him the most

239
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,000
and he set up our family business

240
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,760
in the south all by himself.

241
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,400
Since he readily delegated power

242
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,040
to the Meng family

243
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,480
he must not be power hungry.

244
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,360
His unusual behaviour now

245
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,080
seems born out of...

246
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,680
love.

247
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,080
Did Hua Qian know the identity of Mu Yao?

248
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,160
Before she was married

249
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,560
they were close friends.

250
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,400
Then, she's really...

251
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,320
tolerant.

252
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Lord

253
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,520
should we send more people

254
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
to keep an eye on their household?

255
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,200
Something seems off.

256
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,240
She resorted to drugs to get married.

257
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,840
Why did she become so tolerant after marriage?

258
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,200
What you report today should be kept secret

259
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,440
and there's no need to

260
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,680
keep an eye on their household.

261
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,720
The Mu family case has been settled.

262
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,160
If there's more to be uncovered

263
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,240
the mastermind will make a move again.

264
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,400
I see, Lord.

265
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,280
Qian.

266
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,160
Father. Mother.

267
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,600
Qian, why did you come back alone?

268
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,960
I haven't been back for a long time

269
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,440
and I missed our parents

270
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,040
so I decided on a whim

271
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,320
to visit for a few days.

272
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Great!

273
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,880
Now I finally have someone to talk to.

274
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,120
Qian...

275
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,080
Qian

276
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,520
did you fall out with your husband?

277
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,160
No.

278
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm just missing you.

279
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Nonsense.

280
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,680
You've been married for a while.

281
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Why are you still so childish?

282
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,480
My dear...

283
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,240
Qian, you're now Master Zhong's wife.

284
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,760
Remember what we told you

285
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,160
when you got married?

286
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,640
Being a wife

287
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,680
is not the same as being a daughter.

288
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
You can't just run back to your home

289
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,720
whenever you lose your temper.

290
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,600
I didn't fall out with Master Zhong.

291
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,240
I just wanted to visit for a few days.

292
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,480
—Well...                             —You...

293
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,520
You just got married for two months

294
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,760
and you came back.

295
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,480
What would others think of you

296
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,400
Master Zhong and our family?

297
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,000
Listen, I'll take you home

298
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,240
immediately after dinner.

299
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,640
If you have any grievances

300
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,560
air them before me and him

301
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,320
so that I can do you justice.

302
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,400
There's no need for that, Father.

303
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,680
I'm really fine.

304
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
It's just...

305
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,840
It's just a whim.

306
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Fine.

307
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,480
If he didn't do you wrong

308
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,600
you mustn't make any trouble for him.

309
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,560
Don't forget that it was you

310
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,920
who were dying to marry him.

311
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,960
Just skip dinner and go back now.

312
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,000
Qian, you need to curb your temper.

313
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,760
Have you forgotten what I told you?

314
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,040
You might be married to Master Zhong

315
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,720
but he can get a concubine at any time.

316
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,560
You came back right after your wedding.

317
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,440
What would others think of you?

318
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,240
The other maidens and girls may gossip

319
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,960
which will cause him to lose face

320
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,600
and you, as well.

321
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,320
All I did was to visit my home.

322
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Why do you make it out to be so serious?

323
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,560
Do you really care about me?

324
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
You...

325
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,920
I'd been praising you for your maturity

326
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,560
but why are you acting childish now?

327
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,960
Master Zhong is an influential figure.

328
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,760
You should put him first, right?

329
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,320
It's not that we don't like having you back.

330
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,560
But you just got married.

331
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,320
People might gossip about this.

332
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,560
Be a good girl.

333
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,240
Think carefully about what I said.

334
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Don't be stubborn.

335
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,200
I'll talk to your father

336
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
so that he won't send for the master.

337
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,920
It's better for you

338
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
to settle your own affairs.

339
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,960
Talk some sense into your sister.

340
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,160
All right...

341
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,400
Qian, did you really fall out with...

342
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
No...

343
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,160
How many times must I say that?

344
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,560
Sorry, I'm not in a good mood.

345
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,200
I want to be alone.

346
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,800
Mistress was in a bad mood.

347
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
She did not mean to lose her temper with you.

348
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,640
Sir, have some preserved fruit.

349
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,920
It's good to have a temper

350
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,240
so I'm not afraid that

351
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,880
my sister will be bullied outside.

352
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,400
Mistress, what's up?

353
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,600
Are you still upset

354
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,240
by Butler Hua's reprimanding?

355
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,320
He meant well.

356
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,720
Why do my parents worry so much about

357
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,200
my relationship with Master?

358
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,720
Master Zhong is a sought-after man

359
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,800
of many girls in the city.

360
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,440
It's natural for them to think highly of him.

361
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,680
So, if I tell them now that

362
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,560
I won't choose Zhong Yelan this time

363
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,880
they won't support me, right?

364
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,720
What do you mean, not choosing?

365
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,200
Nothing.

366
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,760
I didn't pin too much hope on my family

367
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,680
but what happened today confirms

368
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,400
that no matter in life past or present

369
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,440
I'm always fighting alone.

370
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,800
Why do you mean, past and present life?

371
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,280
Besides, you're not alone.

372
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,800
Butler Hua and Mrs Hua are still alive.

373
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,720
Master Zhong cherishes you, too.

374
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,920
You're the most fulfilled person in the world.

375
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,480
You don't know.

376
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,040
All the unmarried girls

377
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,040
are very envious of you.

378
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,280
Envy me?

379
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
Yeah. Didn't you notice that

380
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,480
those girls turned green with envy

381
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,360
whenever they saw you at banquets?

382
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,200
Mistress, what I said is true.

383
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,720
"A married daughter is someone else' family".

384
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,240
I'd thought things would be better

385
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,720
since I'm given another chance.

386
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,960
But I guess that

387
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,400
I was wrong.

388
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,720
I shouldn't seek refuge at home

389
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,360
when something happens

390
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,760
given that

391
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,720
they don't understand me at all.

392
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,520
Why am I telling you all this?

393
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Anyway, you won't understand.

394
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,400
Sorry, Mistress.

395
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,520
I'm stupid so I don't understand it.

396
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,240
It's not you.

397
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,840
No one can understand.

398
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
I was too careless.

399
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,400
Just because in my past life...

400
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,200
Last time she didn't find out anything

401
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,080
before the ancestral worship

402
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
so I thought I could also be worry-free.

403
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Today's incident is a good reminder to me.

404
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,280
Some things aren't as easy as I thought.

405
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,520
I had better rely on myself.

406
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
Stop.

407
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,720
Servants will do the chores in the study.

408
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,280
You don't need to do these.

409
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,480
I can't stay here doing nothing.

410
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,360
So far, what have you found out?

411
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,800
I told you

412
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,000
Hua Qian had nothing to do with it.

413
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,000
Is it me you don't believe, or yourself?

414
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,960
Otherwise, why would you repeat this?

415
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,760
Nanfeng.

416
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,520
—Master.       —Beef up the patrolling team.

417
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,040
Tell them to be extra vigilant.

418
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,160
Master, what happened?

419
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,160
We might have unwanted company.

420
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,480
Perhaps the Ge family has made another move.

421
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,880
The Ge family?

422
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,040
That family was reported by you

423
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,600
and seized for fake incense.

424
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
After so many years

425
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,000
why would they come back?

426
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm afraid some of them may have escaped.

427
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,240
We should be careful.

428
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
All right.

429
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,800
Mistress, why are you up so early?

430
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,360
I couldn't sleep so I decided to get up.

431
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,480
By the way, bring me my ledgers

432
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,520
and those of Zhong Residence.

433
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,120
Call Butler Ji and Housemaid Li over.

434
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,360
I guess I'll need to talk to them

435
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,680
when I go over the ledgers later.

436
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,800
Mistress, are you learning how to run things?

437
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,200
The more skills I pick up

438
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,200
the more I can use in the future.

439
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,720
It says here...

440
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,560
Mistress, I'm not familiar

441
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,080
with your dowry inventory.

442
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,000
The master said that

443
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,640
it should be excluded from the main accounts.

444
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,760
So it's under your own charge.

445
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,360
If you need an assistant

446
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,160
I can recommend one to you.

447
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,120
The master is deliberately

448
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,640
staying out of your dowry inventory.

449
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,120
That means if we get divorced

450
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,160
I can take everything with...

451
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,680
Thanks for your time, Butler Ji.

452
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,720
I'll tell Mistress more about these ledgers.

453
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,200
Go about your own business.

454
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:03,920
All right. Mistress, I'm off.

455
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,720
Mistress, what was that about?

456
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,560
The good thing is

457
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,320
you're finally

458
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
taking over household matters.

459
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,120
In that case

460
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,600
Butler Hua and Mrs Hua can rest assured.

461
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,760
I'm not interested in housekeeping.

462
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,240
I learn this because I don't want to

463
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,800
rely on others in the future.

464
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Mistress, take a look at this first.

465
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,760
Master.

466
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,800
Do you want to go over to the mistress'?

467
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,120
Why do you want me to go to her so much?

468
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,320
I heard that

469
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,000
she's been learning to take over

470
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,160
housekeeping matters.

471
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,120
Don't you want to show your concern?

472
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,160
I don't want to hear these nosy words

473
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,720
from you again.

474
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,720
I should be damned.

475
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,880
Who's there?

476
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,880
It's me.

477
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,000
Who are you?

478
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,960
What, don't you remember my voice?

479
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,840
Catch him! Over there!

480
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,880
—Hurry up!                —Search carefully!

481
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,360
—Hurry!                           —Linglong?

482
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,280
Linglong?

483
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,360
Ling Long?

484
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,120
If you want to live, you'd better be quiet.

485
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,080
What's your purpose

486
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,040
in coming here at this time?

487
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,240
I just need to hide for a moment.

488
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,760
You stay put.

489
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,080
When no one's outside, I'll leave.

490
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,440
Miss, did you just call me?

491
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,280
Unless you want one more hostage

492
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,360
tell her to go.

493
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
Miss?

494
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,160
What's wrong with you?

495
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,280
Nothing.

496
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,800
It was too noisy outside just now

497
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,760
so I wanted you to tell them to be quiet.

498
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,360
The soldiers outside said that

499
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,720
they were chasing the thief

500
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,000
so it was noisy.

501
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,680
I'll go and tell them.

502
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,840
Are you injured?

503
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,040
In the third compartment of the bookshelf

504
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
there's Jindao powder that could help.

505
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,800
You can use it.

506
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,160
You're not afraid of me?

507
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,880
Since you aren't coming for my family

508
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,120
please help yourself.

509
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,960
You're a girl.

510
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,080
Are you really so sure about me?

511
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,560
Please be careful when you leave later.

512
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,560
Don't be discovered by others

513
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,280
and cause trouble for my family.

514
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,360
The Mu family.

515
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,200
What a coincidence.

516
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,320
What?

517
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,480
You were chased and hid here again?

518
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,360
It seems that I'm really memorable

519
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,760
so that you still remember me now.

520
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,200
This is not my place.

521
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,600
If you hide here, don't get me into trouble.

522
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,040
Since this place doesn't belong to you

523
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,960
do you want to leave with me?

524
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,560
Do we know each other well?

525
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,240
I once had a parrot

526
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,720
you and it are very similar.

527
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Are you crazy?

528
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Leave with me.

529
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,200
I'll help you with your father's case.

530
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,760
You know about that?

531
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,000
Some time ago, it went viral in our city.

532
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
Everyone has heard of it.

533
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,040
Who on earth are you?

534
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,760
You want to know?

535
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,400
Come with me and I'll tell you.

536
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,240
I've observed that

537
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,480
nobody in this household trusts you.

538
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,080
If you stay here, it won't help you

539
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,760
and you'll find nothing.

540
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,960
If you go with me

541
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,040
I'll help you revoke the case.

542
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,720
Why do you want to help me?

543
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,400
To thank you for you saving my life before.

544
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
How's that?

545
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,440
Why should I trust you?

546
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,960
Because I'm the only one that trusts you.

547
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,040
How dare you break in here!

548
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,560
Fine. I'll make them pay for this.

549
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,280
I've alerted them to my presence.

550
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Half a month later

551
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,880
I'll come pick you up openly.

552
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Mu Yao!

553
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,720
—Mu Yao!                  —Search the place.

554
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Yes, sir.

555
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,240
Keep a close watch in case the thief returns.

556
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Understood.

557
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,400
Where is he?

558
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,040
Over there! Hurry!

559
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,760
Cuizhu.

560
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,720
See what's going on outside.

561
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Yes, Mistress.

562
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,560
<i>Ancestral worship</i>

563
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,840
Mistress, the master is here.

564
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,480
Master.

565
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
It's still cold out. Don't catch a chill.

566
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,200
Are you doing okay?

567
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,080
I just heard a lot of noise outside.

568
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,720
What's going on?

569
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,480
A thief broke into our compounds.

570
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,000
Mu Yao found him

571
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,320
and was knocked out.

572
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,040
What's wrong?

573
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,400
How can someone be so brash?

574
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,240
I noticed that

575
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,800
your quarters is short-staffed.

576
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,160
Many things have happened lately.

577
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,720
I'll get Ji Dong

578
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,200
to send you more guards.

579
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
That's not necessary.

580
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,440
All right. I'll speak to him tomorrow.

581
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,480
Don't worry about the ancestral worship

582
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,040
happening in two weeks.

583
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,560
I'll handle everything.

584
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,040
You've always been weak.

585
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,480
If you're tired

586
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,280
just let me know.

587
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,560
Thank you for your concern.

588
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,240
You must be tired.

589
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,960
Go back and rest early.

590
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,080
Do you regret marrying me?

591
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,800
What do you mean?

592
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,320
I was drunk

593
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,400
and accidentally ruined your reputation.

594
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,560
I thought you were unwilling to marry me

595
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,880
but on my birthday...

596
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,920
So, while I still love Master

597
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,720
I don't want to keep him

598
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,040
all to myself like before.

599
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,880
I love him deeply.

600
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,320
And I have come to realise

601
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,560
that I'd do anything to make him happy.

602
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Hua Qian.

603
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,320
I've let you down.

604
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,560
Those words I said on your birthday

605
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,880
were passing remarks.

606
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,680
You don't need to take them seriously.

607
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
No.

608
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,600
I know it must have bothered you

609
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,360
so you got it off your chest that day.

610
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,880
I've avoided you lately

611
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,280
to do some thinking alone.

612
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,200
Since this was my mistake

613
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,560
I must take responsibility for it.

614
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
Qian.

615
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,160
I'll never fail you.

616
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,360
<i>How can I tell you</i>

617
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,160
<i>it wasn't your fault at all?</i>

618
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,760
Master?

619
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,720
I appreciate your thoughts

620
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,800
but these days

621
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,280
I'm busy learning about the ledgers

622
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,400
and preparing for the ancestral worship.

623
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,920
I'm all burnt out.

624
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,760
If you really want to talk to me

625
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,560
let's do it after the ceremony.

626
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,880
Why not now?

627
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,040
It's too complicated to explain.

628
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,400
I've been too busy to speak my mind.

629
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,280
Master, please forgive me.

630
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,640
Fine.

631
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
I'll do as you say.

632
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,760
All right. Find Butler Ji tomorrow

633
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,280
and get the person you want.

634
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,800
Yes, Mistress.

635
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,920
What are you doing? That was rude.

636
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,120
My apologies, Qianzhi. Sorry.

637
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,560
Mistress.

638
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,560
What's wrong with her?

639
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,080
She's a girl in love. It's normal.

640
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,240
That's indulgent.

641
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,560
It's so scary to hear

642
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,000
that someone had the nerve

643
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,400
to break into Zhong Residence.

644
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,480
I know who did it.

645
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,640
Mistress, you stayed in all day.

646
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,920
How would you know that?

647
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,720
Do you believe that the intruder

648
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,040
will seek me out a few months later?

649
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,520
Mistress, please go to bed early.

650
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,320
I'll finally meet you.

651
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,240
Mu Yao's admirer number three.

652
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,600
You must not let me down.

653
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,120
<i>Bonus footage</i>

654
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,360
Greetings to you, Master.

655
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,000
How's the investigation going?

656
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,640
The person you want

657
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,480
is now in Zhong Residence.

658
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,520
Zhong Residence?

659
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,480
Isn't it owned by Zhong Yelan

660
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,880
the one who once established

661
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,720
Zhong's family business in the south?

662
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,800
Exactly.

663
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,880
In that case

664
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
I'm all the more eager to see him.

665
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Master.

666
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,000
The Mu family case has been kept secret.

667
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,640
Not many would know about it.

668
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,040
You needn't worry.

669
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,440
Three months later

670
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,440
you'll attend the incense banquet.

671
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,920
Between now and then

672
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,920
you should avoid going into the city

673
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,360
lest it cause you trouble as before.

674
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,440
You're teaching me how to do things?

675
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I dare not.

676
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,720
Before the banquet

677
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,520
I'll send a big gift to the Zhong family.

678
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,440
Should we tell the Senior Lord?

679
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,360
No need to inform my father.

680
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,920
When everything's done

681
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,880
I'm sure it will please him.
