<i>Episode 26</i>

3
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,840
All the other butlers knew about the disputes

4
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,000
between Mu Yunping and I.

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,720
Now that I've come clean

6
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,120
please do as you deem fit, Lord.

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,120
No! It's not like that!

8
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
My father has nothing to do with it.

9
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,880
I fell in love with Master

10
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,160
and disliked Mu Yao

11
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,520
so I framed her and her family.

12
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
I was behind it all!

13
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,960
Lord, she's just a girl.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,200
How could she set up such a meticulous trap?

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,720
You couldn't have done it.

16
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,960
I know that I have made a mistake

17
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,040
so you don't have to take the fall for me.

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,240
Father.

19
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,000
You knew I was going to...

20
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,480
Of course, I knew.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,640
You're my daughter.

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,160
After you returned to Hua Residence

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,800
I knew in depth

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,000
what you did and who you investigated.

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,800
We have to pay the price for our wrongdoings.

26
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,520
Qian.

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,440
I know you had been through a lot.

28
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't worry. Don't be afraid.

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,800
You have me now.

30
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,920
Don't be afraid. I'm all right.

31
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,440
I'll protect you.

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,960
You're here with me.

33
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,040
Let me take you home.

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,600
No! My father has nothing to do with it.

35
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,960
It was all my fault.

36
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,400
It was all because of my selfishness.

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,720
There was no dispute.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,040
I did it. I was the cause.

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,760
There was no dispute.

40
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,800
—I was the mastermind...               —Men.

41
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,240
—Take Hua Wen'ang away.    —Father!

42
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,560
You have nothing to do with it.

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,120
—I did it.                            —Qian.

44
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,640
Consider carefully what to say

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,000
and what not to say.

46
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm solely responsible.

47
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Qian, as long as you're safe

48
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,280
our family will be safe too.

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,120
Father... it's not like that!

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,200
—Remember what I said.                  —No!

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Consider carefully what to say

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,560
—and what not to say.               —Father!

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,840
It's not like that!

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,240
Father.

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,600
—Father.                              —Lord!

56
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,640
—Father!             —I'm solely responsible!

57
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,800
All right.

58
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
This has carried on for too long.

59
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
Let's end it here.

60
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,320
Lord, what my father said just now

61
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,720
was out of love for his child.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What I did today

63
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
is against the principles of ethics...

64
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,200
You did the right thing.

65
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
You stopped him from making more mistakes.

66
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,680
That's not a violation of ethics.

67
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,080
Lord, I can't accept your kindness

68
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,800
with peace of mind.

69
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,080
My father is really wronged.

70
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
I have implicated my father

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,560
because of my relationship with a man.

72
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,600
I deserve death.

73
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
Parents are not obligated to pay

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,000
for their children's mistakes.

75
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
Please look into it, Lord.

76
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,960
Butler Hua has already pleaded guilty.

77
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,080
No. My father has nothing to do with it.

78
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,680
Xiwu.

79
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,600
Are you doing this to spite me?

80
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,000
What happened today

81
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,640
calls for an investigation.

82
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,640
Those who are not involved, you may leave.

83
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,760
—Let's go.                        —Let's go.

84
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,240
If you approach them now

85
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,480
I'm afraid you will add fuel to the fire.

86
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,480
Can't you tell what's going on now?

87
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,280
—Xiwu...             —I know what I'm doing.

88
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,280
Stop kneeling. Your knees may get hurt.

89
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,360
Have you lost your mind?

90
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,720
— How could you...             —Yes, I have.

91
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,200
You caused me to lose my mind.

92
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,640
I told you I would protect Butler Hua

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,680
and your entire family.

94
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,640
Why did you insist on taking the fall?

95
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,960
I was just telling the truth.

96
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,120
Are you saying what Butler Hua said just now

97
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,040
was nothing but lies?

98
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,280
I went to great lengths to pave the way

99
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,880
to absolve you from your family's repercussions.

100
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
Do you know how much effort I have put in?

101
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,280
Absolve me from my family's repercussions?

102
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,120
Your effort, Lord?

103
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,720
Are you referring to the fact that

104
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,600
you made use of evidence I gathered

105
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
and made me blow the whistle on my father?

106
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,640
You thought if someone else blew the whistle

107
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,400
the other butlers might intercede for him

108
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,960
so you made me...

109
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,760
his biological daughter, do it

110
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,640
so no one could refute it, right?

111
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,040
Is it how you view me?

112
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,960
Why didn't you say otherwise?

113
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,080
Am I that corrigible to you?

114
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,680
You're Lord of the Zhong family.

115
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,240
It's not my place to criticise you.

116
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,600
You're still telling me these words

117
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,280
that no one will believe!

118
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I went against the majority

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and tried to prove your innocence.

120
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
I made meticulous plans

121
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,920
so that you could be by my side.

122
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,400
But you won't even take one step forward.

123
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,240
Have you ever asked me if that's what I wanted?

124
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,400
Why wouldn't you want that?

125
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,760
I tend

126
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,920
to be timid and wary of getting into trouble.

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,800
Zhong's Garden is a huge place

128
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,520
where there are too many people

129
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,960
and things get too complicated.

130
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,000
I just want to wander in the wild

131
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,960
and not be confined in a small compound.

132
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,480
Besides

133
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,160
if I were to oppose the Zhong family

134
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,160
would you still go against the majority

135
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,480
and protect me?

136
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,320
Have you ever asked me about this?

137
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
How do you know I won't choose you?

138
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,240
Do I have to ask?

139
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,840
Given your position, it's destined that

140
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
your every action has an impact

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,360
on numerous individuals and situations.

142
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,040
So, why should I hold out hope?

143
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,280
No matter how deep a relationship is

144
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,160
it will fade over time.

145
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,640
When that happens, what should I do?

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,400
In a word, you're afraid.

147
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,400
You're afraid of challenges and difficulties.

148
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,720
But you're not afraid of me.

149
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,400
My place in your heart is insignificant.

150
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,440
You tend to prioritise other people above me.

151
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,400
I didn't do that.

152
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,280
You did, Lord.

153
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,040
You chose to protect Meng Yifei.

154
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,880
I had given you many chances to tell me

155
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,440
but you chose to remain silent.

156
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,000
What you did may be right.

157
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,960
I know you must have a reason to do so.

158
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
But, Zhong Xiwu

159
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,400
it was...

160
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,000
my brother who died.

161
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,200
My brother who loved me

162
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
doted on me, cherished me

163
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,520
and protected me without asking for

164
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,840
anything in return.

165
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,080
He died because of me.

166
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,040
How could you hide it from me

167
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,800
before even asking me about my opinion?

168
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,360
If I told you...

169
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,680
you would go all out to seek revenge.

170
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,800
I told you I would help you with this

171
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,960
but you just didn't believe me.

172
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,480
How could I believe you?

173
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,360
How do I trust

174
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,320
that you will always choose me in the future?

175
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,840
You have a large household

176
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,200
and a lot to consider.

177
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,840
Right now, I may mean a lot to you

178
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,080
but as Lord of the Zhong family

179
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,600
you have many people to look after.

180
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Too many.

181
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Fine.

182
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,480
Fine.

183
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
Fine.

184
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,840
You don't believe me.

185
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,920
You have never believed me.

186
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,760
I once said everything I did

187
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,600
I did it to keep you safe.

188
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,320
It doesn't matter if you don't believe me.

189
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Hua Qian.

190
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
And I also said

191
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,960
I wouldn't let you go so easily.

192
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,840
Why is it so hard...

193
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,640
to live a simple life?

194
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,960
Hua Qian blew the whistle on her father

195
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,400
and Meng Yifei is disfigured?

196
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,560
How interesting.

197
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,320
I can't just stay here.

198
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm going to join in the fun.

199
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,520
Miss, Zhong's Garden is in a mess now.

200
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,040
Please don't cause any more trouble.

201
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
I'm not going to cause trouble.

202
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,720
I'm simply joining in the fun.

203
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,160
Seeing that they are miserable

204
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,720
I feel good.

205
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,400
Miss...

206
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,440
I beg you. Please stop.

207
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,320
Stop? What did I do?

208
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,560
My father told me to live in Zhong's Garden.

209
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,120
I did as I was told. I was obedient, wasn't I?

210
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,680
What, are you going to rat me out?

211
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,800
That's right.

212
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,800
My father sent you here to watch over me.

213
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,120
Fine. Go on and say whatever you want.

214
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,440
Jin Lin is not engaged!

215
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,080
I deserve to die.

216
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,400
I deserve to die.

217
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
I deserve to die.

218
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,800
I saw that you couldn't forget Jin Lin

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,080
so I sent a letter to Master.

220
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Master ordered Jin Lin

221
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
to deliver the goods to you.

222
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,320
His motive was to make you give up hope.

223
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,200
Master forced Jin Lin to end things with you

224
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,560
by threatening to harm his family.

225
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Miss.

226
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,200
Miss.

227
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,760
I thought that you would be devoted to Lord

228
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,040
if you forgot Jin Lin.

229
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,840
It was my fault.

230
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,720
I beg you to punish me, Miss!

231
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,400
Is it true that Jin Lin is not engaged?

232
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
Yes, it's true.

233
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,880
I knew it.

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,120
Zhuqing has not forgotten me.

235
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,480
Miss, I won't lie to you anymore.

236
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
Please take good care of yourself, Miss.

237
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
I will.

238
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,640
Miss, the physician said that

239
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,960
if you took good care of the wound

240
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,160
it wouldn't... leave a scar.

241
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,520
It won't leave a scar?

242
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,640
It's such a big wound!

243
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,520
How is it possible that it won't leave a scar?

244
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,960
How about I cut your face?

245
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
No... Miss...

246
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,600
I shouldn't have said that.

247
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,240
Please forgive me.

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,360
Where is Hua Qian? Where is that slut now?

249
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,680
She did this to me.

250
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,640
I shall see who can protect her!

251
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Answer me!

252
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,520
Miss Hua...

253
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,560
Miss, it's time to eat.

254
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,440
Miss, the food will turn cold soon.

255
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,680
Miss Meng, please stop.

256
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,960
What, I can't go in there?

257
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,600
Please forgive me, Miss Meng.

258
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,800
Lord ordered that no one is allowed to visit her.

259
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Visit?

260
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,080
Hua Qian and I are not friends.

261
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,080
She harmed me with a knife.

262
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,680
I'm here to confront her.

263
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,880
How dare you stop me?

264
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,680
—I can't disobey Lord's orders.   —Nonsense!

265
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,440
Hua Qian attacked me.

266
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Lord is someone who can distinguish

267
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,680
between right and wrong.

268
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,880
Men, drag Hua Qian out here.

269
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes, Miss.

270
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,640
Miss Meng, if you want to arrest her

271
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,760
please come here with Lord's order.

272
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,640
Otherwise, please forgive us

273
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,880
for not obeying your orders.

274
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,400
Miss, the guards here

275
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,120
are just acting according to Lord's orders.

276
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,240
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

277
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,360
You shouldn't be standing in the wind

278
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,480
for too long.

279
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,960
Besides, you don't have to arrest her yourself.

280
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,560
Miss, did you hear the noise outside?

281
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,480
Meng Yifei brought men with her

282
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,720
demanding to confront you.

283
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,320
But after raising a racket for a while

284
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,080
she had no choice but to leave.

285
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,760
Miss, you don't know about this.

286
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,360
Everyone in Zhong's Garden said

287
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,200
Meng Yifei got drunk at the banquet

288
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
and took a fall.

289
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,600
Not only did her face get injured

290
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,640
but also her brain.

291
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,560
The physician said you should avoid wind

292
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,880
while you're recuperating.

293
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,960
Why did you come out again?

294
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm really scared

295
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,640
so I'm here to see Your Highness

296
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
hoping to find peace.

297
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,480
You have been with me for many years.

298
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Not being forthcoming is inappropriate.

299
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,960
Miss Meng, revealing your wound

300
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,720
could cause discomfort for Her Highness.

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,280
Why didn't you dress up the wound?

302
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,120
The doctor said that

303
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,680
the wound shouldn't be covered up

304
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,640
so I left it like this.

305
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,120
Your Highness, if I have caused you discomfort

306
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,800
please forgive me.

307
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
When I said I was scared

308
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,720
I didn't mean for myself.

309
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,560
I'm scared for Lord.

310
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,280
If you have anything to say, just say it.

311
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,920
I went to see the attacker and wanted to

312
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,280
demand an explanation for my scar.

313
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,920
Little did I expect to see that

314
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,240
she was being guarded.

315
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,000
And no outsiders are allowed to see her.

316
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,240
I could only take a look from a distance.

317
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,480
Her compound doesn't seem

318
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,400
like a place for a prisoner

319
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,320
because the furniture and ornaments

320
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,600
are not inferior to mine.

321
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,080
And those guards said

322
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,640
they were acting on Lord's orders.

323
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,800
The daughter of the Hua family

324
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,320
was ruthless and relentless

325
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,560
yet she's still here in Zhong's Garden.

326
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,080
I'm so worried

327
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
that I can't sleep or eat well.

328
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,320
You used to be good at managing situations.

329
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,960
Why are you flinching now?

330
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
It's embarrassing if the servants see you

331
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,480
behaving like that.

332
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,640
It seems that you're still not composed enough.

333
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,600
I need to find someone else

334
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,480
to help manage the affairs of Zhong's Garden.

335
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,600
—Your Highness.                    —That way

336
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,280
you won't lose your appetite or sleep.

337
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm not worried about myself.

338
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,640
I'm just worried about Lord.

339
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,400
After all, that woman has done harm before.

340
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm afraid that she may hurt...

341
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,720
Are all our guards and servants disabled?

342
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,240
What's more, Lord knows martial arts.

343
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,800
Can't he defeat a weak woman?

344
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,520
Instead of spending your time here

345
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,200
you should go recuperate in your compound.

346
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,840
Zhong's Garden is getting more and more dreary.

347
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,640
I will start

348
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,160
looking for some other girls

349
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,720
to live here for a while.

350
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,320
When you're fully recovered

351
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,360
you can help me pick some.

352
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,120
Yes, Your Highness.

353
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,840
I didn't expect Her Highness

354
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,320
to protect her like this.

355
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,960
Miss, Her Highness mentioned

356
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,600
that she would get some girls to live here.

357
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,040
Please take my suggestion.

358
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,520
Go back and recuperate.

359
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,040
It's not too late to teach her a lesson

360
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,600
when you're fully recovered.

361
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,080
I can't stand seeing her on her high horse.

362
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,920
Her Highness doesn't care.

363
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,880
I don't believe the butlers don't care either.

364
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,960
You have been holding this book in your hands

365
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,280
without flipping a page.

366
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,400
Is this page going to transform into something?

367
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Lord, are you going to imprison me

368
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
for the rest of my life?

369
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,880
Do you insist on taking the rap for Butler Hua?

370
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,520
I did it.

371
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,280
Why did you say I took the fall for my father?

372
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,600
Qian, quit this, will you?

373
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I want to see my father.

374
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Not now.

375
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,720
Do you mean

376
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,120
that I won't have a chance to see my father

377
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,360
until he is convicted?

378
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,360
In that case, I have nothing to say.

379
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,720
Can't you see that I'm doing this for your sake?

380
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,520
I hope that you will come to understand...

381
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,720
the true meaning of this sentence.

382
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,040
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

383
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,880
Lord has indeed issued an order.

384
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,720
No one is allowed to visit her.

385
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,000
It may be a house arrest.

386
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,000
A house arrest?

387
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,240
More like protection.

388
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,440
It's hard to say.

389
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,320
How did he handle the Hua family?

390
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,520
Lord just ordered to imprison

391
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,000
the entire family in their house

392
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,720
and no one is allowed to enter or leave.

393
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,400
Lord is busy with the shops

394
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,040
so it's hard for him to cover every aspect.

395
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,840
The case of the Hua family is a serious matter.

396
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,400
Pass down my order. Add more guards.

397
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,280
Your Highness.

398
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,120
You don't usually interfere with these matters.

399
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
If Lord finds out

400
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,040
will he bear a grudge?

401
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,840
It's merely a precautionary measure.

402
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,360
I hope he knows what to prioritise.

403
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,760
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,200
Lord.

405
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,520
It's been proved that

406
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,320
Hua Wen'ang had framed the Mu family.

407
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,680
And he has pleaded guilty.

408
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,280
Lord, I implore you to execute him

409
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
to placate the loyal butler who was framed.

410
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,880
Magistrate Wang, I invited you here today

411
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,560
to discuss the case of the Hua family.

412
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,720
How is the investigation coming along?

413
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,040
I have already sent someone

414
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,520
to bring Broker Qian in for questioning.

415
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,400
The truth will come to light within three days.

416
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,040
Since Hua Wen'ang has confessed

417
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
to the crime he committed

418
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,360
the testimony of Broker Qian is unnecessary.

419
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,640
He has committed such a serious crime

420
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,120
yet he's only imprisoned in his house.

421
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
In my opinion

422
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,120
he should be punished according to the law

423
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,080
and you should make an example out of him.

424
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Lord.

425
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,800
Although Hua Wen'ang has committed

426
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,000
a serious crime

427
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,440
considering his voluntary confession

428
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,360
we can see that he has a conscience.

429
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,400
So, I think he doesn't deserve to die.

430
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,560
Are you saying

431
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,760
one can be absolved from a crime

432
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,920
as long as he comes forward to plead guilty?

433
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,640
Then, what is the use of the law?

434
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,520
Butler Qin, you misunderstood me.

435
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,560
The law isn't all cold and rigid.

436
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,600
The strong bond between Hua Wen'ang

437
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,040
and his daughter Hua Qian is quite touching.

438
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,320
They possess a strong sense of morality

439
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,680
and were not influenced by personal motives.

440
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,000
We should hail them for that.

441
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,720
That was a long speech

442
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,880
but you haven't suggested any punishment

443
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,200
so it's equivalent to saying nothing.

444
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,000
Well...

445
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,760
I'm not Magistrate Wang

446
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,120
so I shouldn't be the one to order a sentence.

447
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,160
But I maintain my stance.

448
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,800
Hua Wen'ang doesn't deserve to die.

449
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Send him and his family into exile

450
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
for two or three years

451
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,280
just like Butler Mu who was framed.

452
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Lord.

453
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,200
You may agree with Li Ji

454
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,880
and decide to send him into exile.

455
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,680
Or you may give him a death sentence.

456
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,400
We shouldn't make the same mistake twice.

457
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,880
This matter will be discussed further

458
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,200
after Magistrate Wang gets to the bottom of it.

459
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,520
Rest assured, Lord Zhong.

460
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,800
Butlers, please be patient.

461
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,720
This is my duty

462
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,400
to investigate and get to the bottom of it.

463
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Lord.

464
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,680
I heard that someone attacked my niece.

465
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,040
Yifei is the eldest daughter of my brother.

466
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,520
She met with an unfortunate incident

467
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,360
so I hope you can do justice for her, Lord.

468
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,800
This is my household affair.

469
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,160
Why did you bring it up

470
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,520
in front of all the butlers?

471
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Meng Ming.

472
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,800
Does your family plan to have

473
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,240
a finger in every pie?

474
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Lord, please forgive me.

475
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,880
Yifei is the apple of my brother's eye.

476
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,120
But now he's running the business in the South

477
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,000
and his health is getting worse by the day.

478
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,920
I was out of line

479
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,280
as I was worried about my niece.

480
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,320
Hua Wen'ang unscrupulously

481
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,720
framed his peer

482
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,440
and his daughter Hua Qian...

483
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,000
To think she would attack Yifei

484
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,880
during the banquet.

485
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,200
He may have confessed to framing Mu Yunping

486
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,240
but his daughter committed a heinous act.

487
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,280
Obviously, she shows no respect

488
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,880
for the Zhong family.

489
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Lord.

490
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,880
Though there may be hidden information

491
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,360
or misunderstanding pertaining to this matter

492
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,120
I still feel that it's inappropriate of you

493
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,880
to keep Hua Qian in Zhong's garden.

494
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,920
As the matter remains ambiguous

495
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,320
I worry for you, Lord.

496
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,000
Meng Yifei was injured

497
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,560
because she was drunk and took a fall.

498
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,520
How could you blame the Hua family?

499
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,120
Everyone witnessed how Miss Hua

500
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,280
took the rap for her father at the banquet.

501
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,560
How did she attack Meng Yifei?

502
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,920
Lord, someone saw her

503
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,600
stepping out for a while during the banquet.

504
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,200
Was she the only one that stepped out

505
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,480
during the banquet?

506
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,280
You claimed that Hua Qian hurt Meng Yifei.

507
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,920
Why did she do it? What feud do they have?

508
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,720
Can you explain that?

509
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Lord.

510
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,200
Maybe Yifei made a mistake.

511
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,280
But, Lord, I implore you to look into the matter.

512
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,360
Having said that

513
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,120
I still think it is inappropriate that

514
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,120
the daughter of the Hua family

515
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,120
is still in Zhong's Garden.

516
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,960
Didn't you hear what I said just now?

517
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,440
Why are you bringing up

518
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,840
the matters of my residence?

519
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,600
I think Butler Meng is indeed getting old.

520
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,560
I heard that the transport guards he sent out

521
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,480
were killed by bandits.

522
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,720
Meng Ming, didn't you also say

523
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,760
that Butler Meng was in poor health?

524
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,440
So, I must do something to help him cope.

525
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,040
Senior, I remember you once managed

526
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,960
the shops in the South.

527
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,200
Take my order. You shall set off next month

528
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
to assist Butler Meng

529
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,680
in managing the shops in the South

530
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,880
and help him lighten the workload.

531
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,920
I shall obey, Lord.

532
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,320
What were they thinking?

533
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,120
Do they all think that I am stupid?

534
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Lord, please simmer down.

535
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,200
We dare not have such thoughts.

536
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,800
I knew it.

537
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,080
She's adamant about this.

538
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
That's why she went to provoke the Meng family.

539
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,080
Look at him. He's not acting like a lord.

540
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,560
He has learned the rules for 20-odd years.

541
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,760
And today, he forgot them all!

542
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,360
Please don't be angry.

543
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,280
Lord has a lot on his plate lately.

544
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,200
I noticed that Lord has lost a lot of weight.

545
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,840
Your Highness, you raised him.

546
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,800
A mother knows her son best.

547
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,240
You know his temperament

548
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
better than anyone else.

549
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,040
It's understandable

550
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,280
when one makes a mistake.

551
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,280
But he still has you, Your Highness

552
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,880
to guide him along.

553
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
A grown-up child won't listen to his mother.

554
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,800
Since he had the nerve to say those words

555
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,600
in front of all the butlers

556
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,600
that shows he's not going to listen to me.

557
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,680
You and he share a strong bond.

558
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,280
Lord will never ignore you.

559
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,640
If he knew he had to hold back

560
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,560
there was no way he would make

561
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,600
such an unwise move.

562
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,680
He's a mild-natured child.

563
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,640
I didn't expect him to be so stubborn.

564
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,680
He's worse than Yelan.

565
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,800
I can't believe I haven't seen this side of him.

566
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,680
If he keeps this up

567
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,920
don't tell me I have to deal with it myself?

568
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,200
For more than two decades

569
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,240
you have seen watching his every move.

570
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,440
He never disappoints.

571
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:43,280
However, it's only human

572
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,640
to be bewildered

573
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,440
by new experiences and emotions.

574
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,040
If Lord can come to his senses on his own

575
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,360
it beats any lengthy advice he gets

576
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,760
from people around him.

577
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,920
I'm not sure

578
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,720
if he can come to his senses on his own.

579
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,080
Trust him.

580
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,000
Oh, right.

581
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,240
I overheard the servants chatting today

582
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,880
which reminded me

583
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,880
that Lord's birthday is around the corner.

584
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,960
But I heard Lord has ordered that

585
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,840
the celebration should be

586
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,200
kept simple and small.

587
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,600
I guess it's because he is busy

588
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,880
and has no time to organise it.

589
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,800
A simple celebration is good

590
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,400
but what is needed can't be left out.

591
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,480
I'll have a deep discussion with him

592
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,440
after his birthday.

593
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,800
Miss, Lord is here.

594
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,400
Greetings, Lord.

595
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Watch what you say

596
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,160
when you're in Zhong's Garden!

597
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,840
Lord, what do you mean?

598
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,920
I have given enough leeway

599
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,040
to you and your family.

600
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,000
If you continue sending out messages

601
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
and putting pressure on me via your family

602
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,760
my patience may run out.

603
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,040
I don't understand what you mean, Lord.

604
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,320
Since you don't understand

605
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,040
you shall be confined to your compound

606
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,120
and focused on recuperating!

607
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,040
Hua Qian attacked me.

608
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,920
Are you going to pretend you know nothing?

609
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,840
I have been living here for quite some time.

610
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,760
How could you treat me like this, Lord?

611
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,320
Do you want me to spell it out for you?

612
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Lord...

613
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,080
Miss...

614
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,320
How did he find out?

615
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,000
It's impossible...

616
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Wang, have you heard about what happened

617
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,160
to Head Butler of the Zhong family?

618
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,720
You mean Hua Wen'ang, right?

619
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
Of course, I heard.

620
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,560
Head Butler of the 100-year-old incense shop

621
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
had to step down so suddenly.

622
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,280
It is said that his daughter

623
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
blew the whistle on him.

624
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,720
I think Miss Hua is really cruel.

625
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,000
He's her father after all

626
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,560
but she didn't show any mercy.

627
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,800
Well, Miss Hua put righteousness

628
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,040
before family.

629
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,920
It's not what an ordinary lady would do.

630
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,920
I heard she took the fall for her father at first

631
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,760
but Hua Wen'ang couldn't sit there

632
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
and watch her do that

633
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,600
so he came forward and confessed.

634
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,440
Is that true?

635
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,000
In that case, Miss Hua

636
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,040
is a role model for women.

637
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,880
The South is too far from Huangcheng.

638
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,000
The news from there

639
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,680
takes around ten days to reach us.

640
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,320
I wonder how's the Hua family now.

641
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,280
Hua Wen'ang made a big mistake.

642
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,800
Even if Lord of the Zhong family wants his life

643
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,080
it's understandable.

644
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,120
I don't know if it will implicate his family.

645
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,960
It's not going to be easy for Miss Hua.

646
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
Yeah.

647
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,240
I never failed the tasks you assigned me.

648
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,720
But I hope you will keep your word

649
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
and not lie to me.

650
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,200
Didn't you say that I was a bad liar?

651
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
So, why are you worried?

652
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Master.

653
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,280
Even with your token

654
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,520
I was not allowed to enter Hua Residence.

655
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,080
I didn't get to see Qianzhi.

656
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,920
Hua Residence may be locked down

657
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
but it beats having the entire family

658
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
thrown into prison.

659
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,800
I don't think any of them are suffering.

660
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,600
My family was the cause of this.

661
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,760
I was, too, blinded by wrath

662
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,320
and had done something wrong.

663
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,040
If I put myself in their shoes

664
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,200
I believe it's only the doing of one individual

665
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,560
not everyone in the Hua family did wrong.

666
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,880
How about I beg Lord

667
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,320
to punish them lightly?

668
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,120
This matter is not up to you now.

669
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Never mind.

670
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,440
I'd better make a trip to Zhong's Garden.

671
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,240
If you really want to do something for Hua Qian

672
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,280
you'd better not go to Zhong's Garden now.

673
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
Why?

674
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,600
Sometimes

675
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,200
men are more jealous than women.

676
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,360
Don't worry.

677
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,480
I know what to do.

678
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,520
I'm sorry.

679
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,520
I'm acting on someone's behalf.

680
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,160
I can't let you leave.

681
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,560
As you can see, I'm very busy now.

682
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,040
If it's not important

683
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,320
let's talk about it some other day.

684
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,960
I'm about to leave for the South.

685
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Before I leave, I'm still a little worried

686
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,240
so I want to ask you about something.

687
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,080
What do you want to know?

688
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,480
How are you going to deal with Hua Qian?

689
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,840
In what capacity are you asking me this?

690
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,000
As your senior.

691
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,320
If that's the case, it doesn't concern you.

692
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,320
Hua Qian is the daughter of the Hua family

693
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,040
and Butler Hua has committed a crime.

694
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,640
Be it personal factors or rational reasons

695
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,240
you shouldn't keep her here.

696
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,440
I'm sure you've read the butlers' routine reports

697
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,040
in the past few days.

698
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,440
Some of them brought it up openly

699
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,840
while some of them tried to hint to you.

700
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,720
If you insist on not listening

701
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,720
I'm afraid Hua Qian will be in a tight spot.

702
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,800
Don't forget that she used to be my...

703
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,440
Do you want to interfere in my affairs

704
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,680
like those butlers?

705
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,040
Are you doing this because you care about me?

706
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,600
Or do you have another intention?

707
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,560
<i>The Zhong Family History Record</i>

708
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,280
When I go to the South

709
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,000
I plan to take Mu Yao with me.

710
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,840
And I hope to give her status before I leave.

711
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,600
Now that the Mu family's name is cleared

712
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,560
I would like to ask you to be our witness

713
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,520
and declare that Mu Yao is now my legal wife

714
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,840
and have that recorded in the family history.

715
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,040
Mu Yan and I are truly in love.

716
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,000
And now, I'm very sure of my feelings.

717
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,320
I'm happy to have her

718
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,000
as my only woman for the rest of my life.

719
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,000
It takes great effort to see you.

720
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,320
Many of us tried ways and means

721
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,320
to live in Zhong's Garden.

722
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,040
And you?

723
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,560
Even Lord couldn't keep you here.

724
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,800
He had to send guards to keep watch on you.

725
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,720
Do you know why I hate you?

726
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,320
When you liked Zhong Yelan

727
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,440
you resorted to underhand means

728
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,600
to be with him

729
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,840
and no one stopped you.

730
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,880
Unlike some people.

731
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,560
Meeting their sweethearts

732
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,120
isn't something that comes easily.

733
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,960
You live a life I wanted

734
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,800
and everyone likes you so much

735
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,720
but yet, you're not satisfied.

736
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,280
Don't you think you're particularly annoying?

737
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,760
But seeing how miserable you are now

738
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,600
I feel much better.

739
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,840
So much for him taking a liking to you.

740
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,880
It's not going to help you.

741
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,600
You climbed over the wall

742
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,320
just to tell me these things?

743
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,520
You finally stopped pretending to be dumb.

744
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,520
Go on, read your book.

745
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,680
This is probably the last time we see each other.

746
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,840
I won't say sorry for what I did to you

747
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,640
but I'll make it up to you in another way.

748
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
How?

749
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,600
I won't tell you.

750
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,800
<i>Bonus footage</i>

751
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,520
Miss, I've made the bed.

752
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,480
I once praised you for being composed

753
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,360
and now it seems that I was right.

754
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,520
Even though you were tipping your master off

755
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,240
you showed no signs of being nervous

756
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,440
on your face.

757
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,240
It seems that nothing in this world

758
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,520
can faze you.

759
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:14,320
I was wrong. Please punish me, Miss.

760
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
You were not wrong.

761
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,560
You are a loyal servant.

762
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,280
It's just that the master you are loyal to...

763
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,240
isn't me.

764
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Miss.

765
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,320
Ever since I was little, I was trained

766
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,760
to do my master's bidding.

767
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,440
I don't even have a choice.

768
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,400
It's none of my business.

769
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,280
I know I did wrong.

770
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,040
Punish me however you want.

771
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,400
You usually have Qianzhi or Hua Rongzhou

772
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,600
to run your errands.

773
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,840
So, I...

774
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,280
I didn't tip him off all the time.

775
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,480
When you said you were going to

776
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,600
leave Huangcheng

777
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,080
I kept it to myself.

778
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,120
All of you said the same thing

779
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
when you tried to defend yourselves.

780
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,600
Are you saying it doesn't count as a betrayal

781
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,680
if it occurred only occasionally?

782
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,800
Since you played the hypocrite

783
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,240
with every semblance of sincerity

784
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,920
don't expect me to be kind to you now.
