00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
<i>Episode 30</i>

2
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,800
Lord, I've increased the dosage of Jiayin Pills

3
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,280
according to your instructions.

4
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Good.

5
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,720
Miss Hua has been in a coma for 26 months.

6
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,440
At this rate

7
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,560
we will run out of Jiayin Pills soon.

8
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,920
It's all right.

9
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
I will continue to make them.

10
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,880
But blood amber is hard to find

11
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,840
and the raw materials are running low.

12
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,720
Put up a notice to buy blood amber

13
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,840
at double the price.

14
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,080
I finally found her.

15
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,440
I will never give her up no matter what.

16
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,320
<i>Two years ago</i>

17
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,400
—Men!                   —What are you doing?

18
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Tie her to the pole outside

19
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
so that people who pass by

20
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
will see the consequence of defectors.

21
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Stop!

22
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
How dare you! Who are you?

23
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,080
Qian!

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
Qian!

25
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,520
Qian!

26
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,720
Who did this?

27
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
Who did this?

28
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Lord, it's better to take Miss Hua to a physician

29
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,240
as soon as possible.

30
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,680
She's an outcast. How dare you...

31
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,200
Our Lord requested a letter of pardon.

32
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,320
Hua Qian is no longer a prisoner

33
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
under your jurisdiction.

34
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,120
And we'll deal with you later

35
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,440
for unlawful torturing and killing of prisoners

36
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
under your jurisdiction!

37
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
If you have a second chance in life

38
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,640
will you do anything differently?

39
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
I...

40
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,840
will.

41
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,920
I want to do things differently.

42
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,480
I want to start over.

43
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,200
I want to do things differently.

44
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,280
I want to start over.

45
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,440
I want to do things differently.

46
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Qian.

47
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,680
—I want to do things differently.     —Qian!

48
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,120
I want to start over!

49
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,720
She's fine.

50
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,560
But she seems to be having a bad dream.

51
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,760
Rest assured, Lord.

52
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,280
Jiayin Pill is good for calming the mind.

53
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,560
It seems the medicine is working.

54
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,880
According to recovered patients

55
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,280
they were able to hear sounds

56
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,160
while in a coma.

57
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,720
Lord, you may talk to her more often.

58
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,960
It will help with her recovery.

59
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,960
I want to do things differently.

60
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,280
I want to start over.

61
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Qian.

62
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,720
—I want to do things differently.  —It's me.

63
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
—I want to start over.          —Zhong Xiwu.

64
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,560
I want to do things differently.

65
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
—I want to start over.                —Qian.

66
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,480
It would be great if I had reached you sooner.

67
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,400
Jiayin Pills can cure physical ailments

68
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,240
but it can't do much for mental illnesses.

69
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,520
Lord...

70
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,760
Qian!

71
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,040
You're awake.

72
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,160
I thought you left.

73
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,440
Why are you here in my house again?

74
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,800
Where is Hua Rongzhou?

75
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,080
Hua Rongzhou? Who is he?

76
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,480
What's wrong with me?

77
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,160
Why do I feel lightheaded

78
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,520
and weak all over?

79
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,120
Miss Hua, you've been in a coma for a long time.

80
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,320
You're experiencing some discomfort

81
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,560
upon waking.

82
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
In a coma?

83
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,680
Yes, you should rest.

84
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,680
I'll get someone to prepare food for you

85
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,840
to help you recover strength.

86
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,920
<i>Why was he in a hurry to leave?</i>

87
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,560
<i>Didn't I fall asleep on the swing</i>

88
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,560
<i>while reading the storybook?</i>

89
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,960
<i>What's going on?</i>

90
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
Allow me to make a bold prognosis.

91
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm guessing she's in a confused state

92
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,560
after being in a coma for a long time.

93
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,400
Or she might be suffering

94
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,080
from temporary amnesia.

95
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,520
In my opinion

96
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,640
since Miss Hua is still very weak

97
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,920
we'd better go along with whatever she says

98
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,280
so as not to cause her distress.

99
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,680
Lord, Master is here.

100
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,720
<i>This is odd.</i>

101
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,480
<i>Why am I so hungry all of a sudden?</i>

102
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
<i>Why do I feel that</i>

103
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,480
<i>something is wrong somehow?</i>

104
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,320
Isn't this aroma the one I often smell?

105
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,440
What kind of incense is this?

106
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
What brings you here?

107
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,160
I passed by when transporting goods

108
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,400
so I came to pay you a visit.

109
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,080
Business comes first.

110
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,640
You don't have to make time to come to see me.

111
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,480
You have stayed here for more than two years.

112
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,200
When do you plan on returning to Huangcheng?

113
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
The butlers in Huangcheng

114
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,960
submit reports to me every month

115
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,120
so it's fine that I don't return.

116
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,840
What about Mistress?

117
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,560
She's all alone in Huangcheng.

118
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Why exactly are you here?

119
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,720
I know that you may still be angry with Mistress

120
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,360
because she ordered Magistrate Wang

121
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,400
to send the rest of the Hua family into exile.

122
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,800
But they deserved it.

123
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,520
It has been more than two years now.

124
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,200
And Mistress also said that

125
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,360
as long as you fulfil your duty as a lord

126
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,520
she will not interfere with your affairs.

127
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
I see that you're here to convince me.

128
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
On our way here

129
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,600
we heard that Hua Qian had woken up.

130
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,400
You should return to Huangcheng with her.

131
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,800
I don't think Mistress will stop you this time.

132
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,560
"We"?

133
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,880
Yao is with me. She went to see Hua Qian.

134
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,000
You have a good appetite.

135
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Why are you here too?

136
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,280
I came to see if you were dead.

137
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,160
Sorry to disappoint you.

138
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm alive and well.

139
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,520
Kind people have short lifespans

140
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,840
while evildoers often live much longer.

141
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,400
I admire you for being so calm.

142
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
If you're here to mock me

143
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,960
please leave. I won't see you out.

144
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,560
That's right.

145
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,920
A selfish and cold-blooded person like you

146
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,680
won't care about your loved ones.

147
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,920
I thought after losing loved ones

148
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,160
you would be as miserable as I used to be.

149
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,760
Isn't your father alive and well?

150
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,960
His name has been cleared.

151
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
He should return home

152
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
and assume the position of Head Butler.

153
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Return home?

154
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,440
Return home from the netherworld?

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,040
Do you mean...

156
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,320
your father has passed away?

157
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,560
Drop your pretence.

158
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,440
My father hanged himself in prison

159
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,600
to prove his innocence.

160
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,120
Are you saying you have forgotten that?

161
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
What...

162
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,440
What about my father?

163
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Your father...

164
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,960
Your father deserved to be beheaded.

165
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,960
What about my mother?

166
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,720
What games are you playing now?

167
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,760
Didn't your mother and brother get killed

168
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,920
when you tried to defect two years ago?

169
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,320
Impossible...!

170
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Am I dreaming?

171
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
—Impossible!                          —Qian!

172
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
Didn't you just tell me that

173
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,000
you faked my parents' death

174
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
and sent them out of the city?

175
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,360
You won't lie to me.

176
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,480
Am I right?

177
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,040
Right. I won't lie to you.

178
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,400
Don't get worked up. Sit down and we'll talk.

179
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,360
Do you remember my maid Qianzhi?

180
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
How is she?

181
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
—Qian...                           —Shut up!

182
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,360
I want her to tell me.

183
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,080
On the day you were arrested

184
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,920
she was beaten to death by soldiers.

185
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,280
Qian, you have been in a coma for a long time

186
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
so you're a little confused.

187
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,840
You'll be fine after some rest.

188
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,120
In a coma?

189
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,840
I...

190
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,680
How long have I been in a coma?

191
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
26 months.

192
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,920
Impossible!

193
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
I have never been...

194
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,720
I have never been in a coma for so long.

195
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,800
I was sure I went back in time

196
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,640
and changed the course of events.

197
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,240
Impossible!

198
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,960
Right.

199
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,680
There's Hua Rongzhou.

200
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,840
Hua Rongzhou.

201
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,120
Hua Rongzhou.

202
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,400
Master, do you remember Hua Rongzhou?

203
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,680
You recruited him into Zhong Residence.

204
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,680
You told Nanfeng to teach him martial arts.

205
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,920
You remember him, don't you?

206
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Do you remember him?

207
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,080
There is no such person in Zhong Residence.

208
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,400
No way!

209
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,280
No way!

210
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,520
Hua Rongzhou is my guard.

211
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,640
Qianzhi is still alive.

212
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,200
My father and my mother are still alive.

213
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,400
I went back in time and changed everything!

214
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,040
Qian, please calm down.

215
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,800
You were overwhelmed by grief

216
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,880
and went into a coma for a long time.

217
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,760
So I lit some Jiayin Pills in your room.

218
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,000
Jiayin Pills have a calming effect.

219
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,960
I don't know what you're talking

220
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,400
but you might have been in a coma for so long

221
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,640
that you mixed up your dream and reality.

222
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,520
Dream?

223
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,120
Are you telling me that

224
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
everything I had been through

225
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,520
was a dream?

226
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,360
It can't be true...!

227
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,720
I went back in time and changed the past.

228
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,320
Everyone is alive!

229
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,600
If we could change past events

230
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,480
there wouldn't be innocent people

231
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,120
who died in vain.

232
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
Shut up!

233
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,080
Qian.

234
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,760
It's all right.

235
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,760
The past is in the past.

236
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,040
It's all over now.

237
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,720
We can start all over

238
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,520
and make up for past regrets together.

239
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,720
<i>Isn't this aroma the one I often smell?</i>

240
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
What's in the incense burner?

241
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,000
It's the bergamot incense you use every day.

242
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,240
What's that smell?

243
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,000
Has the bergamot incense gone bad?

244
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,640
Why is there a strange scent?

245
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
The scent in the carriage

246
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
is making me a little dizzy

247
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,400
so I didn't hear you.

248
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
No incense was lit in the carriage.

249
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,560
No incense?

250
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,840
Why do I keep smelling the scent of incense?

251
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,240
The scent of the incense candle in the lantern

252
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,000
smells very familiar.

253
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,240
It seems to be providing me

254
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
with some pain relief.

255
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
You were overwhelmed by grief

256
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
and went into a coma for a long time.

257
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,840
So I lit Jiayin Pills in your room.

258
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,240
They have a calming effect.

259
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
This is odd.

260
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,600
I don't have any incense in the room.

261
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,040
Why do I keep smelling a familiar scent?

262
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,600
What incense are you using on your clothes?

263
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,720
It smells so familiar.

264
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
I don't have the mood

265
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,680
to use incense at a time like this.

266
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,440
What kind of incense do you wear?

267
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,920
Why does it smell so familiar?

268
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,240
I'm not wearing any incense.

269
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,840
Did you smell something familiar?

270
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,320
Miss, you haven't been using any incense

271
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,800
so you don't have any scent on you.

272
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,200
It's the scent on your body, Miss.

273
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,120
You have this scent on you

274
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,400
ever since the first time I met you, Miss.

275
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,320
Jiayin Pills...

276
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,680
I see.

277
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,440
Start all over?

278
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,080
You said...

279
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,000
we could start all over?

280
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,560
Do you know what it means to me

281
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,440
when you said "start all over"?

282
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,720
If that was a dream

283
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,960
and this is reality

284
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
that means I have...

285
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,480
I have been through all the events

286
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,840
three times.

287
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,320
I've experienced...

288
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,400
my family's death three times.

289
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Qian.

290
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,320
Qian.

291
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,120
Although what happened in the dream is not real

292
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,520
Qian...

293
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,720
I'm here!

294
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,120
It's not real?

295
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,400
It's not real?

296
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,640
If...

297
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
nothing is real

298
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,240
I'd rather stay in the dream

299
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
and never wake up.

300
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,240
At least my parents are alive in the dream

301
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,080
and someone is waiting for me.

302
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,600
Qian!

303
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Qian!

304
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,480
Qian!

305
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,080
Qian!

306
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm here.

307
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm here.

308
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,000
What's wrong?

309
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Does it hurt?

310
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Yes.

311
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,240
You are real. I knew it.

312
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,480
I had a bad dream just now.

313
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
It was so scary.

314
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,760
Rest assured. I'm here.

315
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,600
Yes. This is the reality.

316
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
This is the reality.

317
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,480
This is the reality.

318
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,880
This is the reality.

319
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,720
How is she? She just came to.

320
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,000
Why is she in a coma again?

321
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,600
Generally, she's fine.

322
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,200
Then, why is she still in a coma?

323
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,000
Simply put

324
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,120
she's suffering from trauma.

325
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,440
As I said earlier

326
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,080
Jiayin Pills can cure physical ailments

327
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,680
but they can't do much for mental illnesses.

328
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,320
She chose not to wake up.

329
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,000
So, no medicine is going to work.

330
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,480
You had woken up once

331
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,680
so you can surely wake up again.

332
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,400
Is...

333
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,360
Is there anything I can do to help?

334
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,840
Zhong Yelan.

335
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,600
Take your wife with you and leave immediately.

336
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,040
If you dare come here again

337
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,160
don't blame me for being rude.

338
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,760
My apologies.

339
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,200
Let's go.

340
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,840
The physician said she chose not to wake up.

341
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,440
There's nothing much we can do.

342
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,080
Was I out of line telling her all that?

343
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,800
You told her the truth.

344
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,480
If she didn't hear it from you

345
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,240
she would hear it from someone else later on.

346
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,440
Lord.

347
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,120
I'll go out and look for blood amber.

348
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,280
Qian.

349
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,640
Qian.

350
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,600
Senior.

351
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,520
Can you help me?

352
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,720
What can I do to help?

353
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,520
Qian...

354
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,040
likes you.

355
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,160
Can you wake her up for me?

356
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,200
Qian.

357
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,040
I'm here to take you back to Zhong Residence.

358
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,520
Qian.

359
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,280
I'm here to take you back to Zhong Residence.

360
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,160
Qian!

361
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
I've been calling her for two hours

362
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,280
like you wanted me to.

363
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,920
It doesn't seem to work.

364
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,920
May I try?

365
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
Hua Qian.

366
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,640
If you don't want to wake up

367
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,960
because of what I said that day

368
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,160
let me apologise to you.

369
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,200
The conflicts between you and me

370
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,000
have gone on for so many years.

371
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,120
We should put it to an end.

372
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,800
Let bygones be bygones.

373
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,160
I have moved on

374
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,400
and I hope you can do the same.

375
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,040
Living in the past

376
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,640
will only make you feel miserable.

377
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,760
Hua Qian.

378
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
We are...

379
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,040
even now.

380
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,000
Although I don't know what Hua Qian

381
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,640
had experienced in her dream

382
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,840
I heard her saying

383
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,000
that her life was not worth living.

384
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,480
So, if you want her to wake up

385
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,760
you have to give her a reason to live.

386
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,080
She felt there was no purpose in living

387
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,800
based on her past.

388
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,160
Give her something to look forward to

389
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,920
she might very well wake up.

390
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,320
I don't know what happened in your dream

391
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
that made you feel that

392
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,920
you had no reason to live.

393
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,240
Over here, someone is waiting for you too.

394
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,120
I've been waiting for you all along.

395
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,880
You woke up only for a brief moment.

396
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,680
I have a lot to say to you.

397
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,800
For example, I haven't told you that I like you.

398
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,040
I liked you even before

399
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,280
you fell in love with my senior.

400
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,160
Hua Qian is an abandoned woman.

401
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,520
Plus, the Hua family has committed a crime.

402
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,280
There's no way I'll let you marry her.

403
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,840
I dwelled on it too much in the past

404
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,200
and my senior married her instead.

405
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,120
I can't make the same mistake twice.

406
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,000
You are Lord of the Zhong family!

407
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
How can you be so wilful?

408
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,000
What would the people

409
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,600
think of the Zhong family?

410
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,400
If I can prove that I can handle

411
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,000
all the matters of the Zhong family well

412
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,080
can you promise me to stop putting pressure

413
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,200
on Magistrate Wang?

414
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,320
If I can convince everyone in the Zhong family

415
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,880
to come to terms with me marrying Hua Qian

416
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,160
you shall not stop me, Mother.

417
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
Senior, you have many talents in your house.

418
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,800
It's amazing that even a maid can play so well.

419
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,440
Lord, you're flattering me.

420
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,200
Her skills are mediocre.

421
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,400
Senior, since you think she's an average player

422
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,680
why don't you give her to me?

423
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,880
My mother loves music.

424
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,480
I'll let her serve my mother

425
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
so she can relieve her boredom.

426
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,560
Lord.

427
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,520
This cloud silk brocade was sent from the south.

428
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,640
It is said that only one piece was produced.

429
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,280
Such a piece of good cloth

430
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,640
is impossible to find in Huangcheng.

431
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,040
Ask Lin Jiang to come over.

432
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,080
Yes, Lord.

433
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
Lord.

434
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,560
The cloud silk brocade has been sent to the

435
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,840
textile shop that Young Master Hua frequents.

436
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,040
And he bought it with a lot of money.

437
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
Good.

438
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,000
Unlike Yelan

439
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,680
you are Lord of the Zhong family.

440
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,880
Bear in mind not to be soft-hearted.

441
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,240
You shouldn't be distracted

442
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,600
by those little tricks.

443
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,360
Mother.

444
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm occupied with work.

445
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,880
I don't have spare time to do other things.

446
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
I'm glad you know that.

447
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Lord.

448
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Do you still intend to go

449
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
to Zhong Residence tomorrow?

450
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,240
I wanted to see her happy face

451
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,200
on her wedding day.

452
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,960
But now

453
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,400
I'm afraid of seeing her happy face.

454
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,800
Forget it.

455
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,280
I won't go.

456
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,400
Your mother is in the back hall.

457
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,720
What are you doing here?

458
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,600
This is where the butlers have meetings.

459
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,520
Father, I miss you.

460
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,440
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

461
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,920
Greetings, Master.

462
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,040
You... go home!

463
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Miss.

464
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,720
Are you blind?

465
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,840
How dare you bump into our lady!

466
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,280
Miss, please spare my life!

467
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,360
Are you all right, Miss?

468
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,080
Miss, please spare my life!

469
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,720
Miss, please spare my life!

470
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,960
You lowly servant!

471
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,600
Not only did you steal pastries from the banquet

472
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,120
but you also bumped into Miss Hua.

473
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,760
Take her away and teach her a lesson.

474
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,000
After that, sell her away!

475
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,400
—Yes, sir!       —I didn't do it on purpose.

476
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,320
—Please spare my life!                —Wait.

477
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,040
I accidentally bumped into her.

478
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,120
It wasn't her fault.

479
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,920
But she also stole pastries from the banquet.

480
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,800
I told her to take them for me

481
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,920
because...

482
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,800
because my brother was still hungry.

483
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,760
All right. We shall take our leave.

484
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,600
Thank you, Miss Hua.

485
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,160
Thank you, Miss Hua.

486
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,200
We should leave.

487
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,600
Her Highness is still waiting for us.

488
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,160
These are dirty.

489
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,680
If you want more

490
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,240
go to the kitchen and ask for some pastries.

491
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,040
Tell them I want them.

492
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,280
Thank you, Miss Hua...

493
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,440
You are very kind.

494
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,320
Am I right, Senior?

495
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,040
Yes. Well done.

496
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,080
The three of us grew up together

497
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,840
but you only had eyes for Senior.

498
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,000
I always thought you would be happy

499
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,800
only when you got what you wanted.

500
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,400
It turned out I was wrong.

501
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,600
I shouldn't have allowed you

502
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,880
to fall in love with Senior

503
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,840
and gradually turned into someone you were not.

504
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,160
Even if you would hate me

505
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,000
I should have warned you.

506
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
You should give up as soon as you realised

507
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,160
you had fallen for the wrong person.

508
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,840
If I had not dwelled on it

509
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,560
and not hide my love for you

510
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,960
maybe you wouldn't be where you are now.

511
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,920
Somehow I feel

512
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,120
you know that I have feelings for you

513
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,080
as I'm so bad at hiding my feelings.

514
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,000
Qian.

515
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,080
I don't know what makes you

516
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,600
hang on to your dream

517
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,280
but that's not real.

518
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,040
I'm real

519
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,880
from the beginning to the end.

520
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
I waited for you for 26 months.

521
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,720
I mumbled these things to you every day.

522
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,360
Somehow I feel that

523
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,440
you're able to hear some of them in your dreams.

524
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Qian.

525
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,880
It's impossible to the course of events.

526
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,640
You made a mistake but it's all right.

527
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,960
It's also normal to have feelings of regret.

528
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,000
As long as you want to start over again

529
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,280
it's never too late.

530
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,680
You once said you wanted to travel the world

531
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,000
and bring incense to every corner of the world.

532
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
I've never forgotten what you said.

533
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,480
I know

534
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
the reality is all too painful for you

535
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
but running away is not the solution.

536
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Qian.

537
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,720
I want to tell you this.

538
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,840
Don't be afraid.

539
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,200
If you choose to wake up

540
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,080
I will be with you to face all this.

541
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,400
If you choose not to wake up

542
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,400
I will be here waiting for you as well.

543
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,320
Since I've been waiting for so long

544
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,600
I'm fine with waiting a little more.

545
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,920
But, Qian...

546
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,200
I know you will choose to wake up

547
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,840
won't you?

548
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,200
<i>I remember hearing someone mumbling away</i>

549
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,760
<i>while I was dreaming.</i>

550
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,880
<i>It was you.</i>

551
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,520
<i>You just wouldn't let me sleep in peace.</i>

552
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,120
<i>Forget it.</i>

553
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,720
<i>It's time I woke up from my dream.</i>

554
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
What's wrong?

555
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,640
I'm leaving.

556
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Where are you going?

557
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,080
A place I fear to go.

558
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,280
But I must go.

559
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,240
So, I can't go with you this time, can I?

560
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,760
Miss, you knew Butler Hua and Mrs Hua are alive

561
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
but you didn't tell me to look for them.

562
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,760
So, I've guessed that

563
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,280
you would leave one day.

564
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,520
So, you knew all along.

565
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,040
I know everything.

566
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,200
For example, you like to eat walnuts

567
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,560
but you hate to deshell them.

568
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,320
You like to eat fruits

569
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,560
but you hate stale ones.

570
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,600
You like being in the sun.

571
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,080
You like sitting on the recliner chair.

572
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,480
You hate noise and complete silence

573
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,000
at the same time.

574
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,280
I also know that...

575
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,320
you will do well

576
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,520
even without me by your side.

577
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,480
Now I know

578
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,360
why your surname is Hua.

579
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,120
In this dream

580
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:08,080
I've made up for many past regrets.

581
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,760
The people around me were all from the past

582
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,320
except you.

583
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,800
I feel that no one has ever loved me truly.

584
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,200
So, you appeared in this dream.

585
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,160
You're someone who will never leave me

586
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,040
no matter what I did.

587
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,600
Hua Rongzhou, thank you very much.

588
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,000
I'm leaving.

589
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,240
I have to face reality in that hopeless world.

590
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,760
We can't live life all over again

591
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,520
but I no longer fear the future.

592
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,640
It's all right, Miss.

593
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,640
In any case...

594
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,680
you're the reason I exist.

595
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,520
Lord.

596
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,800
Her Highness sent someone over.

597
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,560
Ignore them.

598
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,200
They came with blood amber.

599
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,760
I'll make it quick. Wait for me.

600
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
How much blood amber did they bring?

601
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,440
I have yet to check the exact quantity

602
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,840
but I saw four wooden boxes.

603
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,920
Wonderful.

604
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,560
Zhong Xiwu.
