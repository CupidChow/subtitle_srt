00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,640
<i>Episode 15</i>

2
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Lord

3
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,960
Miss Meng sent over this soup earlier.

4
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,920
She said that she made the soup herself.

5
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
She made it herself?

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,600
It doesn't look like it.

7
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,960
It has already gone cold.

8
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Take it away.

9
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Yes, Lord.

10
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,160
Did anyone take notice that

11
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,360
that Lord was not in his study room?

12
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,800
Master, don't worry. I sent them all away.

13
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Let's go.

14
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,800
Qianzhi.

15
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,280
Qianzhi!

16
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,200
Mistress.

17
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

18
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,520
I just feel that it's been hard on you.

19
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,400
What did I do when I was drunk yesterday?

20
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
You didn't do anything

21
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,520
except cursing all the way in the carriage.

22
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,280
If you were not drunk, Mistress

23
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,760
I wouldn't have known you had been suffering.

24
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,760
—You bastard, Zhong Yelan!        —Mistress.

25
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,680
—Mistress, stop.          —You lowly Master.

26
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,840
—You can't do this!                    —I...

27
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
—I was so stupid...        —Mistress, yes...

28
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
to fall in love with you!

29
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,040
—Mistress!                      —I hate you!

30
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,480
—Who do you think you are?        —Mistress!

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,000
—Do you think I still like you?   —Mistress!

32
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,760
I-If I hadn't come back too late

33
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,960
I wouldn't care about you!

34
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,360
Yes... you are right, Mistress.

35
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,960
You're right. Ignore him.

36
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Ignore him, Mistress.

37
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,680
—And you.                               —Me?

38
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm telling you... yes, that's right.

39
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,920
—Yes, it's me.              —Yes, I felt bad.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's why I let you and Zhong Yelan

41
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,120
be together.

42
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,640
—I...   —Don't think that I'm afraid of you!

43
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,960
—Right, Mistress.          —I'm telling you.

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,160
—Fear not.    —Don't you tell me what to do.

45
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,600
I know. I won't tell you what to do, Mistress.

46
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,880
I'm trying to turn over a new leaf

47
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
otherwise I might just kill you!

48
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,720
You're right, Mistress.

49
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
I...

50
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
Mistress.

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,080
—I...          —Mistress, you can't do this.

52
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,400
Mistress!

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,240
It's too dangerous!

54
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,880
I almost forgot to scold you.

55
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,720
You darn fatty.

56
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,200
Yes, it's me...

57
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Tell me.

58
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,640
You're at the prime time of your life.

59
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,040
And what did you do?

60
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,760
You forced girls to be your concubine

61
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,200
and became a good-for-nothing.

62
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,080
All you do is call me "sister" all day long.

63
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
I don't want to hear that anymore!

64
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,960
I won't call you "sister" from now on, Mistress.

65
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,200
I've warned you umpteen times

66
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,600
but you still went out and caused trouble for me.

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
—Yes, I understand.            —And, Mother?

68
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,720
She indulges your wayward behaviour.

69
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,160
Everything I said had fallen on deaf ears.

70
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
I did listen to you, Mistress.

71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,480
What do you think you are?

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,680
I did listen to you.

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Why do I have to tolerate all this?

74
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,840
—Mistress, don't cry.     —I took the blame.

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,360
And I got hit by an arrow.

76
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,760
In the end, everyone hates me.

77
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,120
No, no one hates you.

78
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,720
Why is my life so hard?

79
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
No one hates you, Mistress.

80
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,400
—No one hates you.  —Why is my life so hard?

81
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Sit tight... Mistress, stop crying.

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
Who did I curse at?

83
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,840
Mostly at Master and Young Master Hua.

84
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,600
Followed by Concubine Mu and Butler Hua.

85
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,720
And Lord as well.

86
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,280
Who else heard it?

87
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,240
Mistress, don't worry.

88
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
You only started ranting

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,440
after Guard Hua helped you onto the carriage.

90
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,440
so only Guard Hua and I heard.

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,160
Ask Hua Rongzhou to come over.

92
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Yes, Mistress.

93
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
Mistress.

94
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,920
What happened to your face?

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,280
I got hurt accidentally

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,440
while practising martial arts.

97
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,840
But no one is your match here.

98
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,040
Did Master make things difficult for you?

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
No.

100
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,440
D-Did I hit you last night?

101
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,600
I didn't see you hit him on the carriage

102
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,720
but I had no idea what happened

103
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
when I was looking for the carriage.

104
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Let me take a look. Take off the gauze.

105
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,200
I accidentally hurt myself!

106
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
Fine.

107
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,200
You startled me by raising your voice.

108
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,080
Even though I was drunk and out of control

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
I didn't think I'd hit anyone.

110
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
So bright.

111
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,840
Mistress, don't poke my eyes!

112
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,800
What a soft candy!

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,520
No, you didn't hit me.

114
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm going to Hua Residence later.

115
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,040
Please help me prepare the carriage.

116
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,200
Mistress, why are you going back

117
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,560
all of a sudden?

118
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,600
I'm afraid Mrs Hua...

119
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
I've been avoiding the problem for a long time.

120
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
It is time for me to face the music.

121
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,760
Mistress.

122
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,920
Butler Hua is in the study right now.

123
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,640
He asked me to come and welcome you.

124
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,800
Where's my mother?

125
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,320
Mrs Hua is not feeling well

126
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,920
so she's resting in her compound.

127
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,040
I'm afraid she's still angry

128
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
because of my indifference to her recently.

129
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,240
Are you crazy?

130
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,440
Your brother is still in prison

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,120
and you're thinking about the Mu family?

132
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
You should make good use of your time

133
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:57,720
thinking about how to win back Master's heart!

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,240
Master is not going to relent

135
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,520
and I can't find a way

136
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
to intervene in Shen's case.

137
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,400
If you want my brother to come out of prison

138
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,520
then you should listen to me.

139
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,200
What can you do?

140
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,800
In the past month

141
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,240
you have tried various means, haven't you?

142
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,120
And my brother is still locked up.

143
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,840
Do you have any other way out

144
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,440
besides trusting me?

145
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,240
What made you change so much suddenly?

146
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,640
Who provoked you?

147
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,840
I'm just trying to atone your sins for you.

148
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,440
Father, I don't think you've committed murder

149
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,680
but do you know how many crimes you have...

150
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,480
no, I should say how many crimes

151
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,960
the Hua family have committed?

152
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,840
Which merchant is completely clean?

153
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,840
I don't know when you became so naive.

154
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,280
Do you think I can get promoted

155
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,600
merely through hard work and kindness?

156
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
It was I

157
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
who worked so hard

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,040
to climb to the position of a butler

159
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,880
which allowed you to sit here

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,400
and talk back to me.

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,040
Don't forget your last name

162
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,880
when you talk about justice!

163
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,400
Of course, I will never forget.

164
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,040
It is precisely because my last name is Hua

165
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,160
and you are my father

166
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,280
that I have not turned my back

167
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,440
against the Hua family.

168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,160
It doesn't matter

169
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,440
if you won't listen or believe me.

170
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,880
I will let you know in my own way

171
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,040
that the wealth and honour

172
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
you sought after in the past

173
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
simply show your short-sightedness

174
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
at your high rank.

175
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
You...

176
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,320
Do you want to slap me again?

177
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,160
But this time, I won't let you

178
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,520
like I did before.

179
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,640
Now the only person

180
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,960
you can rely on to save my brother is me.

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,440
When I get my brother out of his fix

182
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
you should calm down

183
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,320
and have a good talk with me.

184
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,000
When can your brother get out of prison?

185
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,520
Don't forget what I said just now, Father.

186
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,720
How fast you act will determine

187
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,640
how long my brother stays in prison.

188
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,720
Mistress, are you leaving now?

189
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,720
Butler Hua ordered me to prepare lunch.

190
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,680
I still have things to do, so I won't eat.

191
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,640
Mistress, won't you go see Mrs Hua?

192
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
She has trouble sleeping and eating these days

193
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,920
and has lost a lot of weight.

194
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,960
—No.                                  —Qian.

195
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,320
It's rare that you come home.

196
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,320
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

197
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,360
There are many things to do.

198
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,640
I have to hurry

199
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,400
lest you feel that I'm not doing anything.

200
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,840
Those things can wait a little while.

201
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,920
I heard that you came back

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,320
so I prepared some of your favourite snacks.

203
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,040
Stay with me for a while.

204
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
No need.

205
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,520
Come on.

206
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,880
I have something to tell you. Let's go.

207
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Here.

208
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,560
Have some.

209
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,440
I made you your favourite snacks.

210
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,720
You haven't been back for a while.

211
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,360
Try it and see if it still tastes the same.

212
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
It's delicious.

213
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,680
Your brother loves these too.

214
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,840
I remember when I made snacks

215
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,040
and he would be watching by my side.

216
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,600
Once ready, he would quickly bring them to you.

217
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,680
And he would eat the leftovers

218
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,120
only when you had your fill.

219
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,560
As I said before

220
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,960
I'll do something about my brother.

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
Mother, you don't have to tell me that

222
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
so euphemistically.

223
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,200
I know

224
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,360
you must think that

225
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,240
I've been partial to your brother, right?

226
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,800
After all, he is my only son.

227
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,800
You haven't given birth to a son

228
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,200
so you don't realise

229
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,360
the importance of a son.

230
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,040
How would I not know?

231
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,000
You were the same in the previous life.

232
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
You didn't care about me at all.

233
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,920
You cared only about your son.

234
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,200
When you were a child

235
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
I seldom took you home to my maiden home

236
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,800
to see your grandfather.

237
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,520
I thought

238
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,720
you knew what I was thinking.

239
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,200
My grandfather?

240
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
You were really young

241
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,400
when your grandmother passed away.

242
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,840
Of course, you don't have

243
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,960
any impression of them.

244
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
What happened to Grandmother?

245
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,120
I haven't told you this before.

246
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,280
Now that you are someone's wife

247
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,400
it's time I told you about some things.

248
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,360
Your grandmother

249
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,000
was the legitimate wife of your grandfather.

250
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,840
Although I took the title of the legitimate child

251
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I was not treated as well as

252
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,720
the son of the concubine.

253
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,240
Do you know why?

254
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,440
It was because your grandmother

255
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,440
only gave birth to me, a daughter.

256
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
My dear daughter

257
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,000
it's your birthday today.

258
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,160
What do you want as your birthday gift?

259
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,440
I don't want anything.

260
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,840
I just want you to play with me all day.

261
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,560
Sure. What do you want to play?

262
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,680
Let's discuss this.

263
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,240
Master, Second Young Master keeps coughing.

264
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Concubine Jiang asked if

265
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
you could go over and take a look.

266
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,520
If he's sick, go get a physician.

267
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,960
Master knows nothing about medicine.

268
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,640
You can't say that.

269
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,760
I'll go and have a look.

270
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,240
Father, you just promised me

271
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,280
that you would play with me all day.

272
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,720
You're being wilful now.

273
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,000
Your brother is sick

274
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,320
and you still want to play.

275
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I'll go and have a look.

276
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
I'll come back when he's better.

277
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,560
—Father!                           —My dear!

278
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,480
—My daughter.                       —Father.

279
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,200
Miss...

280
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,680
Master gave you this as your birthday gift.

281
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,760
What is in your hand? Let me see.

282
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,880
This is the jade bracelet my father gave me.

283
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
I want it too.

284
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,200
You are a boy. What do you want this for?

285
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
I don't care.

286
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,680
I want to have whatever you have.

287
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,520
What makes you think you can take my things?

288
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,600
Do you want me to teach you a lesson

289
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
on behalf of your mother?

290
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,880
I dare you. I am Father's son.

291
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
You're just a daughter

292
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
who will marry off sooner or later.

293
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
When that happens

294
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
the whole house will be mine.

295
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,280
If you dare hit me

296
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,040
I will drive your mother out to be a beggar!

297
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,480
Second Young Master.

298
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,760
Mistress, your daughter is the elder sister.

299
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,600
How could she do this to her younger brother?

300
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,240
So what?

301
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,840
It is a matter of course for the child of the wife

302
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,520
to take in hand the child of the concubine.

303
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,760
I know that you can't give birth to a boy

304
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,600
so you don't like my son.

305
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,520
But even if my son is the child of a concubine

306
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,840
he is still the future heir of Master.

307
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,040
If he is hurt badly

308
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,280
the family line of Master will just end here.

309
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,120
—You!                               —Enough!

310
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,240
Why are you making so much noise?

311
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
You...

312
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,320
Go apologise to your brother.

313
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
My dear!

314
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,080
It's wrong to hit someone anyway.

315
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Besides, you are his elder sister

316
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,920
all the more you should apologise

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,120
to your younger brother.

318
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,760
Sure. I'll give in to him

319
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,240
and I don't need anything from now on!

320
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
You...

321
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,520
Your grandfather never treated me harshly

322
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,520
but whenever I had a dispute

323
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,840
with my brother

324
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,520
he would be partial to his son.

325
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,080
He felt that

326
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,600
his daughter would marry off sooner or later

327
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,080
and belong to someone else.

328
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,600
Your grandmother failed to give birth to a son

329
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,680
and she suffered all her life.

330
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
I never want to live that kind of life again

331
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,680
and I don't want you to suffer like me too.

332
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,720
Your father seems to pour his heart and soul

333
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,680
into the shops

334
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,200
and doesn't intend to take concubines.

335
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,600
It's only because I gave birth

336
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,760
to your brother first.

337
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,520
If I had only given birth to you, a daughter

338
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
there would have been many concubines

339
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,480
in Hua Residence a long time ago.

340
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,280
Mother, you said you were suffering

341
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,040
because of preferential treatment.

342
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,880
So, why did you become someone

343
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,840
who has a preference for sons as well?

344
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,840
Qian, this is different.

345
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,160
Shen is your biological brother

346
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,960
and he will protect you

347
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,080
because you are blood related.

348
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,680
Without your brother

349
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,200
do you think your life in Zhong Residence

350
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,480
would be easy?

351
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,880
Your father can marry another woman

352
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,080
at any time

353
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,480
and I can only watch on helplessly.

354
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,200
If your father has another son

355
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,920
he will naturally pay more attention to him.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,440
When you don't have the Hua family as backing

357
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,640
Master may treat you badly

358
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,840
and you will have to suffer in silence

359
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,520
in Zhong Residence.

360
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,360
That's why I've been urging you

361
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,080
to give birth to a son as soon as you can

362
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,080
so even if your father doesn't care about you

363
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,080
your position won't be affected.

364
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,080
And you have your brother.

365
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,080
No matter how unsuccessful he is

366
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,600
he is the only one we can rely on.

367
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,800
Do you understand?

368
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,200
That's right.

369
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,640
You have never experienced life and death

370
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,800
so it's understandable you think this way.

371
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,120
You silly girl.

372
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,600
Do you even understand what I said?

373
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,080
What life and death are you talking about?

374
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,480
It's nothing.

375
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,520
I just want to tell you

376
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,200
that I will get my brother out of prison

377
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,440
so you don't have to worry anymore.

378
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
That's good.

379
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,640
That's good.

380
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,840
Here. Eat some.

381
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,200
Have more to eat.

382
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,600
It's rare that you come home.

383
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,360
Greetings, Lord.

384
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,360
Lord, did you try the soup

385
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,560
that I sent you the night before yesterday?

386
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,200
Song'an brought it to me.

387
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,360
It tasted quite good.

388
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,560
I'm glad to hear that.

389
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,600
I was worried that if I had put too much sugar

390
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,480
and you might think it was too sweet.

391
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,880
It was a tad sweet but it was still edible.

392
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,080
Your second uncle

393
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
did his tasks quite well

394
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
in Huangcheng these few days.

395
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,920
Your mother hasn't come back yet.

396
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,120
If you have time, you can pay

397
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,360
your second uncle a visit.

398
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,680
Although my second uncle

399
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,040
is my father's sibling

400
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,000
we are not close after all

401
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,360
so I don't want to bother him.

402
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,880
A terrible person does have a pathetic side.

403
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
Mistress, these are all the money

404
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,040
that could be withdrawn from the shops.

405
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
These should be enough.

406
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,600
—Qianzhi.                    —Yes, Mistress?

407
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,800
Put this away.

408
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Yes, Mistress.

409
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,480
Mistress, why do you need so much money?

410
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,240
It's for something important, of course.

411
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Qianzhi.

412
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,600
Have you ever thought about gaining freedom

413
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
and leaving Zhong Residence

414
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,880
to live your own life?

415
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,240
Mistress, what does this mean?

416
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,680
Being a maid and wasting time here every day

417
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,880
is not a good idea after all.

418
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,800
Mistress, are you going to drive me away?

419
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,240
What did I do wrong?

420
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
No, I'm not driving you away. I...

421
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,840
Forget it. Let's drop it.

422
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,520
You're such a crybaby.

423
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,480
I can't live without you.

424
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,120
It would kill me to drive you away.

425
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,360
Don't be a crybaby like Qianzhi.

426
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
And remember to ask the physician

427
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
for some good medicine

428
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
to treat the wound on your face.

429
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,720
Don't keep covering it with gauze.

430
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Don't leave any scars

431
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,720
on such your handsome face.

432
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,040
I'll take my leave.

433
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,520
One is a crybaby

434
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,120
and the other one is quick to blush.

435
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,640
Why are the people around me so emotional?

436
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,120
Sir, the damage in the Li family

437
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,360
caused by the Zhang family

438
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,000
has been fully documented.

439
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,240
And all the money that is due

440
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,800
has been calculated as well.

441
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,440
We have urged them many times

442
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,720
but the Zhang family still refuse to carry it out.

443
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Sir!

444
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Sir!

445
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
Sir!

446
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,440
What happened to Young Master Hua this time?

447
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
He cried and said that

448
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
he was bitten by a mouse

449
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,480
and might get sick and die in prison.

450
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Since he's been bitten

451
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
get a doctor to check on him.

452
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,880
We did. But he wouldn't let

453
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,120
the physician touch him

454
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,240
saying that he was afraid of being drugged.

455
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,400
All right.

456
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,840
Since he still has the strength to cry

457
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,000
it proves that it is nothing serious.

458
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,240
Give him three meals a day as per normal

459
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,680
and just ignore him.

460
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,520
Sir...

461
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,600
He's been locked up for a month.

462
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,000
When will his interrogation start?

463
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,600
In the past month

464
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,760
all the prison guards got really exhausted

465
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,720
because of him.

466
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,320
Do you think I can have

467
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,720
the interrogation whenever I want?

468
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Wait for the notice.

469
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
No more questions!

470
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,640
If there's nothing else, get out of here.

471
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,760
Yes, sir.

472
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,360
After you, sir.

473
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,800
Concubine Mu, why don't you read it tomorrow?

474
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Be careful not to hurt your eyes.

475
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,160
I can't fall asleep anyway.

476
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,800
It's good to read for a while.

477
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,440
It's been almost a month

478
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,520
and the bold criminal who attacked you

479
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
is still locked up with no interrogation

480
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,920
and Master is doing nothing about it.

481
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,760
I saw Mistress go out again today.

482
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,440
She doesn't seem to be affected at all.

483
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,360
She went shopping

484
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,040
and visited her parents, as if nothing happened.

485
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,160
This matter has nothing to do with her

486
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,760
so, of course, she doesn't feel anything.

487
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,040
But that criminal is her brother.

488
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,200
You got scared out of your wits

489
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,960
but Master didn't come and comfort you.

490
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,040
He even allows Mistress to do as she pleases.

491
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,840
He's too partial to her.

492
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,080
If it goes on like this

493
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,320
it's not surprising that

494
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,080
Magistrate Wang may suddenly

495
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,480
release that criminal.

496
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,280
Bring me some water.

497
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,920
I want to wash up and go to bed.

498
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,200
Mistress, one of Butler Hua's servants sent this.

499
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,440
My father may be stubborn

500
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,840
and refuses to listen to the truth

501
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,600
but when it comes to his only son

502
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,360
he sure acts quite quickly.

503
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,880
Mistress, who are these people?

504
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,240
Ask Hua Rongzhou to come over.

505
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Yes, Mistress.

506
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,360
I need help. It's a complicated task.

507
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
And I don't have trustworthy people

508
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,560
around me.

509
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,560
Would you run this errand for me?

510
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,360
Mistress, of course.

511
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,560
I am willing to die for you.

512
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,040
It's not that serious. Get up.

513
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,360
There is a name list

514
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,840
and enough money in here.

515
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,160
Gather all their indentures within three days.

516
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,480
Consider it done, Mistress.

517
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,840
Our little guard is all grown up now.

518
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,080
He's able to take care of important matters.

519
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
That's him.

520
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,600
<i>Indenture</i>

521
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,800
<i>Indenture</i>

522
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,360
<i>Indenture</i>

523
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,920
Well done.

524
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,320
It seems that I have underestimated you.

525
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,440
It's only been a day

526
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,560
and you have finished the task.

527
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,640
Tell Qianzhi to come.

528
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,080
I'll get it over and done with

529
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,560
while it's still early.

530
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Yes, Mistress.

531
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,080
Mistress.

532
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,640
Why does your handwriting

533
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,360
look different from before?

534
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,600
My right hand was injured

535
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,200
so it affected my handwriting.

536
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,080
A woman's hands are so precious.

537
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,800
Even if Master is angry

538
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,520
he can't treat you like that.

539
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,320
Mistress, you used to excel in <i>guqin,</i> chess

540
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,600
calligraphy and painting

541
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,600
but now, he has ruined everything.

542
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,480
Therefore, send this to Zhong Yelan.

543
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,120
<i>Divorce Letter</i>

544
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,880
Mistress, this is...

545
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
The divorce letter.

546
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,120
M-Mistress, this is...

547
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,920
I have something else to do, so please hurry.

548
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,720
Mistress...

549
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,560
This is...

550
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,160
Mistress, Concubine Mu says that

551
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,800
she's feeling unwell and will refuse visitors.

552
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,320
Do you know the lightness skill?

553
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,280
Yes.

554
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,840
Carry me over the wall.

555
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,480
Quit dawdling. Just hurry.

556
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,920
How do we do this?

557
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,080
Do you carry me in your arms or on your back?

558
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Hurry!

559
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Hurry up!

560
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,240
Mistress, pardon me.

561
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,560
How did you get in here?

562
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,400
Concubine Mu does not want to see visitors.

563
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,560
You can't go in there.

564
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,200
Concubine Mu!

565
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,400
Concubine Mu!

566
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,200
Let go of me.

567
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,560
Guard Hua, you...

568
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,800
What do you want?

569
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,440
I want to talk to you. I was refused entry

570
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
so I had to find an alternative way in.

571
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,880
I have nothing to say to you.

572
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,040
Read this before you speak.

573
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,560
What do you mean by this?

574
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
Are you threatening me?

575
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,640
No, I'm here to make a deal.

576
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,560
Make a deal?

577
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,880
With the indentures of the former servants

578
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,560
of the Mu family?

579
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,040
Let Hua Shen go

580
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,640
and I will return all the indentures of

581
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,080
your former servants of the Mu family to you.

582
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,120
What if I don't want to let Hua Shen go?

583
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
What will you do then?

584
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,040
I didn't come here to threaten you

585
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,280
so I won't take your servants' lives

586
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,560
as a bargaining chip.

587
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,000
Not to threaten me?

588
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,720
So what does this mean?

589
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
It's a warning.

590
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,800
I could easily get hold of

591
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,600
the indentures of your former servants.

592
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,480
This proves that I can do much more.

593
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,960
Whether you are convinced or not

594
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,240
I have the upper hand

595
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,440
when it comes to negotiations.

596
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,480
For the wrong things Hua Shen has done

597
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,840
I have no objection

598
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,080
that he should pay the due price.

599
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,760
But for the things he hasn't done

600
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,360
I will not have you falsely accuse him either.

601
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,400
The perception of right and wrong

602
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,000
differs from person to person.

603
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,000
Even if the Hua family is guilty of heinous crimes

604
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,760
we should not pay the price

605
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
for what we did not do.

606
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,760
So, Mu Yao

607
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,960
since you want to take revenge

608
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,160
and overturn the case

609
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,920
then come at me in an upright manner.

610
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,640
I will not obstruct your pursuit of the truth

611
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,120
but if you continue with underhand means

612
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,920
I won't turn a blind eye to it.

613
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Master is the one

614
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
who wants to punish Hua Shen.

615
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,800
Do you think it would work coming to me?

616
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,160
Mu Yao

617
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,840
don't underestimate your place

618
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,680
in Zhong Yelan's heart.

619
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,760
And do you think Zhong Yelan doesn't know

620
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,480
that you set it up this time?

621
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,680
Sure enough, people who are in love are fools.

622
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
In the past month

623
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Zhong Yelan didn't push for

624
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
any punishment for my brother

625
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,200
and just had him locked up.

626
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,200
Why do you think it is so?

627
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,560
In a fit of rage that day

628
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,680
he almost killed my brother.

629
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,240
Don't try to lie to me.

630
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,600
Deep down, you're clear

631
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,120
whether I'm telling the truth or not.

632
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,960
Moreover, Zhong Yelan understands you

633
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,560
better than I do.

634
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,120
Even though anger might have impaired

635
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,840
his judgement at first

636
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,400
he would find questionable points

637
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,880
when he calmed down later on.

638
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,200
No matter how absurd Hua Shen was

639
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
he wouldn't have the nerve to create havoc

640
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
at Master's wedding.

641
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,000
You can't even fool me.

642
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,400
What makes you think you can fool him?

643
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,080
Why do you think you know him better?

644
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,600
It's not that I know him better.

645
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,760
It's just that Zhong Yelan

646
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,280
accidentally revealed his guilt

647
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
in front of me a few days ago.

648
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,560
You didn't want to listen to me

649
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,400
and now I don't wish to talk to you either.

650
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,840
My mind is troubled

651
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,760
I'm not in the mood to argue with you.

652
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,040
so please leave me alone.

653
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,280
Hua Qian...

654
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,040
Take my brother's life if you want

655
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,840
as long as you can feel at ease.

656
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,120
You made use of the fact

657
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,840
that Zhong Yelan liked you

658
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,120
and came up with this plan

659
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,800
that was full of loopholes.

660
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,880
If I hadn't stopped him that day

661
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,960
he would have slain my brother

662
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,720
with his sword.

663
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,640
And you would have avenged Linglong.

664
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,720
Hua Qian

665
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,720
I didn't expect to see this side of you.

666
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,480
Finally, let me remind you.

667
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,000
The most vulnerable thing in this world

668
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,280
is humanity.

669
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,400
Sooner or later

670
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,560
your manipulation will consume your goodness.

671
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,480
Because of what happened in the past

672
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,640
I could tolerate what you did this time.

673
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,840
But if you use these underhand means

674
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
to set up the Hua family again

675
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,880
I will not show you mercy again.

676
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,760
The indentures I brought you today

677
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,480
serve as a warning.

678
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,080
Hua Qian, what exactly do you want?

679
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,720
I'm teaching you how to behave.

680
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Are you angry?

681
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,280
In that case

682
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,000
think twice before you act.

683
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,720
If you do something wrong

684
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,920
you will get caught.

685
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
One more thing.

686
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,000
I have confessed to Zhong Yelan

687
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,680
about me posing as you.

688
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,560
I now return Zhong Yelan to you

689
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,040
so I don't owe you anything.

690
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,840
Return to me?

691
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,920
Qianzhi should have delivered the divorce letter

692
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,320
to Zhong Yelan by now.

693
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,840
You can deal with your affairs and your feelings

694
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,920
by yourself from now on

695
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,680
and I won't get involved anymore.

696
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,760
You want a divorce?

697
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Yes.

698
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,240
Don't involve me in the matter

699
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,960
between you and Zhong Yelan in the future.

700
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,640
Mistress.

701
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,680
Where have you been?

702
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,920
To settle an old score.

703
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,240
What are you doing here?

704
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,320
Didn't Qianzhi explain it clearly to you?

705
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,480
What does this mean?

706
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,400
Once I leave Zhong Residence

707
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
everyone will be happy.

708
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Isn't that a good thing?

709
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,400
Do you think it would be better

710
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,680
if you return to Hua Residence?

711
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,520
What do you mean?

712
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,760
The Hua family can't even protect themselves.

713
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,960
You are just a woman

714
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,840
and how long can the Hua family protect you?

715
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,520
Master, what do you mean by this?

716
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,240
You won't say anything?

717
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,480
Let me make a guess then.

718
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,000
You mean you're going to

719
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,720
help Mu Yao reverse the verdict.

720
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,840
Out of sympathy

721
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,440
you would let me stay in Zhong Residence

722
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,400
so I won't get implicated

723
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,040
by the downfall of the Hua family.

724
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,440
If that's the case

725
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,760
you don't have to worry about it, Master.

726
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,680
You saved my life.

727
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,560
I won't turn a blind eye to you.

728
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,080
So, even if you wish to leave

729
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,560
you have to wait for a while.

730
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,280
I can only protect you

731
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,920
if you remain in Zhong Residence.

732
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,560
I saved your life by accident.

733
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,800
I would definitely stand by and watch

734
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,640
if I had another chance to relive the moment.

735
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,560
So, you don't have to take it to heart.

736
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,520
Take it as I was making it up

737
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,000
for my previous mistakes.

738
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,840
You and I don't owe each other.

739
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,560
I don't need you.

740
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,960
I can protect myself.

741
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,080
You can protect yourself?

742
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,480
How?

743
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,800
You will protect yourself

744
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040
by setting others up as before?

745
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,920
What does it matter to you who I set up?

746
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,840
I was kind enough to ask for a divorce

747
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,280
so you and Mu Yao could be together.

748
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,280
Why are you getting angry with me?

749
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,800
Kind enough?

750
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,680
No, Hua Qian.

751
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,040
You always only think of yourself.

752
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,760
—I...                 —You said you liked me

753
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,440
so you posed as Mu Yao.

754
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,440
And then you wanted to marry me

755
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,960
so you drugged me.

756
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,800
Even when you took the arrow for me

757
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,640
it was just an excuse

758
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,360
to get yourself off the hook.

759
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,280
Now

760
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,040
you wanted a divorce

761
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,600
and wished to leave Zhong Residence

762
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,400
so you went to Her Highness

763
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,680
to pass down an order to marry Mu Yao to me

764
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,000
and force me to make a choice.

765
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,840
Indeed, you're good at

766
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,000
finding a way around problems.

767
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,800
You always find a way to go around problems.

768
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,240
And you do it...

769
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,200
by manipulating everyone around you.

770
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
—You...                               —What?

771
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,040
You want to call me an ungrateful, inhuman

772
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,080
and lowly man again, right?

773
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,800
Zhong Yelan, you're an ungrateful

774
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,560
and inhuman lowly man!

775
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,360
How can you say that about yourself, Master?

776
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,760
You're putting up an act even now.

777
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,240
About the divorce...

778
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,200
you can't make it happen.

779
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,320
Mistress

780
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,160
Master seems to be very angry.

781
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,560
I have never seen him so angry before.

782
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,480
I was careless.

783
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,000
I merely wanted to act quickly

784
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,080
and didn't take into account his dignity.

785
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,760
I shouldn't provoke him like this.

786
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,080
I think I might have stirred up his urge

787
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,560
to rebel against me.

788
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,960
Does that mean he didn't leave

789
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,160
and overheard me that night?

790
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,760
Then what should we do?

791
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Forget it.

792
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,320
Let's go to Zhong's Garden tomorrow.

793
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,360
<i>Bonus footage</i>

794
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,920
What a waste!

795
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Lord.

796
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,320
Mistress's maid and guard

797
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,600
have followed her downstairs.

798
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,440
Then let's go too.

799
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
Yes, Lord.

800
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,440
Tell the tailor to come and see me

801
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,640
a few days later.

802
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,720
Yes, Lord.
