00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,640
Episode 12

3
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,560
Is that Mistress Zhong in the carriage ahead?

4
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,160
Hold up.

5
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,560
Junior Lord Wu, what can I do for you?

6
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,600
Mistress, you are such a busy woman.

7
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,120
I have sent you invitations several times

8
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,440
but you've never responded.

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,960
You must be joking.

10
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,760
I am a married woman.

11
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,280
It's inappropriate for me to meet you.

12
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
You can go directly to my husband

13
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,960
if you're in need.

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,520
You and I have something to talk about.

15
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,080
Like that maid in Zhong Residence.

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,320
I don't understand.

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,640
Which maid?

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Mu Yao.

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,920
So you are talking about her.

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,640
In fact

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,440
she will become my husband's concubine

22
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,880
next month.

23
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,600
You're such a forgiving woman.

24
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,520
What, you changed your attitude

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
just because I won't cooperate with you?

26
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,440
How did you know

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,000
what I was going to do?

28
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,160
Rather than wasting time and energy on me

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,480
divert your attention to someone else.

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
After all, the ball is in her court.

31
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,760
If she really cared about you

32
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,480
would you have to solve the issue alone?

33
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,760
Sometimes a step too late

34
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,000
and you may never catch up.

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
What do you know?

36
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
You asked for Mu Yao

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,440
at the incense banquet, didn't you?

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,560
If you really care about her

39
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,600
you should ask her what she thinks of you.

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,600
Otherwise, no matter how hard you work

41
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,800
it will be in vain.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
What makes you say

43
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,800
that my efforts would be in vain?

44
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,600
You and Mu Yao only met a few times

45
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,480
and she doesn't like you.

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,480
Why are you so obsessed with her?

47
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,520
Sometimes, despite what already happened

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,000
it's up to us to alter the outcome.

49
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,800
You don't have to follow the established path.

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,800
Junior Lord Wu, think about what I said.

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,040
If you are still in the city next month

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,160
you are welcome

53
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,800
to attend their wedding banquet.

54
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,840
I will take my leave.

55
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
Let's go.

56
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,080
Does the Junior Lord of the Wu Family

57
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,520
really like Mu Yao?

58
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,320
I guess so.

59
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,080
Otherwise, why is he still thinking about her

60
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
after so many years?

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,400
Childhood crushes

62
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
are the most unforgettable after all.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,720
So many years?

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
Did they know each other before?

65
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,840
Master...

66
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,760
Master...

67
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,800
Zhong's Garden is amazing.

68
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Even a bird here

69
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,800
can speak like a human being.

70
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Get down here.

71
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,640
Get down here.

72
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,760
He had told me about his plan

73
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,640
because he wanted to work with me.

74
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,400
This parrot offended four people.

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,920
What an annoying pet.

76
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,640
Why don't you let him take away Mu Yao?

77
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,160
He can't take her away.

78
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,560
That's the destined outcome for him.

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,280
I told him that

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,680
because I wanted him to accept this reality

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,240
and stop making himself a fool

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,000
while embroiled in their stories.

83
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,640
Why have you come to me all of a sudden?

84
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,480
Did you find out something again?

85
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,880
This is a gift for Concubine Mu

86
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
from Her Highness.

87
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,800
Congratulations, Master.

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,600
Concubine Mu?

89
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,080
Thank you, Steward Gao.

90
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,200
I have delivered both the gift and order

91
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
from Her Highness.

92
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,520
I'll take my leave.

93
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,720
Thank you, Steward Gao.

94
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,760
You went to Zhong's Garden yesterday

95
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,120
and today Her Highness wants me

96
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,480
take Mu Yao as a concubine.

97
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
What are you trying to do?

98
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,560
I just did what you wanted to do.

99
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,600
Why are you still not satisfied?

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
Do you know what you are doing?

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
Didn't you proclaim that

102
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,280
that Mu Yao was your woman?

103
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
I gave you what you wanted.

104
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
Why are you getting angry at me?

105
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,320
Since when did you start

106
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,560
sparing a thought for me?

107
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,040
Are you thinking

108
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,920
the position of the concubine

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
is not good enough for her?

110
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,480
Why don't you let her take my place?

111
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,000
Didn't you say that I was a giving person?

112
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,240
I can step aside. I don't mind.

113
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,920
I know what you want to do.

114
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,840
Are you really the one behind this?

115
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,640
Who else could it be?

116
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,080
Do you think that if I'm a concubine

117
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,880
you will be able to control me?

118
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,080
Mu Yao, you have always been smart

119
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,680
but why have you become dense now?

120
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Which would be an easy target for bullies?

121
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,720
A maid or a concubine?

122
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,400
So, you want to humiliate me

123
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,640
by making me a concubine?

124
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,440
Think whatever you want.

125
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,800
I know you don't believe me

126
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,320
but now I really have no intention

127
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,680
of competing with you.

128
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,400
Otherwise, I wouldn't give in, would I?

129
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,320
You can be wary of me.

130
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,520
I don't care.

131
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,240
Anyway, you'll come to know I don't mean ill.

132
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,320
Sir, where are you going?

133
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,680
—Let's leave first.                    —Sir.

134
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,920
You can run but you can't hide.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,320
Word got out.

136
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,520
What should I do?

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,040
What should I do?

138
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,440
Tell me! What do I do?

139
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,840
My sister is smart.

140
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,280
She will find a way.

141
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,720
Come on. Let's go.

142
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,640
No wedding ceremonies for concubines?

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,880
What's the reason for that?

144
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,560
It's a rule passed down from the ancestors.

145
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,720
Then can she wear the wedding dress?

146
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,600
A concubine

147
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
can only wear a pink wedding dress.

148
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,600
Is there an exception?

149
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
No!

150
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
On top of that

151
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,080
concubines can only enter through the side door

152
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,280
and they have to offer tea to the mistress

153
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,560
before the whole process is over.

154
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,760
I didn't know there were so many rules.

155
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,360
You're from a reputable family

156
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,040
and Butler Hua has never taken a concubine

157
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,640
so it makes sense that you don't know.

158
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,680
We can't go against the rules

159
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,880
to preserve the honour

160
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,440
of a rich and powerful family.

161
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,880
Do you have any other questions, Mistress?

162
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Well...

163
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,440
A wedding banquet is fine, no?

164
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,080
A wedding banquet?

165
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Yes.

166
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,000
It's your choice, Mistress.

167
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
Who organised my wedding banquet?

168
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
Butler Ji.

169
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,640
Tell him to duplicate what he had done before

170
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,840
and invite the same group of guests.

171
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,160
What?

172
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,440
And drop the ritual of serving tea.

173
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
This is...

174
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
All right.

175
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,800
She didn't argue with me today.

176
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
Mistress, you've been so enthusiastic.

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,280
People who don't know might think

178
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,440
you're the one getting married.

179
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,800
Housemaid Li has trained herself

180
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
to be unflustered under stress

181
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,440
or else you would be the death of her.

182
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,720
Mistress, I'll get back to work.

183
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,520
You blind servant! Didn't you see me?

184
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,600
—I'll kill you.                        —Sir.

185
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,840
—We're in Zhong Residence.       —This is...

186
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,400
Young Master Hua, are you all right?

187
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,880
My hands were tired

188
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,920
and I didn't notice you coming in this way.

189
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,440
It's you. I...

190
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,920
Sir, she'll be Master's concubine soon.

191
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,520
The news spread so quickly.

192
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,800
But I haven't served tea

193
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,640
so I'm still a maid.

194
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,400
Young Master Hua, why are you in such a hurry?

195
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,480
I'm here to see my sister.

196
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,640
Mistress has not gone out today

197
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,480
so she should be in her compound.

198
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,280
Do you need me to lead the way?

199
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,080
That'd be nice. Let's go.

200
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,520
We won't trouble you. I know the way.

201
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,040
Sir, let's go.

202
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,240
Sir, we should go.

203
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Stay focused.

204
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,000
Don't forget what we are here for today.

205
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
Right...

206
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,280
Mistress, here's the guest list.

207
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,160
Thank you, Butler Ji.

208
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,240
Send the invitation cards

209
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,360
to everyone on the list.

210
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Yes, Mistress.

211
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,320
Mistress, if there's anything else

212
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
just ask for me any time.

213
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,080
I'm leaving to make preparations.

214
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,720
Have you gotten enough sleep?

215
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,920
I didn't sleep.

216
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
I was just distracted.

217
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,480
Are you preparing

218
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,760
for the wedding banquet next month?

219
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
She's just a concubine.

220
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,960
I don't think it's necessary for you

221
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,080
to do so much.

222
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,800
When I came here this morning

223
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,120
I ran into that maid

224
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,800
but didn't recognise her until I talked to her.

225
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,400
Isn't she the one I saw

226
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,760
coming out of Master's study?

227
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,240
I told you, but you didn't listen.

228
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,760
Look what happened.

229
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,040
She got what she wanted

230
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,240
and made you work so hard

231
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,880
to prepare for the wedding banquet.

232
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,040
Why don't you just pretend to be sick

233
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
and let someone else take over?

234
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,680
Let my brother-in-law handle this hard task

235
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,040
and he'll know the difficulty you're facing.

236
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,840
You're in trouble again?

237
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
No.

238
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,000
No!

239
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,760
I missed you so I came to see you.

240
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,400
If everything was fine

241
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,520
you wouldn't be speaking and acting

242
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
like a normal person.

243
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Tell me.

244
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
What did you do

245
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
to make our father angry again?

246
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,120
You're so smart.

247
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't hide anything from you.

248
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,440
It's not a big deal.

249
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,560
I gave someone one of my concubines.

250
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,640
And?

251
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,840
Yes, it's not a big deal at all.

252
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
The banquet preparation has worn me out

253
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,360
these few days.

254
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,680
Just get to the point, why don't you?

255
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,760
If all that you did was

256
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
give a concubine to someone

257
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,400
you wouldn't need to come to me.

258
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,040
It's just about a woman, really.

259
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,200
Fine. Since you don't have anything to say

260
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,320
you may go back now.

261
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,600
I'm busy. I don't have time for you.

262
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,400
Fine. I'll tell you the truth.

263
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,160
But could you put in a good word for me

264
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,720
in front of our parents?

265
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,320
They always listen to you.

266
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,680
Tell me

267
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,040
and I'll decide if I want to do that for you.

268
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,640
I'm telling you

269
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,920
everything in our house

270
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,760
is of high quality.

271
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
You don't like her? It's all right.

272
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,560
There will be more.

273
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,360
There are better ones.

274
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Come on. Let's drink.

275
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,760
Bottoms up.

276
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,320
B-B-Beauty, don't go.

277
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,200
Who are you calling "beauty"?

278
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,760
I thought

279
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,760
there were plenty of beautiful women here.

280
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,000
Aren't there?

281
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,280
But I only just saw a woman

282
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,320
who was slightly above average.

283
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,640
And you know what?

284
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,320
She ran away.

285
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,800
No problem.

286
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,280
If you want her

287
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,600
just take her away later.

288
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Sir, that is the 19th concubine you just took.

289
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Which one?

290
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,480
The one whom you bought

291
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,880
and was your maid at first.

292
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,240
What are you talking about? My concubine?

293
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,920
She is merely a maid I bought.

294
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,840
Since Brother Wang likes her

295
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,760
just take her with her.

296
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,720
Thank you very much, Brother Hua.

297
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,680
You're indeed the son of the Hua family

298
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
and your generosity amazes me.

299
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,000
Why are you still here?

300
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,480
Bring her here.

301
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Well...

302
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,840
—You...                       —I'll do it...

303
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,120
Come on. Let's drink.

304
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,640
Why hasn't she come yet?

305
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,120
I can't wait.

306
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,640
My compound is big

307
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,080
so it would take her some time to come here.

308
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,880
—How rich...       —Just wait a little more.

309
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Where is she?

310
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
Speak.

311
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,680
How dare she!

312
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm going to fix her.

313
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,720
—Sir!                     —I'll go with you.

314
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,520
Tell me, Qian.

315
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,720
My friend wanted a woman in my compound.

316
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,880
How could I say no?

317
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,280
But that maid... was ungrateful.

318
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,600
The moment I got distracted

319
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,280
she hit her head against a pillar and died.

320
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,720
She brought bad luck to my compound.

321
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,960
In fact, I had everything taken care of

322
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,640
but some lowly maid leaked the incident

323
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,560
so I'm afraid to go home now.

324
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,800
What do you want me to do?

325
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,240
I suppose our father

326
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,400
would have found out about this by now

327
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,280
and he will punish me for this.

328
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,160
Could you put in a good word for me

329
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,360
in front of him?

330
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,000
So you don't think you should be punished?

331
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,160
Of course.

332
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,920
Be punished because of a maid?

333
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,680
How embarrassed would I be if word got out?

334
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,760
Qian, you have no idea.

335
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,440
That maid was once convicted and sold.

336
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,720
I shouldn't have bought her

337
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,680
out of sympathy.

338
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,440
Sure enough, people like her deserve it

339
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,680
and they can't be good.

340
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,280
You think people like her deserve it?

341
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,760
Yes. See what she got me into?

342
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Get out!

343
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
Qian.

344
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,760
I've been nicer to you recently

345
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,920
so you think I'm going to

346
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,120
take care of this for you?

347
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
I...

348
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,240
I never meddle in your private affairs.

349
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,480
I thought...

350
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,720
I thought at least those women in your compound

351
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,280
were social climbers and willing parties.

352
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,560
It turned out I was wrong.

353
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,360
You've become so reckless and brazen!

354
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,560
Hua Rongzhou, come in.

355
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,680
Hua Rongzhou, take my brother

356
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
back to Hua Residence.

357
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Forget it.

358
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,320
Go get Nanfeng here for me.

359
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,640
Yes, Mistress.

360
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,840
Mistress.

361
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,200
Nanfeng.

362
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,120
I want you to do something for me

363
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,040
and I'll owe you one.

364
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,800
Mistress, don't put it like that.

365
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,840
I work for you.

366
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,280
Just tell me whatever you want me to do.

367
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,760
Go to Hua Residence with some men.

368
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,560
Tell them it's my instruction.

369
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,360
Ask the women in my brother's compound

370
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,840
if any of them want to leave.

371
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,760
Those who wish to leave

372
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,040
bring them here.

373
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,760
I'll give them enough money

374
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,080
to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.

375
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,160
You are Master's guard

376
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,600
so my father would probably not stop you.

377
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,520
W-W-Wait.

378
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,680
What are you going to do?

379
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,920
You don't think you've done anything wrong?

380
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,680
Does the life of a maid mean nothing to you?

381
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,160
She's just a slave.

382
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,320
I bought her so her life belonged to me.

383
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,320
She wanted to kill herself.

384
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,920
What could I do about it?

385
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,640
She's just a slave?

386
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,760
Isn't a slave a human?

387
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,400
Don't slaves have loved ones?

388
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,480
What if this happens to me?

389
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,720
What if I became a slave?

390
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,560
What if I were exiled or sold?

391
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,680
Will you say that

392
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,800
I deserve it as well?

393
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,800
Put yourself in her shoes.

394
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,120
Imagine how painful it is for her family.

395
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
That maid was once a criminal.

396
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,560
She was an orphan

397
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,760
and had no family.

398
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,920
That is why you think

399
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,440
you've done nothing wrong?

400
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,000
Nanfeng, I'll be counting on you.

401
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,000
Please take my brother back

402
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,680
and tell my father

403
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,320
that if he still won't discipline his son

404
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,760
I'll do it for him.

405
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,200
—Yes, Mistress.          —You should be glad

406
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,600
that you are my brother.

407
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,040
Otherwise, you wouldn't stand here intact now.

408
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,600
Do I need to make you walk

409
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,760
Young Master Hua?

410
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,960
Has the bergamot incense gone bad?

411
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,960
Why is there a strange fragrance?

412
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,760
I don't think so.

413
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,040
Put that away.

414
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,880
This is the request of Mistress.

415
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,560
Please approve, Butler Hua.

416
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,880
Huang.

417
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,600
Take him to Hua Shen's compound.

418
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,400
Yes, Sir.

419
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
This way, please.

420
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,520
My dear.

421
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,600
He merely bought a maid.

422
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,440
It's nothing unusual

423
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,240
yet she made a big deal out of it.

424
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
Why can't she save her brother

425
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
from embarrassment?

426
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,800
That's right, Father. That's right.

427
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,080
She's so busy with the wedding banquet

428
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,560
which seems to make her quick to flare up.

429
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
—She...                            —Servant.

430
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,080
Get me the ruler.

431
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,120
Father! I was wrong!

432
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,560
I won't do it again, Father.

433
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,680
—Yes. He knows...      —Father, I was wrong!

434
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,480
Why are you still here?

435
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,960
Do I have to get it myself?

436
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Yes, Sir.

437
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,320
Father, I was wrong!

438
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
Father, I was wrong!

439
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,600
I won't do it again, Father.

440
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,480
I won't do it again. Spare me the beating!

441
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,360
I was wrong, Father!

442
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Let's go.

443
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,440
Father, I was wrong!

444
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,120
Father! Stop!

445
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,560
Father, I was wrong!

446
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,800
Father...

447
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,640
Guard Nanfeng, you are in a hurry.

448
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
Where are you going?

449
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I'm dealing with something

450
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,880
on behalf of Mistress.

451
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,160
Is it the much-talked-of matter

452
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,880
related to the son of Butler Hua?

453
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Yes.

454
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,280
Did you send him to prison?

455
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,080
No. I just sent him back to Hua Residence

456
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,520
and Butler Hua would decide what to do to him.

457
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,720
Well, I see.

458
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,680
Get back to work. I shan't hold you up.

459
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,440
Mistress, Nanfeng is back.

460
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
He brought back four young ladies

461
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
from Hua Residence.

462
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,040
They are now in the courtyard outside.

463
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,000
People believe

464
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,920
that wives should listen to their husbands.

465
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,920
Not many women have the courage

466
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,320
to stand up to that stigma.

467
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,600
Give some money to each of them

468
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,280
and help them prepare to leave.

469
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Yes, Mistress.

470
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,640
The peach blossoms in the backyard bloomed.

471
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,520
Do you want to go there to relax your mind?

472
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,640
It's nice to go out for a walk.

473
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,480
I have picked so many.

474
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,200
They're more than enough to make wine

475
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,280
and peach blossom cakes.

476
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Let's go back.

477
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
I'm sorry.

478
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,400
You don't need to apologise, Master.

479
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,920
I know Her Highness' order

480
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,320
has nothing to do with you.

481
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,320
Maybe I have misled Hua Qian.

482
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,360
Don't worry. I won't make you a concubine.

483
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,440
But I still can't divorce her yet.

484
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,680
If you're not agreeable, you can refuse

485
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,160
and I'll ask my mistress to rescind her order.

486
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,840
I know you're kind.

487
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,680
But...

488
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
this is what I want.

489
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,520
It seems that some people are already here.

490
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,520
Mistress.

491
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,920
It's all right. Let's go back.

492
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,920
Hua Rongzhou, have you grown taller?

493
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,640
You were about the same height as me

494
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,400
when you joined last year

495
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,920
but now, it seems you're a little taller than me.

496
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,640
Guard Hua is still growing.

497
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,000
I think he's going to be a lot taller.

498
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,680
But his face still looks like a boy.

499
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,480
Look at him. He's so thin

500
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,160
but his face is as round as a baby's

501
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,000
which makes him look even younger.

502
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
It is true that a round face

503
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,920
will make people look young.

504
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,680
I have to say those chubby cheeks are adorable.

505
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,640
I can't help but want to pinch those cheeks

506
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,960
and take a nibble.

507
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,680
Relax. I'm not going to start nibbling on you.

508
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,200
—This way, please.         —Congratulations.

509
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,160
—Please come in.           —Congratulations.

510
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,440
—Thank you...               —Please come in.

511
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,160
—You may put these here.      —Here you are.

512
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,440
—Congratulations...               —This way.

513
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,800
This way, please.

514
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,360
Shopkeeper Liu.

515
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,360
—Congratulations.              —Thank you...

516
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,520
Mistress, congratulations.

517
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,520
Thank you. Please come in.

518
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,200
Look at her.

519
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
She's organised a wedding banquet

520
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
for a concubine.

521
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
I really don't understand her.

522
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,640
What else could it be?

523
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,360
—To show her generosity!         —Thank you.

524
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,080
It's the first time I've seen someone do so much

525
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,520
when her husband is taking a concubine.

526
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
That's true.

527
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,800
She is really a "good wife".

528
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,360
I'll tell my daughter not to pretend

529
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,680
to be someone that she's not.

530
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Thank you.

531
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,960
A girl brought up in a rich and powerful family

532
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,800
always looks at the bigger picture.

533
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,400
Think about your identity

534
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,280
before talking behind someone's back.

535
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,160
What do you girls from plebeian families have

536
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,440
to compare to her?

537
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,040
You're here too, Mrs Hua?

538
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,480
If my memory serves me right

539
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,400
your husband was just transferred here

540
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,760
from a small town.

541
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,120
Just a butler of humble birth.

542
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,360
No wonder you would be

543
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,640
that presumptuous and disrespectful.

544
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Mrs Hua...

545
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
Your husband is in charge of the procurement

546
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,440
for the Zhong family, right?

547
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,800
He is still an errand boy

548
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,320
after working for so many years.

549
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,560
Shouldn't you ask yourselves why?

550
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,480
You're right and I'm wrong, Mrs Hua.

551
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,360
I will remember you.

552
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,640
Don't let me hear any more gossip

553
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,560
and watch yourselves.

554
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,320
—Yes.                     —This way, please.

555
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,120
No matter what my daughter does

556
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,520
she is the only daughter of the Hua family

557
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,960
and the wife of Master Zhong.

558
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,520
She and you lowly women

559
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,480
are not equals.

560
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,000
Long time no see.

561
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,480
Let's go.

562
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
—Congratulations.          —Congratulations.

563
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,960
—This way, please.          —Please come in.

564
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Please.

565
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
What brings you here, Mother?

566
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,320
Look at what you did.

567
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,840
You brought our family shame.

568
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,600
Your brother...

569
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,680
There are many people here.

570
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,000
You should go in first, Mother.

571
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,640
Your brother will come too.

572
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,960
Keep an eye on him.

573
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,600
Qian.

574
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Qian.

575
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
Qian.

576
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,320
Everyone present today is of high status.

577
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,720
Behave yourself

578
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,680
and don't cause me any more trouble.

579
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
Don't worry, Qian.

580
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,040
I know what I can and cannot do today.

581
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,760
Does that mean that you will be good today

582
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,720
but you still won't change in the future?

583
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,480
No. I'm a changed man now.

584
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,160
I am.

585
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,640
I'm different now.

586
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,840
Qian, I'm really a changed man now.

587
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,040
I won't cause you trouble again.

588
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,040
Concubine Mu, it is done.

589
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
Wait.

590
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,000
Put this on for me.

591
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,720
This hairpin doesn't seem to go well

592
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,240
with your outfit today...

593
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,600
It's all right. Just put this on for me.

594
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,520
Yes, Concubine Mu.

595
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,800
There will be a wide range of pastries

596
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,360
and melon seeds here. Help yourself...

597
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,600
Be careful.

598
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,440
Help yourself to them.

599
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,240
—Congratulations, Mistress.       —Mistress.

600
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,680
Lord is here. Lord.

601
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,840
Lord.

602
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Have a few more drinks.

603
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,480
Come on...

604
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,480
Let me fill it up for you.

605
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,880
—You can't leave.            —Of course not.

606
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,760
Come here and sit with me.

607
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Lord.

608
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,720
—Let's sit here.      —Why are you so happy?

609
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,240
Lord, all the guests have arrived.

610
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,680
Let me lead you to your seat.

611
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,480
The wedding will start soon.

612
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,680
You're not surprised by my attendance?

613
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,520
I was surprised just now.

614
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,720
You haven't answered me yet.

615
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,560
Why are you so happy?

616
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,840
Lord, that's a good question.

617
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,680
Actually, I am not happy

618
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,200
but it is a happy occasion after all

619
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,440
so I'd better put on a smile.

620
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,520
Hua Qian

621
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,920
are you completely indifferent to my senior now?

622
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,680
How could it be?

623
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,400
You're overthinking, Lord.

624
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,640
There is no need

625
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,680
to do away with the tea-serving ceremony.

626
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,840
I don't need to have tea served to me.

627
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,200
You're making Mu Yao break the rules

628
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,200
that are passed down from the ancestors.

629
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,800
I only suggested this with the best intentions.

630
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,960
Since you're not agreeable

631
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,120
then keep the tea-serving ceremony.

632
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,280
Now you don't even bother to act

633
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,920
all demure and virtuous anymore.

634
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,880
What, you don't like it?

635
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,400
Then divorce me.

636
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,920
Mu Yao, here's a bracelet.

637
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,960
A little something from me.

638
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,400
Come on.

639
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,680
Come on.

640
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,280
—Dig in.                         —Let's eat.

641
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,520
—Tuck in.                 —Enjoy yourselves.

642
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,400
—Start eating.                        —Okay.

643
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,520
—Come on.                        —Let's eat.

644
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,600
Eat as much as you want.

645
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,640
If the food is not enough

646
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,040
I'll get the cook to prepare more.

647
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,640
—Come on.                      —Let's drink.

648
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,120
—Cheers.                           —Come on.

649
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,360
Please.

650
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,960
Let's drink.

651
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,520
A toast to you, Mrs Hua.

652
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,880
You don't have to be that polite.

653
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,960
Come on.

654
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,400
A toast to you.

655
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,920
Have more.

656
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,000
Qianzhi.

657
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,600
Try this. It's nice.

658
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
—Mistress.              —Where's my brother?

659
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,960
Okay...

660
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,360
I saw him wandering in the backyard just now.

661
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,520
Tell him the ladies here

662
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,000
are all from rich families

663
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,080
and that he'd better not move around

664
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,160
lest he offend someone.

665
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,720
Yes, Mistress.

666
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,400
Come on. One more drink.

667
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,400
—Sure.                             —Come on.

668
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,800
Thank you all for coming today.

669
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,880
Let's drink.

670
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,800
Greetings, Young Master Hua.

671
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,000
Hey, beauty.

672
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,400
I'm Mistress's maid.

673
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,000
Right. I remember you.

674
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,000
Mistress instructed me to tell you

675
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
that the ladies here

676
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,520
are all from rich and powerful families.

677
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,560
You'd better not move around

678
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,680
so as not to offend someone.

679
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,760
I'm full.

680
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,040
I'll just stay here and not go anywhere.

681
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,480
Huang went to get some hangover soup for me.

682
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,480
After the banquet is over

683
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,720
tell my mother that

684
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
she can come here to find me.

685
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,760
I'll take my leave.

686
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
All right.

687
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,920
Are you going to be Zhong Yelan's concubine?

688
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
Yes.

689
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,440
If this is not what you want, I can...

690
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
This is what I want.

691
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,680
You will regret this.

692
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,360
Let's talk about it when I really regret it.

693
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,760
Junior Lord

694
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,920
I don't know why you keep coming to me

695
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,760
but please don't come to me again.

696
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,080
I will get someone to catch you

697
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,640
every time I see you.

698
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,880
I told you before

699
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,280
but you forgot.

700
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,640
What motive do you have for coming to me?

701
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,640
I swear.

702
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,840
I fell in love with you at first sight

703
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,320
and can't stop thinking about you.
