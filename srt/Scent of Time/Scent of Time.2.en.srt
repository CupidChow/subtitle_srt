00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,560
<i>Episode 2</i>

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Qian.

4
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,880
Are you all right?

5
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,840
Don't worry, I'm unharmed.

6
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Then I'm relieved.

7
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,400
Your Highness.

8
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,720
It seems that somebody set Mistress up

9
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
to make her fall into the water.

10
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,520
Yelan would have rushed to look for you

11
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,160
if I hadn't stopped him.

12
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,520
He really doesn't trust me, right?

13
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,360
Lord

14
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,240
it was Butler Hua who forced me

15
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,920
to send him news secretly.

16
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,480
He threatened my family

17
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
so I was afraid to refuse him.

18
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,960
Given my loyalty to you

19
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,600
I can't sleep or eat well.

20
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,640
After listening to Mu Yao's advice

21
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,360
I've come to beg for your forgiveness.

22
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,760
In view of my sincere repentance

23
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
I hope you won't sell me.

24
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,200
<i>Some blood ties mean nothing.</i>

25
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,920
<i>They're just the ones who seek benefits</i>

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,320
<i>and avoid harm.</i>

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,640
<i>Now that I'm given another chance</i>

28
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,200
<i>I can avoid these hidden dangers in advance.</i>

29
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,840
Mistress

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
you can't blame me for feeling that way

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
given what happened under your watch.

32
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,280
What a heartless guy.

33
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,920
You only care about your wife instead of me.

34
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,240
What's going on?

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,480
Mother, did I miss anything?

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes, you sure did.

37
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,800
After your senior got married

38
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
he only cares about his wife.

39
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,160
And now he starts lecturing me, an old woman.

40
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,800
Senior, that doesn't sound right to me.

41
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,240
Qian.

42
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,520
Come here. Come to me.

43
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,960
My father gave me this as a wedding gift

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,960
and now, I want you to have it.

45
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
I cannot accept it.

46
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,800
You're a sensible girl

47
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,880
so you know what to do.

48
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,200
Since I've gifted it to you

49
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,200
just take it.

50
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,360
Your Highness...

51
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
My mother really wants you to have it

52
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,560
so you should just take it.

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

54
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,920
I didn't expect that after so many years

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,560
some things are still a mystery to me.

56
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,800
I can see that Master and Mistress

57
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,400
are so in love.

58
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,360
Of course

59
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,640
they've known each other since childhood

60
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,880
and they're made for each other.

61
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Why is she so lucky?

62
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,160
What did you say?

63
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,240
Miss...

64
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,040
We're here.

65
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,840
<i>Xinzhu Garden</i>

66
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,560
<i>All this time</i>

67
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,480
<i>my safety has been a concern.</i>

68
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,200
<i>And Hua Man</i>

69
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,240
<i>has caused others to be suspicious of her.</i>

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,680
<i>If I don't want a repeat of history</i>

71
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,280
<i>I must start from the cause of everything</i>

72
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,040
<i>that is my father.</i>

73
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,400
You've made my mistress very pleased today.

74
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,880
I've never seen her treating you so well.

75
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,560
Are you saying that she doesn't like me?

76
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,240
My mistress doesn't like to speak much

77
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,240
so she may seem a little cold

78
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,760
but that is not true.

79
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,960
Her Highness only treated me well

80
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,000
because of you.

81
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,480
That's not true.

82
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,840
You're kind and gentle

83
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
and others will know it

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
when they get to know you better.

85
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,760
<i>Zhong Residence</i>

86
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,520
Banxia, come and undo my bun.

87
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,840
It makes my neck sore after a whole day.

88
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,560
—Yes.                               —Banxia.

89
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
Don't undo the bun now.

90
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,680
Mistress, you and Master

91
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,840
haven't had a good meal

92
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
since you've been out all day.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
I've prepared some tonic soup

94
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,920
to warm you up.

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,760
Why don't you send some to Master?

96
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,440
I'd better not disturb him

97
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,920
as he has his business to attend to.

98
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,680
My mistress!

99
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,840
Why don't you get it?

100
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,120
Master didn't even come here

101
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,560
on the wedding night.

102
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,840
It's late now

103
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,240
and he isn't here yet.

104
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,880
If he has been sleeping elsewhere

105
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,800
others would mock you.

106
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,000
When you were in Hua Residence

107
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,640
you knew how to get to a man's heart.

108
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,800
How can you act this way after marriage...

109
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,240
Fine, I'll send it.

110
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,080
Hurry along... hurry!

111
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,400
Master, Miss Mu still refuses to eat.

112
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,880
She said if you don't believe her words

113
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,920
and refuse to restore her family's good name

114
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,840
she won't want to implicate you.

115
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,200
So she insists on leaving.

116
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,040
If she doesn't want to eat, let her be.

117
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Keep a close watch on her

118
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,440
and don't let her leave.

119
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Master

120
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
Miss Mu is a wanted criminal.

121
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,400
It's not a good idea to keep her here.

122
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,760
Since she has offered to leave...

123
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,040
I know what I'm doing.

124
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,400
Master, Mistress is on her way here.

125
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,080
Qian, why are you here?

126
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,880
The maids made some nourishing tonic soup.

127
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,160
You should have some.

128
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,960
Don't wear yourself out because of work.

129
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
Thank you for being so considerate.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,480
I've been handed more tasks today.

131
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,920
So I'm afraid I'll stay busy for a while.

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,480
It's okay. I won't bother you

133
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,760
if you're busy.

134
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,280
Qian...

135
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,360
I'm not asking you to leave.

136
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
I just came here to pass you the soup.

137
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,680
Don't keep a late night.

138
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,880
I'm going back to my room.

139
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,320
Come here.

140
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Master.

141
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,640
Get Ji Dong here.

142
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Yes.

143
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,440
Mistress

144
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,760
why are you suddenly so cold to Master?

145
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,760
Because love

146
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,320
will completely change a person.

147
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,520
I'm given a second chance now

148
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
so I can't blow it.

149
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,640
Mistress, why are you back?

150
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
What happened?

151
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,080
Housemaid Li.

152
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Butler Ji, why are you here?

153
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,640
I'd like to meet the mistress.

154
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,280
This way. Come.

155
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,120
Mistress, Butler Ji is here.

156
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,280
Greetings, Mistress.

157
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,280
What can I do for you

158
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,600
at this late hour, Butler Ji?

159
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,000
I came here to hand you

160
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,360
the family token and the ledger.

161
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
I know they're in good hands

162
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,240
since you're managing it.

163
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,320
I'm not in a hurry

164
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
to take charge of it.

165
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,360
This is an order from Master.

166
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,680
Please rest assured

167
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,360
that I'll help you

168
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,600
if you don't understand it.

169
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,880
I shall take my leave now.

170
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,760
I'll leave the task to you.

171
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
You're my wet nurse

172
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
I can surely trust you.

173
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,000
Mistress, you should learn to do it.

174
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,720
Not now.

175
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,240
Mistress, please take a look.

176
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,600
Here's the gift registry for home visits.

177
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,960
For matters like this

178
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,680
you can do as you deem fit.

179
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,680
Why is she acting so weird today?

180
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,280
Maybe she is tired.

181
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,800
Miss.

182
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,240
It's time for your meal.

183
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Miss...

184
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,800
Master, the guard reported that

185
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,080
Miss Mu has escaped.

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,240
You should go if you're busy.

187
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,440
I can go home on my own

188
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,760
I'll be waiting at Hua Residence.

189
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,600
That won't do.

190
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,240
How could I leave you alone?

191
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,000
Don't worry.

192
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,840
You can just go.

193
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,920
Sorry. Stop the carriage.

194
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Let's go.

195
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,560
<i>Last time, he left me just like that.</i>

196
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,160
<i>This time, I asked him to leave.</i>

197
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,880
<i>Hopefully, this will make him forgive me</i>

198
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,440
<i>when I eventually confess to him.</i>

199
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,480
What's this smell?

200
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,520
You beggar!

201
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,160
You can't escape this time.

202
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,040
I kindly offered to introduce you to some jobs

203
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,680
but instead of showing gratitude

204
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,320
you stole my money bag.

205
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,120
How will you compensate me for that?

206
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Tell me!

207
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,240
—You beggar!                  —Stop running!

208
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,840
Be careful with my stuff!

209
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,040
Block him!

210
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,840
Block him!

211
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,400
—Lord...                    —Run if you can!

212
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Are you going to run or not?

213
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,880
Did you order the food?

214
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes, I've told the man in charge

215
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,600
and they'll deliver the food once it's ready.

216
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,360
Good.

217
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,840
Lord, if you want to buy some food

218
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,440
you can just send us to get it for you.

219
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,080
Why do you choose to do it personally?

220
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,000
The desserts here

221
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,400
are amongst my mother's favourites

222
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,120
so it's only right that I buy them in person.

223
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,960
Besides, the Zhong family's shop is close by

224
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
so I can also check out

225
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
how the staff are doing...

226
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,360
Where did this beggar come from?

227
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,480
How dare you block our carriage?

228
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,080
You beggar!

229
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,000
This beggar

230
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,400
stole my money bag

231
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,400
so he ran into you while escaping from me.

232
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,520
I'll take him away with me.

233
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,440
Do that and take him far away from us.

234
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,080
Don't bring bad luck to our carriage.

235
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,040
Right... we'll get going now.

236
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,200
Qianzhi, you're not allowed

237
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,440
to call someone a beggar.

238
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,320
Mistress, why do you get off the carriage?

239
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,320
I can handle this.

240
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,640
Don't let these untouchables stain your eyes.

241
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,360
If I hear you call someone a beggar again

242
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,640
you will be fined a month's income.

243
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,360
Did you say that he stole your money?

244
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,200
Mistress, I came here for business.

245
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,280
Yesterday when I was walking in the street

246
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,000
this beggar just bumped into me

247
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,400
and stole my money bag.

248
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,640
So have you found your money bag yet?

249
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,880
No. He stole it yesterday

250
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,680
and he must have hidden it.

251
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,120
I just searched him

252
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,240
and he didn't have a dime.

253
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,960
So you didn't find your money bag

254
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,680
on him, right?

255
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,240
Beggars like him

256
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,840
are liars.

257
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,080
He won't tell me where he hid my money bag

258
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
without getting a beating.

259
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,000
Did you steal his money bag?

260
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,280
I'm sure he'd say no.

261
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
I...

262
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,240
I didn't.

263
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,520
Rascal, quit lying...

264
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Shut up.

265
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,760
Neither did you find your money bag

266
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,880
nor catch him in the act.

267
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,400
And you beat him up

268
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,960
without any proof.

269
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,280
How can we trust you?

270
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,120
If you insist

271
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
that this kid stole your money bag

272
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,240
report it to Magistrate Wang.

273
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,520
But if you can't prove he did it

274
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,720
then you might be punished

275
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,360
more than just

276
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,920
compensating for his medical treatment.

277
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,640
Mr Zhang

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,400
you're here to conduct business deals.

279
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,560
It's better not to offend the authorities.

280
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,320
Here. Take it.

281
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,320
Let's go...

282
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,560
What's your name?

283
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,200
Rong... Zhou...

284
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,320
Your surname is Zhou, right?

285
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,440
The money that he gave you

286
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,800
should be enough for you to clean yourself up

287
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,080
and have a good meal.

288
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,280
As there's a big crowd watching

289
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,520
it won't be wise for me to give you money.

290
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,480
You may be young but I think you're tough.

291
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,800
You can find a job to support yourself.

292
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,240
Come look for me at Zhong Residence.

293
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,640
I can offer you a job.

294
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Nan Feng.

295
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,960
Take Mr Zhou to the clinic.

296
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,000
If you meet troublemakers along the way

297
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,360
send them to Magistrate Wang

298
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,480
for serious punishment.

299
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Go!

300
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,400
Come on, get up.

301
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,800
Mistress, how can you do that in public?

302
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,640
Besides, you can't solve

303
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,960
all these vagrant or beggar issues.

304
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,280
You used to stay out of such things.

305
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,240
Good deeds may be rewarded.

306
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,320
So if I ever get into any trouble

307
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
maybe someone else will help me, too.

308
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,800
What?

309
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,440
Nothing.

310
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,320
I shouldn't fear doing good deeds in public.

311
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,360
In fact, I wish I could do so more often.

312
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Let's go.

313
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,480
Why do I feel like

314
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,080
she has become a different person?

315
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
She might be doing it

316
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,680
as it gets her what she wants.

317
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,920
Really?

318
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,280
Why aren't they here yet?

319
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,800
They should arrive soon.

320
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Come on.

321
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,680
How do I look?

322
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
Come on.

323
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,480
—Not here.                    —What's wrong?

324
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,960
Others are watching us.

325
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
Father.

326
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,920
Mother.

327
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,080
Master has some urgent business to attend to.

328
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,360
He'll join me shortly.

329
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
Okay.

330
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
It doesn't matter.

331
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
My dear...

332
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,280
<i>I almost forgot my father has a temper.</i>

333
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,640
<i>But there is no time</i>

334
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,040
<i>to waste on my own sorrow.</i>

335
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,280
Everything's fine.

336
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,120
Your brother left early this morning

337
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,800
when he learnt of your visit.

338
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,320
I don't know what he's up to.

339
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,200
You know he's flighty like that.

340
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,920
Don't blame him.

341
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,800
Come on. Let's go in.

342
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,560
Come.

343
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,600
You must be exhausted after a long ride.

344
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I've instructed the maids

345
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,480
to light some incense in the tent

346
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,720
that will soothe your mind.

347
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,120
Try to have a rest

348
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,480
before your husband arrives.

349
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,240
It's okay. I'm not tired yet.

350
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Where's Father?

351
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,160
He was so excited

352
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
when he heard that you're visiting.

353
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
He put aside his work early in the morning

354
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,880
to wait for you, only to see you by yourself.

355
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,480
That probably upset him a little.

356
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,680
I think he must be sulking in his study.

357
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,120
Don't worry about him.

358
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,400
He'll be fine

359
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,640
when Master Zhong gets here.

360
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,360
Anyway, what kept him so busy

361
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,960
that he let you come back alone?

362
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,760
I don't know.

363
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,200
It's probably some work matters.

364
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,840
Qian, I've been told

365
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,440
you haven't consummated your marriage.

366
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,800
Don't rest on your laurels

367
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,080
just because you're married now.

368
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,240
Life at Zhong Residence

369
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,560
can get very complicated.

370
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,880
You may be married now

371
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
but plenty of women will still try

372
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,400
to get into Zhong Residence.

373
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,080
I know what I'm doing.

374
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Right.

375
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,880
You just got married

376
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,920
so I can understand

377
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,200
that you don't care about what I said.

378
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,360
Although Master Zhong

379
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,960
is only the disciple of the former Lord

380
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,440
you should not forget

381
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,880
that he once

382
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,720
set up all the shops in the South on his own.

383
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,960
That measures him up to the former Lord.

384
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,480
Listen to me.

385
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,520
You should try to bear him a son quickly

386
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,520
to secure your position.

387
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,000
Then you can also help us out a little.

388
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,880
Your brother isn't married yet

389
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,840
and our family depends on you.

390
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,600
I see.

391
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,960
Getting impatient again?

392
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,760
Only I care enough to tell you this.

393
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,960
Yet you pay no mind

394
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,840
to what I said to you.

395
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,400
Do you want your father and me

396
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
to still worry about you

397
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,640
after we eventually pass on?

398
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,040
I suddenly remember

399
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,200
that I need to tell Father something.

400
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,680
I'd better go find him.

401
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm not done talking yet.

402
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,600
What do you want to say to your father?

403
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,960
Something important.

404
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,280
You...

405
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,600
This girl...

406
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,800
Mrs Hua, don't worry too much.

407
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,520
Now, Master values Mistress a lot.

408
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,560
How could I not be worried?

409
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,040
She has been pampered since childhood.

410
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,520
—Life here is relatively simple.     —Right.

411
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,080
She has never suffered any loss.

412
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,080
So she isn't aware of how complicated life gets.

413
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,960
Mistress is intelligent.

414
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,560
Don't worry about her.

415
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,120
Besides, I'll look out for her.

416
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
Tell me more

417
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,880
about how Master Zhong treats her.

418
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,720
<i>It was my jealousy</i>

419
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,480
<i>that made my father take the chance</i>

420
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,200
<i>to bring down the Mu family.</i>

421
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,360
<i>So only I can change the course of action.</i>

422
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,720
<i>I must give it a shot.</i>

423
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Father.

424
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,040
Did you hear about

425
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,080
Mu Yunping's exile sentence?

426
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
What happened?

427
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,720
I've heard that he's self-righteous

428
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
stubborn and inflexible.

429
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,720
After suffering such humiliation

430
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,400
he might have a hard time in prison.

431
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
Isn't that good?

432
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,280
Saves me the trouble to deal with him.

433
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
<i>Looks like I need to try another approach.</i>

434
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,160
Master and I visited Zhong's Garden recently.

435
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,560
I saw my cousin there

436
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,000
and discovered something interesting.

437
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,880
Would you like to know more?

438
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,920
What did she say?

439
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
She...

440
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,520
had someone push me into the pond.

441
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,960
What?

442
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,400
I'm now Master Zhong's wife

443
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,360
so she bears a grudge against me

444
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,040
and wants me to suffer.

445
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,640
Qian.

446
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,360
I took her under my wing.

447
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,920
Why would she turn against you?

448
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,920
Well, you're getting old

449
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,600
and can't read people well now.

450
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
She's someone

451
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,880
who only cares for her own interests

452
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,080
and is very petty

453
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,920
yet you still took her under your wing.

454
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,640
Anyway, she said she wanted to talk to me

455
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,160
but she was just digging for information.

456
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,560
If not for my vigilance

457
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
I wouldn't have found out

458
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,040
there's a spy in Zhong Residence.

459
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,880
Are you saying

460
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,560
she bears allegiance to the Lord

461
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,560
yet tried to trick you into talking?

462
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,040
You have many informants.

463
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,200
Just check with them.

464
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,600
Anyway, I think you should stay away from her.

465
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,160
So what do you think I should do?

466
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,920
<i>Hua Man had me fall into the water</i>

467
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,440
<i>and asked someone to eavesdrop on our chat.</i>

468
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,760
<i>All of that is true.</i>

469
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,640
<i>My recounting is based on that.</i>

470
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
<i>So, my story embellishments</i>

471
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,920
<i>shouldn't matter much.</i>

472
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,640
<i>It's a huge taboo</i>

473
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,840
<i>to collude with the Lord's staff.</i>

474
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,440
<i>It's not too late</i>

475
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,080
<i>to cut ties with her.</i>

476
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,640
The Lord should have noticed you now.

477
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,120
So, in my opinion

478
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,880
you should keep a low profile.

479
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,640
I did not mean to casually

480
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,440
bring up Mu's case.

481
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,520
The other day

482
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
I overheard the Lord mention

483
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,520
Mu Yunping who's now imprisoned.

484
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,320
He seems to value the Mu family

485
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,040
so he might just try

486
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,240
to ask Magistrate Wang

487
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,960
to pardon his crime.

488
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,120
I was thinking

489
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,880
if you choose to bring this matter up

490
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,360
it could make things easier for the Lord.

491
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Qian

492
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,880
haven't you always hated the Mu family?

493
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,720
I finally got rid of them

494
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,080
as per your wishes.

495
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,320
Why are you pleading for them?

496
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,560
<i>I don't want us to repeat the same mistake.</i>

497
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,200
I heard you've moved into a big mansion

498
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,520
recently.

499
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
How did you find time to meet me?

500
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,920
Everyone is so busy.

501
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,160
My father told me

502
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,960
to handle the furniture

503
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,840
so I've come to your place

504
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,680
to get away from the chore.

505
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,480
Why don't you find a reliable broker

506
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,760
for these matters?

507
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,880
Would you like me

508
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,200
to introduce our broker to you?

509
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,440
That'd be great.

510
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
I'm new here

511
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,880
and I don't know anyone very well.

512
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,400
These tasks have been troubling me so much.

513
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,320
Don't be so formal with me.

514
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,480
Qian

515
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,840
it's so nice to have you in my life.

516
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,160
Father, do you think this is a good idea?

517
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,600
Mu Yao uses me to get close to Master.

518
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,600
That causes me to worry.

519
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,320
These days, I've noticed that he looks at her

520
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,640
differently.

521
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,720
Mu Yao's father

522
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,880
has not even been here for a year

523
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
yet he has taken over

524
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,880
the Zhong family's business operations.

525
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,640
You can't even get close to it.

526
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,040
I also heard

527
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,280
that he always finds fault

528
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,160
with the medicinal material

529
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,280
that you'd already examined.

530
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,880
He complained about you

531
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,640
along with the whole workshop.

532
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,080
If this goes on

533
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,440
I'm afraid that the Zhong family's higher-ups

534
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,120
will follow his lead.

535
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,040
Only Mu Yao and I

536
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,440
know about the broker thing.

537
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,400
If she tries to pin it on me in the future

538
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,680
there's no witness to back her up.

539
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,360
You can arrange an unreliable broker

540
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,960
to meet her

541
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,960
in the south of the city

542
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,800
and tell him to recommend low-quality furniture

543
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,600
which will mess up the Mu family.

544
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,400
Then Mu Yao would have no time

545
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,200
to get close to Master

546
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,200
and her father would have no motivation

547
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,680
to fight you for the butler position.

548
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,840
Qian.

549
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,000
Do you want to rid the Mu family for good?

550
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,400
What do you have in mind?

551
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,880
It isn't easy to fix up a broker.

552
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,600
Besides, the flawed furniture

553
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,280
can be easily noticed.

554
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,640
The Mu family can always

555
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,160
replace the broker then.

556
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,400
Recently

557
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,720
the scent workshop has just received

558
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,240
a large order of agarwood incense balls.

559
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,240
I happen to meet...

560
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,320
a master of the market.

561
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,360
It is said that with his refining skills

562
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,320
aquilaria incense can be made

563
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,520
into agarwood incense within a short time.

564
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,840
Even the scent master can't tell it apart.

565
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,960
That's impossible.

566
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,240
How come I've never

567
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,920
heard of such fraud?

568
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,800
You don't have to know it.

569
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,840
Agarwood incense isn't very volatile

570
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,480
so it tends to weigh heavier

571
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,360
than aquilaria incense over time.

572
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,400
How dare you, a supervisor

573
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,840
try to fool us

574
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,280
by substituting aquilaria incense

575
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,440
for agarwood incense?

576
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,280
That's impossible.

577
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,560
I checked all the agarwood balls

578
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
after they were made.

579
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,120
They're indeed top-notch agarwood incense

580
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,920
and not aquilaria incense.

581
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,800
You're still denying it?

582
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
I've been working with the Zhong family

583
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,880
for decades

584
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,200
and never encountered anything like this.

585
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,520
Do you know that you've almost ruined

586
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,640
our reputation?

587
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,280
Think about it.

588
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,280
I've been working here for decades as well.

589
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,760
How can I not tell apart

590
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,520
agarwood and aquilaria incense?

591
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,680
I did not switch one out for the other!

592
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,440
I've never done that!

593
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,640
Magistrate Wang, something fishy is going on.

594
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,880
Just give me a few days

595
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,680
and I'll figure it out...

596
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,440
Magistrate, we've found them.

597
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,400
—Bring them to me.                —Yes, sir!

598
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Bring them here.

599
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,200
Magistrate, we found this

600
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,560
when I broke a piece of Mu's furniture

601
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,880
by accident.

602
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
See?

603
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,440
Mu Yunping

604
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,040
how can you explain this?

605
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,440
You said you'd need more time.

606
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,520
You wanted to destroy the evidence, right?

607
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Magistrate Wang!

608
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,200
This agarwood fragrance powder isn't mine!

609
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,200
They were found in your house

610
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,200
and you said

611
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,880
that you'd inspected the agarwood balls.

612
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
It is clear that you did a switch

613
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,720
in order to

614
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,160
steal the agarwood incense.

615
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,280
I've never done this before

616
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,320
in my life.

617
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,080
Nor have I ever been accused of it.

618
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,960
Please help me clarify this false claim!

619
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,200
We have evidence and a witness.

620
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,840
Mu Yunping.

621
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,120
No matter how you plead

622
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,000
such an act will never be tolerated!

623
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,920
I sentence you

624
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,600
to sell all your family members, as payback

625
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,680
to Councillor Gu and the Zhong family.

626
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,640
You're hereby sentenced to

627
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,400
life in exile by the borders.

628
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,440
You can spend the rest of your life there

629
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,600
for reflection!

630
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,720
Send help! Mu Yunping committed suicide!

631
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
—<i>Death proves my innocence</i>      —Somebody...

632
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,600
Somebody!

633
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,400
I'm not trying to plead for the Mu family

634
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,760
but now that our family has some power

635
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,200
it's inevitable that the Lord fears you.

636
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,920
Otherwise, when I was at Zhong's Garden

637
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
the other day

638
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,440
they wouldn't have been so wary of me.

639
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
I've suggested this plan

640
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,320
for the good of our family.

641
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,480
Our good?

642
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,200
What do you mean?

643
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,920
After all, you're someone

644
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,600
that was trained by the former Lord.

645
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,920
If the current Lord can't trust you

646
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,280
he'll find a new butler

647
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,800
to go up against you.

648
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,640
We've had our differences with the Mu family

649
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,200
and sometimes they turned into fights.

650
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,440
Now, if you offer

651
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,560
to plead for their pardon

652
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,640
it'd lower the Lord's guard

653
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,200
and also let others know

654
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,360
that the Hua family is fair

655
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,320
and remains loyal to the Zhong family.

656
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,200
Qian, do you know

657
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,000
hidden dangers must be removed completely?

658
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,080
You should know

659
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,880
I loathe the Mu family.

660
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,600
If I had better options

661
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,640
why would I let you plead for them?

662
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,680
Injure one and you injure them all.

663
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,240
There's no chance for them

664
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,840
to restore their reputation.

665
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,640
If we act too ruthlessly

666
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,520
tongues will wag.

667
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,200
After all

668
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,800
you know the full story better than I do.

669
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,200
Qian, you've grown up.

670
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,680
Have you decided what to do?

671
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,800
Leave it to me.

672
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,880
Qian.

673
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Have some tea.

674
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,840
Mistress, why are your hands sweaty?

675
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,640
<i>He might be family</i>

676
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,600
<i>but it's not easy persuading someone</i>

677
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,920
<i>who hasn't faced death</i>

678
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,640
<i>to be kind-hearted.</i>

679
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,880
Mistress?

680
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,000
Nothing. Let's go back to our compound.

681
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,920
Huang, hurry up! Keep up.

682
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,560
Huang, hurry up!

683
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,680
Hurry up!

684
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,720
How rude of me.

685
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,920
I was just looking for something

686
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,880
and bumped into you accidentally.

687
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,200
What are you looking for?

688
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Do you need my help?

689
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,520
I'm looking for the jade

690
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,840
that my mother gave me before she died.

691
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,200
What a filial girl you are!

692
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,320
Why don't you follow me back to my quarters?

693
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
I'll send someone to help you find it.

694
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,120
Why is my brother so fat now?

695
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,560
You can have as much jade as you want.

696
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,160
It's kind of weird.

697
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,680
Isn't he always like this?

698
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,200
<i>That's true.</i>

699
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,080
<i>He lost a lot of weight</i>

700
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,400
<i>when he was in exile for a year.</i>

701
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,440
<i>He's still acting so frivolous.</i>

702
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,080
Thank you!

703
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,040
Qian...!

704
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
Qian!

705
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Qian!

706
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,880
—What's the matter?                 —This...

707
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,760
I bought this brocade satin a few days ago.

708
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,600
It's white, your favourite colour.

709
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,440
There's no other like it.

710
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,840
I heard you'd be visiting today

711
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,960
so I spent a lot of money to get it for you.

712
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,680
Make an outfit with it

713
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,040
and Master will be so charmed by you.

714
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,720
I don't like white anymore.

715
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,040
Save it for your concubines.

716
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,440
They're not worthy of it.

717
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,960
You're born beautiful

718
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,520
and deserve this precious piece of cloth.

719
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,960
Praise me if you will

720
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,720
but don't put others down.

721
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,360
That will cause trouble for me.

722
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,200
I'm just being honest.

723
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,160
Anyway, I don't like white anymore.

724
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,880
I've other things to do. Don't follow me.

725
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,280
Sister!

726
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,640
Sister!

727
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,920
Why is my sister so grumpy?

728
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,520
I know.

729
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,880
Zhong Yelan must have made her mad.

730
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,560
Why are you so cold to your brother today?

731
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,160
Life is already so difficult.

732
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,440
How can I like such a troublemaker

733
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,920
who pretends to be smart?

734
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,800
<i>Bonus footage</i>

735
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,000
—Let me think about it.               —Sure.

736
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,160
Sir.

737
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,640
Is this the money bag you lost?

738
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,160
I saw you falling down here the other day

739
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,440
and you ran away before I could get to you.

740
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,760
Does this belong to you?

741
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,520
Is it true what you just said?

742
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,840
Yes.

743
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,800
Well, Mr Zhang.

744
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,080
In this case, it seems

745
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,120
that you did do that little beggar wrong.

746
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
What did you say?

747
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,120
He pushed me, I fell over

748
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,360
and I gave him a good beating.

749
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
That makes us even.

750
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,280
Mr Zhang.

751
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,360
B-But that's because you stepped on him first.

752
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,960
Why do you talk so much?

753
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,480
Who's the boss here?

754
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,720
You are.

755
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,920
That's right.

756
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Mr Zhang, I'm sorry!

757
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Who's the boss here?

758
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
I...

759
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
I...

760
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
I...

761
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,320
I'd wanted to

762
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,680
beat you up a long time ago.

763
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,880
I am sorry!

764
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,840
Waiter, another bottle of wine.

765
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,680
Okay, right away.

766
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,440
Enjoy.

767
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,480
Sir, are you here for a meal

768
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,760
or to stay the night?

769
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,720
I heard you're hiring helpers.

770
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,960
Are you here to apply for it?

771
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,040
Yes. That's why I'm here.

772
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,160
I want to get a job.
