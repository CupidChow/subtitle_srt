00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>Episode 7</i>

3
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,960
Hua Rongzhou, come here.

4
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,760
Well, security has been an issue these days.

5
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
From today

6
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,560
you'll be a guard in Mistress's compound.

7
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,320
Remember to be vigilant at all times.

8
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Yes, sir.

9
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,720
All right. He's yours now.

10
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm Yinxing. I work for Mistress.

11
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,920
Come with us.

12
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,600
My name is Cuizhu.

13
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

14
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,360
Mr Wang, for the ancestral worship next month

15
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,840
I need some of your men

16
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
to beef up the security.

17
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,160
It's for our ancestors.

18
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,360
We have to make sure

19
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
everything goes smoothly.

20
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,360
I know...

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,440
Lord, you're the son of Her Highness

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,280
and the fragrance your family makes

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
has helped all of us.

24
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,240
Just tell me how many people you want.

25
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,880
Thank you, Mr Wang.

26
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,280
My pleasure.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,600
If it weren't for your family

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,920
the people in our city

29
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,680
would've suffered from the fake fragrance

30
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,480
that the Ge family made.

31
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,200
Now I'm just doing my job.

32
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,440
Now that you mention it

33
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,400
have all the escaped Ge family members

34
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,840
been arrested?

35
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,400
After all, their family fell because of us.

36
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,800
I'm afraid

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
they might want to take revenge on us.

38
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
You're right.

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
But I haven't heard of them these years.

40
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,040
I think they're too afraid

41
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,520
to show their faces.

42
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,960
Well...

43
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,240
Don't worry, Lord.

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,040
I'm the magistrate of Huangcheng now.

45
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,960
The Ge family

46
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,400
won't have the nerve to show up here.

47
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,480
Thank you.

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,920
What did you just say, Mistress?

49
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,760
Master said that I'm too weak

50
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,320
so I've decided to start exercising today.

51
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
This is for my health.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,320
You won't be against it, will you?

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,560
<i>Many events will happen in the future.</i>

54
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,480
<i>I'm too weak now</i>

55
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,240
<i>to make it through the ancestral worship.</i>

56
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,240
Five.

57
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Eight.

58
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,520
Mistress, this is...

59
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,880
Housemaid Li, do you want to join us?

60
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,720
Mistress...

61
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,200
Slow down.

62
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,080
Mistress, what improper behaviour!

63
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,480
What improper behaviour!

64
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Housemaid Li.

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Housemaid Li.

66
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,280
Stop her...

67
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,120
Mistress, you've exercised for half a month

68
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,040
and it really works.

69
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,240
You eat much more

70
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,800
and the dress made a few months ago

71
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
is a bit small for you now.

72
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,960
If you can't give a compliment, be quiet.

73
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,600
Mistress, it's time to go.

74
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,440
Master's waiting outside.

75
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Let's go.

76
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,880
<i>Ancestral Tablet</i>

77
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,920
All kneel.

78
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,360
First kowtow.

79
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,240
Up.

80
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,720
Second kowtow.

81
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
Up.

82
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,040
Third kowtow.

83
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,520
All rise.

84
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,280
Offer incense.

85
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,280
Offer wine.

86
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,280
Offer fragrance formula to ancestors.

87
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,560
Protect the Lord!

88
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
—Master.                                —Go.

89
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,760
Run!

90
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,520
Don't be distracted, Master.

91
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,000
Here's an arrow from me in return.

92
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Come here.

93
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
Yao!

94
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,200
Master, you can't risk revealing yourself.

95
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,160
Yao!

96
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
The ceremony is coming to an end.

97
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,280
Just a little longer.

98
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
All right.

99
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,440
<i>Sorry. It's crucial to my next plan</i>

100
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,160
<i>so I must take your place and save his life.</i>

101
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,160
<i>Where's the arrow?</i>

102
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
<i>Where's the arrow?</i>

103
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,960
<i>Why hasn't it shown up yet?</i>

104
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,240
What's wrong?

105
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Protect the Lord!

106
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,200
Zhong, hand over our fragrance formula!

107
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Go.

108
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,280
Run!

109
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,960
Look at his exquisite outfit.

110
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,160
He must be Mu Yao's third admirer.

111
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Stop!

112
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,040
She's your target.

113
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
Why should I listen to you?

114
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,760
Because I didn't get hurt at all

115
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,880
in my previous life.

116
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Previous life?

117
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
I'll send you to your next one right away.

118
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,400
Mistress, are you all right?

119
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,440
Why didn't you listen to me?

120
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,600
Look at yourself now.

121
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,000
Young man, you're promising.

122
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,480
—What's your name?                   —Hua...

123
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,440
Oh, no! I'm running late.

124
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Rongzhou.

125
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,880
Here's an arrow from me in return.

126
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Let me do it.

127
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
<i>She's so stupid.</i>

128
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,240
<i>Must she block the arrow to save him?</i>

129
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
<i>Just push him away.</i>

130
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,480
How... how could...

131
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,640
How could this be...

132
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,440
Qian!

133
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,280
Qian!

134
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Qian.

135
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,920
Nanfeng!

136
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,240
—Master.                          —Mistress!

137
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,200
—Take care of Mu Yao.          —Yes, Master.

138
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,560
Mistress.

139
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
Master, we have both the fragrance

140
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,880
and the formula. Let's leave.

141
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,440
If they find us, there'll be trouble.

142
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,320
Qianzhi.

143
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,240
Physician Xia, how is she?

144
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Master.

145
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,320
Mistress' wound has been treated

146
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,360
but it's way too close to her heart.

147
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,640
If it were any closer

148
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,320
I'm afraid even the best doctor

149
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
could not save her.

150
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,880
Take good care of her

151
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,160
and she'll come to.

152
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Thank you.

153
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,520
Nanfeng, show him out.

154
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,160
—Yes, Master.                      —See you.

155
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
Nanfeng.

156
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,400
Master.

157
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,120
Go to my study and bring me my clothes

158
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,400
and personal items.

159
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,720
Yes, Master.

160
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,080
Master.

161
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,400
Everything's ready.

162
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,000
We can leave secretly tomorrow.

163
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,920
Magistrate Wang has imposed martial law

164
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,880
to track down the assassins.

165
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,800
It was really hard

166
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,280
to find this opportunity.

167
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Come here.

168
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,280
How ridiculous!

169
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,160
We dispatched too many people this time

170
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,120
and it caught Senior Lord's attention.

171
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,280
I'm afraid when we go back

172
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,200
he'll question you about it.

173
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,560
So what?

174
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,400
Do you think my father

175
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,320
wants to deal with cheap raw materials

176
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
and doesn't want

177
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,960
the Zhong family's fragrance formulas?

178
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,720
I once took in one of the Ge family members

179
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,720
and he didn't say anything.

180
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,800
He has handed over our entire staff to me

181
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,000
which means he has recognised my ability

182
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,600
and I'm allowed to do anything.

183
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,920
But the Jiayin Pill formula

184
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,200
that we got this time is fake

185
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,800
and the people we sent to their shops

186
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,800
found nothing.

187
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,080
I underestimated Lord Zhong.

188
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,720
I didn't expect him to do this.

189
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,480
Seems like he knew this would happen.

190
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,560
But the people in this city are superstitious

191
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,880
and tie these ceremonies to luck.

192
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Their ceremony was ruined.

193
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,880
So they need herb merchants like us

194
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,040
to keep their business going.

195
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,920
But, Master

196
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,680
you acted without permission this time.

197
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
If this gets out

198
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,320
even the Senior Lord might not be able

199
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,880
to protect you.

200
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,880
The Zhong family still thinks

201
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,200
the Ge family was responsible.

202
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,600
You need not be so worried.

203
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
But I think

204
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,840
we'd better leave as soon as possible.

205
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Am I...

206
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
late again?

207
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,760
Master.

208
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,320
They're holding an incense banquet soon.

209
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
We can...

210
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,720
come back then.

211
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,840
All right.

212
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,320
Get this. Tell everyone that this time

213
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,080
we only took away the Jiayin Pill formula

214
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,120
and that's all we did.

215
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,960
Yes, I'll make sure our stories match up.

216
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,800
No.

217
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,320
This isn't what I'd expected.

218
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
I...

219
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,160
Qian.

220
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,000
You've finally come to.

221
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,200
—I...                   —Don't say anything.

222
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,160
The physician said the arrow missed your heart

223
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,040
or else I wouldn't get to see you again.

224
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
No, I...

225
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,960
Let's talk about it after you recover.

226
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,360
The physician said

227
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,040
you should take a good rest.

228
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,440
Can you let me...

229
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,600
I know.

230
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,640
Qian, don't worry.

231
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,120
From now on, I won't let you down.

232
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
I...

233
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,680
I'll get the physician.

234
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,280
Zhong Yelan

235
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,720
I have something to tell you now.

236
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,080
As I said, let's...

237
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
I wasn't the one

238
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,680
in the temple with you

239
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,800
when you were a kid.

240
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,000
It was Mu Yao.

241
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
What are you talking about?

242
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,840
Do you still remember

243
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,040
the jade pendant you gave to that girl?

244
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,040
I lied before.

245
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,080
I told you my brother lost it

246
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,200
but I saw it on Mu Yao.

247
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,160
And

248
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,600
nothing happened between us.

249
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,600
We didn't consummate our relationship.

250
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,040
I had drugged you...

251
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,280
that time.

252
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,000
I noticed that

253
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,560
you treated her differently

254
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,560
so I made that mistake in a panic

255
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,520
to let me marry

256
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,200
into your family.

257
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,160
I had a near-death experience

258
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,880
and now I realise how wrong I was.

259
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,000
You don't need to forgive me, Master

260
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,280
but please don't implicate my family.

261
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
You...

262
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,680
What do you mean?

263
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,280
I'm responsible for my actions.

264
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,960
If you want to divorce me

265
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,680
I would understand.

266
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,800
You...

267
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,320
Master...

268
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,840
Master, everything is packed.

269
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,320
—When shall we start moving?       —Save it.

270
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,720
Master.

271
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,040
Master.

272
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,240
Mistress, what did you say to Master just now?

273
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,680
I just told him the truth.

274
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,120
The truth?

275
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,640
But why did Master seem like

276
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,160
a different person just now?

277
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,680
You don't know how anxious Master was

278
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,280
when you were in a coma.

279
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,040
Remove the incense in the room.

280
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,360
It makes me dizzy.

281
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,040
Mistress, you're ill

282
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,400
so we didn't light any incense.

283
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,520
No incense?

284
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,400
Then why do I keep smelling

285
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,680
the scent of incense?

286
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,040
There's no scent.

287
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,400
Maybe I'm just ill.

288
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,960
Bring some sleep-aiding fragrance to me.

289
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,760
I want it in oral medication and incense.

290
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,200
They're supposed to be strong.

291
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,120
Why do you suddenly want those, Mistress?

292
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
I can't take the pain.

293
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,880
They can help me fall asleep.

294
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,160
Bring as many as you can.

295
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm afraid the pain won't let me sleep.

296
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
All right.

297
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,880
It's time to leave.

298
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,200
I've packed my bags.

299
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,560
Three months are almost up. I'm...

300
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
Was it you...

301
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,360
that I met in the temple of the city

302
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,240
13 years ago?

303
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,080
Why do you suddenly ask about this?

304
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,400
Was it you?

305
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Yes.

306
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,840
Where's the jade pendant I gave you?

307
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,520
So it was you.

308
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,040
It was you indeed.

309
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,240
Why didn't you tell me?

310
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,920
I thought you had forgotten about it

311
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,840
and that only I retained the memory.

312
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,440
If you had told me

313
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,760
right from the beginning...

314
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,160
Then what?

315
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,280
When I met you again, I recognised you.

316
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,680
But your indifferent attitude made me think

317
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,800
I was wrong.

318
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,160
Have we met before?

319
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,560
Though I learnt the truth later

320
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
considering the strict rules here

321
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,480
and our reputation

322
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,760
how could I bring it up?

323
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,600
I'll help you investigate your father's case.

324
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,000
I want to know how many lies

325
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,560
Hua Qian has told me

326
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,560
in addition to the ones

327
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,360
she revealed to me today.

328
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,600
<i>Qian.</i>

329
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,040
<i>Qian.</i>

330
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,400
<i>Qian, wake up.</i>

331
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,000
<i>Qian, I won't let you down again.</i>

332
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,120
Hua Qian!

333
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,720
You used Mu Yao's identity to get close to me

334
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,000
and secretly drugged me to marry you.

335
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,280
You and your father framed her family

336
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,840
and put them in prison.

337
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,440
Our ties are severed now

338
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,840
and we shall go our separate ways.

339
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,440
Is it because of Butler Hua's poor parenting

340
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,240
or his own misbehaviour

341
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,880
which has set a bad example?

342
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,160
You don't need to be nervous.

343
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,440
I wasn't going to rebuke you.

344
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,800
It was just a passing remark.

345
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,760
I've met Hua Qian before

346
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,320
but she'd never tolerate

347
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,520
any other woman around my senior

348
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,320
let alone speak well of another woman

349
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,520
in front of him.

350
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,320
Are you really Hua Qian?

351
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,680
What the hell.

352
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,520
I can't have peace even in my dream.

353
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,120
Do I look that bad?

354
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,320
I had a nightmare.

355
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,760
That's why I said something like that.

356
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,520
Please forgive me, Lord.

357
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,640
Don't worry about it.

358
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,160
My mother heard you had a coma for five days

359
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,480
and was very worried

360
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,200
so she wanted Physician Wu to see you.

361
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,240
My senior isn't here.

362
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,760
But to reassure my mother

363
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,280
I decided to come in with the physician.

364
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,600
Five days?

365
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,920
Please reach out your hand, Mistress.

366
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,880
Lord, Mistress is fine now.

367
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,080
But the wound was severe

368
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,400
and was very close to her heart.

369
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,560
so she might have frequent chest pain.

370
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,920
If she was doing well

371
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,440
why did she remain in a coma for so long?

372
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,440
I smelled...

373
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,200
Did you use some sleep-aiding fragrance?

374
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Right.

375
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,120
I'm afraid of pain

376
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,320
so I used some fragrances.

377
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,280
With all due respect

378
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,880
using fragrances isn't always good for health

379
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,360
and there should be a limit.

380
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,200
You fell into a coma.

381
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,920
I think it was due to the dose of fragrance.

382
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,680
It might cause weakness

383
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,920
and damage to the brain.

384
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,760
Please use them with caution, Mistress.

385
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,960
Thank you for your reminder.

386
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,440
I'll be careful with it.

387
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,920
I've never heard

388
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,720
of this way to relieve pain.

389
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,240
I'm too weak to withstand the pain

390
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,160
so I came up with such a bad idea.

391
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,000
You can leave now.

392
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
Yes, Lord.

393
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,880
Are you going to drive me away?

394
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
No, I'm not.

395
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
Lord.

396
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,480
Actually...

397
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,080
something still puzzles me

398
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,120
so I want to ask you about it.

399
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,040
Lord, I just woke up

400
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,920
and my mind is still foggy.

401
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Shall we talk another...

402
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,200
It's a simple question.

403
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,480
On the ancestral worship day

404
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,680
when the assassins attacked

405
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,320
all the other ladies and girls panicked

406
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,840
except you.

407
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,160
You looked very calm.

408
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,560
Master was by my side

409
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,360
and I trust him

410
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,120
so I didn't panic.

411
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,960
But I saw that you didn't flinch

412
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,480
when you confronted an assassin

413
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,240
and that you even stopped him.

414
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,280
I just had a near-death experience.

415
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm still frightened

416
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,080
and my mind feels foggy.

417
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,120
Please just get to the point.

418
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,560
Are you suspecting

419
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,360
that the assassins are linked with my family?

420
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,960
You're overthinking it.

421
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,320
It was just a casual question.

422
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
Qianzhi.

423
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,840
Be careful.

424
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,840
Lord, although I'm just a woman

425
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,920
I know a person has only one life.

426
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,320
Even if I had evil intentions

427
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,920
I wouldn't risk my life.

428
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,640
What do you mean?

429
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,880
You brought the physician with you today.

430
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,160
Wasn't it because you wanted to check

431
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,720
whether my injury was real?

432
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,280
<i>Bonus footage</i>

433
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,280
How's the investigation?

434
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,880
The assassination happened so suddenly

435
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,000
and the men behind it acted furtively

436
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,040
without leaving any clues.

437
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,000
I think it was planned long ago

438
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,200
and not done on a whim.

439
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,600
There weren't many assassins

440
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,280
so it didn't cause a big disturbance.

441
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,400
Only a few families were wounded.

442
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,440
How's the situation at Zhong Residence?

443
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,920
Master wasn't injured

444
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
and neither were his guards.

445
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,080
What about her?

446
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,280
Mistress got injured and is unconscious

447
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,960
but I don't have the details.

448
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,720
Get a physician and come with me.

449
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,960
Lord, Her Highness is still

450
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,240
waiting for the news.

451
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,400
Perhaps you should go reassure her first?

452
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
All right.

453
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,120
Keep an eye on her.

454
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
Yes, Lord.
