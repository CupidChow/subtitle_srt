<i>Episode 13</i>

3
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,280
Try this.

4
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,200
I've had enough. You should have some too.

5
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Mistress

6
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
something happened to Young Master Hua.

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
I ate too much.

8
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,120
Excuse me for one second.

9
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,800
Why is she leaving?

10
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,440
It's all right. You ladies carry on.

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,680
Stay here and keep an eye on things.

12
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,600
—Why did she leave? —What happened?

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,800
It's nothing. Carry on eating and drinking.

14
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,080
Bring us another bottle of wine.

15
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,280
Let's carry on.

16
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
What did my brother do this time?

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,440
Young Master Hua is now

18
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,800
in Concubine Mu's room.

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
What does that mean?

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't know the details.

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,880
A servant came to report

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,240
that Young Master Hua broke into

23
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Concubine Mu's room.

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,840
Brother... wake up.

25
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,320
Go take a look at Mu Yao.

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,240
Brother...

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,440
Concubine Mu.

28
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
Brother...

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Wake up.

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
Brother!

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Qian.

32
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Blood.

33
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
What happened?

34
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
Yao.

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
Are you all right?

36
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,840
Master.

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm fine.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,760
Luckily, Zisu came in just in time

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,400
but...

40
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,440
I accidentally hurt Young Master Hua.

41
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,640
—Master.                          —Master...

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,720
Calm down and listen to me.

43
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,480
Mistress...

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Mistress!

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,600
Mistress, are you all right?

46
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
Let me look at your hand.

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,600
Your hand is bleeding.

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Hua Rongzhou.

49
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,480
—Master.                          —Get back!

50
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,720
Master, listen to me.

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,600
Please calm down. Let's find out more

52
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,440
before you do something you can't undo.

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Get out of the way.

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Master, you can't kill him yet.

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,560
Shall we find out what exactly happened

56
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,720
before punishing him?

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,400
Find out what happened?

58
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,360
Don't you know your brother well?

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,720
No wonder you asked Her Highness

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,480
to have me take Mu Yao as my concubine.

61
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
Now, it seems that

62
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,320
you and your brother had it planned all along!

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,600
I know I have lied to you many times

64
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
so I don't blame you for not trusting me now.

65
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,240
But these are two separate matters.

66
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,520
—Master, calm down and...  —I won't kill him

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,760
but I'll cripple his arms

68
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
to let him learn to keep his hands to himself!

69
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,680
Qian...

70
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,400
Save me, Qian.

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,640
Save me, Qian.

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
Qian.

73
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,200
You won't get out of my way?

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,240
Qian.

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,280
Qian...

76
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Calm down, Senior.

77
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,680
You look like you want to fight me too.

78
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
What do you mean, Lord?

79
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,000
Are you standing up for this useless man?

80
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,240
Hua Shen is the only son of Butler Hua.

81
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
I know how you feel, Senior.

82
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,560
But you must act rationally.

83
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,880
He was disrespectful to my woman today.

84
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,760
Do you mean he can escape responsibility

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,040
because of who he is?

86
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,920
I'm not defending him.

87
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,160
In my opinion, it's better

88
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
to put him in prison first

89
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,720
and wait for Magistrate Wang to investigate.

90
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,960
You have more important things to do today.

91
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
I don't think

92
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Magistrate Wang would shield Hua Shen

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,640
with you watching him.

94
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,520
He is getting off easy.

95
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,560
What are you going to do?

96
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,760
Where are you taking me?

97
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,520
Help me, Qian...

98
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
Thank you for your help, Lord.

99
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Go back to your compound

100
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,760
and have the wound treated.

101
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,840
But there are many people in the front yard.

102
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040
Leave it to me.

103
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,760
Rest assured and go back.

104
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,920
Farewell, Lord.

105
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
Mistress.

106
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,240
Mistress.

107
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Are you all right?

108
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,880
I'm fine.

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm sorry.

110
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,560
Mistress, I'm sorry.

111
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,920
You don't have to apologise.

112
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,360
You did well. I should thank you.

113
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,720
You don't sound weak

114
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,560
What a relief.

115
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,800
Go see a physician later.

116
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,560
Be careful.

117
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Let me help you.

118
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,360
Bring this to her.

119
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
Hang in there, Mistress.

120
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
It hurts too much.

121
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,360
Hang in there. It's almost done.

122
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,800
Greetings, Lord.

123
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
—Lord.                                —Lord.

124
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Let me do it.

125
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,440
Lord, why are you...

126
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,040
Don't worry. The guests are all taken care of

127
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
and they're leaving as we speak.

128
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,920
Lord, let Yinxing do it.

129
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,240
You don't trust me to do a good job?

130
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,440
It's not that.

131
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,800
It seems inappropriate to let you do it.

132
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,040
Lord, how about knocking me unconscious

133
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
before treating my wound?

134
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,840
Your pain tolerance is low.

135
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,400
Why did you shield Hua Shen?

136
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,640
He is my brother after all.

137
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,120
Aren't you fast? I just...

138
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,080
I have bought you some time

139
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,880
but, as you know, my senior needs an answer.

140
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,000
Master was so angry today.

141
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,920
Aren't you angry, Lord?

142
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,880
Why would I be angry?

143
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,640
Lord, why did you help me?

144
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,680
<i>Didn't you try to test me?</i>

145
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,600
You kept my secret...

146
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,320
to yourself.

147
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,920
We are on the same team now.

148
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,800
<i>Is he so bored that</i>

149
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,520
<i>he has to tell someone who he admires?</i>

150
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,480
All right. I'm leaving.

151
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,560
Mistress.

152
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,080
When I went to the physician for medicine

153
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,920
I saw Guard Hua take a bottle of medicine

154
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,600
and rushed out in a hurry.

155
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,960
I said hello, but he didn't even notice me.

156
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,960
I wonder how his injury is.

157
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,040
When I came back

158
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,600
I saw him standing at the door.

159
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,880
Is he injured too?

160
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,040
I don't know.

161
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,640
I didn't take a close look.

162
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000
He fell on a chair

163
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,480
and must have got some scratches.

164
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Cuizhu.

165
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,600
Go check on Huang Rongzhou on my behalf.

166
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,800
What's wrong with her?

167
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,600
She was always glad

168
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,320
to have a chance to get close to him.

169
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,320
But she's not today.

170
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,640
Maybe she's worried about him.

171
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,640
Go put away the medicine.

172
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,480
Mistress, do you feel

173
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,640
that Lord treats you differently?

174
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,000
Of course, he treats me differently.

175
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,760
What are you going to do about it, Mistress?

176
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
You don't understand.

177
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,520
He treats me that way

178
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,800
because I know his secret.

179
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
His secret?

180
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,720
What are you referring to?

181
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,720
It's a secret. How can I tell you?

182
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,680
Qian.

183
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,480
What did Master say?

184
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,240
I haven't had time to see Master.

185
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,680
I asked your father about it last night.

186
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,680
He said Master had your brother

187
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,960
sent to the <i>yamen</i>

188
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,920
for that...

189
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,640
that disgraceful act.

190
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,520
He can't interfere

191
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,960
in case the incident blows up.

192
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,040
So we need your help to find out more.

193
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,040
—I have a plan.     —That's not good enough.

194
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,400
Your brother has never suffered.

195
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,040
How can he survive in prison?

196
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,640
How can he make it through?

197
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,440
I won't stand by and do nothing

198
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,080
but I have to get to the bottom of this

199
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,280
before I come up with a solution.

200
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,760
I wasn't there

201
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,120
when he was taken away yesterday.

202
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,480
Why didn't you stop them?

203
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,880
He is your only brother.

204
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,680
When I was pregnant with you

205
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,480
he touched my belly every day

206
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
and said that he would protect you

207
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,760
after you were born.

208
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,120
Now that he is in trouble

209
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,400
and you're just sitting here?

210
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,760
Mother, don't worry.

211
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,520
If my brother is really wronged

212
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
I won't stand by and do nothing.

213
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,680
You haven't been to the prison.

214
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,640
How would you know who set him up?

215
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,000
I went to Magistrate Wang for help

216
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,480
but he didn't let me in.

217
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,400
He said I could only visit him a few days later.

218
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,040
A few days later?

219
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,920
Your brother won't be able to survive prison.

220
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,640
He will be miserable.

221
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,520
It happened in this house

222
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,240
and you're Master's wife.

223
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I don't think

224
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
the magistrate will stop you from going in.

225
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,600
My brother was just taken away

226
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,080
and I haven't even found out

227
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,560
what exactly happened yesterday.

228
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,280
What's the use of me going to the prison now?

229
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,840
Then, what can you do sitting here?

230
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I know

231
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,640
you always think your brother is a disgrace

232
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,400
and you're not the one suffering in prison

233
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,120
so it's no wonder you're not anxious.

234
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,320
I think he's a disgrace?

235
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,480
More like his improper behaviour

236
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,640
is bringing us disgrace.

237
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
It's true I haven't visited him

238
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,760
but what's the use of being anxious?

239
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,000
Making a big fuss

240
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,080
before we get to the bottom of the matter

241
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,440
will only make us vulnerable.

242
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,320
Mother, how can you be sure he's innocent?

243
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,520
It's possible that he deserves

244
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,760
his current situation.

245
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,600
Ever since you stepped in here

246
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,960
you couldn't stop talking about

247
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,760
how my brother would suffer in prison.

248
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,040
Have you noticed my injured hand

249
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,400
and asked me about it?

250
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
—I...                           —Never mind.

251
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,080
You've always favour my brother

252
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
and I'm used to it.

253
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,800
If you don't get a favourable answer from me

254
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,560
I guess you won't let me go easily.

255
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,840
Let's go to the prison right now.

256
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,720
Try and find out who set your brother up.

257
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,600
Madam, you made some hurtful remarks.

258
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,040
I'm too worried to choose my words carefully.

259
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,680
Let's get Shen out of prison first.

260
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,560
<i>Huangcheng Magistery</i>

261
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,560
Here we are.

262
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,560
Qian...

263
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,000
Qian, I've been waiting for you

264
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,760
for a day and a night.

265
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,240
Don't you understand the situation you're in?

266
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,160
I went to great lengths to get in here.

267
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,680
Our mother is refused entry.

268
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,160
Are you here to take me out? Are you?

269
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
Brother, it's not that easy.

270
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,320
I have told you many times.

271
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
Mu Yao is not someone you can touch.

272
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,480
Why didn't you listen to me?

273
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,720
I bear in mind everything you said.

274
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,200
I won't touch anyone you say I can't.

275
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,880
Why don't you believe me?

276
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,720
Then what happened yesterday?

277
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,120
Why did you end up in Mu Yao's room

278
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,560
with your clothes in disarray?

279
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,760
I-I-I really have no idea.

280
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,200
I had a drop too much yesterday.

281
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,600
I was trying to sober up in the backyard.

282
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,720
One of your maids came to remind me

283
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
to stay put.

284
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
So I stayed put in that pavilion.

285
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
Then what?

286
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,960
Later on, I...

287
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,640
It seems that you want to stay here

288
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,760
for a few more days.

289
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,640
I'll tell you...

290
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,520
I saw a pretty maid in the back garden

291
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,680
and she seduced me.

292
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,120
I was drunk so I followed her

293
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,080
into a compound.

294
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,640
Soon after that, I was knocked unconscious.

295
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,320
When I woke up, I saw you in front of me.

296
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,200
I was too scared to speak. I...

297
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Are you sure that maid seduced you?

298
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,000
She kept peeking at me.

299
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,880
Didn't it mean she was into me?

300
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,040
You think too highly of yourself!

301
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
You had too much to drink

302
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
and acted on your  carnal desire.

303
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,280
Yet, you are making excuses for yourself.

304
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,680
No one can control himself when he's drunk.

305
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
I guess my judgment

306
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,080
was clouded by too much alcohol

307
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,280
so I thought she was interested in me

308
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,400
and inadvertently broke into

309
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
someone's compound

310
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,080
and was seen as a lecher.

311
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,360
Qian, it wasn't my fault.

312
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,240
You said this with so much confidence

313
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,400
It seems to me you're fine

314
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,600
even though our mother suggested otherwise.

315
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,840
In that case

316
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,400
stay here and repent for a few more days.

317
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,800
Qian...

318
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,400
Save me, Qian.

319
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,960
This place is filthy and stinks to high heaven.

320
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,400
There are even rats.

321
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,800
And the prison guards abused me.

322
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,040
I don't think I can survive a few more days.

323
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,520
Qian...

324
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,680
Really?

325
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,400
The wound on your head

326
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,720
has been well treated.

327
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,240
It doesn't look like you have been tortured.

328
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,240
—I...             —Learn a lesson from this.

329
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,320
Qian!

330
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,600
Qian...

331
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,000
Qian!

332
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,680
Qian...

333
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,360
How is your brother?

334
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,640
I've warned him countless times

335
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,720
but his carnal desires

336
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,960
always get the better of him.

337
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
This time

338
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,760
h-h-he even did it at your residence.

339
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,360
He really deserves a beating.

340
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,280
Do you also think

341
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,520
he did it?

342
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,480
Qian.

343
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,360
Your brother...

344
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,960
is indeed a bit licentious

345
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
but he did that

346
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,720
because he was drunk.

347
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,720
He's my only son

348
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,560
and you only have one brother.

349
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,960
Even if you are angry with me

350
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,960
you can't leave him in the lurch.

351
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,880
My dear girl...

352
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,880
Why would I be angry?

353
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,440
I don't think he did it.

354
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
Really?

355
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,880
Greetings, Mistress.

356
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
You're my maid. Spare the formalities.

357
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,560
I have a few questions for you.

358
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,000
Did you see anything strange

359
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,560
the day you went to look for my brother?

360
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,080
When I went to the backyard

361
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Young Master Hua was sitting alone

362
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
in the pavilion.

363
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,640
He told me his servant went to

364
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,920
get him hangover soup.

365
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
What did he say

366
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
after you sent him my message?

367
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,600
He said he had too much to drink

368
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,640
and that he wanted to get some rest there.

369
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,920
He asked me to tell Mrs Hua

370
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,640
to come to the pavilion to look for him

371
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
after the banquet was over.

372
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,680
Did you tell anyone he was in the pavilion?

373
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
No, I didn't.

374
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,640
Did you meet anyone on the way back?

375
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,880
I met no one.

376
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,440
Mistress.

377
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,000
Did I do something wrong?

378
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
It has nothing to do with you.

379
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Don't overthink it. Go get some rest.

380
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,520
Mistress, what did Cuizhu do?

381
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,360
Nothing. I was just making sure

382
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
to make myself feel at ease.

383
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,680
Which compound is Mu Yao living in now?

384
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,160
The same compound as before

385
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,520
but it has been refurbished.

386
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,480
Good.

387
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Mistress.

388
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,760
Master was angry that day

389
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,440
so he went a bit too far.

390
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,040
You must have been hurt badly.

391
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,400
You don't have to stand guard.

392
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,720
Go back to your room and rest.

393
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
I'm fine.

394
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,280
What are you doing?

395
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,960
Mistress.

396
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
Master ordered us to guard

397
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,760
Concubine Mu's compound.

398
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,640
No one is allowed in.

399
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
You...

400
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,680
Tell Mu Yao I'm here. She'll let me in.

401
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
Please, Mistress.

402
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,720
Wait outside.

403
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Yes, Mistress.

404
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,120
You've been waiting for me, haven't you?

405
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,240
If you're here to plead for Hua Shen

406
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,080
shouldn't you show humility?

407
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,280
My brother didn't do anything wrong.

408
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,800
Why would I intercede for him?

409
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,720
Mu Yao, there are only the two of us now.

410
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,720
Let's cut to the chase.

411
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,480
I thought

412
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,600
you wouldn't resort to such an underhand mean

413
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,840
after you had been framed before.

414
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
I realised I was wrong.

415
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,840
You are really disappointing.

416
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,360
I didn't intend to come here

417
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,360
but I thought I should play my part

418
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,520
in your charade

419
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,840
so your hard work doesn't go to waste.

420
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,280
I told you I would no longer compete with you

421
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,520
for Zhong Yelan

422
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,440
but you just won't believe me.

423
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,560
And you even resorted to an underhand mean

424
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,280
and used him to deal with me.

425
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,280
You think I'm doing it for him?

426
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,960
What else could it be?

427
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,800
You set up Hua Shen.

428
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,000
I won't stand by and do nothing this time.

429
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,120
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

430
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
I had put up with you

431
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,760
because I regretted what I did to you.

432
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,240
But now, you implicated an innocent man

433
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,960
by resorting to an underhand mean.

434
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,280
I won't be merciful anymore.

435
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,040
Every injustice has its perpetrator.

436
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
Hua Qian.

437
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,960
To think you have the nerve to say that.

438
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,000
Why can't I say that?

439
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,760
Master.

440
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,600
Magistrate Wang sent some men again.

441
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,200
It concerns the case of Hua Shen.

442
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,720
They want to ask Concubine Mu a few questions.

443
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,680
Should I let them wait outside like before?

444
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,440
Let them wait.

445
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
Yes, Master.

446
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Wait.

447
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,920
Let me ask first.

448
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,640
Your family are all selfish people

449
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,920
who can't tell right from wrong.

450
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,840
You said Hua Shen didn't do anything wrong?

451
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,000
You set up the banquet incident, didn't you?

452
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,040
My brother has questionable morals

453
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,160
but he has never had

454
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,320
any ill intentions towards you.

455
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Really?

456
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,520
Although I can't vouch for everything else

457
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,360
I can say that he has never lied to me.

458
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,400
I've warned him repeatedly

459
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,560
and he always respects my requests.

460
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,800
Besides, you used to be...

461
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,280
I've known you for a long time.

462
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,320
You're someone who doesn't easily shed tears.

463
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,360
That day you huddled in the corner

464
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,800
trembling in fear.

465
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,960
That was merely an act.

466
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,800
Your intention is obvious.

467
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
You're right.

468
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,280
I set him up.

469
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,920
Hua Shen didn't touch me at all.

470
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,760
I heard a maid died

471
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,280
in Hua Residence a few days ago

472
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,400
but Young Master Hua showed up at the banquet

473
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,000
with no indication of any consequences.

474
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,880
Butler Hua acts as your family's shield.

475
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,440
It's no wonder none of you

476
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,760
cares about a maid's life.

477
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
What are you trying to say?

478
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,880
The maid who committed suicide

479
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,040
was Linglong.

480
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,640
Your father told us to buy these.

481
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,480
You have reached the age of marriage

482
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,480
so you should doll yourself up.

483
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,920
Look at the jewellery.

484
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
How beautiful.

485
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,560
You like it?

486
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,800
I'll give it to you.

487
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,520
I'm a maid.

488
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,640
How can I wear such a precious thing?

489
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,640
Why not?

490
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,760
This one.

491
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,520
It's inappropriate.

492
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,720
Wear it.

493
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,960
It looks good on you.

494
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,600
You said that I've reached the age of marriage

495
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,640
but you're a year older than me.

496
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,360
This shall be your dowry.

497
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,280
Dowry?

498
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,560
You...

499
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

500
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,880
Don't run.

501
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,040
Linglong lost her parents when she was a child

502
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,080
and grew up with me in the north.

503
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,480
You remember her, don't you?

504
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,680
There are prettier ones.

505
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,920
Come on. Cheers.

506
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,360
That maid was once a criminal.

507
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,800
She was an orphan

508
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,000
and had no family.

509
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,640
My father was falsely accused of

510
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,720
stealing property in his custody

511
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,120
and was exiled.

512
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,360
All the servants in our residence

513
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,600
were sold away.

514
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
They remained as slaves

515
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,880
no matter where they were sold.

516
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,360
At first, I thought so too.

517
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,920
But...

518
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,640
why did it have to be Hua Shen

519
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,800
who bought her?

520
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
How dare you!

521
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
How dare you!

522
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,320
—You'll get it from me!      —Brother Hua...

523
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
—You'll get it from me!      —Brother Hua...

524
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Stop...

525
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
I pity her.

526
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,440
What an ungrateful thing.

527
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,560
You should thank your lucky star

528
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,720
my friend fancies you.

529
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,160
How dare you refuse

530
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,440
and even hit Huang?

531
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,360
Who do you think you are?

532
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,640
I was wrong.

533
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,600
Please forgive me, my dear husband.

534
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,800
You're my concubine?

535
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,520
My concubine?

536
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,320
I don't consider you my concubine.

537
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,280
You are a lowly slave

538
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,560
and I bought you!

539
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,120
You have a temper, huh?

540
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,320
Fine. I'm a kind man

541
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
so I'll let it slide this time.

542
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,920
Now, go pack your things

543
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,560
and leave with Mr Wang.

544
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
Do you hear me?

545
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,320
My dear husband...

546
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,280
What do you mean?

547
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,280
He means you're mine from now on.

548
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Exactly.

549
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,280
My dear husband.

550
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,400
A woman cannot serve two husbands.

551
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,840
How can you give me away?

552
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
Who do you think you are?

553
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,240
You're just a lowly maid!

554
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,400
I can give you to anyone!

555
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,720
Don't worry.

556
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
My residence is as good as his house.

557
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,520
I will treat you well.

558
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,240
If you don't want to, that's fine.

559
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,560
Get this. I'll sell you to a whorehouse!

560
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,760
Do you want me to do that?

561
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Let's go.

562
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,720
Even though I am a slave

563
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,640
I cannot bear such humiliation!

564
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,440
Concubine Linglong...

565
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,360
Concubine Linglong!

566
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,800
Concubine Linglong!

567
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,480
So...

568
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,080
Hua Qian

569
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,040
what gives you the confidence

570
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,360
to say that Hua Shen is innocent?

571
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,600
The lowly maid

572
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,040
who died in Hua Residence

573
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,560
was someone I saw as my sister.

574
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,440
—I...                                 —What?

575
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,320
What are you trying to say?

576
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Hua Qian.

577
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,560
I gave you a chance. I gave you time.

578
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,040
But what did you do?

579
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,360
As you know

580
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,000
Linglong and I were very close.

581
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,400
Do you think you had made it up to me

582
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,040
by making me Zhong Yelan's concubine?

583
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,240
No. I didn't know that the maid was Linglong

584
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,600
and I begged Her Highness just to...

585
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,880
You thought she was an ordinary maid

586
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,360
so you stood by

587
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,280
and left Hua Shen to your father?

588
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,520
You knew Butler Hua was going to shield him

589
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,920
yet you still did what you did.

590
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,400
That's because in your eyes

591
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:11,840
an insignificant maid's life is worthless.

592
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,000
You told me you wouldn't hurt me again

593
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,800
and I almost believed you.

594
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,880
I wanted to believe that

595
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,880
you might not be involved in my family's case.

596
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,520
But what happened to Linglong

597
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,720
made me realise that I could never forgive you.

598
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,720
Numerous people have experienced hardships

599
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,360
at the hands of the Hua family

600
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,840
and it has gone unnoticed.

601
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,400
You are a member of the Hua family.

602
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,800
That makes you uncaring and selfish too.

603
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,040
You can pretend you don't know

604
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,120
because you don't see it

605
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,880
but I can't.

606
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,040
That's the reason why you set him up?

607
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,400
To avenge Linglong?

608
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,760
Since you didn't punish him

609
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,840
I made him get what he deserves.

610
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,240
You don't care about a maid's life.

611
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,040
What about me, Zhong Yelan's concubine?

612
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,360
Can it make him pay a heavy price?

613
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,040
By resorting to this?

614
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,880
Making use of the man who loves you?

615
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,920
Why can't I do that?

616
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,320
Do you mean we should accept any evil deeds

617
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
committed by the Hua family

618
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,440
without any resistance?

619
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,040
To me

620
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,360
as long as it is against your family

621
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,400
it's just a means to an end.

622
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
All right.

623
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,160
I understood.

624
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,520
Mistress.

625
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,160
Mistress, what's the matter?

626
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Is it...

627
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
What are you doing here?

628
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,360
From now on, without my permission

629
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,920
you're not allowed to step into Yao's compound.

630
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,560
If Lord hadn't stopped you that day

631
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,080
would your sword have fallen on me?

632
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,400
It would, right?

633
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Zhong Yelan.

634
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,040
Is the jade pendant that important?

635
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,720
Does it matter so much who the person

636
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,120
who stood with you in the temple was

637
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,600
when you were a child?

638
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,360
Is it possible to develop romantic feelings

639
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
solely by reminiscing about someone

640
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,920
to whom you gave a jade pendant?

641
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,760
Why are you saying this now?

642
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,400
I just wonder

643
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,880
if it's true that a liar

644
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,760
can never gain others' trust

645
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,560
and set things right.

646
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,520
And even at the cost of my life

647
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,920
I couldn't earn time to defend myself

648
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,160
when you drew your sword at me.

649
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,480
Are you displaying vulnerability

650
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,240
to manipulate me to let Hua Shen go free?

651
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,320
So be it...

652
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,280
if that is what you think of me.

653
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Mistress.

654
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,040
<i>He likes Qianzhi.</i>

655
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,520
What are you going to do with Hua Shen?

656
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,320
I'll leave it to you, Master.

657
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,080
Master.

658
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,480
Master, Magistrate Wang's men haven't left yet.

659
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,080
What should I say to them this time?

660
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,800
Find an excuse and send them away.

661
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Yes, Master.

662
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
<i>Bonus footage</i>

663
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,120
You seem to have serious internal injuries.

664
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,840
Why do you only want Jindao Powder?

665
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,960
Let me examine you.

666
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,440
Don't bother. Just give me Jindao powder.

667
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,520
Please hurry.

668
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,640
But you don't seem to have sustained

669
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,920
superficial wounds.

670
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,880
Jindao Powder is only good for external wounds.

671
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Haven't you found it yet?

672
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,960
I'm looking for it.

673
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,600
I got it. Where are you hurt?

674
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,960
Let me treat the wound for you.

675
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,480
Why are you in such a hurry?

676
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,160
Physician, do you have Jindao Powder?

677
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,760
What happened? Who got hurt?

678
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,600
Why does everyone want Jindao Powder?

679
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,320
Please give it to me. It's an emergency.
