1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,560
<i>Episode 22</i>

3
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,080
Miss Hua, what brought you here today?

4
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,200
I thought about your suggestion, Miss Meng.

5
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,720
It seemed like a good idea

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,000
so I came here to discuss it in detail.

7
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
Sister Hua, you're indeed a smart girl.

8
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,320
It's just that I know nothing

9
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,440
about Zhong's Garden.

10
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,560
I'm afraid I won't be of any help

11
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
to you, Miss Meng.

12
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,320
I have lived here for many years.

13
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,400
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

14
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
If you agree to cooperate with me

15
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,240
I will definitely tell you everything.

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,200
In that case...

17
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,000
do you know what Lord likes?

18
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,880
You've asked the right person.

19
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,360
Lord has a sweet tooth.

20
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,120
You can't go wrong

21
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,720
if you cater to his pleasure.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Sweets? But there are so many choices.

23
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
Remember the time

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
when Her Highness asked you

25
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,200
to deliver something to Lord.

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
It must have taken time and effort

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,960
to deliver lychees to Huangcheng

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,520
during this season.

29
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,680
Well, the Queen Mother dotes on you

30
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,840
Your Highness.

31
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,640
Not me.

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,600
It's because her grandson loves lychee.

33
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Lord loves lychees

34
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,360
and also lychee honey...

35
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,240
Lord never shows his emotions.

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,120
I only found out about it after living

37
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,240
in Zhong's Garden for a while.

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,240
Sister Hua, please keep it to yourself.

39
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,200
I can see that Lord treats you differently.

40
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,520
If you move into Zhong's Garden

41
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,120
like me someday

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,160
don't forget me.

43
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Where are your manners?

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
What's the rush?

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,720
Lord just had a meeting with the butlers.

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,920
Step out and come back later.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,440
But Lord told me to inform him immediately

48
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,160
if Miss Hua comes to Zhong's Garden.

49
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,280
—She's here?                     —Yes, Lord.

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Miss Hua is now in Miss Meng's compound.

51
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,920
Greetings, Lord.

52
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,480
Lord, did you just have a meeting

53
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
with the butlers?

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,560
Yes. And I'm here for Hua Qian.

55
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,920
We have something important to discuss.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Lord, you came just in time.

57
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Sister Hua and I are wrapping up

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
our conversation.

59
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,400
Why are you visiting Meng Yifei

60
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,640
so frequently these days?

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
Lord, it seems like you don't want me

62
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,920
to hang out with Meng Yifei.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,520
This is the second time you came to interrupt us.

64
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,240
Why is that?

65
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,600
You seldom come here, but every time you come

66
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,240
you visit either my mother or Meng Yifei.

67
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,960
It's fine if you visit my mother

68
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,520
but why does Meng Yifei see you

69
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
more often than I do?

70
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,480
Why didn't you bring your guard

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,880
to Zhong's Garden today?

72
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,160
It's just a visit to Zhong's Garden.

73
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't need so many servants around me.

74
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,200
Really?

75
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,440
I heard that you had been very close

76
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,160
to your guard in the past few days.

77
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,040
I remember you left me in a hurry

78
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,840
after you learned that he was injured.

79
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
I thought he was more than

80
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,560
just a servant to you.

81
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,520
Hua Rongzhou is my guard.

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,880
He is loyal to me.

83
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,320
He was injured because of me.

84
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,200
Of course, I had to show concern for him.

85
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,920
Is he just a guard?

86
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,520
Lord, do you like lychee honey?

87
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
Are you asking me about my preferences?

88
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,720
Few people know this.

89
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,760
Although I have a sweet tooth

90
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,080
I must avoid honey.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,680
I ate it by mistake when I was a child

92
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,880
and it almost killed me.

93
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,920
The physician said I was allergic to honey.

94
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,080
This concerns my safety.

95
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,200
Fearing that someone would poison me

96
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,760
my mother got rid of all the servants

97
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,240
who knew about this

98
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
I don't mind telling you

99
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,360
but do keep it to yourself.

100
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,720
So, there's more to it than that.

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,320
You can ask me directly

102
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
if you want to know anything in the future.

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
Lord, will you tell me everything?

104
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
Have you found the assassin

105
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
who killed my brother?

106
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,640
Qian.

107
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,720
Just leave this to me.

108
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,160
I promise. I won't let the mastermind off

109
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,200
so you don't have to worry so much.

110
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,800
Leave everything to me.

111
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
You need not do anything.

112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,840
But...

113
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,480
if I knew who the mastermind were

114
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,360
I would deal with the matter myself.

115
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Do as you please.

116
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,720
Roasted chestnuts! Delicious chestnuts!

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,040
Freshly roasted chestnuts!

118
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,280
Come and try some!

119
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Roasted chestnuts!

120
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,160
—Do you want some chestnuts?           —Yes.

121
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,040
Come and try some! Roasted chestnuts!

122
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,160
Big and sweet roasted chestnuts!

123
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,840
Miss, buy some roasted chestnuts.

124
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,240
A bag of roasted chestnuts, please.

125
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,400
Sure!

126
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,480
—Here you are.                        —Here!

127
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Thank you.

128
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,840
Here. It's all yours.

129
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,960
Roasted chestnuts!

130
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
Come and try some. Roasted chestnuts!

131
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Freshly made.

132
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,480
Sweet and delicious roasted chestnuts.

133
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Come and try some!

134
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
It's so sweet.

135
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,840
—Why are you not eating...            —Qian!

136
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,920
It's you! The murderer!

137
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,520
It really is you, you damn murderer!

138
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,200
I didn't expect to see you here.

139
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,400
There is justice in this world!

140
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,760
My poor dead father-in-law...

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,600
Thank goodness!

142
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
Madam, let's talk it over calmly.

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
He is my guard.

144
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,120
If you slander an innocent man

145
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
I can report to the authorities

146
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
and have you arrested.

147
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,920
—You...                            —I swear.

148
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,200
I didn't slander him.

149
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,720
If it's not true...

150
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,600
My dear, take a look.

151
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,320
Isn't he that little bastard?

152
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,840
He killed your father.

153
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
I can recognise him even if he turns into ashes.

154
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,800
That's right! He killed my father.

155
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,800
Murderer! He's a murderer!

156
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,480
Everyone, he's a murderer!

157
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,880
I am the daughter-in-law of Master Li

158
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,320
a rich merchant in a border town.

159
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,560
My father-in-law took pity on this little bastard

160
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,520
and brought him on as a servant.

161
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,640
But this wretched kid was ungrateful.

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,360
He killed my father-in-law, took some money

163
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,320
and escaped.

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,680
This happened seven years ago.

165
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,400
Thank goodness there's justice in this world.

166
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,800
We meet him here again.

167
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,040
Everyone!

168
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,520
Please report to the authorities

169
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,000
and have him arrested!

170
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,280
Arrest him!

171
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,680
You said it had been seven years

172
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,640
so you might have mistaken him for someone.

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,640
You can't slander someone here

174
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,480
without any evidence.

175
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,840
I've mistaken him for someone?

176
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,920
Look at his evil face.

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,360
There's no mistake!

178
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,040
We bought him due to his good looks

179
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,000
but never did we expect that

180
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,680
we had invited trouble.

181
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,000
He's not the only good-looking man

182
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,080
in this world.

183
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,640
Miss, you are deceived by this murderer

184
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,760
because of your kindness.

185
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,240
Don't worry. I'm here

186
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,480
and I won't let you get slandered.

187
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
What if it isn't slander?

188
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,880
Miss.

189
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,880
I told you before. I have killed someone.

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You...

191
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,520
Did you hear what he said, everyone?

192
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,800
Did you hear?

193
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,800
He has confessed to the murder.

194
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,760
—Send him to the authorities! —How dare you!

195
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,280
No one can arrest my guard.

196
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,320
You're shielding a murderer!

197
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,440
Magistrate Wang is here...

198
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,440
—Make way!         —Magistrate Wang is here.

199
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,720
Magistrate!

200
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,160
Magistrate!

201
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,040
Magistrate, please grant us justice.

202
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,520
That man killed my father-in-law.

203
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,200
Quickly arrest him before he runs away.

204
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,480
I am the daughter-in-law of Master Li

205
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,760
a rich merchant in a border town.

206
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,440
My father-in-law took pity on him

207
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
brought him on as a servant.

208
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,240
But this wretched kid killed my father-in-law

209
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,720
while we were away.

210
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,280
He then took some money and escaped.

211
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,800
He's gone scot-free for seven years.

212
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,480
Magistrate, it's all true!

213
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,240
Magistrate, please grant us justice.

214
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,920
Move! Don't crowd around here.

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,160
Miss Hua.

216
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,320
This lady here stopped me to hear her complaint.

217
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,240
—Just go.               —I can't ignore her.

218
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,840
Miss Hua, please step aside.

219
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,480
I will take him back for investigation.

220
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,920
This incident has just happened

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,920
and here you already are, Magistrate Wang.

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,960
Looks like nothing in Huangcheng

223
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,000
escapes your eyes.

224
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,760
You should be commended

225
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,560
for your prompt action.

226
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,920
I happened to pass by

227
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,160
and heard about a murder case

228
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,520
so I rushed over.

229
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,360
Miss Hua, I hope you can be cooperative.

230
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,680
Be cooperative?

231
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,960
Someone has slandered

232
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,480
a member of the Hua family.

233
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,920
Are you saying I can only stand by and watch you

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,320
arrest my guard?

235
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,440
Of course not...

236
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,480
Miss Hua, I won't make a ruling

237
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,040
before an investigation.

238
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,520
Since an investigation is required

239
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,000
why don't you arrest him

240
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
when the investigation is complete?

241
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,080
You can't make an arrest based on a few words.

242
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
Don't tell me you're afraid that

243
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,640
that the Hua family will cover up for him

244
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,480
and help him escape?

245
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,080
Chen Yuan did a good job.

246
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,720
Qian.

247
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Come here, Qian.

248
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,560
Someone tried to set me up. I can't...

249
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,160
Do you really know the man you're protecting?

250
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,680
Be good and follow me.

251
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,400
Hua Rongzhou is wronged.

252
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,600
Wronged? His surname is not even Hua.

253
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,880
Hua Rongzhou...

254
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's too crowded here.

255
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,400
Come with me and I will tell you everything.

256
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,640
What will Magistrate Wang do to Hua Rongzhou?

257
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
I don't want to hear you

258
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
worrying about him anymore.

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,080
—Lord.                   —This is Lin Jiang.

260
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,160
He's my chief guard.

261
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,560
He normally works in the shadows.

262
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,520
Hold on, Mistress.

263
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,120
Mistress, my brother was rude to you.

264
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,080
Allow me to apologise on his behalf.

265
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,040
Do you have a brother?

266
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,880
Miss Hua, are you referring to Chen Yuan?

267
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,280
You have also met him before.

268
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
He is my subordinate.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Qian.

270
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
It wasn't my intention to sound you out

271
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,400
at the tea house that day.

272
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,560
Your brother was making a scene

273
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,440
so I told them to help the <i>pipa</i> musician.

274
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,880
I didn't expect you to show up.

275
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,600
What do you want to say about Hua Rongzhou?

276
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,960
Miss Hua, you will understand

277
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,160
after reading these.

278
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,800
The name "Qi Rongzhou" written on these papers

279
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,720
refers to Hua Rongzhou who works for you.

280
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
His surname is Qi

281
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,720
and his hometown is in Huiyang County

282
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
a few thousand miles from here.

283
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,000
Qian.

284
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,800
I don't think you know anything about this.

285
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,920
Don't you do background checks

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,040
on the people around you?

287
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,280
I hadn't taken notice of him

288
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,680
until he suddenly stood in front of you

289
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,800
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet.

290
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,520
And I thought he looked familiar.

291
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,400
He was the street beggar you met

292
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,400
and the waiter at the tea house as well.

293
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,760
It was obvious he got close to you on purpose

294
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,680
so I sent someone to investigate him.

295
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,360
How did you run into him on the street?

296
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
I just happened to see him

297
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,000
crash into your carriage.

298
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Is it such a coincidence?

299
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,160
We are talking about your guard now.

300
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,080
I know him.

301
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,440
Hua Rongzhou isn't that kind of person.

302
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,400
Miss Hua.

303
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,920
Even if Qi Rongzhou

304
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,760
didn't murder Master Li for money

305
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,000
he has killed more than once.

306
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,800
Miss Hua, have you ever heard of

307
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,920
a craftsman named Wei Xian?

308
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,920
Do you know where the best blacksmith shop is?

309
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,680
I heard that

310
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,640
there was a female craftsman named Wei Xian

311
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,480
who was the most skilled.

312
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,040
A female craftsman? I have never heard of her.

313
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,160
All the girls admired her.

314
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,880
Unfortunately, she passed away a while ago.

315
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
This sounds familiar.

316
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,880
Wei Xian is the most skilled female craftsman

317
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,960
outside Huangcheng.

318
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Everyone knew her

319
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,360
but she was killed last year.

320
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,960
At first, most people thought

321
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,480
it was just another case of revenge killing.

322
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,760
When my subordinates were investigating

323
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
Qi Rongzhou

324
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,280
they accidentally discovered that Wei Xian

325
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,920
once had an apprentice named Rongzhou.

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,240
On the night before Wei Xian's death

327
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,600
someone spotted Qi Rongzhou at the scene.

328
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,880
And after that, he disappeared.

329
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,200
But the incident soon blew over.

330
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,160
I gave you this bracelet to protect yourself

331
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,560
not to kill yourself.

332
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,640
Qian.

333
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,320
Qi Rongzhou hid his identity well.

334
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,920
Chen Yuan noticed that

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
the Li family had been spying on him.

336
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,160
This led him to more clues

337
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,320
about Qi Rongzhou's past.

338
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,440
He killed for money

339
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
when he was only ten years old.

340
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,000
And later on, he killed his master.

341
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,840
Qian, I know you're kind and compassionate

342
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,720
but how can I let such a dangerous man

343
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
be around you?

344
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,400
The couple we met on the streets earlier on...

345
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,280
You set it up, didn't you?

346
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,840
I did it for you.

347
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,280
You might not believe what I say

348
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,240
so I told Chen Yuan to bring the Li couple here.

349
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,400
But putting on that act on the streets

350
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,600
was his idea.

351
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,960
I was worried that Qi Rongzhou

352
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,560
would be upset and hurt you

353
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,120
so I came to protect you.

354
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,360
I might not believe what you say?

355
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Lord, did you really come

356
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
because you were worried that

357
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
Hua Rongzhou might hurt me?

358
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,920
But of course!

359
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you think I was there to see you

360
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
defending him regardless of the facts?

361
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,080
Thank you, Lord.

362
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,280
If you lack guards

363
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,960
you can pick either Lin Jiang or Chen Yuan.

364
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,440
They normally work in the shadows

365
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
and both of them are just as highly skilled

366
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,320
in martial arts as him.

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,240
They belong to you, Lord.

368
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,440
I shall decline.

369
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
As they were offered to you

370
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
they now belong to you.

371
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,040
Lord, I appreciate your kindness

372
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,760
but it's a lot to take in.

373
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,680
Please give me some time

374
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,240
before we talk further.

375
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,360
Lord.

376
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,680
Master Zhong's guard was nearby just now.

377
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,800
It's okay.

378
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,400
Qian...!

379
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,840
Are you all right?

380
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm fine.

381
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,360
I was so worried about you!

382
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,440
I heard what happened.

383
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
I was so worried

384
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
I almost went out to look for you.

385
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,760
Then, I heard Magistrate Wang has made

386
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,960
arrangements for someone to escort you back

387
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,360
only then I felt relieved. You...

388
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,680
Sorry to make you worry, Father.

389
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,960
Qian, get this.

390
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,960
Pay extra attention when you choose

391
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,200
your servants in the future.

392
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,640
I won't allow you to keep those

393
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
with questionable backgrounds.

394
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,400
Especially those...

395
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,800
Especially those you brought back

396
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,960
from Zhong Residence.

397
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,240
I'd suggest you do background checks

398
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,520
on them again.

399
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,360
It's not limited to the servants.

400
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,960
What did you say?

401
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,440
Nothing. I just feel a little tired.

402
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,480
Look how inconsiderate I am.

403
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,960
You just encountered a frightening event.

404
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,640
Of course, you need to take a good rest.

405
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Have a good rest.

406
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,720
Take good care of her.

407
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,600
Yes, Master.

408
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,080
Miss...!

409
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
I'm begging you. Please save Guard Hua.

410
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,280
He can't be a murderer like they claimed.

411
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,360
He must have been framed.

412
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
Please save him!

413
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,680
Cuizhu, please leave me alone for a while.

414
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
Miss, I'm begging you!

415
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,600
—Let's go.           —Miss, I'm begging you!

416
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,840
—Let's go.           —Miss, please save him!

417
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,440
Miss...

418
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,360
Miss.

419
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,880
Mu Yao sent someone to deliver a letter.

420
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Miss...

421
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
Ridiculous.

422
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,200
How ridiculous!

423
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,160
Tell me.

424
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,120
Why did everything come to me at once?

425
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Miss, what are you going to do?

426
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,800
The escaped slave in the woodshed...

427
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,280
Throw him out tonight.

428
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,840
I'm not wasting any more food on him.

429
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
Yes, Miss.

430
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,760
I thought you made up your mind to be a coward

431
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,000
and pretended not to know that I was here.

432
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,600
Qian has decided to let you go.

433
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,920
I was wondering about

434
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,920
Hua Qian's bold behaviour.

435
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,000
It turned out that you were plotting against me

436
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,120
behind my back.

437
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,200
Qian doesn't know that

438
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,640
I have come to let you go.

439
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,200
She is gentle by nature

440
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,120
and has always been timid and cowardly.

441
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,320
She shouldn't get involved in such things.

442
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,360
After you leave

443
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,040
remember to keep your mouth shut.

444
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,000
Do not say what you shouldn't say.

445
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,560
She is gentle by nature?

446
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,400
She is timid and cowardly?

447
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,320
Are you suffering from some eye disease?

448
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,040
I know my daughter.

449
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
You're free to go.

450
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,320
Why did you come here instead of leaving?

451
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,080
To seek revenge?

452
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
My negligence was to be blamed

453
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,400
for what happened at the banquet.

454
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,400
Someone saw an opportunity and took it.

455
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,600
What happened to your family is my fault.

456
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,720
Are you here to apologise?

457
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,520
So, you also think that my brother was unlucky

458
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,560
and got killed due to the chaos?

459
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,520
It's my fault.

460
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,680
I caused your brother's death.

461
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,960
Do you know that

462
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,600
I was the assassin's target

463
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,200
and Hua Shen died protecting me?

464
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,840
I had no idea...

465
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes.

466
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,040
It was chaotic

467
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,240
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet.

468
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,440
Everyone was frantically fleeing.

469
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,360
No one could notice anything else.

470
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,120
Even you, one of the masterminds

471
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
didn't know what exactly happened.

472
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,560
How would anyone else know?

473
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,800
I am to blame and cannot evade accountability.

474
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,240
Come at me

475
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,440
if you still want to settle scores.

476
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Just...

477
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
leave her alone.

478
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,000
Since you are so worried

479
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,600
why don't you just take her away?

480
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,720
Why do you let her stay on?

481
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,600
She has made her choice

482
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,440
and I respect her decision.

483
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,880
You respect her decision?

484
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,280
Kill someone for me

485
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,280
and I won't bother her ever again.

486
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
You and your father have been

487
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
manipulated me long enough

488
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,720
and I won't get involved in your affairs again.

489
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,440
You know my father?

490
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,200
So, Butler Hua didn't tell you about it either.

491
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
What is it?

492
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,480
You can ask him yourself.

493
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,640
<i>He doesn't seem to be lying.</i>

494
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,360
<i>But in the previous life</i>

495
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,480
<i>they had never met each other.</i>

496
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,080
<i>What's going on?</i>

497
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,840
I owe you big time

498
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,360
for what happened to your brother.

499
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,360
But if you set Mu Yao up again

500
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,760
I won't stand by and do nothing.

501
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,800
Are you saying you won't get involved

502
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,800
if Mu Yao causes problems for me?

503
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,040
But if I cause problems for Mu Yao

504
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,840
you will step in?

505
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,480
So much for standing by and doing nothing.

506
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,880
Mu Yao won't cause problems for you again.

507
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
No matter how I see it

508
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,520
I feel that I am at a disadvantage.

509
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,440
What do you want?

510
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,760
Remember.

511
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,080
You owe me big time.

512
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,960
You have to pay this debt one day.

513
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,440
All right, I'll be waiting.

514
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,760
Are you hurt?

515
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,680
In the third drawer of the bookshelf

516
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
there is Jindao Powder

517
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,960
good for stopping bleeding and pain relief.

518
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,640
Go get it yourself.

519
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,960
Fly away!

520
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,200
I fell in love with you at first sight

521
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,840
so I couldn't get you out of my mind.

522
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,960
Spare me your lies.

523
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,800
I'll count to three.

524
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,680
If you don't leave, I'll scream.

525
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
One.

526
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,640
Don't you wonder why I keep pestering you?

527
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,400
—Two.            —You'll come to me one day.

528
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Three.

529
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,760
What's the matter?

530
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,680
I'm the one who should apologise.

532
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,640
Why are you apologising?

533
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,200
She's right.

534
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,520
The plans were laid in secret

535
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,720
but the outcome revealed answers.

536
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,480
There are things that I wish

537
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,480
you'll never find out.

538
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
What are you talking about?

539
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,680
To be honest with you...

540
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,800
I had an ulterior motive

541
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,120
when I first approached you.

542
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,280
But then, you piqued my interest.

543
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,040
Now that I think about it

544
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:19,160
I realise I don't really fancy you that much.

545
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,040
So, going forward

546
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,760
don't ever feel guilty towards me.

547
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,560
Don't come looking for me.

548
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,320
Don't even bother thinking of me.

549
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:26,800
<i>Hua Residence</i>

550
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,800
<i>How are Wu Shuomo and Father connected?</i>

551
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,440
<i>They didn't cross each other's paths before.</i>

552
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,400
<i>And I haven't noticed anything in this life.</i>

553
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,760
Cuizhu, you can't come in here.

554
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,480
Cuizhu, you can't come in here.

555
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,640
Cuizhu, Miss just woke up and hasn't eaten yet.

556
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,720
You will have to wait.

557
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,200
—Cuizhu!                          —Leave us.

558
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,880
I know you like Hua Rongzhou

559
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,480
but things are complicated, allow me to...

560
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
No, Miss.

561
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,400
I'm here to confess.

562
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,360
I have made a mistake.

563
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,160
Please punish me.

564
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,720
—You don't have to...          —Guard Hua...

565
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,200
You're the only woman Guard Hua fancies.

566
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,640
It has always been so.

567
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,240
I noticed it from the very beginning.

568
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,960
I felt indignant

569
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,200
and that led me to commit nasty mistakes.

570
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
The incident

571
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,320
at Concubine Mu's wedding banquet...

572
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,600
I told her where Young Master Hua was

573
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,320
and sent away all the servants in the backyard.

574
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
That was how Concubine Mu

575
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,880
had the opportunity to set him up.

576
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
At the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet...

577
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,640
I held on to Guard Hua on purpose

578
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,040
and that was how the assassin managed to

579
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,600
knock you unconscious and take you away.

580
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,760
I've engaged in many deceitful acts

581
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,120
because of my selfish desires.

582
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,320
I should be regarded as a disloyal servant.

583
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
So, Miss, I have no objections

584
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,720
even if you beat or punish me.

585
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,360
But Guard Hua...

586
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,480
Guard Hua puts your life before his own.

587
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
He risked his life to save you

588
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
on numerous occasions.

589
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,440
Regardless of what others may say

590
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,560
he never has any intention of harming you.

591
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,400
I swear on my life.

592
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,520
I know how well he treats me.

593
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,160
I don't need you to tell me that.

594
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,800
Miss, I beg you not to leave him in the lurch!

595
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,720
Get up.

596
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,800
Miss, please punish me.

597
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,640
Miss, please punish me.

598
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,280
Miss, please punish me.

599
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,200
Miss, please punish me.

600
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,240
Miss, please punish me.

601
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,480
Miss, please punish me.

602
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,920
Miss, please punish me.

603
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,280
Miss, please punish me.

604
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,440
Miss, please punish me.

605
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,120
Miss, please punish me.

606
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,800
—Miss...        —Come with me to the prison.

607
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,680
Miss, you are here.

608
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,440
Don't...

609
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,440
I'm filthy.

610
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,160
You're not filthy.

611
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,080
Not at all.

612
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,400
Your surname is not Hua, right?

613
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
I...

614
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,600
Why did you say your surname was Hua?

615
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,280
I disliked my previous surname

616
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,320
so I had always gone without a surname

617
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,920
until I met you, Miss.

618
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,120
I gave myself this surname.

619
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,720
Why didn't you like your previous surname?

620
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,160
Why did you kill...

621
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
that rich merchant Master Li?

622
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,040
And where did you...

623
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,880
get this bracelet?

624
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,600
Miss, since you already know everything

625
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,720
why bother asking me?

626
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,040
Because I want to hear it from you.

627
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,400
How dare they whip you!

628
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Miss!

629
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,280
Miss, don't you want to listen to me?

630
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,560
Miss, you asked me

631
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,680
if I still hated that rich family.

632
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
And now...

633
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,320
do you still hate the rich family

634
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,600
who mistreated you?

635
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
Not anymore.

636
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,560
Why?

637
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,240
It was because I killed him.

638
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,520
I was born in a village.

639
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,080
My father was a rural scholar.

640
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,800
He had big ambitions but was lazy.

641
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,800
My mother ran the household.

642
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,800
When I was five years old

643
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,560
my mother fell ill and collapsed.

644
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,480
Rongzhou, be careful.

645
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,120
Mother, have some medicine.

646
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,280
Don't make medicine for me anymore.

647
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,760
It's a waste of money. It's not going to work.

648
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,320
You have a long way ahead of you.

649
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,000
You need the money.

650
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,120
Mother, are you going to leave us behind?

651
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,000
Tuberculosis is contagious.

652
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,480
Take him away.

653
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,720
Mother...! I don't want to leave you!

654
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,440
I don't want to leave you!

655
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,800
Be a good boy.

656
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,400
Be good, son.

657
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,800
Mother! No!

658
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,360
I want my mother!

659
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,600
I don't want to leave you, Mother!

660
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
Mother!

661
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,840
My mother passed away soon after that.

662
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,360
The following year, my father

663
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,320
took the money that my mother

664
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,560
refused to use for medicine

665
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
and married someone else.

666
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,720
That woman

667
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,480
had a child with my father.

668
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,720
When I was ten years old

669
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,960
there was a famine in my hometown.

670
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,640
That woman urged my father to sell me away.

671
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,320
She told me that she chose to sell me away

672
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,680
because I was good looking.

673
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,280
My younger brother didn't have good looks

674
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,800
so he wouldn't fetch a good price.

675
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,800
Father, thank you

676
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,960
for looking after me for ten years.

677
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,760
Our father and son relationship

678
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,400
has come to an end.

679
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,120
We will never see each other again.

680
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,160
From now on

681
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,400
I will be called Rongzhou.

682
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,600
I will abandon your surname Qi.

683
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,040
I hope...

684
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,920
you will take good care of yourself.

685
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,920
I was fine with being sold.

686
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,520
Ever since my mother passed away

687
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,680
it didn't make no difference to me where I was.

688
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,920
My father would bring up

689
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,160
my late mother from time to time

690
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,080
and that woman got jealous

691
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,760
so she sold me to the notorious

692
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,040
rich merchant Master Li.

693
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,680
Notorious?

694
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,680
<i>Bonus footage</i>

695
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
Lord.

696
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,320
Magistrate Wang has locked up that man

697
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,000
while that couple took advantage of the chaos

698
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,280
and slipped away.

699
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,080
Do you want me to find them?

700
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,840
My lord.

701
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,160
Do you want to go back to Zhong's Garden?

702
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,440
Yes.

703
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,600
Yes, my lord!

704
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,600
Tell Magistrate Wang to wait for three days.

705
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,960
No interrogations during the three days.

706
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,920
Just wait.

707
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
Yes, my lord.
