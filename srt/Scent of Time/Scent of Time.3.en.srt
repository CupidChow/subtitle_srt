00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>Episode 3</i>

3
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,680
<i>Hua Residence</i>

4
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,960
Hungry?

5
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,160
Sir, Master Zhong is here.

6
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Good.

7
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,360
—Master.                      —My apologies.

8
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,000
I got tied up, so I'm late.

9
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,600
It's okay. Work is more important.

10
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Take a seat.

11
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Yes, come take a seat.

12
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,160
Since you're late

13
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
you must drink a cup of wine as a penalty.

14
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,840
Here. I'll pour you a full cup.

15
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,040
This is a bottle of well-aged wine...

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,720
We haven't started the meal yet.

17
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,160
No wine for now.

18
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Okay.

19
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,720
Master, you must be hungry.

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Have some food first.

21
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,680
Right... eat something.

22
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,240
Okay. Let's eat.

23
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,200
—Yes, let's eat.      —All right, let's eat.

24
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,440
Do you like the food?

25
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Very much so.

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Here...

27
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,200
Let me toast my brother-in-law.

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,680
Drink up, Brother-in-law. This is good wine.

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,160
My father has been saving it.

30
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,640
I'll go first.

31
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
How is it?

32
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,720
Let's eat...

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,000
One more.

34
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,480
I save this for special occasions.

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
Have some food, my dear.

36
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,720
Come on... Brother-in-law.

37
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,240
Let me toast you again.

38
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Make yourself at home.

39
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,840
—Eat your dinner.                     —Okay.

40
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,680
Let's dig in. Have some more food.

41
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Try this.

42
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,840
Come on...

43
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,960
Brother-in-law, let me toast you again.

44
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,040
I'm telling you

45
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,760
when I first met you

46
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,920
I thought you and my sister

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,760
were a match made in heaven.

48
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,760
Come on, drink up.

49
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,720
Make yourself at home.

50
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,040
We're family now.

51
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,560
Agree? I...

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
My sister met the right man.

53
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,680
You must be nice to her.

54
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,680
Here, one more cup. Let me toast you again.

55
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
Your brother

56
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,560
is trying to set you up for success.

57
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,520
As the Mistress of Zhong Residence

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,280
you will meet many girls in the future.

59
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,080
Find a nice girl for your brother.

60
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,240
—Do you hear me?                   —Come on.

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,240
Your brother is already 23 years old

62
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,680
and should settle down quickly.

63
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,160
There must be dozens of concubines

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,120
living in his quarters, right?

65
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,320
And I heard he bought a lot of maids.

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,840
If he gets married lawfully

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,320
there won't be space for all of them.

68
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,200
You can't say that.

69
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,160
Every man has several concubines.

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,000
But a lawful first wife is a must.

71
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Is that so?

72
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,920
Why didn't you get any for Father?

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,840
Don't be silly.

74
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Qian.

75
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,800
What did you say?

76
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,600
Nothing.

77
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,080
Eat your dinner.

78
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,560
Brother-in-law.

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,760
We're now family.

80
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,800
Listen, do you have enough domestic staff?

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,280
If not, you can tell me.

82
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,520
I just bought a lot of beautiful maids

83
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,200
If you like them, I'll send them all to you.

84
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
Huang, Shen is drunk.

85
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,680
Help him to his room.

86
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,120
—You must treat my sister well.   —Yes, sir.

87
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,800
Do you get it? I...

88
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,520
Sir, let's go.

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,240
Go away. I don't get to speak

90
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
to my brother-in-law much.

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
You... let go of me.

92
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,720
Let go of him.

93
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,520
Get the ruler that I use for physical discipline.

94
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,800
R-Ruler...

95
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Pardon me, for I'm tipsy.

96
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640
I shall take my leave now.

97
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,680
—Shall we...                        —Father.

98
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,040
It's getting late. We must get going.

99
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
See you.

100
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,280
Come visit us frequently.

101
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,440
Have a safe ride.

102
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
It's all your fault.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why did you bring up the ruler?

104
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,320
You ruined the meal.

105
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
I haven't even spoken to him.

106
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,240
I haven't even had a drink.

107
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,520
Drink up then...

108
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,680
Enjoy it by yourself.

109
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
Why did you leave in such a hurry today?

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,640
Did you not want me to talk to your father?

111
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,200
All he talks about

112
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,920
are work related matters.

113
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,000
Although you and I are married

114
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,760
we should not mix work with family.

115
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,040
Thanks for your consideration.

116
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,800
<i>If only my father could</i>

117
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,360
<i>stop thinking about forming cliques</i>

118
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,640
<i>that'd make things easier for me.</i>

119
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,480
<i>Being seen as an eyesore by the Zhong family</i>

120
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
<i>makes life difficult for me.</i>

121
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,480
<i>Father's ability is beyond doubt.</i>

122
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,720
<i>Since he agreed to the matter on Mu Yunping</i>

123
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,040
<i>I should...</i>

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
I'd like to see Mu Yao.

125
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,760
Master, the guard reported that

126
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,080
Miss Mu has escaped.

127
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,120
You should go if you need to.

128
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
I can continue on my own.

129
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,440
I'll be waiting at Hua Residence.

130
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Sorry.

131
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,920
<i>Prison</i>

132
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Hold it.

133
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,360
What are all of you up to?

134
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,520
Master, we're on our way

135
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,400
to track down the Mu family.

136
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
—What can I do for you?           —Carry on.

137
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,760
I need to talk to your warden.

138
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
Yes, sir.

139
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,720
Follow me.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What?

141
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,760
Do you want to share a cell with your father?

142
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,240
How many people do you think

143
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,480
you're going to fool with this look?

144
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,640
My father is innocent

145
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,720
so I'm going to find out the truth.

146
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,280
Not many people would believe you.

147
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,760
Well, do you believe me?

148
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,680
Were you on your way to your in-laws'?

149
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,960
This is not the place to talk.

150
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,640
What's wrong? Am I not allowed to see her?

151
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,760
That's not it.

152
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,400
Mu Yao and I were like sisters.

153
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
She's in trouble now

154
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,400
so naturally I'm very worried.

155
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,960
That's why I want to see her.

156
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,880
You know about everything?

157
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,800
Qian, believe me.

158
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
I only did it as she's an acquaintance...

159
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,840
You don't need to explain it to me.

160
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,880
I know that you and Mu Yao got along well

161
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
and were once good friends.

162
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,560
I just need to speak to her.

163
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,480
I'm not trying to question you.

164
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
All right.

165
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,120
Qian, I did this just as a friend.

166
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
When you kept vigil at the funeral with me

167
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,480
I vowed to only love you in this life.

168
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,280
<i>Thank you for the assurance.</i>

169
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,320
<i>But that person who did that wasn't me.</i>

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,280
<i>Even if it were</i>

171
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,160
<i>it wouldn't have stopped you</i>

172
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
<i>from falling for her eventually.</i>

173
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,440
<i>I was the one who stood in the way.</i>

174
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,800
After speaking to Qian today

175
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,320
I noticed she's more mature now.

176
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,120
That makes me feel relieved.

177
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,120
Indeed, she's changed a lot.

178
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,560
She used to call me "Papa".

179
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,600
Now she's all grown up

180
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,400
and calls me "Father".

181
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,040
Think of it this way.

182
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,000
One day, she'll become

183
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,640
the Mistress of the household

184
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,120
so it would do her well to mature sooner.

185
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,760
Just three days into her marriage

186
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,800
and she's already so formal with me.

187
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,760
She was even tense

188
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,520
when she spoke with me today.

189
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,040
I don't even know her already.

190
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,920
She feels like a stranger.

191
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
I don't believe you.

192
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
She's always been rambunctious

193
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,040
in front of you.

194
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,800
How can that be?

195
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,520
You must be confused.

196
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,680
That was in the past.

197
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,040
Forget it...

198
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,640
She's married into another family now.

199
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,360
Well, that means

200
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,960
we can worry less

201
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
about our children now.

202
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
Right.

203
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,920
Shen should settle down

204
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,120
at his age already.

205
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Huang.

206
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,120
Where are you sneaking off to?

207
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Come here.

208
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,200
Sir, Master Hua...

209
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,720
What has he done?

210
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Tell me.

211
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Sir...

212
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,920
He said he couldn't sleep after drinking.

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
So he asked me

214
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,720
to invite some girls from Baihua Court

215
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,480
to join him.

216
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,800
Save the trip.

217
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,640
Bring me the discipline ruler instead.

218
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Don't...

219
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
My dear

220
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,800
he drank to be a good host to Master Zhong.

221
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,280
Perhaps he just drank too much.

222
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,680
It's late.

223
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,280
Just let it go.

224
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,720
I'll go get it myself.

225
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,880
You spoilt him.

226
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,280
My dear...

227
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,600
You...

228
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,120
You'll get it from me tomorrow.

229
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,360
My dear...

230
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
My dear...

231
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,040
My dear...

232
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,120
<i>All I want is to survive this time around.</i>

233
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,600
<i>I don't need to rack my brains</i>

234
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,320
<i>to bury the hatchet.</i>

235
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
<i>If I kill the one</i>

236
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,560
<i>that's threatening my survival</i>

237
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,120
<i>I won't need to...</i>

238
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,920
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

239
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,040
<i>Wasn't my last death bad enough?</i>

240
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,520
<i>How can I harbour such thoughts?</i>

241
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,440
<i>If innocent people have to pay the price</i>

242
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,320
<i>for my own survival</i>

243
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,040
<i>I'm just repeating history...</i>

244
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,800
Hua Qian, you...

245
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,160
You're up.

246
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,080
I heard that you're here

247
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,600
so I came to see you.

248
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,680
Why?

249
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,240
So you can brag about your victory?

250
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,640
<i>That was indeed my intention</i>

251
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,560
<i>when I did this the last time.</i>

252
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,320
Hua Qian, listen to me.

253
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,560
Even if you deny what you did

254
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,320
sooner or later

255
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,280
I'll expose how vicious you're to the world

256
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,400
and the hypocrisy of your family.

257
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,040
What goes around comes around.

258
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,280
Your family will never live in peace.

259
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,480
I don't want to talk about the past

260
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,480
but I can assure you right now

261
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,880
your family will be fine.

262
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
What game are you playing now?

263
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,280
So, tell me.

264
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,520
You pretended to be my confidante.

265
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,560
What else is there from me

266
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,360
that you can use for your advantage?

267
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,680
I'm not trying to use you for anything...

268
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,360
Do you think you can still fool me?

269
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,840
What I have experienced in the past few days

270
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,120
is enough to show me your true colours.

271
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,200
You pretend to be weak

272
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,960
but have the heart of a devil.

273
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Right from the start

274
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,240
you knew what you wanted from me.

275
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Miss.

276
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,000
Did you see a parrot around just now?

277
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,640
Was that your parrot?

278
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,240
Did you see it?

279
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,480
I just accidentally scared it off.

280
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,640
Let me help you find it.

281
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
That'd be very kind of you.

282
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,560
You're welcome.

283
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,000
Find out who she is.

284
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,160
How dare she seduce Master Zhong?

285
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,760
Yes, Miss Hua.

286
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,080
I know you won't trust anything that I say

287
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,280
about the past.

288
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,080
But right now, I've no intention to hurt you.

289
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,960
Do you expect me to believe you now?

290
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,600
Hua Qian, your broker sent over

291
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,480
furniture stuffed with agarwood incense

292
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,120
to our house.

293
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,600
And now my family is sentenced

294
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,920
with embezzlement.

295
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,520
I spoke to you about it several times.

296
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,840
Not only did you deny everything

297
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,800
you even reported me to the authorities.

298
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,440
What is it now?

299
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,080
Are you trying to change your story?

300
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,560
Try to calm down.

301
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,960
Mu Yao, a lot of what happened

302
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,280
are out of our control

303
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,480
and incongruent with my state of mind now.

304
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,080
I can't change everything all at once

305
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,800
so I can only do so bit by bit.

306
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,640
I understand why you don't trust me.

307
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,960
But I promise you

308
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,240
everything I say from now is the truth.

309
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,040
Save me this nonsense.

310
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
My father has been sentenced to exile

311
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,240
and I'm a wanted criminal.

312
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,840
Why should I trust you?

313
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,560
I heard something fall.

314
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Your face...

315
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,960
Face?

316
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Did she slap you?

317
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,360
No... she didn't.

318
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,080
I was kind enough to take you in.

319
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,800
How dare you hurt Qian?

320
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,600
Master, you made a mistake.

321
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,160
This has nothing to do with her.

322
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
I know you're kind.

323
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,920
You don't need to plead for her.

324
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,640
I guess I shouldn't have helped...

325
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,920
I did it to myself

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,720
Yes, that's right.

327
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,760
There was a bug on my face.

328
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,000
Qian, you don't need to be so nice.

329
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,720
Master, don't think too much.

330
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,640
Mu Yao did not hurt me.

331
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,280
Put yourself in her position.

332
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,600
Girls are most afraid of being wronged.

333
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,040
So you should apologise to her.

334
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,760
<i>By bringing them together</i>

335
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,680
<i>I hope it takes away the resentment</i>

336
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,160
<i>when I caused them to break apart.</i>

337
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,120
Do you see me

338
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,000
as a girl who's so insolent

339
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,000
and unreasonable?

340
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,200
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

341
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,840
I'm leaving.

342
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,200
Where do you think you're going?

343
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,320
Are you going to break into the prison?

344
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,760
That's better than sitting around.

345
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,720
Exile is no better than a death sentence.

346
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,440
How can I watch my father die?

347
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,360
I took the risk

348
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,920
to help you

349
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,280
since you were friends with Qian.

350
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,400
There's no way I can do that now.

351
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,760
I've never asked you to save me

352
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,640
or help me plan a prison break.

353
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,960
Right now

354
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,120
I just want you to stop being a busybody.

355
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,520
Is that how you see me?

356
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,200
If it weren't for what I did, you'd have...

357
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,440
Are you sure it's from Jiaozhi?

358
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,360
Yes. Most of the agarwood incense

359
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,880
is shipped from Qiongzhou.

360
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,440
It was hard to get so much of it from Jiaozhi.

361
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,880
Come with me to Zhong's Garden.

362
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,880
Butler Hua, what do you mean?

363
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,760
Lord, Supervisor Mu did not embezzle.

364
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,120
Look.

365
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,000
These agarwood incense

366
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,680
come from our workshop.

367
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,160
The staff might have gotten it mixed up

368
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,400
thus resulting in

369
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,200
him using the wrong type

370
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,960
to make the agarwood balls.

371
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you believe this account?

372
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,440
It's not impossible for inexperienced workers

373
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,680
to pick up the wrong ingredient.

374
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,360
Didn't they find the agarwood incense

375
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,600
in his house?

376
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,000
But, Lord...

377
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,160
m-maybe that's from his own collection

378
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,040
and this is the material used by us.

379
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,680
Please take a closer look.

380
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,040
This is shipped from Jiaozhi Country, right?

381
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,640
It smells different

382
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,160
from those sourced in Qiongzhou.

383
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,600
Weren't the raw materials

384
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,760
that he was responsible for

385
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,200
produced in Qiongzhou?

386
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Yes.

387
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Well...

388
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,120
What's going on?

389
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,360
Lord...

390
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,760
Lord, just treat these

391
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,360
as the agarwood incense

392
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,800
that Supervisor Mu is responsible for.

393
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,600
I've been working with him for a year

394
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,600
and we work well with each other.

395
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
Besides

396
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,520
he's worked here for decades

397
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,960
and has managed our business in the north

398
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,160
very well.

399
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,880
He deserves credit for that.

400
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
Although he did something wrong

401
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,600
we have the missing ingredient now.

402
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,520
Exile is akin to the death penalty

403
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
I hope that you can plead

404
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,960
to Magistrate Wang to reduce his sentence.

405
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
Lord.

406
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
The same person who raised a ruckus

407
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,200
about this embezzlement case

408
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,320
is now using his own money

409
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,840
to plead for Mu Yanping.

410
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,840
Looks like he's got a finger in every pie

411
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,000
even the Zhong family's matters.

412
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,800
Get out.

413
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,240
Mistress.

414
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Really?

415
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,640
Are you sure you heard correctly?

416
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,880
Did Magistrate Wang

417
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
really reduced Mu Yunping's sentence

418
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,320
to exile for three years?

419
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,200
What I heard is absolutely true.

420
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,880
The Lord wanted to forgive him

421
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,160
given his contribution to the family

422
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
so he pleaded

423
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,040
to Magistrate Wang for leniency.

424
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
Now everyone

425
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,280
is praising the Lord for his kindness.

426
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,440
<i>Exile for three years...</i>

427
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,320
<i>Mu Yunping is unlikely to kill himself</i>

428
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,240
<i>out of desperation then.</i>

429
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,480
<i>The future lies ahead</i>

430
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,280
<i>Take care of yourself</i>

431
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
Put on your hood

432
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,920
and pay someone on the street

433
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,960
to deliver this letter to Mu Yunping.

434
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,400
Remember, don't let anyone know who you are.

435
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
It's very important

436
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,920
so don't ask any more questions.

437
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,240
And remember, if this gets out

438
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,080
then I'm done.

439
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,280
Mistress, I swear on my life.

440
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,680
What's wrong?

441
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,240
N-N-Nothing.

442
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,120
<i>She's a maid after all.</i>

443
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,240
<i>I guess I'll have to look out</i>

444
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
<i>for more capable people.</i>

445
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,960
Mistress.

446
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,200
What's wrong with Qianzhi?

447
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,480
Nothing. She's just too young

448
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,600
to handle something serious.

449
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,280
Take a look at that ledger.

450
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Leave it here.

451
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,200
I haven't seen you in a few days.

452
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,760
You've lost weight.

453
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
Father...

454
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,040
Thanks to the Lord for showing grace

455
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,280
so I was spared.

456
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,480
And though the land is barren

457
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,000
three years should go by quickly.

458
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,400
I can manage it.

459
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,800
I've already made some arrangements.

460
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,200
They shouldn't treat you too harshly.

461
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,520
I wrote to your uncle in the north.

462
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
You can stay with him

463
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,960
for the next three years

464
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,760
until I return

465
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,800
to look for you.

466
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,680
Although your life is spared

467
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,440
our family name is still smeared

468
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,640
and you're still bearing

469
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,360
the embezzlement sentence.

470
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,760
I want to stay here

471
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
to find out the truth

472
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,840
and restore our family's reputation.

473
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,480
That won't do.

474
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,280
You're just a girl.

475
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,000
How would you overturn the case?

476
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
I'm thankful as it is

477
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,720
that you're not implicated.

478
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,480
You often said

479
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,280
that I grew up in the north

480
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,840
and was a wild child.

481
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,120
I'm not like other girls.

482
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,720
So, don't look down on me

483
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,320
as a girl.

484
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,480
Rest assured.

485
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,760
I'll uncover the truth

486
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,160
and restore our family's reputation.

487
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,440
Then I'll bring you back to the city.

488
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,720
Thank you for your kindness, Master Zhong.

489
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
And for letting me see my father again.

490
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,000
I can repay your kindness

491
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,000
by working as your maid

492
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,600
in your family.

493
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,680
That's not necessary.

494
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,880
I should repay you for your kindness.

495
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,600
I said no.

496
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,880
We're not short of staff anyway.

497
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,680
After all, we were friends.

498
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,040
We might fight often in the past

499
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,720
but I have respect for you.

500
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,320
Take care of yourself.

501
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,480
If you refuse to accept my offer

502
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,280
I'm afraid I might spill the beans

503
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,040
when I'm on the loose.

504
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,600
It was all thanks to you

505
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
that I could avoid being arrested

506
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,360
when my family was on the run.

507
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,280
Are you threatening me?

508
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
No.

509
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,240
That's not my intention.

510
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm just asking you

511
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
to let me repay your kindness.

512
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Repay my kindness?

513
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,200
Is that how you do it?

514
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,600
You've every right to be angry.

515
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,120
But since you chose to help me

516
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I should repay you for that.

517
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,800
It's my fault.

518
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,840
I should never have caught you.

519
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,280
Miss Mu, the banquet is in the back.

520
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,840
What are you doing here?

521
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,720
If my father hadn't forced me to

522
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,080
I wouldn't be at this banquet.

523
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,800
Miss...

524
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,560
I cannot get along

525
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,240
with those who follow the rules.

526
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,880
Why do I have to get into their circle?

527
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,560
Miss, if you insist on doing this

528
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,120
I'll report it to Supervisor Mu.

529
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,640
I mean it.

530
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
Master.

531
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,080
Master.

532
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,960
Master...

533
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,080
Are you calling me?

534
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,280
Master...

535
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,000
Zhong's Garden is so unusual.

536
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,520
Even a bird can speak.

537
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,440
There's a snake behind you.

538
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,880
Get away now. Don't stay there.

539
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,360
Move. Or fly away.

540
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,720
<i>No... I might hurt it.</i>

541
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,600
Wait!

542
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,440
Have we met before?

543
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,440
Just another girl trying to get close to me.

544
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,400
Your father

545
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,840
has a lustrous career in this city.

546
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,840
Yet you're so ready to be my maid.

547
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,920
Fine.

548
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,160
Let's see what you're made of.

549
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Thank you, Master.

550
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,680
Nanfeng, keep moving.

551
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Yes, sir.

552
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,760
<i>All of this was caused by the Hua family.</i>

553
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
<i>Hua Qian.</i>

554
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,480
<i>I vow to expose your wrongdoing one day.</i>

555
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,480
Come here. Put them here.

556
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,640
On that chair.

557
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,960
Put them inside the house.

558
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,960
Leave those here.

559
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,080
Put them here.

560
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,280
You bought a lot of things.

561
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,520
I didn't buy them.

562
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,520
These are from my dowry.

563
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,320
I almost forgot about them.

564
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,440
Mistress, there's one thing today

565
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,000
you can no longer sit idly by.

566
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,640
What's the matter?

567
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,440
That girl named Mu...

568
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,680
She...

569
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,000
Mistress, Master is here.

570
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,080
Qian.

571
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,680
Master.

572
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,160
<i>What are they up to?</i>

573
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Qian.

574
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,160
Our household has never kept idle.

575
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,320
I've brought you a maid.

576
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,600
Look at this full house of people.

577
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,200
I don't need another maid.

578
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,680
One more won't hurt.

579
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,720
She wants to be a maid, anyway.

580
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
I don't need more maids.

581
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,920
The last time I went to your study

582
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,120
it seemed to be poorly staffed.

583
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,000
You should let Mu Yao serve there.

584
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,840
It's up to you.

585
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,800
Mistress.

586
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,320
She clearly has designs on Master.

587
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,000
I couldn't even bear to watch that.

588
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,600
Right, Mistress.

589
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,320
Why didn't you just say yes and let her...

590
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,760
be your maid

591
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,200
so that I can teach her a lesson?

592
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
—Banxia.                          —Mistress.

593
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,800
Come help me with my hair.

594
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Greetings, Mistress. I'm Yinxing.

595
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,680
Where's Banxia?

596
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,600
Something happened in her family

597
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,320
so she took a leave of absence.

598
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,120
She will be gone for a while.

599
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,800
Butler Ji sent me here.

600
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,960
I'm good at hairstyling and embroidery.

601
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,800
Okay, you do it then.

602
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,800
Lord, the desserts are packed to go.

603
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,440
Just stay for a little longer.

604
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,440
Lord, Her Highness might question us

605
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,280
if we return too late.

606
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,120
It's just a little longer.

607
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,720
My mother won't blame me for this.

608
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,200
Sir...

609
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,640
Sir, please...

610
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,760
—Sir...                           —Who's he?

611
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,360
—Sir...             —Looks like a bossy man.

612
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,680
—Sir...                 —Don't you know him?

613
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,880
His father is Butler Hua

614
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,080
and his sister is now Master Zhong's wife.

615
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,120
Everyone is afraid to provoke him now.

616
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,680
Poor girl.

617
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,040
—Look.                      —Sir, I beg you.

618
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,040
He's grabbing her.

619
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,640
Sir, I can't go back with you.

620
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,560
Sir, I beg you.

621
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,400
Sir, my father is waiting for me at home.

622
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,160
I can't go back with you.

623
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,120
You should be honoured.

624
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,000
It is your luck that I chose you

625
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,720
to get into our family.

626
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
Move it.

627
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,160
—Sir...                            —Just go.

628
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,160
How did Hua Wen'ang raise such a son

629
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,160
to ruin Zhong family's reputation?

630
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,200
You usually work undercover.

631
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,000
But go downstairs and help the pipa player.

632
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,680
Let's see how arrogant Hua Shen can get

633
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,400
and how much of a troublemaker he is.

634
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,480
Yes, sir.

635
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,680
I just asked you to play for me.

636
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,040
What are you doing?

637
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Just go.

638
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,080
Sir...

639
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,880
We're in broad daylight and public.

640
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,160
You shouldn't force her to do what you want.

641
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,080
Who said I'm forcing her?

642
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,760
I like her. That's her blessing.

643
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,920
It's none of your business.

644
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,120
If you don't want to die, stay out of it.

645
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,480
We hate to see others being bullied.

646
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,560
So I guess we'll get involved.

647
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,880
Let's see if you can steal her from us.

648
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
You're out for trouble.

649
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Take them down!

650
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,160
Sir, my teeth got knocked out.

651
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,240
—Miss...                          —Let's go.

652
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,520
Get up, you...

653
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,880
You, stay there.

654
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,640
Get this, I'm the only son of Butler Hua

655
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,800
and my sister is Master Zhong's wife.

656
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,680
That makes me Zhong Yelan's brother-in-law.

657
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,480
Make an apology and get out of here or...

658
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,240
<i>Bonus footage</i>

659
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,120
Little bird...

660
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,160
Little bird...

661
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,160
Sir, do you want me to ask some girls

662
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,600
to come over to play dice with you?

663
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,920
Not dice again!

664
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,600
I'm tired of it.

665
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,400
I've been locked up for three days

666
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,080
and now the sound of dice makes me sick.

667
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,480
Can't you find me something new?

668
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,640
Butler Hua and Mrs Hua are out of town

669
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,080
and have grounded you.

670
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,120
Sir, just hang on.

671
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,720
They'll be back home soon.

672
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,520
Huang.

673
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,320
You've reminded me of something.

674
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,800
Come close.

675
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,760
That night, I asked you to go to Baihua Court

676
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,680
to get some singers to come over.

677
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,800
You brought no girls, but my father instead.

678
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,120
That was quite something you did there.

679
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,400
You caused me to be punished.

680
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,600
And now I'm grounded.

681
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,400
Huang, how will you make it up to me?

682
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,760
Stop running. Stop.

683
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,400
Sir.

684
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,640
Butler Hua caught me going out

685
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,520
and I didn't dare to hide the truth.

686
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Don't you dare talk back!

687
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,040
I'll beat you to death.

688
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,480
I'm out of breath.

689
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,760
Take a rest.

690
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,920
Have some water.

691
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,920
Let's see where you can run now.

692
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,400
Go on.

693
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,960
Do you think you did wrong...?

694
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,400
Yes, I did wrong. I'm sorry.

695
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,160
I'm bored. So very bored, Huang!

696
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,280
Do you get it?

697
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,480
Do you get it?

698
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,400
I want to go out and have some fun.

699
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,520
But I'm afraid of my father.

700
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,440
And my father's not home...

701
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,400
My father's not home.

702
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,640
I'm going out!

703
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,000
Sir, where are you going?

704
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,320
Butler Hua said you're not allowed to

705
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,560
go to Baihua Court again.

706
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,120
Who said I'm going there?

707
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm just going out for some tea.

708
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,640
Please don't! Sir!
