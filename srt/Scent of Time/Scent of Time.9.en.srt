00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,800
<i>Episode 9</i>

3
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,240
Mistress, here he is.

4
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,240
Greetings, Mistress.

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,600
I'm short-staffed now.

6
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
Don't mind what I said to you earlier.

7
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
I may have conflicts with Zhong Yelan

8
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,880
but I'm still...

9
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,040
the daughter of the Hua family

10
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,560
and my father's still the butler here.

11
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,240
If you stay and work here

12
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,280
you'll stand to gain from it.

13
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,320
Since I've been assigned to you

14
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,600
then, Mistress, you're my only master.

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Good!

16
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
I said that you were promising

17
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,440
and I was right.

18
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,160
Just let me know if you need any help.

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,840
There are indeed many things for you to do

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,040
right now.

21
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
—Cuizhu.                               —Yes?

22
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
Come and help.

23
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,040
I'm coming.

24
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Come on.

25
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,600
Why are you looking at me like this?

26
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,040
I've heard of it.

27
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,520
What did you hear?

28
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,880
You didn't just deduct

29
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,200
food and clothing expenses from Mistress

30
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,560
but also transferred all the staff

31
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,040
who clean her compound.

32
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,120
Chief Guard, don't talk nonsense.

33
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
I wouldn't have the nerve

34
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,360
to deduct her expenses. It's...

35
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,440
Master's order.

36
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
Did he ask you to transfer all her staff?

37
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,880
Don't assume I don't know that

38
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
he never gave such orders.

39
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,160
As a result, Mistress' maids

40
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,040
are all very busy.

41
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,160
It's not my fault.

42
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
Although Master didn't give these orders

43
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,880
the maids and servants

44
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,680
came to ask me for a transfer.

45
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,200
It's difficult to satisfy everyone.

46
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,600
I can only follow their wishes.

47
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,440
Besides, Master has no objection to this.

48
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,600
Don't use him as an excuse.

49
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,080
You've misunderstood me.

50
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,520
I wouldn't have the nerve.

51
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,120
You can cut spending but don't go too far.

52
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,400
Just toe the line.

53
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,480
I'll take the blame if Master knows of this.

54
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
But if I hear of

55
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,080
your harsh treatment of Mistress' maids

56
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,240
then I won't be so polite.

57
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,200
Remember, I'm in charge of the guards

58
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,400
in this compound.

59
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
All right.

60
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Okay.

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,080
As for those who'd asked to leave

62
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,800
there's no need to transfer them back.

63
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,600
We don't need to retain disloyal people.

64
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,360
Yes.

65
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
By the way

66
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,280
don't forget to instruct your people.

67
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,560
Fine.

68
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,320
Is he...

69
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,480
really getting serious?

70
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,120
All done, Mistress.

71
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,960
Isn't this a little fancy?

72
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,440
It's not the first time

73
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,240
that I'm going to see Her Highness.

74
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,000
Mistress, you've just recovered

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,320
so a fancy look will bring you luck.

76
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,240
All right then.

77
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,600
Is the carriage ready?

78
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,960
We don't have to go out

79
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,920
and pay for this, do we?

80
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,880
No. I'll check it out.

81
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,840
Mistress, please stop.

82
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,280
My brother sent it, right?

83
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,120
I've told him many times

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
apparently, it all fell on deaf ears.

85
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,480
He still buys jewellery for me.

86
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,680
These things are burdens when on the run.

87
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,120
If he sends more things next time

88
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,520
you can reject them directly.

89
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,880
Just tell them I've no interest in such things.

90
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,240
This is no ordinary piece of jewellery.

91
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,160
My brother is finally learning something.

92
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,040
He found such a novel thing.

93
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,720
Mistress, be careful.

94
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,960
This knife is small

95
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,120
but extremely sharp.

96
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,600
How sharp can it be?

97
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,520
Tell my brother

98
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,720
that I really like this thing.

99
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,400
I didn't do it on purpose.

100
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,840
Get up. Don't be that polite.

101
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,160
Come on, tell me

102
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,760
how to turn this back into a bangle.

103
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,520
This is really useful for self-defence.

104
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I don't have anything

105
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,760
that needs guarding here.

106
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,560
I'm going to Zhong's Garden

107
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
and I need a guard.

108
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,000
Would you please take me there?

109
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,120
Noted.

110
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
<i>Young kids are so obedient.</i>

111
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,040
Mistress, shouldn't it be over there?

112
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,080
I was invited here.

113
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,480
We're in broad daylight.

114
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,720
I doubt anyone would have the nerve

115
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
to set me up.

116
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,680
It's fine. We'll go by ourselves.

117
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,920
What a coincidence, Sister-in-law.

118
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,880
<i>Just my luck.</i>

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,400
I happen to be going to see my mother.

120
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Let's go together.

121
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
Is your injury better?

122
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
That day at Zhong Residence

123
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,600
I didn't have time to ask you in detail

124
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,040
as Senior asked to see me.

125
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,240
You asked me detailed questions then

126
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,680
and I'm fine now.

127
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,880
I sense that you're still upset.

128
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,320
Do you still think

129
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,320
that I'm testing you all the time?

130
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,520
Lord, you must be joking with me.

131
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,680
I wouldn't dare think that.

132
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,280
You dare not think that

133
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,480
and not that you're not angry?

134
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Then let me assure you

135
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,400
I'll never speculate about your actions again.

136
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,600
Can you forgive me?

137
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
What's wrong?

138
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,240
Lord, were you talking to me?

139
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,160
Who else would it be?

140
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,240
Every thought of yours must make sense.

141
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,480
So, there isn't any speculation, right?

142
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
Forget it. There will be a time for that.

143
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,160
I thought about what you said that day

144
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,360
and thought it was very reasonable.

145
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
<i>Here we go again.</i>

146
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,520
<i>Didn't you promise me no more speculation?</i>

147
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Forgive me for being ignorant

148
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,200
but may I know what I said wrong?

149
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,000
I said I would stop speculating about you

150
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,800
so you don't have to be so cautious.

151
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,600
<i>I'd be a fool to believe you.</i>

152
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,280
You said that a person has only one life

153
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,240
so nothing's worth risking one's life for.

154
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,760
You should think about this in the future.

155
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,040
<i>Are you threatening my life?</i>

156
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,720
I mean, you...

157
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,320
Greetings, Mistress.

158
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Come and sit by my side.

159
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Yes, Mistress.

160
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,440
You're really ignorant.

161
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,240
Yelan is well-trained in martial arts

162
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
there was no need to take the arrow for him.

163
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,840
It made you ill for so long

164
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,160
and caused me to worry for you

165
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,840
at this age.

166
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,760
You are right, Mistress.

167
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,920
I was ignorant and too impulsive.

168
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,120
Thank you for your concern.

169
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,640
I won't do it again.

170
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,440
Look at how thin you've become.

171
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,120
I used to think that you were too frail.

172
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,920
Now that you're so slim

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,640
how would you bear Yelan a child?

174
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,000
Mother.

175
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,520
You're partial to her.

176
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,720
I've been here for so long.

177
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,280
But it seems like you didn't see me.

178
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,640
The cheek of you to say that.

179
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,320
You're still not married

180
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,080
so my wish for a grandson

181
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,000
is pinned on Yelan.

182
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,360
I heard that you cooked him noodles

183
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,000
for his birthday.

184
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,480
I just cooked them casually.

185
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,120
It's the thought that counts.

186
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,200
It is rare for a pampered little lady like you

187
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,680
would be willing to enter the kitchen

188
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,960
to cook noodles for him.

189
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,960
You were ill for so long

190
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,480
but why didn't you send me any update?

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,360
I was so worried

192
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,840
that I almost sent a physician to you.

193
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,200
My mother heard you had a coma for five days

194
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
and was very worried

195
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,960
so she had me take Physician Wu here.

196
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,800
I'm sorry. It won't happen next time.

197
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,520
Next time?

198
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
You think I've lived too long, don't you?

199
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,240
It was a slip of the tongue. I'm sorry.

200
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,640
Mistress, don't be angry.

201
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,280
Of course, I'm not.

202
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,280
Mistress.

203
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,760
I'll remember everything you told me.

204
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,080
Take care of yourself.

205
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,760
You too.

206
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,880
It's getting late, so I must go now.

207
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,360
You should take an early rest.

208
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,800
I'll come visit you another day.

209
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,080
All right. Be careful on your way.

210
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,560
I will.

211
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,160
Mother, it's getting late

212
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
so I won't bother you anymore.

213
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,520
Go on.

214
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,880
Sister-in-law...

215
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Sister-in-law.

216
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,960
Sister-in-law.

217
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Hua Qian.

218
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Hua Qian.

219
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
Hua Qian.

220
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,720
Lord, what are you doing?

221
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
It is improper for men and women to touch

222
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,480
not to mention I'm your sister-in-law.

223
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,960
Are you trying to put me in a tough spot?

224
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
I called you a few times just now

225
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
but you pretended not to hear me.

226
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,360
Why are you blaming me now?

227
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,440
Lord, did you just call me?

228
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,520
I was thinking about Master

229
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
so I hurried along and missed it.

230
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,440
Didn't you ask for a divorce a few days ago?

231
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,800
Why are you still using him as an excuse?

232
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,680
You're a busy man.

233
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
You shouldn't poke your nose

234
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
into someone else's family affairs.

235
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,080
What's wrong with you today?

236
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,880
As if someone has made you angry.

237
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,120
Lord, if you've nothing else to tell me

238
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,400
I'd like to leave now.

239
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,600
Why don't you let me finish my speech?

240
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,600
Earlier, what I meant by

241
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,120
cherish your life is...

242
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,000
If you sincerely want me to cherish my life

243
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,000
you shouldn't bother me here.

244
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,600
There are so many people in Zhong's Garden.

245
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,800
Have you ever considered

246
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,000
the situation I'll be in

247
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,360
when others see us?

248
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,920
No one has the nerve to talk about us.

249
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,880
No one would do that to you, Lord

250
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,120
but what about me?

251
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,480
I've already lost Master's heart.

252
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,080
My father is also getting on with age.

253
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,600
And my brother has accomplished nothing.

254
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,560
As a woman, I'm alone and helpless

255
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,160
and of course,

256
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,600
you won't understand my difficulties.

257
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,880
The way you've expressed your situation

258
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,080
do you still think that I'm testing you?

259
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,840
Forget it.

260
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,120
Mistress, why are you so bold today?

261
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,960
That's our lord.

262
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,840
Of course, I know that.

263
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,400
Precisely because he's the lord

264
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,400
I had to say what I said to let him know

265
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,360
that now he doesn't need to use me

266
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
to suppress my family.

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,080
Let's get out of here quickly.

268
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,240
Why?

269
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,040
I was angry at being tested by him

270
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,240
so my tone wasn't nice.

271
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,000
He might punish me when he realises that.

272
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,200
Hurry up.

273
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,840
This is something new.

274
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,960
Miss, don't forget your father's instruction.

275
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,080
Stay out of other people's business.

276
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
You don't need to remind me.

277
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,240
Looking at Qian today

278
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,720
she doesn't seem to care about Yelan at all.

279
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Maybe Mistress is still angry.

280
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,880
If that is so

281
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,640
she'd have complained.

282
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,440
You also saw how I brought him up today

283
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,480
but she didn't want to talk about him.

284
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,080
Your Highness, do you want to meet Master?

285
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,920
It's indeed a bit unreasonable for Yelan

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,440
to neglect Qian

287
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,960
but after all, I'm only his elder

288
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,360
and they didn't ask for my help.

289
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,160
If I meddle in their business

290
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,920
then I'll be a nuisance.

291
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,720
Your Highness.

292
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,040
Master's parents died young.

293
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,160
The former Lord and you

294
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,280
have treated him

295
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,560
as your own son since he was a child.

296
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,160
He wouldn't think of you as a nuisance.

297
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,840
Besides, as long as they're still married

298
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,680
they'll get back together.

299
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,680
Qian's a smart girl

300
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,440
but...

301
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,120
What a pity.

302
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,040
Mother, it's getting late

303
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,240
so I won't bother you anymore.

304
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,680
Your Highness.

305
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
Your Highness.

306
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
What's wrong?

307
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,480
Nothing.

308
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,320
I'm probably thinking too much.

309
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,440
I'm full. Clear the table.

310
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,520
Yes, Mistress.

311
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,200
Mistress

312
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
when I was checking our inventory today

313
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,600
I saw the <i>guqin</i>, chess, and writing tools

314
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,320
that Master gave you are all dusty.

315
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,400
You used to fiddle with them when idle.

316
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,320
Why don't I bring them to you

317
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,920
to kill time, Mistress?

318
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Qianzhi.

319
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,960
How do you think I treated Zhong Yelan

320
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,200
before I got married?

321
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,360
It's okay. You can speak freely.

322
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,920
Mistress, you love Master so much.

323
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,200
He likes playing chess

324
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,680
so you learnt from many teachers how to play.

325
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,280
He likes to listen to <i>guqin</i>

326
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,600
so you did everything to master it.

327
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,440
He appreciates good handwriting

328
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,120
so you insist on practising

329
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
regardless if the weather was hot or cold

330
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,440
If he casually

331
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,320
praised a girl's painting skills

332
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
and you'd visit her

333
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,400
to make her acquaintance

334
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,720
and learn from her.

335
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,080
That's right.

336
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,960
I didn't learn all of those things

337
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,720
because I like them

338
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,800
so now I don't want to touch them anymore.

339
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,680
Maybe he's just a little upset.

340
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,360
Do you want to make an apology to him?

341
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,440
I really hope that he can get angry

342
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,240
and hold on to my faults.

343
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,160
I wish he had...

344
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,880
divorce me

345
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,200
so that I don't have to rack my brains

346
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
to figure out how to force him to do so.

347
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,600
What did you just say, Mistress?

348
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,160
Mistress.

349
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,080
A maid from Hua Residence came

350
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,640
and said Butler Hua requested

351
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,240
for your visit tomorrow.

352
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,680
I should do that.

353
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Qian.

354
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,960
Qian, do you like the jewellery I sent you?

355
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Yes.

356
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,560
Then why aren't you wearing it?

357
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
The ones I bought for you

358
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
are all unique and exquisite.

359
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
They match your beauty

360
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,040
and you'll outshine everyone else.

361
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,720
The emerald I got you...

362
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,280
I know. Look.

363
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,920
This is from you. I'm wearing it.

364
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,640
Did I give you this bangle?

365
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,320
Just calm down and talk to her.

366
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
Rest assured.

367
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,280
Don't get angry.

368
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,200
Father.

369
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,800
Mother.

370
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,440
My child...

371
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
I haven't seen you for a while.

372
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,440
Why have you lost so much weight?

373
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,480
Are you ill-treated by Master?

374
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,000
Just tell me.

375
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,200
I was wrong about him

376
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,880
that cold-blooded and ruthless man.

377
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,000
My dear, let her sit first.

378
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Take a seat.

379
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,720
Qian.

380
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
Have you recovered?

381
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm fine.

382
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,920
I heard that

383
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,640
you asked for a divorce?

384
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,920
—Yes.                  —Why did you do that?

385
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,280
You are not a child anymore.

386
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,000
Yet you're still so wilful.

387
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,320
Why did you scold me without asking me why?

388
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
What else could the reason be?

389
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,120
It's because I'd spoilt you too much.

390
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,040
—My dear...    —That's why you're so wilful.

391
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,160
My dear!

392
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,520
Qian is still young.

393
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,800
Be more patient with her.

394
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,040
Have a sip of water.

395
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,480
Have a sip of water and calm down.

396
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Qian.

397
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,600
The master did do something wrong this time.

398
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,800
But you had wanted to marry him so badly.

399
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Right?

400
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,880
How can you still be so wilful?

401
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,120
The key to maintaining a marriage is to...

402
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,640
When I wanted to stay here for a while

403
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,000
both of you also reprimanded me

404
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,400
without asking me why.

405
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,600
And now, it's the same.

406
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,800
Do you see me as your daughter first?

407
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,680
Or as the mistress of Zhong Residence?

408
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,960
Of course, it's the former.

409
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,640
In my view, it's good for you to divorce.

410
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,080
You're so beautiful

411
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,680
and many people fancy you.

412
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,240
You shouldn't remain there to be ill-treated.

413
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,600
Shut up.

414
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,200
You're in no place to speak!

415
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,040
All you do is play.

416
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,640
If you were more responsible

417
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,760
I wouldn't have to work so hard

418
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,600
for the family!

419
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,360
If I knew you'd turn out like this

420
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,240
I'd rather not have a son!

421
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
My dear.

422
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,480
Father, tell me.

423
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,040
What do you work so hard for?

424
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,440
Do you want

425
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,160
to hold sole power in Zhong Residence

426
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,960
or do you want our family to be safe and happy?

427
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,640
What are you talking about?

428
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,520
I've never understood your mind

429
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,480
so I want to hear it from you.

430
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,880
What's your intention behind that question?

431
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,720
Since you didn't answer me

432
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,200
then let me guess.

433
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,920
I assume what you want

434
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,280
is the former, right?

435
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,360
You said what you do is for this family.

436
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,640
But you didn't teach your son well

437
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,960
and watched him become a degenerate.

438
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,560
Then you saw your daughter being wronged

439
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,520
and reproached her with no rhyme or reason.

440
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,000
To you

441
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,640
am I only the wife of Zhong Yelan?

442
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,200
Qian, that's not the way to talk to your father.

443
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,400
What's wrong with what I said?

444
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,360
I've already broken up with Zhong Yelan

445
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,240
and he lets me stay on out of obligation.

446
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,680
Why can't I want to leave?

447
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Do I have to waste my life there?

448
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,880
Weren't you the one

449
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,280
who wanted to marry him so badly before?

450
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,920
Do you regret it now?

451
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,720
Yes.

452
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,880
I was the one who wanted to marry him

453
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,040
and pretended to be his childhood sweetheart.

454
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,600
I even drugged him to marry me.

455
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,520
What you taught me

456
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,720
since I was a child

457
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,320
is that I should fight for everything I want

458
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,520
at all costs.

459
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,480
I listened, remembered

460
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,600
and executed it.

461
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,400
But I was young and naive

462
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,520
and didn't know right from wrong.

463
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,200
I let my emotions run everything.

464
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,480
You're aware.

465
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,640
But don't you know

466
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,480
that what I did is wrong?

467
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,280
You've always been omnipotent in my mind

468
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,680
so why didn't you stop me

469
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,600
when I pretended to be someone else?

470
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,640
When I wanted to drug Zhong Yelan

471
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,920
why didn't you tell me

472
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,080
that a woman shouldn't be so despicable?

473
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,840
Parents

474
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,400
should correct their children

475
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,600
when they're on the wrong track, right?

476
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,920
Mother may be a simple woman

477
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
and have limited knowledge

478
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,200
but, Father...

479
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,400
why do you not teach us right from wrong?

480
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Father.

481
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,680
You may not care about

482
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,920
what I did in the past at all.

483
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,720
After all, all you wanted was

484
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,760
to become the butler.

485
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,280
You've never truly cared about us.

486
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Qian.

487
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,320
Qian.

488
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,720
You're getting brazen, I see.

489
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,120
All right. Listen up.

490
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,400
If I didn't fight for the butler position

491
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,960
do you think our family

492
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,320
can live so comfortably?

493
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,120
Do you think you and your brother

494
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,080
can have anything you want?

495
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,080
You've enjoyed all the benefits

496
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,880
and now you blame me for neglecting you?

497
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,600
Who are you to do that?

498
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,960
My dear...

499
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Of course, I cannot blame you

500
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,040
but I just wanted to tell you

501
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,840
how I truly feel now.

502
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,760
If I say that all I want

503
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,960
is for the family to live well

504
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,600
will you listen to me?

505
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,640
If you want to prove

506
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,080
that everything you did is only for our sake

507
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,160
then you might as well resign.

508
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,920
The money I have

509
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,360
together with our family fortune

510
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,880
is enough to open a little fragrance shop

511
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,480
in a tiny place

512
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,080
without worries about food and lodging

513
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,200
for the rest of our lives.

514
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,080
That's way happier than serving the lord

515
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
in constant fear for our lives.

516
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,320
Happier?

517
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,040
All you think about is your own happiness.

518
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,440
Fine.

519
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,200
If I resign from my job

520
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,160
who will protect your wayward brother

521
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
in the future?

522
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,960
I let you marry into the Zhong family

523
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,760
because you could help him out

524
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,120
if he's down and out

525
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,720
after we've passed on.

526
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,280
But all you do is throw tantrums

527
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,000
without thinking about others at all.

528
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,600
My dear...

529
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,320
So, after all,

530
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,960
you aren't willing to give up

531
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,240
the position of the butler

532
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,880
and my brother is just your excuse.

533
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
Father.

534
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,360
Do you know that this enviable job

535
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,800
is also a hot potato?

536
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,880
If you can do anything

537
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,640
to get rid of peers for this position

538
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
they can do the same to you.

539
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,120
If you fall from this pedestal eventually

540
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,480
do you know what awaits our family?

541
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,360
Prosperity also comes with loss.

542
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,160
By then, no one in our family

543
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,680
can get away from it.

544
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,800
If you continue to obsess

545
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,320
over power and wealth

546
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,280
it will only bring our family to a bad end

547
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,440
in the future.

548
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,840
What are you saying?

549
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,360
Bring our family to a bad end?

550
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
—My dear!                           —Father!

551
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
—Father.       —What a disobedient daughter!

552
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
My dear, calm down!

553
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,520
Despite all these years of raising you

554
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,240
all I get is disobedience from you!

555
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,840
I really don't want to see you again.

556
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,960
Get out of here!

557
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,480
—Now!                              —My dear!

558
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
My dear, calm down!

559
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,560
Qian, stop.

560
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,480
My dear, calm down!

561
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,360
Qian... hurry up.

562
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,640
Get your sister out of here.

563
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Looks like

564
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,960
no agreement could be reached

565
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,600
between us today.

566
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,920
If you insist on being the butler

567
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,440
then please forgive me for being disobedient.

568
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,840
This is the end of my advice to you.

569
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Qian...

570
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Take care of your sister.

571
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,760
Qian, go back and take good care of yourself.

572
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,800
—Qian...         —Rest well! Do you hear me?

573
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,040
Don't come back here again.

574
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,720
All right, my dear.

575
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Calm down.

576
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,040
Qian...

577
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,040
Qian.

578
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,240
You shouldn't talk back to Father.

579
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Look at how mad he got.

580
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,760
Why don't you go back and apologise to him?

581
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,760
Do you also think

582
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,320
that I did wrong today?

583
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,160
Do you want to live a life

584
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,480
with power and wealth

585
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,440
but full of infighting

586
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,160
or live in peace in the countryside?

587
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,440
Why do we have to choose?

588
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,600
With Father around, what are we afraid of?

589
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,880
Why do we have to live a life

590
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,720
in the countryside?

591
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,240
So you're still used to the days of wealth

592
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,160
and power

593
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,440
and don't want to be an ordinary person

594
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,760
and live an ordinary life?

595
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,400
Life is pretty good now.

596
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,520
You worry too much.

597
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,760
<i>Hua Residence</i>

598
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,560
Sure enough

599
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,200
no one in our family listens to me

600
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,760
or believes me.

601
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Let's leave.

602
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,560
Qian...

603
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
Master.

604
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,400
Who did it?

605
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,800
What do you think?

606
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,440
Not many people can slap me, right?

607
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,960
You're still the mistress of Zhong Residence.

608
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,960
Don't let others bully you in the future

609
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,280
lest you disgrace me.

610
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,440
Did you just show concern for me?

611
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,680
What are you doing?

612
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,720
I want you to know something, Master.

613
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,440
—You!                    —Do you see it now?

614
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,440
If you insist on keeping me here

615
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,320
I won't be able to tolerate any eyesore

616
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,800
and it'd be absolutely impossible for me

617
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,640
to live a quiet and peaceful life here.

618
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,400
I was just telling the truth.

619
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,880
Why did he hit me so hard?

620
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,920
Mistress, do you really want a divorce?

621
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,480
Divorce?

622
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,360
I want to divorce but it's not that easy.

623
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,400
After all, if I ask for a divorce

624
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,440
it'll bring disgrace to Master.

625
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,320
He even said that he'd see past my faults.

626
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,120
All I did was talk to my father

627
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,760
and see how I end up like this.

628
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,720
Then, Mistress...

629
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,200
why did you do that to Master just now?

630
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,560
I have no way to ask for a divorce

631
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,800
so I can only force him to propose it.

632
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,680
By the way

633
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
how's your investigation coming along?

634
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,000
You don't want me to intervene

635
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,240
but I haven't heard any updates from you.

636
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,280
I came to tell you this.

637
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,560
My father just sent me a letter.

638
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,400
He found out a kind of fragrance formula

639
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,560
which can make inferior aquilaria incense

640
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,880
pass off as the real deal.

641
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,000
Even a master

642
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,160
with decades of experience in fragrance

643
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,320
cannot tell the difference

644
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,040
that's why my father fell for it.

645
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,440
This technique is...

646
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,040
It was the same technique

647
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,640
used by the Ge family.

648
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,800
It was only after I heard the conversation

649
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
between you and the lord that day

650
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,960
that I had a clue.

651
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,320
Are you implying that

652
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,960
escaped Ge family members are involved in it?

653
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,320
But why did they set your family up?

654
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,240
I have no idea.

655
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,040
But there was something wrong with the broker

656
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,760
who once delivered furniture

657
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,880
containing aquilaria incense powder

658
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,000
to our mansion.

659
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,280
After my family was arrested and imprisoned

660
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,040
she seemed to disappear into thin air.

661
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,240
No one can find her, dead or alive.

662
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,000
Lately, I spoke with Hua Qian's maids.

663
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,400
This matter is very complicated.

664
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,600
She's probably not the mastermind

665
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,440
but at most an accomplice.

666
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
But the Hua family may have bad blood

667
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,560
with the Ge family.

668
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,680
Then, have you ever considered

669
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,360
that maybe Hua Qian just unintentionally

670
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,800
referred a bad broker to you

671
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,520
and has nothing to do with this?

672
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,120
Master, you've never seen her

673
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,840
categorically deny this matter

674
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,280
nor watched how she rejected me

675
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,960
when I asked her for the truth

676
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,320
so I understand why you'd think that way.

677
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,400
I didn't mean that.

678
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,720
What I'm investigating is very difficult.

679
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,200
If you can't bear it

680
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,320
and doesn't want to continue with it

681
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,120
I won't force you to help me.

682
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
No.

683
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Since it's an unjust case

684
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,800
I need to find out the truth.

685
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,840
You can order Nanfeng if you need help.

686
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,240
As for Hua Qian...

687
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,680
Mistress, Mrs Hua sent you a letter again.

688
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,120
Put it aside.

689
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Okay.

690
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,480
Mistress.

691
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,360
Mrs Hua has written to you for several days.

692
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,080
Just take a look.

693
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,280
She just wants me to go back

694
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,800
and apologise to my father

695
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,240
so it's okay not to read them.

696
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Mistress, are you not going to talk to him again?

697
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,840
Of course not.

698
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,840
I just want them to know where I stand.

699
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,040
Even if I can't change their views immediately

700
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,000
it'll have a little influence on them.

701
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,840
Mistress, Nanfeng is here.

702
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Why is he here again?

703
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,960
What's the matter this time?

704
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Let him in.

705
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,320
Greetings, Mistress.

706
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,200
What's wrong?

707
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,320
Is there any problem in the household?

708
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
No...

709
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,120
I'm here just to tell you

710
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,040
that the incense banquet is in three days

711
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,040
and Master wants you to attend it with him

712
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,240
at Zhong's Garden.

713
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,640
Who's going to be there?

714
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,600
Supervisors from all over the country

715
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,320
the Wu family and other suppliers

716
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,920
who work with the Zhong family.

717
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,400
<i>The Wu family?</i>

718
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,080
<i>Is it finally happening?</i>

719
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,000
Mistress, do you have any questions?

720
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,240
Why does Master want me to attend?

721
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,320
It's such a big affair

722
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,680
of course, you should attend it with Master.

723
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,400
<i>Bonus footage</i>

724
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,400
You?

725
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,800
After so many years, you returned?

726
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,800
I want you to make me something.

727
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,840
And I was just wondering

728
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,440
why you came to me.

729
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
It turns out

730
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,920
that you want something from me.

731
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,320
Any price is acceptable.

732
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,320
Why do you speak like we're strangers?

733
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,320
I was your master for a few years after all.

734
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,040
Isn't that right, my good apprentice?
