00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,520
<i>Episode 21</i>

2
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,280
How stupid I must have been

3
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,880
to have lost to you previously.

4
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,800
You are proud and egoistic.

5
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,120
You would rather suffer than lose your dignity.

6
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,480
You always blame others but yourself

7
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
when things go wrong.

8
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,880
Is Zhong Yelan the only man in this vast world?

9
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,560
Can't you live without him?

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,440
You live in such a small world!

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,920
Who are you to criticise me?

12
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,280
Weren't you the same?

13
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,440
It's not that I can't live without him.

14
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,440
I merely wanted to know about his feelings.

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,720
On the cliff that day, I was waiting

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
for him to make a choice.

17
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
If he chose you, I would jump off the cliff

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,400
and stop being infatuated with him.

19
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,480
—If he...            —What's your mouth for?

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,040
Why didn't you ask him?

21
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
If you want to break up, break up.

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,920
What's all the fanfare about?

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,160
Clearly, you couldn't bear to break up with him

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,560
but you just wouldn't admit it.

25
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,160
Didn't you lure me here to hear me say this?

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
The more tragic I am, the happier you are.

27
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,120
I have no interest in your tragedy.

28
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,200
You are here now

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,040
because of your scheme

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
to sound Zhong Yelan out

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,520
which led to my brother's death.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
I...

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,840
I had no intention to harm any of you.

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,720
—It's just that someone else...     —I know.

35
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
If not for your scheming

36
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
no one could get a chance.

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,520
So, you have to bear some responsibility

38
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,240
for my brother's death.

39
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,080
Now, you know how I felt.

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,200
You're now grieving for your brother.

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,440
When my maid Lingong died

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
I was just as heartbroken

43
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,640
that I couldn't eat or sleep.

44
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,880
She was like a family member to me.

45
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,280
And Hua Shen caused her death.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,880
So, an eye for an eye.

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,000
We are even now.

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,480
I won't go after the Hua family from now on.

49
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
No, we're not even.

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
I fell off the cliff because of your ploy.

51
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
I nearly died.

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,720
I have surveyed the mountain.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There is a lake below us

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,280
and thick vines growing along the cliff side.

55
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,440
You wouldn't have died.

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,120
Besides, I never thought

57
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,480
of throwing you down.

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,800
I was just...

59
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,800
building a gold bridge for myself.

60
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,080
So what?

61
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,000
In the end, I was the one who fell off the cliff.

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,480
Then, what do you want?

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,680
Take my life?

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,320
Your life is worthless.

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,680
I want to know the mastermind

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
behind the other group.

67
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,080
How would I know who they are?

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,440
If you don't, investigate and find out.

69
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,200
Aren't you always persistent?

70
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,520
What happened to your self-confidence?

71
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,280
You have to clean up the mess you created.

72
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,600
I am telling you

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,800
Wu Shuomo is not getting any food.

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,920
So, you'd better hurry

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,360
in case he starves to death.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
Are you sure you're going to let Junior Lord Wu

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,960
die in your custody?

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,240
Who said he was Junior Lord Wu?

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
The man I caught

80
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,640
is a runaway slave of our household.

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,760
—You...        —Have you come to a decision?

82
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
Leave when you have. I won't see you off.

83
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
Lord.

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,480
What's wrong? Why are you so flustered?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Lord.

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,440
New information has been discovered

87
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
about the banquet assassination.

88
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,000
How dare they? What nerve they have!

89
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,760
Lord, we can't confront the culprit

90
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,920
based on the information given by the spies.

91
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,920
Otherwise, it would imply that

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,360
the Zhong family's spies are all over the city.

93
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,880
How did I not see it?

94
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,640
Lately, something is brewing

95
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,800
inside and outside of Huangcheng.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,680
It's the same in the South as well.

97
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,400
But they haven't made any moves so far.

98
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,560
On the other hand, the remnants of the Ge family

99
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,720
have not given up the fight.

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,840
Given the simmering dangers underneath

101
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,280
we must avoid hasty actions

102
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
that could lower the morale of our men.

103
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,480
Of course, I know that!

104
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,280
This is precisely why

105
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,040
they are so arrogant and conceited!

106
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,920
Off you go.

107
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Yes, Lord.

108
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,760
How audacious...

109
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,280
they are!

110
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,600
I'll go to bed soon.

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,280
The uninvited guest has already left.

112
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,600
You don't have to guard the compound anymore.

113
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,480
I want to kill someone.

114
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,520
I can help.

115
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,840
You haven't asked who the person is.

116
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,960
What if he was a dignitary?

117
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,040
If you want to kill someone, I will help you.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,080
You're still a kid.

119
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,440
Don't keep talking about killing.

120
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm not a kid anymore.

121
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
I have killed someone before.

122
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
I know that.

123
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
No, you don't.

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,400
Fine... I don't know, okay?

125
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,720
The older you get

126
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,440
the more you like to argue with me.

127
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,120
Go back to sleep early.

128
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,320
Your people are still here.

129
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,240
I suppose it's not difficult to find out.

130
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,480
Yes, we can find out more

131
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,840
but we can't stand by and do nothing

132
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,240
while our master is captured?

133
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,520
I know Hua Qian well.

134
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,840
She won't harm your master just yet.

135
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,520
But if you continue to drag your feet

136
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,280
I can't guarantee she won't harm him.

137
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,960
Concubine Mu, I need your advice.

138
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,920
Where do we start to investigate?

139
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,040
Ferret out the rat within your group.

140
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,000
Check who the traitor is.

141
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,520
Aren't you going to show yourself, Master?

142
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,800
If I didn't make a sound

143
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,680
how long would you stay in hiding?

144
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Till you talk to me voluntarily.

145
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
Master, do you mean

146
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,640
if I decide to keep it from you

147
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,160
you will never ask?

148
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,480
Haven't I been doing that?

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,160
The issue with Hua Shen

150
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,280
the banquet assassins

151
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,760
and between you and Wu Shuomo.

152
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
You keep saying no one will understand

153
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,680
the bad blood between you and Hua Qian.

154
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,840
If I get involved, you'll think that I'm biased.

155
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,360
So I did what you wanted.

156
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
But, Yao

157
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,640
how much longer do you want me

158
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,880
to pretend to be dumb and blind?

159
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,320
At first, you told me

160
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,240
you were trying to clear your family's name.

161
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
But what about now?

162
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,760
What exactly are you doing?

163
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
Zhong Yelan.

164
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I don't know what is wrong with me.

165
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,600
Lately, I have been thinking about this.

166
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,560
I wish I had let the snake eat that parrot.

167
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,000
Yao.

168
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,840
I just want to tell you

169
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,480
that there are only you and me in this house

170
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,080
and it will be the same in the future.

171
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,600
I'm saying this from the bottom of my heart.

172
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,960
So, you don't have to go far to get help.

173
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
I did something wrong.

174
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,360
No one is perfect. To err is human.

175
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
I, too, have erred

176
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,280
because of misjudgment and prejudice.

177
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,440
I know you are stubborn

178
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,680
but know that you don't have to

179
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
face your problems alone.

180
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,360
As long as you need me

181
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,280
I'm here for you.

182
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,320
It's not too late to turn back.

183
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,200
What's the matter?

184
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,840
Mistr... Miss Hua left in a hurry

185
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,160
and forgot this <i>guqin.</i>

186
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,000
I saw it so I brought it here for her.

187
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,320
Don't you know that Miss Hua's hand

188
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,880
was ruined by your master?

189
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,600
Are you trying to make her sad

190
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,040
by bringing this <i>guqin</i> here?

191
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,600
Miss Qianzhi, wait a minute.

192
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
What else do you want?

193
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,880
This is a famous and priceless <i>guqin.</i>

194
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,400
If it were an ordinary thing

195
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,120
I wouldn't send it here.

196
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,080
Priceless?

197
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Priceless?

198
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Give it to me.

199
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Miss.

200
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,560
Still no news from Mu Yao?

201
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,200
It's only the third day.

202
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,120
She probably hasn't found any clues yet.

203
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,760
I'm not keeping watch on her.

204
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,600
Who knows if she's even investigating?

205
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,360
That man is still confined

206
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,120
so Mu Yao probably won't sit on it.

207
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
She is too slow.

208
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,480
Do you think I should send her

209
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,840
a body part of Wu Shuomo

210
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,040
to help speed up her investigation?

211
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
Well...

212
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,640
Miss, Butler Hua is here.

213
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,320
Are you not going to the shop today, Father?

214
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,320
Qian, do you want to eat some fish today?

215
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Fish?

216
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Yesterday, I saw that

217
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,000
the fish in the lake look big and fat.

218
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,760
And you have nothing to do today.

219
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,480
How about going fishing with me?

220
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,640
Didn't the chefs buy any fish?

221
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
This is different.

222
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,840
The ones bought by the chefs

223
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,840
can't compare to those we caught.

224
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,400
You will know the difference

225
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,600
when you eat them tonight.

226
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,640
—Will you go with me?            —All right.

227
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,400
Not a single fish take the bait.

228
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,240
Patience is key when it comes to fishing.

229
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
You have to be calm.

230
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,360
The fish got startled

231
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,000
when you kept moving the fishing rod.

232
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,640
There's no way you'll catch any fish.

233
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
You didn't catch one either, Father.

234
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,120
It takes time.

235
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
It's moving.

236
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Here comes one!

237
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
See?

238
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,200
I caught one when you said I didn't.

239
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Hold this. See that?

240
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,680
The fish looks so succulent.

241
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,440
Qian.

242
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,280
As long as the bait is fat and succulent

243
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,680
no fish can resist it.

244
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Come on.

245
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Here we go.

246
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,240
Youth is synonymous with impatience.

247
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,840
You just need more practice.

248
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Thank you for your advice, Father.

249
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,120
Your mother hasn't had much of an appetite

250
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,480
so she has lost a lot of weight.

251
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,240
Visit her more frequently

252
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,280
when you are free.

253
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,720
Maybe later.

254
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,760
I have been so busy these days

255
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,240
it's hard for me to control my emotions.

256
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,280
Going to see Mother like this

257
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,760
might upset her even more.

258
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,400
That's fine. It's up to you.

259
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,280
Miss, the kitchen sent you fish soup.

260
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,600
Wait a minute.

261
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,680
A girl brought up in a rich and powerful family

262
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,480
always looks at the bigger picture.

263
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,320
No matter what my daughter does

264
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,920
she is the only daughter of the Hua family

265
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,320
and the wife of Master Zhong.

266
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,360
What brings you here, Mother?

267
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,960
Look at what you did.

268
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,760
You brought shame upon our family.

269
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,440
Now, we only have you.

270
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,400
You don't want to stay in Huangcheng.

271
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Fine, we won't.

272
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
From now on

273
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,480
I'll heed your advice.

274
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,520
You told me you wouldn't hurt me again

275
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,200
and I almost believed you.

276
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,280
I wanted to believe that

277
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,240
that you might not be involved

278
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,680
in my family's case.

279
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,360
But what happened to Linglong

280
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
made me realise that I could never forgive you.

281
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,560
Numerous people have experienced hardships

282
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,160
at the hands of the Hua family

283
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,800
and it has gone unnoticed.

284
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,480
You are a member of the Hua family.

285
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,560
That makes you uncaring and selfish too.

286
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
You can pretend you don't know it

287
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,240
because you don't see it, but...

288
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
I can't.

289
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,560
Where's the fish soup?

290
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,120
Bring it here.

291
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,280
Yes, Miss.

292
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,360
I will leave that to you then.

293
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,680
Miss Hua

294
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,920
are you going to sell all the shops you have?

295
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That's...

296
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,480
I heard from my father that

297
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,960
he assigned you to work for my brother

298
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,800
because you are smart

299
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,200
and can control my spendthrift of a brother.

300
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,080
I told you to sell the shops

301
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,000
not to make profits

302
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,600
but to exchange them for cash

303
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
to prepare for...

304
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,440
the future.

305
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,640
Just do your best.

306
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,200
Yes, Miss. I'll see to it.

307
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,520
I've already informed the shop managers

308
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,680
that you would go there.

309
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Off you go now.

310
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Yes, Miss.

311
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,960
Are you done yet?

312
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,360
You delivered the <i>guqin</i> last month

313
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,800
the chess pieces a few days ago

314
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,360
and now the chessboard.

315
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,120
Can't you deliver them all at once?

316
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,240
I was careless when I was tidying up

317
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,320
and didn't notice them all at once.

318
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,520
So I'm delivering them to Miss Hua

319
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,720
when I see them.

320
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,520
Miss has sent people to collect her things.

321
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,040
Since she left these there

322
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,400
it means she doesn't want them.

323
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,920
That's improper.

324
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,720
They belong to Miss Hua.

325
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,280
They should be returned to their owner.

326
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,600
Don't come here anymore.

327
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,320
On behalf of Miss Hua

328
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,800
I'm telling you, she doesn't want those things.

329
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,280
Why not? There are still the brushes and ink.

330
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
I...

331
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Didn't you say that you would deliver the items

332
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
if you saw them?

333
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
You didn't forget the brushes and ink.

334
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,920
Why didn't you bring them over together?

335
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
I...

336
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,360
Listen up, Nanfeng.

337
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,800
Even if Miss Hua is no longer your master's wife

338
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
you don't stand a chance at all.

339
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,320
So, quit finding excuses to come here.

340
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,840
What did you say?

341
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
I said there was no way

342
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
Miss Hua would be interested in you

343
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,120
so stop your wishful thinking.

344
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,040
No, I'm not interested in Miss Hua...

345
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,640
When we were in Zhong Residence

346
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,080
you always found excuses

347
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,320
to come to our compound.

348
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,680
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.

349
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,480
I thought we were both servants

350
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,040
so I didn't expose you.

351
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
But I didn't expect you to push your luck

352
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,360
so I have to give you a firm warning.

353
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,240
No, I...

354
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,080
Stop denying it.

355
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,320
No matter what, you work for Master Zhong

356
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,520
and Miss Hua can never be yours.

357
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,920
I never had any improper thoughts

358
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,560
about Miss Hua.

359
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,120
I saw right through you.

360
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,240
This concerns Miss Hua's reputation

361
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,880
so I won't breathe a word about this.

362
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,200
But spare me your lies.

363
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,360
I will take the chessboard this time.

364
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,800
Please watch what you do from now on.

365
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Stop coming here.

366
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,720
Miss Qianzhi...

367
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,120
How dare you lay your hands on me?

368
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,240
Don't go too far!

369
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,280
As I said, I won't breathe a word about this.

370
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,440
—Let go of me.                —Miss Qianzhi.

371
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
You're the one I fancy.

372
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
Over here.

373
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,040
Right. You missed a spot.

374
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,720
Qianzhi.

375
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Qianzhi!

376
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,880
Did the pot of flowers offend you?

377
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
What's wrong with her?

378
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,320
She's been out of sorts all day long.

379
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,360
It seems that you know what happened.

380
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,080
Tell me what I don't know.

381
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,920
I saw that Nanfeng had been coming

382
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,120
to the back door lately

383
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
to look for Qianzhi.

384
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,280
Nanfeng? What did he want?

385
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,640
He seemed to be delivering things

386
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
you had left behind.

387
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't think I've left anything behind

388
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
at Zhong Residence.

389
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,240
What else is there...

390
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,480
When we were living in Zhong Residence

391
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,640
Nanfeng had come to our compound

392
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,840
quite frequently.

393
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,400
Qianzhi has been like this

394
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,120
since he came to look for her yesterday.

395
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,280
It seems that Nanfeng has other intentions.

396
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,280
Qianzhi didn't mention a word

397
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,880
about Nanfeng's visits.

398
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,160
I'm afraid this girl is also...

399
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,040
Zhong Yelan's guard and my maid.

400
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,520
What an unusual pairing.

401
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,520
They didn't seem to talk to each other much.

402
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,360
Don't tell me I played a role

403
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,680
in bringing them together?

404
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,800
But, Miss, she...

405
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,360
You don't have to worry.

406
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,440
Qianzhi has her life. I shouldn't interfere.

407
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,240
After so many days of boredom

408
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,960
there is finally some good news.

409
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,400
But, Nanfeng works for Master Zhong.

410
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,440
Yinxing, I know what you're worried about.

411
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,920
But I know Qianzhi well

412
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,640
and you girls are now at a marriageable age.

413
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,280
As long as you're sure of what you want

414
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,200
whoever they are, I will support you.

415
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,320
I won't stop you because of their status.

416
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,320
Life is short.

417
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,360
Your own happiness is of utmost importance.

418
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,240
Got it, Miss.

419
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,000
We don't have much time. I should ask her.

420
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,080
M-Miss, are you looking for me?

421
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,720
You're deep in thought in the broad daylight.

422
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,360
That was wrong of you.

423
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,000
How could you keep it from me?

424
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
What?

425
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,400
If I don't ask

426
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,040
are you ever going to tell me about

427
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,160
between you and Nanfeng?

428
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,800
There is nothing between Nanfeng and me!

429
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,160
I deserve to die.

430
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,280
<i>She doesn't look like she's in love.</i>

431
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,320
Hua Rongzhou, come here.

432
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,400
Come on. Go with me to scare someone.

433
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,800
Greetings, Miss Hua.

434
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,840
Lift your head.

435
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,200
I heard you had been coming to Hua Residence

436
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,440
to look for Qianzhi.

437
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,560
Miss Hua, I went to send you

438
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,320
the things you left behind.

439
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,920
Is that so?

440
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't recall leaving anything behind.

441
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,840
Those were gifts from Master.

442
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,000
How dare you, Nanfeng!

443
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,520
I thought you were an honest man.

444
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,080
I didn't expect you to come up with that excuse

445
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,480
and meet my maid in secret at Hua Residence.

446
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,680
Miss Hua, Miss Qianzhi and I have never...

447
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,440
Stop lying! You came to Hua Residence openly.

448
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,840
The two of you must have been intimate!

449
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
I have sincere feelings for Miss Qianzhi

450
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,160
but she is unaware of them.

451
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,080
So, there's no way we would be intimate.

452
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,640
This is the truth, Miss.

453
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,720
For real?

454
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,280
Miss Qianzhi is your personal maid.

455
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,480
If we're in a relationship

456
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,800
we can't hide it from you.

457
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,400
This is just my wishful thinking.

458
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,840
Miss Qianzhi said...

459
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,200
she wouldn't see me anymore.

460
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

461
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,520
I'm not talking nonsense.

462
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,000
You work for Master Zhong.

463
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,800
Miss Hua is in a sorry state because of him.

464
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,640
I'm being nice by coming out here to see you.

465
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,960
How dare you say such nonsense?

466
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,680
I...

467
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,240
Don't come here ever again.

468
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Qian...

469
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,920
<i>These two fools.</i>

470
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,600
If Qianzhi didn't have any feelings for you

471
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,360
why would she not tell me about your visits

472
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,240
but went to see you in private?

473
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,920
Miss Qianzhi scolded me every time she saw me.

474
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,040
She said I insisted on seeing her

475
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,080
so she had no choice but came out to meet me.

476
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,600
If she was really angry with you

477
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,720
why didn't she just send someone

478
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,840
to drive you away?

479
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,320
Why did she still go out and see you?

480
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,000
Miss Hua...

481
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,400
Forget it.

482
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,120
I won't pursue the matter

483
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,720
on account of you...

484
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,760
taking my brother back to Hua Residence.

485
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,920
I owe you a favour.

486
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
So, I will pay you back now.

487
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,480
Miss, do you mean you will give me Miss Qianzhi

488
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,800
as a reward?

489
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,920
I have never regarded Qianzhi as a maid

490
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,040
so the word "reward" is not appropriate.

491
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,080
I won't stand in your way.

492
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,240
That's the least I could do.

493
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,280
Do what you need to do.

494
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,680
Thank you, Miss.

495
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,080
I want to ask you a question before you go.

496
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,760
If you had to choose

497
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,280
between your master and Qianzhi

498
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,760
who would you choose?

499
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,480
Why are you asking me such a question?

500
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,960
Qianzhi has been with me

501
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,200
for more than a decade.

502
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,200
I don't want to see her suffer.

503
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,080
As you know, your master and I

504
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,240
have some conflicts.

505
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,720
If you had to choose between the two of them

506
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,360
in the future

507
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,320
what would you do?

508
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,000
Just get it over and done with.

509
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,160
Qianzhi finds it painful to end things

510
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,000
so I shall decide on her behalf.

511
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,280
Miss Hua, please forgive me

512
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,520
for not being able to choose.

513
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,160
Why?

514
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,840
I work for Master Zhong.

515
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,960
I have been serving him since I was a child

516
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,720
so I know his temperament well.

517
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,160
He will never let me sacrifice my family

518
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,400
to protect him.

519
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,800
Miss Qianzhi is the only person I love.

520
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,560
And I know that she's soft-hearted.

521
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,080
She's the only woman I want to be with

522
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,680
but I can't betray my master for her.

523
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,680
A person who lacks loyalty and integrity

524
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,320
cannot be trusted.

525
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,880
I didn't expect you to be quite intelligent.

526
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,120
What I said is from the bottom of my heart.

527
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,360
That's right. Between a couple

528
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,400
at least one should be smart.

529
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,000
Bear this in mind.

530
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,440
Do not go back on your words.

531
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
What?

532
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,480
Remember what you said just now.

533
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,880
If you ever have a change of heart

534
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,440
I will be the first to come after you.

535
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,840
Don't expect any help from me.

536
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,720
How things turn out between you and Qianzhi

537
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,200
depends solely on you.

538
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,720
Thank you, Miss Hua.

539
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,600
Qianzhi is shy.

540
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,480
Don't tell anyone about what you heard today.

541
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
I will definitely keep my mouth shut.

542
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,440
We rarely come out.

543
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,760
Since we're out, let's prepare her dowry.

544
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,560
—For Qianzhi?                          —Yes.

545
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,040
That silly girl has a one-track mind.

546
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,200
Despite her age, she knows nothing

547
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,760
about saving money.

548
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,800
Looks like I'm going to spend a fortune today.

549
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,400
Luckily, Huang hasn't sold all the shops yet.

550
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,520
Qianzhi will be an ordinary civilian in future.

551
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,320
It's not good if the shop's location

552
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
is too conspicuous.

553
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,640
But with Qianzhi's intelligence

554
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,080
if it is an ordinary shop

555
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,560
I'm afraid she won't know how to run it.

556
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,960
She may end up closing it down

557
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,000
and losing money. What would she do then?

558
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,080
What do you...

559
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,280
—Are you okay...                —He's dirty.

560
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,520
Where did you acquire this bias?

561
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
Come here.

562
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,960
Your knee got scraped. Does it hurt?

563
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,800
Shall I take you to see a physician?

564
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,760
Let me go...!

565
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,360
Let me go!

566
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,800
Let me go!

567
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,920
Let me go!

568
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Let go of him.

569
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,080
Forget it. Let's go.

570
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,000
Take it. Be good.

571
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,640
Look at me.

572
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,000
Somehow I have sympathy for

573
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,240
people who are suffering.

574
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,640
The little beggar's knee is bleeding.

575
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
He's very young

576
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
yet he didn't cry or make a fuss.

577
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,440
I wonder if he's unaware of the pain

578
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,680
or simply unafraid of it.

579
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,600
He was just pretending to be pitiful

580
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,200
when he failed to steal.

581
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,840
You shouldn't give him money.

582
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,480
No one would be fooled

583
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,920
by this kind of trick

584
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,320
used by street beggars.

585
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,280
What do you mean, pretending to be pitiful?

586
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,200
His knee is really bleeding.

587
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,080
Besides, we all go through bad times

588
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,320
at some point.

589
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,840
I don't lack the money.

590
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,520
I consider this

591
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,200
earning good karma points for myself.

592
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,160
You're so gullible.

593
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,480
I noticed your bad temper is getting worse.

594
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Yes, I admit.

595
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,480
I haven't been paying much attention to you lot

596
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,080
but I'm trying to improve on that.

597
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,520
Do you think Qianzhi will be angry with me?

598
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
She rejected Nanfeng.

599
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,880
I'm sure she must be miserable

600
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,800
and I didn't even notice.

601
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,480
What now?

602
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,000
You're careless indeed, Miss.

603
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,040
I criticised myself because I'm being humble.

604
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,560
It doesn't mean you can criticise me.

605
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,080
Do you still think your first encounter with me

606
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,560
was at the ancestor worship ceremony?

607
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,480
I asked if you recalled

608
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,400
asking for my name on four occasions.

609
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,400
Now it seems you really don't remember.

610
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,520
Give me some hints.

611
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
This is where you asked for my name

612
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,800
for the first time.

613
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,240
I see.

614
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,800
If you don't remember, just say so.

615
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,200
It's okay if you don't remember, Miss.

616
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,320
I can tell you the story.

617
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,280
Don't you wonder why I am so familiar

618
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,440
with what beggars do?

619
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,960
It's because I used to be

620
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
a beggar on the street.

621
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,640
And I almost ran into your carriage.

622
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,840
Come over here. Beat him up.

623
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
What's your name?

624
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Rongzhou.

625
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,400
Your surname is Zhou?

626
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,320
Later on, I found a job at a tea house

627
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,120
and happened to meet you again.

628
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,440
You came to the tea house

629
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,720
to look for Young Master Hua.

630
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,560
It's these two commoners.

631
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,160
I overestimated my abilities

632
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,280
and wanted to help you

633
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,680
but in the end, I was beaten up.

634
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,560
At that time, you told me

635
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,440
that if I wanted to protect someone

636
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,840
I must learn to protect myself first.

637
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,480
What's your name?

638
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,680
—Rongzhou.                       —Zhou Yong?

639
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,760
The third time I saw you

640
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,320
was at the ancestor worship ceremony.

641
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,840
This time, I managed to protect you

642
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,360
and myself.

643
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,000
You even patted my shoulder

644
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,120
and said I had a bright future ahead of me.

645
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,400
You have a bright future ahead of you.

646
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,040
—What's your name?                   —Hua...

647
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,320
—Oh, no! I might miss it.         —Rongzhou.

648
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
And the fourth time was

649
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,720
when I was transferred to guard your compound.

650
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,600
I didn't hear you as it was chaotic.

651
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,880
What's your name again?

652
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,880
My name is...

653
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,240
Hua Rongzhou.

654
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,000
After working in Zhong Residence for half a year

655
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,720
I was finally able to walk beside you

656
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,040
and stand in front of you.

657
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,400
The beggar, the choreman...

658
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,560
That was you?

659
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,680
I said you had a bad memory, didn't I?

660
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,840
It's not that I have a bad memory.

661
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
It's because you were stuttering

662
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,080
and couldn't say your name clearly.

663
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,560
Now that I've recounted the past

664
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,440
will you forget those incidents again?

665
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,080
You're usually a man of a few words.

666
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,680
Aren't you talking a lot today?

667
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,040
Well, Miss

668
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,880
you told me to tell you everything.

669
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,560
How obedient.

670
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,600
<i>Yi'er Sanctuary</i>

671
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,200
Second Uncle, why don't you sit down?

672
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,520
I still feel it's too risky.

673
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Are you sure that going forward...

674
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,760
Second Uncle, nothing ventured

675
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,560
nothing gained.

676
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,480
You're right, but, Yifei...

677
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,760
Lord is here!

678
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,160
Greetings, Lord.

679
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,240
You're here too, Mr Meng?

680
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Yes.

681
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,440
My brother wanted me

682
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,720
to bring Yifei some things from the South

683
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,040
so I delivered them here.

684
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,920
My mother and younger sister

685
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,480
just came back a few days ago.

686
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
They were exhausted and feeling poorly.

687
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,920
They thought it was a hassle to bring them to me

688
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,760
so they entrusted the task to my uncle.

689
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,800
Good. I was worried that

690
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,240
Butler Meng's absence all year round

691
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,240
would make you and him feel estranged.

692
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,040
Now that I see that you remain close

693
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,880
and Butler Meng misses his family so much

694
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,240
I feel relieved.

695
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,000
Lord, my elder brother is absent all year round

696
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,640
and can't take care of his family.

697
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,280
I will help whenever I can if I have time.

698
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,880
Butler Meng is indeed

699
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,160
the pillar of the Zhong family's business.

700
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,720
The business in the South

701
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,560
relies heavily on him.

702
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,360
Thank you for your concern, Lord.

703
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,440
He's lucky to be able to be of service.

704
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,040
Qianzhi.

705
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Miss.

706
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,720
Take it.

707
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,840
There's a title deed for a shop

708
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,480
that's under my name in there.

709
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,920
I carefully selected it this afternoon.

710
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
Although the location isn't ideal

711
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,640
it boasts a loyal clientele and network.

712
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,480
After all, shops in the bustling area

713
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
are run by dignitaries.

714
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,080
You might not be able to keep the shop running

715
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,720
without me if it was there.

716
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,000
There's also a set of jewellery in there.

717
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,080
I have never used them before

718
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,440
so they are as good as new.

719
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,800
And your indenture is in there as well.

720
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,680
It's a token of appreciation from me.

721
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,560
Miss, if I have done something wrong

722
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,840
please punish me at will.

723
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,160
I have no objections.

724
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,520
Please don't drive me away, Miss.

725
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,880
—Get up.                              —Miss.

726
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,560
I'm not driving you away.

727
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,560
This is your dowry when you marry Nanfeng.

728
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,800
Miss, I don't want to leave you.

729
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,920
Nanfeng and I are just...

730
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,080
I may have to leave Huangcheng soon.

731
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Fortunately, I found out about it now.

732
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,160
Otherwise, I would take you with me

733
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,920
and ruin your happiness.

734
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,360
No matter where you go

735
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,960
I will go with you.

736
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,600
Don't worry.

737
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,400
If Nanfeng bullies you in the future

738
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,640
even if I'm not in Huangcheng

739
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,280
I'll come back here to protect you.

740
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,520
No. I'm going to go with you.

741
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,000
Why do you want to follow me?

742
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,440
This marriage concerns the rest of your life.

743
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,960
Nanfeng is a good man

744
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,720
and you're in love with each other.

745
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,960
You don't have to worry about me.

746
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,600
Besides, I can't afford to employ you forever

747
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,840
so don't you think about relying on me.

748
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,040
When did you and Nanfeng start?

749
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,520
Why didn't you tell me?

750
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,280
Were you afraid I might get in your way?

751
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,040
I just knew about how he felt a few days ago.

752
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,880
All this while I thought he had feelings for you.

753
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,200
I didn't tell you

754
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,960
because I thought it was impossible between us.

755
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,520
Impossible?

756
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,520
I have an open mind now

757
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,680
and they are two separate matters.

758
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,120
The conflict between Zhong Yelan and me

759
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,520
doesn't have to implicate others.

760
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,600
Miss, you said you were leaving Huangcheng.

761
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,840
Where are you going?

762
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,040
Who knows?

763
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,240
Anyway, I don't want to be confined here.

764
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,720
The world is vast.

765
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,840
I should go out and broaden my horizons.

766
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,920
Don't you think?

767
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,160
Let's table it until the time comes.

768
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,080
When you meet someone you fancy

769
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,600
come and tell me directly.

770
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,720
No matter who he is

771
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,840
as long as he's the man you want to marry

772
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,560
I'll marry you off in style.

773
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,400
Miss, as long as you're Huangcheng

774
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,920
I will be with you.

775
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,480
Are you trying to rush me to leave?

776
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,720
—Miss!                           —All right.

777
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,800
Go put away the dowry

778
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,560
and help me prepare some refreshments.

779
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,160
I'm going to Zhong's Garden.

780
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,600
You're going to Zhong's Garden?

781
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,040
That's right. For the sake of your happiness

782
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,480
I can't wait any longer.

783
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,040
I have to hurry and get the problem resolved.

784
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,040
<i>Bonus footage</i>

785
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,760
Is Huang your birth name?

786
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,640
No. Young Master Hua gave me that name.

787
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,040
What's your real name then?

788
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Huang Aotian.

789
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,640
Why did you change your name to Huang?

790
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,960
Young Master Hua said

791
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,160
my name sounded too noble.

792
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,720
As if I were the master instead of him.

793
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,200
So he changed my name to one

794
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,720
that was easy to remember.

795
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,240
That does seem like something he would do.
