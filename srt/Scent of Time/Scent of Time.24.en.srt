00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>Episode 24</i>

2
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,800
Qian, your tea-making skills

3
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,320
have improved a lot lately.

4
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,800
As long as you like it, Father.

5
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
I heard that you sold all your shops.

6
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,720
They were yours. You had the freedom

7
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,960
to use them as you pleased.

8
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,360
But if you needed money urgently

9
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,720
you could have told me.

10
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Has the placing of my brother's tablet

11
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,960
at the ancestral hall in our hometown

12
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,080
been arranged?

13
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,880
More or less.

14
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,440
Father, you said

15
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
you would take my mother and me

16
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,880
to go on a trip to relax.

17
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
Does it still count?

18
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,000
Yes, but let's wait a little while more.

19
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,440
Your brother's murderer

20
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,200
is yet to be apprehended.

21
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,840
I will only be at ease

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,480
when the case comes to an end.

23
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,400
Just leave the investigation

24
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
to Magistrate Wang.

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,880
It's his duty

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,560
so he's more adept at it than you are.

27
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
What's the matter?

28
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,440
You can't wait to leave, Qian?

29
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,560
Huangcheng is a boring place.

30
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,400
I don't want to stay any longer.

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,440
How about this?

32
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,200
Go out of the city for a tour with your mother.

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
I'll go find you a few days later.

34
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,240
But I prefer to go as a family

35
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,600
with both you and Mother.

36
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,800
Have you decided on where to go?

37
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,360
I want to go to a small town

38
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,920
in the south of the Yangtze River.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,840
I heard it has plenty of bridges and streams

40
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
making it an ideal place for relaxation.

41
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,360
All right.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,480
I'll spend a few days wrapping things up.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,440
After that, I'll hand in my resignation.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Are you serious, Father?

45
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,480
Yes.

46
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,600
Father, I'll take my leave.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
All right.

48
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,440
<i>I forgot to ask him about Wu Shuomo.</i>

49
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,880
<i>Forget it. I'll ask him another time.</i>

50
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
<i>Hua Residence</i>

51
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,560
Lord is occupied with official business today.

52
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm afraid he can't make time now.

53
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,840
What about coming back another day, Miss Hua?

54
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,400
Since Lord Zhong is busy

55
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,200
I'll wait here till he's available.

56
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Miss Hua, waiting here isn't a good idea.

57
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,240
Why don't you go home first?

58
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,680
I will go to your residence and inform you

59
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,680
once Lord is available.

60
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,840
I live in Hua Residence.

61
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,120
I feel bad having you

62
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,640
to deliver a message to me.

63
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,320
It won't hurt to wait a bit.

64
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,760
She went there again?

65
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,160
Yes, Miss.

66
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,160
It's strange. We seemed quite close a while ago.

67
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,920
But lately, she keeps declining my invitations.

68
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,160
Where's Qi Ruxin?

69
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,400
Why haven't I seen her these few days?

70
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,040
It is said that she was traumatised

71
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,320
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

72
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
so she is still resting in her room.

73
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,200
Let's go then.

74
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,840
I think I haven't visited

75
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,600
Her Highness in a while.

76
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,880
But there are people coming and going here.

77
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,360
If people see you standing here

78
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,960
that would be...

79
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
You went too far.

80
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,760
You knew I wouldn't allow people

81
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,040
to badmouth you

82
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,520
so you waited at my door and refused to leave.

83
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
Lord, you should keep a distance from me.

84
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,400
What, are you trying to push me away again?

85
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,840
Tell me.

86
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,080
What is the purpose of your visit today?

87
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,400
Didn't you reproach me for not coming?

88
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,000
But it seems you're still reproaching me

89
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,480
now that I'm here.

90
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,840
Would you say that you're here for me?

91
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,320
I came here today

92
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,160
to ask you for a favour, Lord.

93
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,200
Lord, please spare my guard.

94
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
In the end, he's still the reason you came.

95
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
In exchange

96
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,320
my father and I will wash our hands of

97
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,280
my brother Hua Shen's matter.

98
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,000
You have full control.

99
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,680
What do you mean?

100
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,280
You should know what I mean, Lord.

101
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
Your guard did harm first.

102
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
How can I let him go free

103
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
just because you said so?

104
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,440
Hua Rongzhou did wrong

105
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,760
but it is not necessary to kill him for it.

106
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,520
He suffered a lot when he was little.

107
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,640
It's understandable that

108
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,440
he found it hard to find a balance.

109
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,520
When he was little?

110
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,760
You believe whatever he says.

111
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,480
The rich merchant Master Li

112
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,520
killed countless children.

113
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,520
His family don't expect Hua Rongzhou

114
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,120
to repay the crime with his life.

115
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,000
Why must you force them to testify against him?

116
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,680
He was imprisoned for less than five days

117
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,160
and you have come to Zhong's Garden

118
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,440
to seek my help twice.

119
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
You said he was young.

120
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,920
Are you saying being young

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,400
gives you immunity from punishment?

122
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,480
Master Li might deserve death

123
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,960
but Qi Rongzhou took more than one life.

124
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,280
You mean

125
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,160
everyone should shoulder responsibility

126
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,280
for what they have done, right?

127
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,240
Meng Yifei sent someone to kill me

128
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
but my brother got killed instead.

129
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,640
If you value fairness and justice

130
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,400
as much as you claim

131
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,240
why did you hide this matter from me?

132
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
Why do some get to walk away free

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,120
when they've killed someone

134
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,600
while the rest have to repay the crime

135
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,040
with their lives?

136
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,120
How are your parents?

137
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,640
The Ge family

138
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,360
completely disregard the law.

139
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,000
The assassination was executed in public

140
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,680
and they did not show

141
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,000
the Zhong family any respect.

142
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,320
In a way, we brought upon your brother's death.

143
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,280
So, you also think that my brother was unlucky

144
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
and got killed due to the chaos?

145
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
It was my fault.

146
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
I caused your brother's death.

147
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,840
Do you know that

148
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,160
the assassins only targeted me

149
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,440
and Hua Shen died protecting me

150
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,080
from the sword attack?

151
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,120
I had no idea...

152
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,400
Yes. It was chaotic

153
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet.

154
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,400
Everyone was frantically fleeing.

155
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,120
No one could notice anything else.

156
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,760
Even you, one of the masterminds

157
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,320
didn't know what exactly happened.

158
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,200
How would anyone else know?

159
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,320
The magistracy investigation

160
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,440
is constrained by red tape.

161
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,360
It's quicker to investigate on my own.

162
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,360
Besides, I'm the assassins' target

163
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,960
so I'm not going to let them off so easily.

164
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,360
Miss Hua, you are so brave and wise.

165
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,320
Are you making use of this

166
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,680
to strike a deal with me now?

167
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,800
So, you do already know this.

168
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,960
I discovered something

169
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
about the banquet assassination.

170
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,440
During the banquet

171
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,840
there wasn't anything unusual

172
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,400
about the private guards in Huangcheng.

173
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
It's just that...

174
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Go on.

175
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,600
A few days before the banquet

176
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Butler Meng in the South

177
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,000
and Butler Qi in the North

178
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,840
sent men back to deliver gifts respectively.

179
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,360
What's up with the Meng family?

180
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,280
Butler Meng had twenty-odd people

181
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
to escort his wife and daughter back to the city.

182
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,200
Meanwhile, they also delivered Mid-Autumn

183
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,720
Festival specialities and gifts he prepared.

184
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,600
And Second Master Meng received them.

185
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,640
It was not until the third day after the banquet

186
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
that these twenty-odd people left the city

187
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
and returned to the South.

188
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,440
According to the spies in the Meng family

189
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,360
half of them were strangers

190
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
and they were not those who delivered the gifts.

191
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,960
Can we trust what the spies' said?

192
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,800
If the spies weren't sure about it

193
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
they wouldn't report it to us.

194
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,920
Besides, it doesn't make sense

195
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
to stay for so long

196
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
after the delivery was made.

197
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,560
With all the recent events

198
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,960
their strange act alerted me.

199
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,080
It was nothing complicated.

200
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,160
What took you so long to find out?

201
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,680
The man who delivered gifts

202
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,960
from the Qi family was suspicious

203
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,040
so I spent much time

204
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,640
investigating the Qi family.

205
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,040
Finally, I found out that

206
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,200
that man and Miss Qi

207
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,840
were in a relationship.

208
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,560
He had nothing to do with the assassination.

209
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,280
I knew about that early on.

210
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,960
It was obvious Qi Ruxin was out of sorts.

211
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,720
I didn't expect that'd throw you off the trail.

212
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Lord, please forgive me!

213
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
Did you look into the Meng family's guards

214
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
who delivered the gifts?

215
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
I'd already sent people to the South

216
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
to investigate it in secret.

217
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,400
Their investigation revealed that

218
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,160
those guards were killed by bandits

219
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,640
before they could reach the shops in the South.

220
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,440
It is said that after Butler Meng

221
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,720
learned about this

222
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,560
he even paid people

223
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,960
to eradicate those bandits.

224
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,400
However, the information came from the spies

225
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,200
and there were no eyewitnesses.

226
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,520
How dare they?

227
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,440
How dare they?

228
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,480
Many things

229
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,480
are not as simple as you think.

230
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,440
I'll make it simple.

231
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,640
Spare Hua Rongzhou's life

232
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,160
and I'll keep my mouth shut about Meng Yifei

233
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,480
for the rest of my life.

234
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,480
Is the guard that important to you?

235
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,240
That's not the point.

236
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,440
Not many people around me

237
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,280
treat me sincerely

238
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,280
so I cherish people who treat me well.

239
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,320
What about me?

240
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,680
Haven't you noticed how I treat you?

241
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,280
So what if I noticed?

242
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,280
I've made myself clear from the very beginning.

243
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,600
You are the lord of the Zhong family.

244
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,680
You bear heavy responsibility in producing

245
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,640
incense that promotes good health for people.

246
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,080
You'll always put business matters

247
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
before your relationship with a woman.

248
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,920
—I just...               —You knew all along

249
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,760
that Meng Yifei was one of the masterminds

250
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,240
behind the banquet assassination

251
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,600
and you tried to stop me from seeing her

252
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
on several occasions.

253
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,520
You were afraid that I would find out, right?

254
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,040
The Meng family will pay the price.

255
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,240
I can assure you that.

256
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,120
But it's not the time yet.

257
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,240
I know why.

258
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,640
The Meng family holds the operating rights

259
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
of the shops in the South.

260
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,080
A forcible seizure of power

261
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,160
will only undermine the power of your family

262
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
and give others an opportunity

263
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
to take advantage.

264
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,240
I also know that you have your reasons

265
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
for keeping Meng Yifei and Qi Ruxin

266
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
in Zhong's Garden.

267
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,160
So, you can't do anything to them.

268
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,800
I also understand

269
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,240
that you can't do as you please

270
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,600
being in a position of authority.

271
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,040
But knowing...

272
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,200
doesn't mean I agree with your actions.

273
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Qian...

274
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,960
Despite your status as Lord

275
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,280
you can't ensure fairness in all aspects.

276
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,840
Everyone has an axe to grind.

277
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,400
If you let Hua Rongzhou off

278
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,680
I'll persuade my father to resign

279
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,240
and we'll return to our hometown.

280
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,120
We will never pursue Meng Yifei's matter.

281
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,760
Are you going to leave?

282
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,800
I can't believe you are leaving.

283
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Only I know about what Meng Yifei did.

284
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,920
If you don't trust me

285
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,280
you can shut me up completely

286
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,920
and let the rest go.

287
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,040
I've told you umpteen times.

288
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,080
I have never made assumptions about you

289
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,160
but you just won't believe me.

290
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,040
Fine.

291
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,960
If that is the case

292
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,520
I won't waste my time anymore.

293
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,960
But know this

294
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm agreeable to everything you asked

295
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,880
except allowing you to take that guard with you

296
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,280
and live outside Huangcheng!

297
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,680
I definitely won't allow that!

298
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,920
What do you mean, Lord?

299
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,880
<i>Agreement between Qian Ying and Mu Yunping</i>

300
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
The proof of your father's crime

301
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,280
that you're holding is just a copy.

302
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,360
Do you think I really don't know

303
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,320
what your father did?

304
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,160
You're in charge of my jewellery.

305
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,480
Do you remember the white jade bracelet

306
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,800
that Her Highness gave me when I got married?

307
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes, I do.

308
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,800
Help me look for it.

309
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,200
I will go to Zhong's Garden tomorrow.

310
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,800
There's something I should return.

311
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,560
Yes, Miss.

312
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,600
Yinxing is on your side.

313
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,120
Why does she seem like a changed person?

314
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,880
She probably became nicer

315
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,520
after she got what she wanted.

316
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
Is that so?

317
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
I guess we should look into it.

318
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,280
Pick a smart girl in Zhong Residence

319
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,520
and put her by her side.

320
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,880
Greetings, Mistress. I'm Yinxing.

321
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,040
You said I didn't trust you just now.

322
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,840
To think you have placed

323
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,160
a spy right next to me.

324
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,000
No wonder every time I go out

325
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,640
I would meet you on the streets.

326
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I know

327
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,880
no matter how I defend myself

328
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,400
you won't trust me anymore.

329
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,480
But it's impossible that

330
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,120
you and Butler Hua can leave Huangcheng

331
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,560
without any concerns.

332
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
That's true.

333
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,120
You have complete control over us.

334
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,400
Framing a colleague is also a serious crime.

335
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,520
Why don't you grant me death?

336
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,480
Will that be enough to atone for my father's sin?

337
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,560
You know what I'm thinking

338
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,640
yet you said that to provoke me.

339
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,000
I know what you're thinking?

340
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,880
Zhong Xiwu.

341
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,400
No, I never know what you're thinking.

342
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm not showing you this

343
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,800
to hold Butler Hua accountable.

344
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,720
What for then?

345
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
You said

346
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,480
you would stop pursuing Meng Yifei's matter

347
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,920
in exchange for your guard's safety.

348
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,280
I will allow that

349
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,400
provided you reveal the truth

350
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,600
about Butler Hua framing his colleague

351
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,800
if you want keep him safe.

352
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,640
Why me?

353
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,040
Haven't you already gathered the evidence?

354
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,640
You will know by then.

355
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
On the fifth day of next month

356
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,600
I will call for all the butlers in the city

357
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,280
to attend a banquet in Zhong's Garden.

358
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,560
If you make this known in front of them

359
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,640
I will spare your family.

360
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,960
Lord, you treat this like a game.

361
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,080
Whether to hide or reveal a wrongdoing

362
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,520
is entirely up to you.

363
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Qian...

364
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,920
I'll hold you to it.

365
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,400
I'm going to pick up Hua Rongzhou now.

366
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,840
On the fifth day of next month

367
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,560
I will do what you asked me to.

368
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,880
As for Yinxing

369
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,360
please summon her back.

370
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
I shudder to think of the consequence

371
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
if I keep her.

372
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,800
Qian, believe it or not. Whatever I do

373
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,600
I do it to make you stay by my side.

374
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,040
Qian!

375
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,840
Let's go to the prison first.

376
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Yes, Miss.

377
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Go to the prison before going back

378
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
to Hua Residence.

379
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
Come take a look.

380
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Buy one.

381
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,320
This basket is durable.

382
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,600
Come take a look.

383
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
What is this?

384
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,080
Jinhua Powder, a pain relief medicine.

385
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm injured because of you

386
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,880
so you shall apply the medicine for me.

387
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,480
I can't reach my back.

388
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,560
Come with me.

389
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,640
Come out.

390
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm here to pick you up.

391
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,800
What happened to you?

392
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
You don't look well.

393
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
I'm fine.

394
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,360
You're lying.

395
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,280
You're bad at lying.

396
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,080
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

397
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,080
You are smart, aren't you?

398
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,480
Hua Rongzhou

399
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,120
why do you seem different from before?

400
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,800
How am I different?

401
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,720
Guard Hua, this is your sword.

402
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,160
I brought it here for you.

403
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,320
Miss, I have washed up.

404
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,120
Here are some money and food.

405
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,480
You don't have an indenture

406
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,080
so I prepared these things.

407
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,960
It's wrong to kill after all.

408
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,280
I did my best to save you

409
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,960
from punishment this time.

410
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,720
Find something else to do from now on.

411
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,080
Miss, you once said

412
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,080
you would not leave me to live alone

413
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,600
but now you are abandoning me?

414
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Yes.

415
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
Just leave.

416
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,520
We've known each other for a while

417
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,400
so we shall part on good terms.

418
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,160
Don't make me drive you away.

419
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,280
No one in Hua Residence is my match.

420
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,040
So, if I insist on staying

421
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,080
no one can drive me away.

422
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,600
Say that again.

423
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,280
Are you saying you can defy my orders now?

424
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,680
You once said you would leave with me.

425
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
And at the prison entrance

426
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,440
you said you came to pick me up.

427
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,560
I believed every word you said.

428
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,640
Why are you going back on your word?

429
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,440
It is different now. I have...

430
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,840
What I did before was to protect myself.

431
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,720
I had never deliberately created trouble

432
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,960
or hurt anyone.

433
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,480
If you're upset about my past wrongdoings

434
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,680
I promise

435
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,520
I will never do such a thing again

436
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,600
unless you give an order.

437
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
If you don't believe me

438
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
I'll cripple my right hand

439
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
to show my determination.

440
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,440
Anyway, I learned martial arts

441
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,880
not to take revenge or bully the weak.

442
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,520
Now, I use it to protect you.

443
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,080
If you don't want me around

444
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,320
my martial arts skills are as good as useless.

445
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,680
You tricked me.

446
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,680
Miss, you once said if you left Huangcheng

447
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,760
you would only have me by your side.

448
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,320
So, don't find excuses to drive me away.

449
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,200
I don't want you to be alone.

450
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,480
As for me...

451
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,760
I only have you by my side all this time.

452
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,120
Look at you.

453
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,640
I can't trust you with important tasks, can I?

454
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I will change for the better.

455
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,120
All right... I won't drive you away.

456
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,880
Thank you, Miss.

457
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,840
You may leave now.

458
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,280
Yes, Miss.

459
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,640
<i>He's just as stubborn as I was</i>

460
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,320
<i>in my previous life.</i>

461
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,680
<i>Leaving would be best for him though.</i>

462
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,240
<i>Forget it. I'll think of another way.</i>

463
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,920
Miss, did you see Yinxing?

464
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,880
I haven't seen her today.

465
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,480
I sent her away.

466
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,840
What did she do?

467
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,520
The same reason why I sent Cuizhu away.

468
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,560
It seems that we can't have trusted servants

469
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,800
in our compound.

470
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,360
Miss, rest assured.

471
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,200
I will never betray you.

472
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,680
That can't do.

473
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,000
Nanfeng might come here asking for you.

474
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,360
Why didn't you flee while you were blushing?

475
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,560
Miss, say whatever you want.

476
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,080
I'm already used to it.

477
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
There goes one more fun thing to do.

478
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,160
Find someone to deliver it to...

479
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,440
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

480
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,400
—Don't drag your feet.          —Miss, he...

481
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,200
Do it. Hurry up.

482
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
Go.

483
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Go.

484
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,040
Grab a pot of Exquisite Dark Wine

485
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,240
and come with me.

486
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Yes, Miss.

487
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,360
<i>Grave of Hua Shen</i>

488
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,040
This is Exquisite Dark Wine. Your favourite.

489
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,040
Do you smell it, Shen?

490
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,200
I can't hold my liquor

491
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,560
so let's drink it later.

492
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,280
Let me say what I came here to say first.

493
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,640
I'm sorry, Shen.

494
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,960
I'm here to apologise to you again.

495
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,000
I can't...

496
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,040
avenge your death

497
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,840
even though I know who the murderer is.

498
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,080
As expected, there's a traitor among you.

499
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,680
We have failed in our duties.

500
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,240
When our master returns

501
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,600
we'll offer up our lives as penance.

502
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Let's table your punishment

503
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,360
until your master returns.

504
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,520
Hand over that traitor to me

505
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,800
so that I can get your master back.

506
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
We used some techniques

507
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,640
during the interrogation.

508
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,560
He couldn't withstand torture

509
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,400
and died.

510
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,360
Do you want your master back or not?

511
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,960
Please forgive me, Concubine Mu.

512
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,640
We must never...

513
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,560
hand over the traitor.

514
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
Why?

515
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,600
Our master planned the banquet abduction

516
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
for you.

517
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,920
It was supposed to be a clandestine plan.

518
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,880
We did it under the disguise of the Ge family

519
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,040
so no one suspected us.

520
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
Who would have thought someone would die?

521
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,880
If word got out that Junior Lord Wu attempted

522
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,320
to assassinate the son of Butler Hua

523
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,080
our master may be deemed as the culprit

524
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,320
of the bad blood between the two families

525
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
even though our master merely wanted

526
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,160
to abduct Hua Qian

527
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,280
and not assassinate anyone.

528
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,320
The murderer was someone else.

529
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,360
But no one cares about the details.

530
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,400
Our master was stubborn

531
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,000
and insisted on taking the risk.

532
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,920
We could only obey.

533
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,920
If we were caught, we'd kill ourselves

534
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,720
and not breathe a word.

535
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,160
But we had a traitor among us.

536
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,680
He was detrimental to our master's life.

537
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,440
No matter what, we couldn't hand him over

538
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,800
to testify.

539
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,360
So...

540
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,640
you can only tell me

541
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,800
who caused Hua Shen's death?

542
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
Exactly.

543
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,160
Do you think

544
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,920
Hua Qian will be satisfied with this answer?

545
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,000
Would you please send her a letter first?

546
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,240
If she's wise, she will understand.

547
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,120
But if Hua Qian insists on

548
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,280
not releasing our master

549
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,360
then we have no choice

550
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,120
but risk our lives to rescue him.

551
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,040
Miss, Mu Yao sent someone to deliver a letter.

552
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,040
Mu Yao wrote to me

553
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,520
saying that we all knew the truth

554
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,160
but we had to act like we were unaware

555
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,360
because there was no evidence.

556
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,440
We couldn't find evidence

557
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,960
because one murderer

558
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,200
was protecting another murderer.

559
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,160
The only person who could come forward

560
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,160
pretended not to know as well.

561
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,160
Shen, I couldn't do more.

562
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,880
It's an unfair world.

563
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,400
Connections override the law.

564
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,480
An eye for an eye

565
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,640
only applies to the lower echelons of society.

566
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,160
For some, killing someone

567
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,680
is as easy as killing an ant.

568
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,880
For some, seeking justice

569
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,840
is like swimming upstream.

570
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,320
Shen.

571
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,840
I'm sorry.

572
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,880
I couldn't risk my life

573
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,360
to drag Meng Yifei down.

574
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,560
I could only use

575
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,400
the hearsay information

576
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,240
to exchange for

577
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
the most favourable outcomes

578
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,080
for the Hua family.

579
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,120
Am I too evil?

580
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,240
After I was reborn

581
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
I thought as long as

582
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,120
I kept a distance from you all

583
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,680
I could avoid repeating the same mistakes.

584
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,680
Now it seems...

585
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,840
I was wrong.

586
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,360
This is...

587
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,960
the second time I was wrong.

588
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,520
Do you know something, Shen?

589
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,760
I saw you die in front of me twice.

590
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,680
Don't worry, Shen.

591
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,760
I will make things difficult

592
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,680
for that person.

593
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,000
I am...

594
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,800
an evil person to begin with.

595
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,040
Miss.

596
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Miss.

597
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Miss.

598
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Shen.

599
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,880
Shen.

600
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,600
<i>Bonus footage</i>

601
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,240
You are smart, aren't you?

602
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,320
Be careful of your injuries.

603
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
Come on up.
