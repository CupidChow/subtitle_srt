Scent of Time

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,440
<i>Episode 1</i>

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,600
Catch her!

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,280
This way! Hurry up!

5
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,560
She's there! Hurry up!

6
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,240
Hurry up!

7
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,760
This way! Hurry up!

8
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,520
—This way.                        —Yes, sir.

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,040
Stop there! Come on.

10
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Yes, sir!

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,160
Stop there!

12
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,480
Hurry up!

13
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,760
Come on.

14
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,680
I can't be caught.

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,160
I can't be caught like this.

16
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,440
Listen, you guys go that way.

17
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,160
—Yes, sir.            —You guys go this way.

18
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,280
—Yes, sir.      —The rest of you, follow me.

19
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Hurry up!

20
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,880
Hurry up!

21
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
This way.

22
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Let me go!

23
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,760
Send me back to Huangcheng!

24
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,680
Let me go!

25
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,560
I'm the mistress of Zhong Residence.

26
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,280
How dare you catch me!

27
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,560
Let me go!

28
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,560
Let me go!

29
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
How dare you!

30
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
I'm the mistress of Zhong Residence.

31
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,880
I'm the mistress there!

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,240
Send me back to Huangcheng City.

33
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,640
How heartless you are, Miss Hua!

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,360
How can you ignore your loved ones?

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,400
Mother...

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No...

37
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
No!

38
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,000
No!

39
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,760
This isn't my brother.

40
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,400
That's not my mother.

41
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,080
I don't know them. No.

42
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,000
20 lashes for helping an exiled prisoner escape.

43
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,000
That was too light a punishment for them.

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,240
But I guess even that was too much

45
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,000
for these pampered rich folks.

46
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,480
How dare you!

47
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,920
How dare you!

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
Stop shouting!

49
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,840
When your family drove Butler Mu to his death

50
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,640
you should have thought of this.

51
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,160
You deserve it!

52
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,880
Wait and see.

53
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,120
You'll soon get your just deserts.

54
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,560
You deserve death.

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,640
When you were doing these evil things

56
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,240
did you think this day would befall you?

57
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,000
You get what you deserve.

58
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,920
Yes!

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,240
You deserve it!

60
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,720
It's your comeuppance. Yes.

61
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,960
You deserve it!

62
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,800
Why?

63
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,960
Why did this happen?

64
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,320
I did all I could to frame so many people.

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,960
This shouldn't happen.

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,400
Did I do wrong?

67
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,480
If you have the chance to start over

68
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,240
will you change anything?

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,840
I will.

70
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,760
Miss?

71
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Miss?

72
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,960
Miss?

73
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
Miss?

74
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,120
Miss?

75
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,000
Are you okay, Miss?

76
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Let me go!

77
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Let go of my mistress. Get off her!

78
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,680
—Miss?                                  —Go!

79
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Let me go!

80
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,880
—Go.                             —Let go...!

81
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,240
—Qianzhi?                    —Miss... I mean

82
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,200
Mistress, Master will be here shortly.

83
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,920
Don't doze off again.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,200
You are married to the Zhong family.

85
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,040
You can't act as you were back at home.

86
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,320
Mrs Hua kept telling me to remind you.

87
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,040
<i>I'm married</i>

88
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,080
<i>to the Zhong family?</i>

89
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,240
<i>Didn't this take place two years ago?</i>

90
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,480
How grand the feast is.

91
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,840
—Come on...                         —Please.

92
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,440
Let's drink...

93
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,720
To the master...

94
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,520
—Let's drink up.                   —Come on.

95
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,360
—Let's drink together.             —Come on.

96
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,960
Have you noticed that

97
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,520
Master doesn't look happy today?

98
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
Not at all.

99
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,600
Master has always been taciturn.

100
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,120
—Besides...                         —Master.

101
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,520
the second daughter of Hua family

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,680
is also well-educated.

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,080
And her father is

104
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
the butler of the Zhong family.

105
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,320
They are a match that's made in heaven.

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,480
Master, let me offer you a toast.

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
That's right.

108
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,800
Come on. After you.

109
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,840
After you.

110
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,200
Okay. Dig in.

111
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,360
All right.

112
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
What happened?

113
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,160
Miss?

114
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,760
Is this the day that I marry Zhong Yelan?

115
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,120
Y-Yes.

116
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,240
Where are my mother and big brother?

117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,640
Ma'am and Master must be

118
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
hosting the banquet with Butler Hua

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,240
back in your family home now.

120
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,240
My father is still alive?

121
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,280
Miss, what are you saying?

122
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,960
Miss?

123
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,160
Miss, what was that for?

124
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,520
<i>This is not a dream.</i>

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
<i>I did go back two years in time.</i>

126
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,760
I want to see my mother and brother.

127
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,960
Mistress...

128
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,880
Mistress, you just got married.

129
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,720
You can't go home now.

130
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
People would gossip if you do that!

131
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,360
Besides, Master is about to come, Mistress.

132
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,920
No. Let me go see my mother.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,720
—Mistress, no.   —My father and brother too.

134
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,840
Mistress.

135
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,800
Master had too much to drink.

136
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,040
He doesn't want to disturb you

137
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,760
and thus sent me to tell you

138
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,280
that he'll sleep in the study.

139
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,880
I've got to go.

140
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
Master

141
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,440
the Mu family was just arrested during the day.

142
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,480
Miss Mu is now a wanted criminal.

143
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,640
Maybe you shouldn't hang around her

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,760
even if you are friends.

145
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,160
I'll be right back.

146
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,080
Master, this is your wedding day.

147
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,080
Mistress is waiting for you in the bedroom.

148
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
Tell her that I've drunk too much

149
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,600
and fallen asleep in the study.

150
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,600
What if she doesn't believe me?

151
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,200
It's the wedding night

152
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,400
of Master and our Mistress.

153
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,120
I'll go check the study to see

154
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
if Master is truly drunk.

155
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,960
—Miss Qianzhi...        —Get out of the way.

156
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,480
Miss Qianzhi, Master has fallen asleep.

157
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
Get out of the way.

158
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
—Miss Qianzhi.              —You're lying...

159
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,080
I'll check it out. Get out of the way.

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,320
Greetings, Mistress.

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Mistress.

162
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,120
Mistress, wait here for me.

163
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,880
I'll go and look for Master.

164
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,800
Don't worry. I'll get him to come here.

165
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,520
No.

166
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,960
Let it be. Get me some hot water.

167
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I want to take a bath.

168
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,240
What if Master comes...

169
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,360
No, he won't.

170
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,200
How do you know that, Mistress?

171
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,840
I...

172
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
just know it.

173
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,280
Heavenly gods

174
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,400
did you hear my prayers

175
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,880
and give me a chance to start over?

176
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
<i>Zhong Residence</i>

177
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,400
—Let go of me!                       —Leave.

178
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,520
Master...

179
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
Hua Qian

180
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,080
you pretended to be Mu Yao to approach me

181
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,720
then drugged and forced me to marry you.

182
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
You colluded with your father

183
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,120
to frame the Mu family and landed them in jail.

184
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,960
I know the truth now.

185
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll turn a blind eye to your wrongdoings

186
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
but it's over between us from this day forth.

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
We're done.

188
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,800
Master...

189
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,240
Don't force me out.

190
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,120
Master...

191
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,760
Don't force me out.

192
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,400
Master...

193
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
<i>Divorce Letter</i>

194
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
Butler Hua crossed his master for self-glory.

195
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,360
He framed and drove Mu Yunping to his death.

196
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,000
He will now be beheaded.

197
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,040
His family will be exiled beyond the borders.

198
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,680
20 lashes for helping an exiled prisoner escape.

199
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,640
That was too light a punishment for them.

200
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,760
But I guess even that was too much

201
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,800
for these pampered rich folks.

202
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,760
<i>Why did it have to start</i>

203
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,280
<i>from the day after the wedding?</i>

204
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,640
<i>It's certainly not the time</i>

205
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,320
<i>to confess what I did wrong.</i>

206
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,160
<i>Or Zhong Yelan would think I was playing him.</i>

207
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,680
<i>I need to get something on him first.</i>

208
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
<i>Also</i>

209
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,800
<i>Mu Yunping was arrested yesterday.</i>

210
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,240
<i>If my memory serves me right</i>

211
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,800
<i>he will kill himself in prison</i>

212
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,880
<i>to prove his innocence nine days from now</i>

213
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,880
<i>which turns his daughter against my family.</i>

214
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,440
<i>There's still time to change everything.</i>

215
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,040
<i>My ending is not set in stone.</i>

216
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,640
<i>I can't let history repeat itself.</i>

217
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,760
<i>Not for my family, either.</i>

218
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
Go...

219
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,800
You, look up.

220
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
Check carefully.

221
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,040
Master, what brings you here?

222
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,800
I came to do some errands with my men.

223
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,520
You can go ahead.

224
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,160
Yes, Master. We'll leave you be

225
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,480
and take our leave.

226
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's go. Come on.

227
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Go.

228
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
Wait.

229
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,600
What's on the cart?

230
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,760
Firewood.

231
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,640
—Go.                       —Sir, who's that?

232
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,600
He doesn't look like an officer.

233
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,800
You seem more nervous

234
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,960
to see him than seeing the magistrate.

235
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,720
You're clearly a newcomer.

236
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,440
He's the senior of the Lord of the Zhong family.

237
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,080
Don't mess with anyone from the Zhong family

238
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,840
even if you've to provoke the magistrate.

239
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,480
The Zhong family calls the shots

240
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,080
in this town that we're in.

241
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,320
What?

242
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,800
They provide incense for the royal family.

243
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,000
His Majesty even married Her Highness away

244
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,680
to such a remote place.

245
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,000
Think about it.

246
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,120
By the way, stay away from the Hua family too.

247
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
—Be careful.                          —Wait.

248
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,760
I don't want any trouble.

249
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,880
Isn't Mr Hua a butler in Zhong's residence?

250
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,240
He's not an ordinary butler.

251
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,040
He's in charge of purchasing.

252
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,080
The Hua family earns ten times

253
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,320
more than the magistrate does every year.

254
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,640
Nobody else but the Zhong family

255
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,800
is more prosperous than them here.

256
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
All right.

257
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,840
Stay close!

258
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Let's go.

259
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,760
Mistress, it's time to get up.

260
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,400
You'll have to greet Her Highness today

261
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,040
in the Zhong's Garden.

262
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,680
Did you not sleep well, Mistress?

263
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,280
Yes. Not so well.

264
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
You can nap when we come back.

265
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,400
What's in the incense burner?

266
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,400
It's the bergamot incense you are used to.

267
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,760
No.

268
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,400
It doesn't smell like the bergamot incense.

269
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,160
Is there any other incense in it?

270
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,560
No. Just bergamot incense.

271
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,040
What else did you smell, Mistress?

272
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,040
I can't tell.

273
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Forget it. It's been too long.

274
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,000
Maybe I've forgotten the smell of bergamot.

275
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,280
Mistress.

276
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,440
Butler Ji sent them here this morning

277
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,280
in case we are understaffed.

278
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
—I'm Cuizhu.                    —I'm Banxia.

279
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
Greetings to you, Mistress.

280
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
You shall look great

281
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,120
for your first visit to Zhong's Garden.

282
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,400
Mistress, time to dress up.

283
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,600
Why are these all white?

284
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,280
Isn't it the only colour you prefer, Mistress?

285
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,760
You told us specifically

286
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,960
to prepare plain dresses

287
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,520
made of white silk after marriage.

288
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,760
Besides, white dresses look soft

289
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,200
and fit you well as you look gorgeous.

290
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,040
Make some new dresses in other colours

291
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,240
for me another day.

292
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,200
White dresses can get dirty easily.

293
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,520
And I've had enough of them.

294
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,200
Time to try something new.

295
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,760
Yes, Mistress.

296
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,120
Greetings to you, Master.

297
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,600
Mistress...

298
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,680
Master.

299
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,240
I drank too much yesterday

300
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,760
and slept in the study to avoid disturbing you.

301
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,200
Are you upset with me, Qian?

302
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,400
Of course not, Master.

303
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,160
We don't need these formal titles.

304
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,240
Call me the way you used to.

305
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,200
<i>Right. He was nice to me</i>

306
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,680
<i>when I fooled him to be guilty.</i>

307
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,040
<i>I've made the mistake once</i>

308
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,920
<i>and paid the price.</i>

309
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,760
<i>Don't make the same mistake this time.</i>

310
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,680
You look like you wanted to tell me something.

311
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,800
No, nothing.

312
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,960
I see. Let's go, then.

313
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,240
Look at this.

314
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Is it ready?

315
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,800
This is yours. You'll be the next one.

316
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,080
I haven't seen such a busy street for years.

317
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
I woke up late and haven't eaten anything.

318
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,800
Have you had breakfast?

319
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
<i>I almost forgot</i>

320
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,400
<i>that he must be thinking of Mu Yao</i>

321
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,240
<i>whom he saved last night.</i>

322
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>She also escaped from being sold</i>

323
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,760
<i>when Mu Yunping was sent to a life of exile.</i>

324
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,840
Hurry up! Go search over there.

325
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,480
Don't let her escape.

326
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,720
—Yes, sir!                            —Wait.

327
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,040
Just go.

328
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Check carefully.

329
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
You may go.

330
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,840
Master, what brings you here?

331
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,880
I came to do some errands with my men.

332
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,760
You can go ahead.

333
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,040
Yes, Master. We will leave you be

334
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,360
and take our leave.

335
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,840
Go search over there.

336
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,160
Come on.

337
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,200
Follow me.

338
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,000
Bailiffs are all out for the fugitive.

339
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,200
You can ignore me

340
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,600
if you want to get caught.

341
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,120
<i>Mu Yao must resent me bitterly</i>

342
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,160
<i>and doesn't want to see me.</i>

343
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,040
<i>I never expected it would be harder</i>

344
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,360
<i>to start over than being impudent.</i>

345
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,720
Go away...!

346
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,320
You took my place!

347
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,000
We're almost there.

348
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Okay.

349
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,920
Bloody beggar!

350
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,880
Look where you're going.

351
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,920
You're an able-bodied young man

352
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,720
who can earn your own living.

353
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,280
Why did you become a beggar

354
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,200
that no one would respect?

355
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,160
I have a good eye for people.

356
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,880
Your eyes are pretty nice looking.

357
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,840
I know many rich families

358
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,560
that need more servants.

359
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,800
Why not come with me?

360
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,000
You can get a place to live

361
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,760
and I can earn some money.

362
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
What do you think?

363
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,560
Boss!

364
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,080
—Bloody beggar!    —Get the little rat back!

365
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,280
Stop there!

366
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,080
Where's my money bag?

367
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,320
That rascal stole it!

368
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,400
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

369
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,280
Lord.

370
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,400
Greetings to you, Lord.

371
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Senior.

372
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,160
You finally came, Senior.

373
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,160
I wanted to congratulate you yesterday.

374
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,720
But my mother didn't want me to disturb you.

375
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,760
Thank you for caring, Lord.

376
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,880
You're always so formal

377
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,240
no matter what I've told you.

378
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,840
You're my senior.

379
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,120
Just call me by my name.

380
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,880
I shouldn't break the rules.

381
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,000
I've something to discuss with you.

382
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,280
Let's go to my mother's courtyard first.

383
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Sure.

384
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,280
<i>It won't take long</i>

385
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,600
<i>before the Lord falls for Mu Yao.</i>

386
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,320
<i>No wonder my family's plot was exposed.</i>

387
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,560
Stop doing that.

388
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,400
Who would you choose between us?

389
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,840
<i>These rumours were rife</i>

390
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,320
<i>but I still don't understand</i>

391
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,640
<i>why Mu Yao could make their heads spin.</i>

392
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,840
Mistress?

393
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,320
Mistress?

394
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,800
Mistress, I've been calling you several times.

395
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,040
What were you so deep in thought about?

396
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,640
Nothing. Let's go.

397
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
What's the incense today?

398
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,760
It smells like benzoin incense.

399
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,080
Miss Meng is correct.

400
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,440
It's benzoin incense

401
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,520
which can refresh and increase blood flow

402
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,360
and prevent heartache and stomachache.

403
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,640
Yelan rarely visits.

404
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,160
Use his favourite sandalwood instead.

405
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,240
Yes, Your Highness.

406
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,520
Your Highness, you're so nice to the master.

407
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,680
Greetings to you, Mother.

408
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
Greetings, Your Highness.

409
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,800
Take a seat.

410
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
Mother.

411
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,880
Yelan, you're married now.

412
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,520
Since you chose her to be your wife

413
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,160
you shall get along with her.

414
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,200
I'll remember it, Your Highness.

415
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,520
You're the former Lord's last apprentice

416
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
and grew up here in the Garden.

417
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,440
Why are you so polite

418
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,480
and won't even call me Mistress?

419
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,040
Yes, Mistress.

420
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,480
And you.

421
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,720
Now that you've been married to him

422
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,600
as you'd wanted to

423
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,160
you shall concentrate on being his wife

424
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,040
and cultivate your virtues and values.

425
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,040
Don't do anything beneath your status.

426
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,880
<i>It seems like Her Highness also knows</i>

427
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
<i>the truth of our marriage?</i>

428
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,960
<i>Isn't it a secret?</i>

429
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,880
I'll remember your words, Your Highness.

430
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,160
Do it, instead of saying it.

431
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,840
I will do what I said

432
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,160
restrain myself and develop virtues.

433
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,680
Great.

434
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,360
I'll wait and see.

435
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,360
I will not let you down, Your Highness.

436
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,040
<i>In order to survive</i>

437
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,160
<i>I shall change my image first.</i>

438
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320
Mother.

439
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Mother.

440
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,600
I've something to discuss with my senior.

441
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,160
—I shall take my leave.               —Sure.

442
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,960
Take as much time as you need.

443
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
Butler Meng sent some unique cream

444
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,800
and rouge from the South yesterday.

445
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,320
You can pick what you fancy later.

446
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

447
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,480
Thank you for your kindness.

448
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,920
But I can't take what my father gave you

449
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,480
Your Highness.

450
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,360
He works so hard for our family in the South.

451
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,640
And you've stayed by me for so many years.

452
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,600
It's nothing compared to your work.

453
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,120
You, too.

454
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,760
Your father works hard to take over the shops

455
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,760
in the North last year.

456
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,080
Yes.

457
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,520
It's his honour to do so.

458
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,680
Her Highness reads sutras every day.

459
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,360
I came across some sutras

460
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,920
that Sister Qi transcribed a few days ago.

461
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,320
Were those for Her Highness?

462
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,320
You're eagle-eyed.

463
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,480
Those are indeed for Her Highness.

464
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,640
I'll bring them another time.

465
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,800
It's rare for a young girl

466
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,920
to devote time to transcribe sutras.

467
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,800
Being refined is better than being impetuous.

468
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,360
Are you disapproving of what I said?

469
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,960
What do you think

470
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,080
is the most important thing for a woman?

471
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,840
Your Highness

472
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,520
great women have four virtues, including

473
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,320
virtues, appearance, eloquence and diligence.

474
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Okay.

475
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,520
It seems that you know virtues come first.

476
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,640
You shall behave and restrain yourself

477
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,360
to be a good wife for Yelan.

478
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,280
I'll remember it, Your Highness.

479
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,440
I heard several goldfish

480
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,080
were brought to the Garden.

481
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,280
Shall we have a look, Your Highness?

482
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,040
Sure.

483
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,760
Let's take a walk.

484
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,240
Aren't you coming?

485
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Yes.

486
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,000
<i>My change of image</i>

487
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,280
<i>seems to be working already.</i>

488
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,200
<i>At least she didn't leave me alone here</i>

489
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,920
<i>as she did in the other lifetime.</i>

490
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,080
Look at that one.

491
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Your Highness.

492
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,120
Look, they're fighting over the food.

493
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Here.

494
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,640
Your Highness, that one is coming over here.

495
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,440
There're several here.

496
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,480
They're fighting for food.

497
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
Look.

498
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,880
<i>I had little contact with anyone</i>

499
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
<i>in the Garden in the last life.</i>

500
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,080
<i>I never knew these women</i>

501
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,520
<i>could be so boring.</i>

502
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,040
<i>Just the sight of goldfishes</i>

503
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,680
<i>got them all excited.</i>

504
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,120
They ate it.

505
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,840
These two are so pretty.

506
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Yes.

507
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,920
Those two are nice, too.

508
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,200
Yes. Look.

509
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,560
They're fighting.

510
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Look.

511
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,000
Look.

512
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,760
They eat a lot.

513
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Yeah.

514
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,480
Mistress...!

515
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,600
It's the clothes of Mistress Hua.

516
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,160
—Help!                            —Help her!

517
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,440
Mistress!

518
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,840
What can we do?

519
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,360
Mistress...

520
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,080
Mistress. Here.

521
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
Be careful.

522
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Mistress.

523
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,200
When did you learn to swim?

524
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,400
<i>There's nothing I can't learn</i>

525
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,960
<i>after a year in exile.</i>

526
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,520
Mistress...

527
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,640
Go and clean yourself up.

528
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Mistress.

529
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
Let's go.

530
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,600
How did Mistress Hua...

531
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,840
How did she fall into the water?

532
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,680
It's Yuzhu, the maid who is close to Hua Man.

533
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,200
Senior, look.

534
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,200
Here are the fake agarwood balls

535
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,240
used in Mu Yunping's embezzling case.

536
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,480
I studied them for two days

537
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,440
to find the forgery technique.

538
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,080
It's quite similar to Ge's technique.

539
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,120
The Ge family?

540
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,400
How could it be?

541
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,800
The Ge family produced harmful incense.

542
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,040
And you solved the case on your own.

543
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,920
You must be aware of their technique.

544
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,520
You can inspect them if you don't believe.

545
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,960
I informed Magistrate Wang

546
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,360
but he hasn't found out anything yet.

547
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,280
It's been about ten years

548
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,160
since the Ge family was raided and caught.

549
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,000
Even if someone escaped

550
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,800
he won't easily show up.

551
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,160
And Mu Yunping

552
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,000
has been transferred here less than a year.

553
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,760
It may have nothing to do with him.

554
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,560
It's hard to say.

555
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,400
Maybe the Ge family has been preparing

556
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,160
to make a comeback.

557
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,680
I'm worried that they've infiltrated our family.

558
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,160
Magistrate Wang has sent

559
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,640
Mu Yunping into exile.

560
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,160
But one of his family members

561
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,640
who was supposed to be sold

562
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,840
remains missing.

563
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,600
They've searched the entire town.

564
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,320
Is the Ge family involved in any way?

565
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,440
Master, Mistress...

566
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,400
fell into the water.

567
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
What?

568
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,280
What happened?

569
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,880
Lord, Her Highness and Mistress Hua

570
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,680
were viewing goldfishes by the pond.

571
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,960
But somehow

572
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,480
Mistress Hua fell into the pond.

573
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,680
But she's fine

574
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,000
because she managed to swim to the bank.

575
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,960
—You can leave now.                    —Yes.

576
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,000
Tell Chen Yuan to find out more.

577
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,720
Yes, Lord.

578
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,160
Qianzhi?

579
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,640
Congratulations on finally getting

580
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,400
what you want.

581
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,640
As your older cousin

582
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,520
I'm really happy for you.

583
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,160
Miss Man, it's quite startling

584
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,960
to congratulate someone silently

585
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,040
behind their back.

586
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,680
Why are you so distant?

587
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,640
You've been my family.

588
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,320
We never had secrets between us.

589
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,400
I have served

590
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,600
the Senior Lord for over a decade.

591
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,280
If you want to be married into the family

592
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,040
the young Lord will at least

593
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,840
make you the Mistress. What do you think?

594
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,400
You're already the butler, Father.

595
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,760
You don't need me to please

596
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,880
Her Highness and the Lord.

597
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,680
Besides, you know that

598
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,800
Zhong Yelan is the only one

599
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,640
I want to marry.

600
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,160
Fine...

601
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,400
You're my only daughter.

602
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,880
Since you're not keen

603
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,600
I'll send your uncle's eldest daughter.

604
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,320
Someone has to marry into

605
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
their family for us.

606
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,160
Family?

607
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,200
Is there anything wrong, Sister?

608
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
You're now

609
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,600
a high-ranking maid of the Lord.

610
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,960
You'd better not call me "sister".

611
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,120
I can't live up to it.

612
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,000
I was out of line.

613
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,760
I haven't seen you for a long time.

614
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,280
And it's been hard to arrange this meeting.

615
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,680
I was too excited.

616
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Arrange?

617
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,320
There were so many people around you.

618
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,280
Her Highness also cares about you.

619
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,680
I had no choice but to do what I did

620
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,000
to get the chance.

621
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,960
You ordered someone

622
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,000
to push me?

623
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,760
I had housemaids who could swim on standby.

624
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,760
You weren't in any danger.

625
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,960
After all, it's the only way

626
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,600
to escape all the spies.

627
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,040
<i>Why didn't it happen in the last life?</i>

628
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
<i>That's it.</i>

629
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,640
<i>Back then, Her Highness</i>

630
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,000
<i>snubbed me and left me in the room.</i>

631
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,760
Look.

632
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Look.

633
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,960
How dare they.

634
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,520
Do they think it's Hua's Garden here?

635
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,160
I shall see what messages

636
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,120
they're trying to slip through

637
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,680
before my eyes.

638
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,120
You're too cautious, Miss Man.

639
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,000
You can just come and talk to me.

640
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
There's no need to do it furtively.

641
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,480
These walls have ears.

642
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,800
I need to ask you

643
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,800
to help pass on a message.

644
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,600
Mu Yunping was imprisoned.

645
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,240
He'll never see the light of day.

646
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,720
—I'd like to ask Butler Hua...  —Ridiculous!

647
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,400
Are you out of your mind?

648
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,560
How dare you

649
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,200
gossip about the master's affairs?

650
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,920
Why should my father know anything about it?

651
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,960
I've set everything up here.

652
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,560
No one would notice us.

653
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,840
Don't worry, Mistress.

654
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,720
<i>No wonder the Hua family fell.</i>

655
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,840
<i>They're all so foolish and mean.</i>

656
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,320
You confused me, Miss Man.

657
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,000
Why do we have to be secretive?

658
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,000
How forgetful you are, Mistress.

659
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,800
Butler Hua sent me here

660
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,960
and fostered me

661
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,920
because he wants me to help him.

662
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,640
You must be confused.

663
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,840
It was you who wanted to come here.

664
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,400
Uncle was unable to make it happen.

665
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,480
My father helped you

666
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,800
for his brother's sake.

667
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,920
Why do you frame him for social climbing?

668
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,320
I won't tell others

669
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,000
or hold you accountable

670
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,360
since you're my cousin.

671
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,280
But I hope you can stop playing tricks

672
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,920
and ruin our relationship.

673
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,720
Are you out of your mind today?

674
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,280
How could you say that?

675
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,440
Why would he send me here to help him

676
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,280
if you hadn't wanted to marry the master

677
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,560
at the time?

678
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,520
It's mean for you to say so.

679
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,400
It's true that I love the master.

680
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,200
Even if my father

681
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,280
really wanted to plant someone here

682
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,120
why would he choose you

683
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,640
instead of other more beautiful cousins?

684
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,760
You said you fell for the Lord.

685
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,720
My father made an exception and helped you

686
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,040
for the sake of your father.

687
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,600
I feel bad for him that his kindness

688
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,880
was misunderstood.

689
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,360
How dare you say I'm ugly?

690
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,160
It's funny what you chose to focus on.

691
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,520
I shall tell my father

692
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,720
not to break the rules for his brothers.

693
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,640
Now that you've fallen for the Lord

694
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,960
you should learn to mind your own business.

695
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,280
Do you need me to lecture you

696
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,760
on how to be loyal to your Lord?

697
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
You...

698
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,400
How dare you turn against me.

699
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,960
You only became the mistress

700
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,200
by drugging your husband.

701
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,400
Quit acting like you're so noble.

702
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,720
Mistress.

703
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,920
Mistress, why did you come out

704
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,160
with your hair loose?

705
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
No one's in there

706
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
so I came out to find you.

707
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,160
A maid asked me

708
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,880
to get your wet clothes.

709
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,240
Mistress, let me comb your hair first.

710
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,160
I remember they always liked

711
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,280
to show off their sisterhood.

712
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,160
Do you think

713
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,480
Hua Qian knows that we're here?

714
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,880
I don't know, Master.

715
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,920
<i>Bonus footage</i>

716
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,000
I was told you'd visit your senior tomorrow.

717
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,520
It's his wedding. I've nothing to do here

718
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,840
so I want to join in the fun.

719
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,520
You can meet at any time

720
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,760
except for tomorrow.

721
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,680
Do you not like Butler Hua's daughter?

722
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,480
That's true.

723
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,600
Many women fake weakness to win sympathy.

724
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,720
And not to mention

725
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,920
that the girl got married

726
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,280
by shady means.

727
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,280
A mistress should be stable and refined.

728
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,000
Only concubines would cry for sympathy

729
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,640
to deal with troubles.

730
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,080
Yelan is too honest.

731
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,120
He's determined to be responsible

732
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,560
in spite of our warnings.

733
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,720
Senior is a bit too soft-hearted.

734
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,680
Unlike him, you are lord of the Zhong family.

735
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,680
You mustn't be soft-hearted

736
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,160
and easily bewitched by these wily women.

737
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,760
Mother.

738
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,640
I'm too busy to care

739
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,480
