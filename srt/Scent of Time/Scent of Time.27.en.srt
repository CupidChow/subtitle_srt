<i>Episode 27</i>

3
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
Let me go.

4
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,200
Let me go!

5
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,840
What does this have to do with you?

6
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,880
I owe her a favour.

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,960
I'm just here to repay the debt.

8
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
Get someone to deliver it to...

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,120
Wu Shuomo.

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,720
What are you waiting for? Do it.

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
—Don't waste my time.                 —Miss.

12
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,840
I must return.

13
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,880
There's no one by her side now.

14
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I must return!

15
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,040
Return?

16
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,560
And what can you do?

17
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,200
—I'll be with her and...      —Die together?

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm not afraid of death.

19
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,080
Let me go.

20
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,680
Let me go!

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,680
Now, I get why she wrote

22
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,960
to ask me for this favour.

23
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,360
Miss Qi, Lord is busy.

24
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,920
I'm afraid he doesn't have time to see you.

25
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
I know that.

26
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,640
Miss Qi, you'd better not bother Lord now.

27
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,080
Your Highness.

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
—Miss Qi.                          —Miss Qi.

29
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,240
—Miss Qi.                          —Miss Qi.

30
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,440
—Miss Qi.                          —Miss Qi.

31
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,360
Lord, I...

32
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,880
—I need to talk to you.            —Get out.

33
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,880
I don't have time for your nonsense.

34
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,680
I just went to see Hua Qian.

35
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,880
Zhong Xiwu, like I said

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,240
we suffer the same fate.

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
You're destined to not get what you want.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,120
<i>Lord has passed down an order.</i>

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,560
<i>Qi Ruxin, the daughter of the Qi family</i>

40
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,560
<i>is narrow-minded and vicious.</i>

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,880
<i>Out of jealousy, she hurt</i>

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,840
<i>the daughter of the Meng family.</i>

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,760
<i>Considering her father's contributions</i>

44
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,080
<i>she's merely being driven</i>

45
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,400
<i>out of Zhong's Garden.</i>

46
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,280
<i>And her relatives are</i>

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,680
<i>not allowed to take her in.</i>

48
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,840
Lord.

49
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,920
Take it away. I have no appetite.

50
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,840
Her Highness sent someone to deliver this.

51
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
It's your birthday today.

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
You'd better eat some, Lord.

53
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Birthday?

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,360
That's right. Did you forget, Lord?

55
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,080
A month ago, you said that you wanted

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,760
to keep the celebration small and simple.

57
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Her Highness sent people here

58
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
several times today

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,080
and you said you were busy

60
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,600
so Her Highness had someone bring

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,880
some food for you just now.

62
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,760
Lord, where are you going?

63
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,360
I brought some snacks.

64
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,640
Care to eat them with me?

65
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,400
Are you still angry with me?

66
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm a sinner.

67
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
It's wrong of me to be angry.

68
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,080
Qian, I know you're unhappy lately...

69
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,960
So, you do know that I'm unhappy here.

70
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,480
Do you see that you're forcing me

71
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,720
to do something that I don't want to do?

72
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,760
Qian, why won't you relent?

73
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,960
Zhong Xiwu, this is meaningless.

74
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,720
Either let me go or kill me.

75
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,840
And I'm never one of your options, am I?

76
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,040
Zhong's Garden is never short of women

77
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,040
be it now or the future.

78
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,200
It's too crowded for me.

79
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,800
But what if I only want you?

80
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
Can you give up

81
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,360
being Lord of the Zhong family for me?

82
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
You can't

83
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,480
because your future has been mapped out

84
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,200
to be Lord of the Zhong family since birth.

85
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Indeed.

86
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
As long as I could remember, I have never

87
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,360
stopped learning how to be a good lord.

88
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,840
You are the only exception.

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,640
I was indeed sounding you out at first

90
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
but over time, I began to know the real you.

91
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,080
Rumours and hearsay cannot be trusted.

92
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,560
It's hard to meet another woman

93
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,360
who is as clear-headed and kind as you.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,160
I couldn't control my emotions.

95
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,080
I followed my heart.

96
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
You know all that.

97
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,400
Why did you force me to choose?

98
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,440
Is that a joke, Lord?

99
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,240
Who is forcing who in this situation?

100
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,800
I told you to expose Butler Hua

101
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,920
because I wanted you to draw the line...

102
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,080
You're ignoring what I said

103
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,960
so I don't want to listen to you as well.

104
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,640
You really don't care about anything anymore?

105
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,640
Even the guard that you sent away?

106
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,680
What do you mean?

107
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,800
So, you'll listen to me now?

108
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,680
What did you mean by that?

109
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,920
Do you think I could do nothing about it

110
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
just because you sent him away

111
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,400
and got someone to protect him?

112
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,200
Are you threatening me?

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,240
Does he mean that much

114
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,160
to you?

115
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,280
If you harm him...

116
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
I will...

117
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,640
You said you were afraid of death

118
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,480
but you jumped off the cliff for my senior

119
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,840
took the rap for Butler Hua

120
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,520
and now, you even threaten to harm me

121
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,560
because of that guard.

122
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,960
Qian, you're not afraid of death.

123
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,600
You just don't love me.

124
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,720
You just...

125
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,160
don't love me.

126
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Let go...

127
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,800
It's my birthday today.

128
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,440
"I've cooked soup for the man I love.

129
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,920
I look forward to him tasting it."

130
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,880
I have been looking forward

131
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,240
to your birthday noodles

132
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,320
but now it seems...

133
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,720
I'm not meant to have them.

134
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,320
Don't worry.

135
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,640
I never had the intention

136
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,120
to hurt the people you care about.

137
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,640
What happened to your hand?

138
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,400
Lord...

139
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,440
I'll go get a physician.

140
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,960
Don't.

141
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,840
Don't let anyone know about this.

142
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,200
But, Lord, your hand is injured.

143
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,400
Go get me some wine.

144
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,600
—Lord...                             —Do it!

145
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,000
—Madam Wu.                     —Steward Gao.

146
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Her Highness sent me here

147
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,920
to collect the food box.

148
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,200
Lord is busy with work.

149
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,600
He doesn't want anyone to disturb him.

150
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,240
It's only a food box.

151
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,800
I'll get someone to return it to Her Highness

152
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
when Lord is done.

153
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
Never mind the food box

154
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
but Her Highness is worried about Lord's health.

155
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,960
She insisted that I came here

156
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,960
to check if he had eaten dinner.

157
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,360
Her Highness won't be happy

158
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,480
if I go back empty-handed.

159
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,520
How about this? Please wait here.

160
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,440
I'll go inside and take out the food box.

161
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,600
I'm fine if Lord gets mad at me.

162
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,960
Thank you, Steward Gao.

163
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,000
I owe you a favour.

164
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,120
Hearing that the food was sent by Her Highness

165
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
whetted his appetite.

166
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,320
He finished them all very quickly.

167
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,560
That's great.

168
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,160
I'll go back and report this to Her Highness.

169
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,640
Take care, Madam Wu.

170
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,640
Are you sure?

171
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,240
I am sure.

173
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,440
I will not tolerate her anymore.

174
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,440
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Yinxing.

175
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,200
—Take her away.                        —Yes.

176
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,240
Your Highness...

177
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,000
Spare the formalities.

178
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,960
You have no respect for me anyway.

179
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,040
Do you remember what you promised me?

180
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,040
Why are you still entangled with Lord?

181
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,360
Do you think I'm an idiot?

182
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,400
Can't you see it, Your Highness?

183
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,680
If I had wanted that

184
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,160
I wouldn't be imprisoned here.

185
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Answer me.

186
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Lord got injured last night. Did it happen here?

187
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,960
—Yes, it did.                 —How dare you!

188
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,320
It was unintentional. He forced my hand.

189
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Fine.

190
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Do you know what I'm here for?

191
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Yes, I do.

192
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm sorry for

193
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,160
not appreciating your kindness, Your Highness.

194
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,280
I only ask that you spare the lives of my family

195
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,880
and I will be eternally grateful.

196
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
You're a filial daughter.

197
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,880
I will spare Butler Hua's life.

198
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm not a filial daughter.

199
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Consider carefully what to say

200
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,280
and what not to say.

201
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
Father...

202
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,960
Father!

203
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,640
—I did it all alone.                —Father!

204
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,760
Don't worry.

205
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,400
I never had the intention

206
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,040
to harm the people you care about.

207
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,040
Miss, remember to look for me soon

208
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,520
or I will come back for you.

209
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,840
All right. Be safe.

210
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,920
<i>I tried to change the course of my life</i>

211
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,960
<i>but the outcome didn't change.</i>

212
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,920
<i>But at least some of them survived.</i>

213
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,560
Your Highness.

214
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,080
Get rid of her.

215
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,200
Make sure no one sees this.

216
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Men.

217
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,920
Make sure no one sees you.

218
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Get rid of this too.

219
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Yes, Your Highness.

220
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,520
Master...

221
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,200
Master...

222
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Master...

223
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
I've told you umpteen times.

224
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Stay composed no matter what.

225
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,200
Master, Lord...

226
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,440
Speak clearly.

227
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,160
Is Lord... inside?

228
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,120
Lord had a drop too much yesterday.

229
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,600
He has a headache and is still sleeping.

230
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,000
Everything else has to wait.

231
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,680
But, Master, I saw...

232
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,560
I saw Her Highness going...

233
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,800
to that compound.

234
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
Lord!

235
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
—Lord!                              —Master.

236
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,840
Lord...

237
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Lord!

238
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,080
Lord...

239
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,480
—Hurry!                              —Water!

240
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,400
—Somebody!                       —Let me go!

241
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,720
This way.

242
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,520
—Here it comes.             —Douse the fire!

243
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,640
—This way!                        —Somebody!

244
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,880
—Let me go.                       —This way.

245
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Miss!

246
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,840
Come out!

247
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,240
—Coming!                              —Miss!

248
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Over here!

249
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,600
—Watch out!                      —Let me go!

250
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
—Hurry up!               —Make way.

251
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
—Qian!                                —Lord!

252
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,440
—Qian!                              —Lord...

253
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,400
The fire is out of control. You can't enter!

254
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
Lord!

255
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,000
—Miss!                                —Lord!

256
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,480
—Lord...                              —Qian.

257
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
—Qian!                                —Lord!

258
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,280
—Men!                      —Lord, I checked.

259
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,400
—Qian!                   —No more survivors!

260
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,640
Qian! Men...

261
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,760
Lord!

262
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,520
—Men!                                 —Lord!

263
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,760
There are no more survivors.

264
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,320
Qian!

265
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,440
—Let go of me!                        —Lord!

266
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,160
You can't go in there.

267
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,840
Qian!

268
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,080
There are no more survivors.

269
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,080
Qian...

270
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Qian...

271
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,320
She's still in there.

272
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,760
Somebody help!

273
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,080
Help her!

274
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,640
Please. Somebody, save her.

275
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,760
Where's Chen Yuan?

276
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,360
—Her Highness just left.          —This way.

277
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,640
Come on. Give it to me.

278
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,320
Miss...

279
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,800
Miss...

280
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,880
Can someone please help me?

281
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,800
—This way.                       —Let me go.

282
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,600
—You can't go in there.          —Let me go!

283
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,240
Let me go.

284
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,240
Miss...

285
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,400
Miss...

286
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,960
Let me stay with my lady.

287
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,760
Let me go.

288
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,520
Miss...

289
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,520
Miss...

290
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,360
You terrible servants!

291
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,560
How could you let Lord come out

292
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,640
in a dishevelled state?

293
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,680
Quit slacking or you'll be executed.

294
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,560
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

295
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,680
Mother, why did you do that?

296
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,920
Can't I punish the servants

297
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,320
for their poor performance?

298
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,600
You know I'm not referring to this.

299
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,680
I thought you liked Hua Qian as much as I did.

300
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
Now it seems that I was wrong.

301
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,080
I'm the only one who wants her safe

302
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,880
in Zhong's Garden.

303
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,960
Leave us.

304
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,880
You like her, so what?

305
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,040
As Lord of the Zhong family

306
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,520
you're not free to do as you please.

307
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,280
You've been telling me this since I was little.

308
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
I'm sick and tired...

309
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,400
of hearing it.

310
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,920
Have I been too obedient?

311
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,960
Should I start getting into trouble like some

312
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,720
so that you won't be so strict with me?

313
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,880
Haven't you been creating havoc lately?

314
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,600
You kept the daughter of the Hua family here

315
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,600
for a long time. And I put up with it.

316
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,680
I also turned a blind eye to you

317
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
driving Qi Ruxin away

318
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,120
because I trusted that you could handle it well.

319
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,280
And what did you do?

320
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,120
You got hurt

321
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,800
and tried to hide the incident from me.

322
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,440
You should know that

323
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,920
I did all of this for your own good.

324
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,320
I did it for your own good.

325
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,480
I was afraid that you would not believe it

326
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,320
so I got Chen Yuan to bring the Li couple here

327
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
to testify against him.

328
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,920
I was worried that

329
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,320
Qi Rongzhou might get mad and hurt you

330
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,840
so I came to see you.

331
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,160
You thought Hua Rongzhou might hurt me.

332
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,720
Is that the real reason why you're here?

333
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Why can't you see that

334
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm doing this for your own good?

335
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,840
I hope one day

336
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,320
you can understand the true meaning...

337
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
of these words.

338
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,320
That is...

339
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,040
how she felt when she heard these words.

340
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,680
Xiwu.

341
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Mother.

342
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,840
I only wanted to be with the woman I love.

343
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,080
Why can't you let me have what I want?

344
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,000
It's because you're Lord of the Zhong family.

345
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,480
You represent the entire family.

346
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,720
Stop trembling.

347
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,600
You're spilling the medicine.

348
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,000
Do you know how expensive it is?

349
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Master.

350
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,320
I have not done such chores before.

351
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Let me do it.

352
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm just throwing away my money.

353
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,280
He won't eat or drink

354
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,320
so I have to spend so much money

355
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,640
buying expensive herbs

356
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,000
to nurse him back to health.

357
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,280
This man may look young

358
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,720
but he is tough.

359
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,400
He would make a good spy.

360
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,200
I think he can endure the torture

361
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,360
if he's caught.

362
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,640
It's a pity

363
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,120
that he doesn't work for me.

364
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Master.

365
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,800
What did you say? She died?

366
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,160
Yes. The pigeon messengers sent the news.

367
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,360
Word hasn't gotten out yet.

368
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Master.

369
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
It seems that the Hua family did not

370
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
to rat us and the Ge family out

371
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,000
so we don't have to do their bidding anymore.

372
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,120
You're stating the obvious!

373
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,400
They are not stupid.

374
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,720
Which is worse? Framing his peer

375
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,240
or conspiring with the enemy?

376
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
Surely he would confess

377
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
to the lesser of two evils.

378
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,080
She's a ruthless woman.

379
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,040
I don't believe she's dead.

380
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,720
Are you sure this is not a setup?

381
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,080
I'm sure it's not.

382
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,640
Her Highness saw to it herself.

383
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,360
It's of grave importance.

384
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,720
The spies had verified it before reporting.

385
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,960
What a pity.

386
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,360
If she wanted me to return the favour

387
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,960
by asking me to rescue her

388
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,160
I might not turn her down.

389
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,360
But she wasted such a precious chance

390
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,360
on this wolf guy.

391
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,320
She probably overanalysed the situation.

392
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,320
Let's pack up and leave.

393
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,800
Just leave him here.

394
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,360
Since she's dead

395
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,640
I no longer need to keep my promise.

396
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,680
So, we'll just... leave him here?

397
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,800
What, do you want to take care of him?

398
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,960
Huangcheng is full of odd characters.

399
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,680
I'd better stay far away from here

400
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,000
and not get involved anymore.

401
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,880
<i>Hua Residence</i>

402
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
What do you want?

403
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,600
I'm one of the guards of the Hua family.

404
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Her Highness has passed down an order.

405
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,600
The Hua family is imprisoned.

406
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,120
No one can enter or leave without permission.

407
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Where is Hua Qian?

408
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
Is she in there too?

409
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,080
Miss Hua took the rap for her father.

410
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
She set herself on fire ten days ago

411
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
in Zhong's Garden.

412
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,880
Set herself on fire?

413
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,960
Where's Hua Qian?

414
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,520
Who... are you?

415
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,880
The nerve of you to come here.

416
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,680
Chen Yuan.

417
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,920
Don't kill him.

418
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,480
Throw him out.

419
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,240
Where is she?

420
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,600
Where are you hiding her?

421
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,120
She died.

422
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
It's impossible.

423
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,680
Why is it impossible?

424
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,000
Even though I'm Lord of the Zhong family

425
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,160
I'm unable to protect everyone...

426
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,120
in Zhong's Garden.

427
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,560
You were unable to protect her.

428
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,520
Since you were unable to protect her

429
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,280
then why did you...

430
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,560
force her to stay here?

431
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,320
I really don't know what she saw in you.

432
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,440
How could you trap her in such a place?

433
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,000
I will give you a chance.

434
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,240
On the fifth day of every month

435
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,720
you're free to come here.

436
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
If you can defeat my guards

437
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,440
then we will talk about...

438
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,000
her.

439
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,160
Do you mean...

440
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,280
Why do you treasure such a tattered sachet?

441
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,320
Xin?

442
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,640
Am I dreaming?

443
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,800
Do you still think it is a dream?

444
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,160
Why are you here?

445
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,680
I caused the wound on Meng Yifei's face.

446
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
What do you want?

447
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
Freedom.

448
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,920
Think about it.

449
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,160
If Hua Qian is charged with assault

450
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,200
even if the Meng family doesn't pursue it

451
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,080
she will never be able to marry you.

452
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,480
I'm here to take the fall without being asked.

453
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,840
As far as I know

454
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,280
you used to hate Hua Qian.

455
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,400
Why would you do this for her?

456
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,960
Things are different now.

457
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,120
I know someone is waiting for me.

458
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,880
Zhong Xiwu is such a petty man.

459
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,360
I made some sarcastic remarks about him

460
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,840
so he ordered that my relatives

461
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,240
were not to take me in.

462
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,200
I've lost everything for your sake.

463
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
So...

464
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,920
are you able to provide for me?

465
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Of course!

466
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,280
I'm picky about food.

467
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,280
I'll cook for you.

468
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,320
I'm picky about my living condition, too.

469
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,920
I'll save up and buy a house.

470
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,280
I have never done any household chores.

471
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,680
I will do everything.

472
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,640
If you're going to do everything

473
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,800
what will I do?

474
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,040
You can just...

475
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,000
be my wife.

476
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Qian.

477
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,600
Qian.

478
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,360
Qian.

479
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,880
Qian.

480
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,440
<i>Bonus footage</i>

481
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,600
Why does Lord always

482
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,840
carry medicine with him too?

483
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,920
I didn't notice.

484
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,720
I don't know when Lord started doing this.

485
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,280
You said "too". Why is that?

486
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,920
Miss Hua used to carry a pouch with her.

487
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,400
There was a small bottle of medicine inside it

488
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,280
which looked quite similar to Lord's.

489
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,120
Maybe our masters

490
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,640
are more thoughtful than us servants.

491
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,080
Steward Gao, what's wrong?

492
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,720
Don't mention this to Lord.

493
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,200
What?

494
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
About Miss Hua carrying

495
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,120
a medicine bottle with her.

496
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Why?

497
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,920
It hurts too much.

498
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,560
<i>It's easier for him to get over her</i>

499
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,600
<i>if he doesn't know that</i>

500
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,680
<i>the feelings were mutual.</i>
