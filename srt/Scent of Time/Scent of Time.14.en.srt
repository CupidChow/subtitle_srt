<i>Episode 14</i>

3
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,200
Miss.

4
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,960
But you're a year older than me.

5
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,720
This hairpin is a gift to you as a dowry.

6
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,640
Dowry?

7
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
You...

8
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,760
What are you talking about?

9
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,160
Don't run away!

10
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,280
Qian.

11
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Look!

12
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,400
It's so sunny out there.

13
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,320
Mistress, Mrs Hua sent someone

14
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
to ask about the matter

15
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
concerning your brother.

16
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,720
I was daydreaming again.

17
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,400
What incense are you using on your clothes?

18
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,720
It smells so familiar.

19
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,960
How would I be in the mood to put incense

20
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,360
on my clothes at a time like this?

21
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,280
Mistress, just tell me

22
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
what plans do you have

23
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,280
with regard to your brother?

24
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,280
Mistress!

25
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Mistress!

26
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,840
Mistress! Let's play kick-the-shuttlecock.

27
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,360
Come on, Mistress.

28
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,720
Just come with us, Mistress.

29
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Mistress!

30
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,640
Mistress, would you like some walnuts?

31
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
It keeps your mind sharp.

32
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,440
Mistress!

33
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,280
Mistress!

34
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,840
Housemaid Li, what should we do?

35
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
She's...

36
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,480
You'd better go to your room and get some rest.

37
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,920
It's no use waiting here.

38
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,040
Shen is still suffering in prison.

39
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,080
I can't possibly be at ease sitting in my room.

40
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,960
Shen is our only son

41
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,280
Magistrate Wang won't do anything

42
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,040
before he is convicted.

43
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,480
But we cannot just sit idle and do nothing.

44
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,440
Qian is

45
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,040
the Mistress of the Zhong family.

46
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
I've sent so many people over there

47
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to ask her for help.

48
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,240
Except for the time I went there myself

49
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
she didn't bother to say anything!

50
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,640
I'd say, she simply doesn't care

51
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,080
about her only elder brother.

52
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,400
How about...

53
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,600
I go and see her again?

54
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,000
She can ignore the servants I sent

55
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,720
surely she has to talk to me, her mother.

56
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,520
Sit down, will you?

57
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,400
This is a critical period.

58
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,280
You'd better not go to Zhong Residence.

59
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,160
Master is still angry.

60
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,240
If you go there frequently

61
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,680
all the more he might give Qian

62
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,320
the cold shoulder.

63
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,440
Then what should we do?

64
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,960
So, Qian is so afraid of

65
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,120
losing her position as Mistress

66
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,440
that she'll leave her brother in the lurch?

67
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
I think...

68
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,840
Qian must have other plans.

69
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,480
What plans can she have?

70
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,560
If she has other plans

71
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
why did she ignore the people I sent?

72
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,720
My dear

73
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,760
it could be that

74
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,440
someone has something on her

75
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
so her hands are tied

76
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,280
and is unable to help Shen openly.

77
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,480
What could it be?

78
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,680
I have no idea

79
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,960
but we had better not to act rashly.

80
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,600
Come on, have some tea.

81
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,280
I don't feel like it.

82
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,080
Both Shen and Qian worry me.

83
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,360
I know you have a sweet tooth.

84
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,840
See if these suit your taste.

85
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,800
The pastries here are excellent for sure.

86
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,400
A few days ago, Yelan married a concubine

87
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
and you also went to join in the fun?

88
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Yes.

89
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,360
I didn't attend my senior's wedding

90
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,760
when he married his wife

91
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,160
so I made up for it this time.

92
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,560
You are the Lord of the Zhong family

93
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,440
it's not inappropriate even if you didn't go.

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,280
He is my senior.

95
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,040
I should at least go and take a look.

96
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,960
I know that the two of you are close

97
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,360
since childhood.

98
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,360
So, what happened to the son of the Hua family?

99
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,760
Why did he get thrown into prison

100
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,400
as soon as the wedding was over?

101
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,080
The news was suppressed

102
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,920
within Zhong Residence.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,560
I haven't heard a whiff of it

104
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,200
in the past few days.

105
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,120
Actually, it wasn't a big deal.

106
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,120
Hua Shen passed out

107
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,520
in my senior's concubine's room that day.

108
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,760
No one knew what happened exactly

109
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,000
so he's in custody

110
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,760
awaiting Magistrate Wang to investigate.

111
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,760
But it's been more than half a month.

112
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,880
Why hasn't Magistrate Wang done anything yet?

113
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,120
It is a grave matter.

114
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,160
After all, he is the only son of Butler Hua

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,320
and my senior is watching how the case unfolds

116
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
so Magistrate Wang is afraid

117
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
to make a rash judgment.

118
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,200
Yelan is a person who can distinguish

119
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,480
right from wrong

120
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
so he won't wrong the innocent.

121
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,240
I'm guessing Qian must feel unsettled.

122
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,400
Qian is a sensible and kind girl.

123
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,440
Unfortunately, she has such a terrible sibling.

124
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
She's in a dilemma

125
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,880
about whether to help him or not.

126
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,320
I wanted to ask her

127
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,440
to come over and comfort her

128
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,480
but she doesn't seem to want

129
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
to get out of the house at all.

130
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,040
Mistress.

131
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,240
Mistress, the weather is nice today.

132
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,600
Do you want to go out for a walk?

133
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,840
Sister Qianzhi...

134
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,360
What is going on with Mistress?

135
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,600
Why is she keeping silent

136
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,960
and lying still all day?

137
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,000
Young Master Hua is still in prison.

138
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,880
Why is Mistress not doing anything?

139
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,400
Mistress is very upset for sure

140
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,600
but Master is not letting the matter slide

141
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,000
what else can Mistress do?

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,720
Then what should we do?

143
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,600
We can't let Mistress be depressed like this.

144
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,480
We have said and done everything we could.

145
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,600
Master hasn't relented

146
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,120
and Mistress chose to remain silent.

147
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,200
We can do nothing about this situation.

148
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,560
Concubine Mu, you paint really well.

149
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,720
Not really.

150
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,160
She hasn't been out of her compound

151
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,760
for the past half month.

152
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
She hasn't done much either.

153
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,360
If she stands by and does nothing

154
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,840
not fearing being called cold-blooded

155
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,520
I will look up to her a little.

156
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,360
If she has the nerve to help Hua Shen

157
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,760
I won't hesitate to take advantage of this

158
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,240
and drag her into the mire as well.

159
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
But Magistrate Wang

160
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,280
is merely locking Hua Shen in prison

161
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,560
and nothing more.

162
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,040
There's no rush.

163
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,920
Is your hand okay?

164
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
It's fine.

165
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,440
Is my head very heavy?

166
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,840
Not at all.

167
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,480
Where are they?

168
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,080
I don't see any maids around.

169
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,640
I don't know either.

170
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,560
Squat down and talk to me for a while.

171
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,600
I'm wide awake now.

172
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,640
I haven't asked you this since you came.

173
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,600
Is your family in Huangcheng?

174
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,600
No

175
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,800
they live in a remote village.

176
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,000
They couldn't afford to raise me

177
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,520
because of the famine

178
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,640
so they sold me to a rich family as a slave.

179
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,440
Didn't you join the Zhong Residence

180
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,000
when we were recruiting guards last year?

181
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,040
I was sold to another family

182
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,880
and I escaped from there.

183
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,400
Then you...

184
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,720
must have had a hard time.

185
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
Not anymore.

186
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,640
Not anymore.

187
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,760
Do you still hate that rich family

188
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,640
who mistreated you?

189
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,760
Not anymore.

190
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Why?

191
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,360
That's because I have already...

192
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
Why did you want to see me?

193
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
Like always, you are good at

194
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,600
winning people's hearts.

195
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,560
You have raised yourself a loyal servant.

196
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,720
Master, did you come here for a quarrel?

197
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,200
Aren't you the one who wants to see me?

198
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,120
When did I...

199
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,520
The maids took it upon themselves.

200
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,920
I have nothing to say to you.

201
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,120
Please go back, Master.

202
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,280
You haven't been out in the past half month.

203
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,200
What are you up to?

204
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,280
Have I done something wrong?

205
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
Or has your prejudice made you think that

206
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,080
I have done something wrong?

207
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,960
Are you blaming me?

208
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,920
What's the use of blaming you?

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,920
That would only make me feel upset.

210
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,680
You seem to enjoy making insinuating remarks.

211
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,480
You didn't want to listen to me before

212
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,240
and now I don't want to talk to you either.

213
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,240
My mind is troubled

214
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,160
I don't have the mood to argue with you

215
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
so please leave me alone.

216
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Hua Qian...

217
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,440
Take my brother's life

218
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,000
if you want to

219
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,040
as long as you can feel at ease.

220
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,040
Mistress.

221
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,360
I asked for Master without your permission

222
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,960
because I was really worried

223
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,760
seeing you were so depressed.

224
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
It's okay.

225
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
I don't blame you.

226
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Qian.

227
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,400
Qian, I saw that you hadn't bought

228
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,400
any decent jewellery since you were married.

229
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,440
I went to buy some nice ones for you

230
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,680
and here they are.

231
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,440
Mistress, it's time to go to bed.

232
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,720
<i>Now I finally know</i>

233
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,160
<i>why I was reborn on the night of my wedding.</i>

234
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,040
<i>If it had been earlier</i>

235
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,960
<i>I'm afraid I would once again</i>

236
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,160
<i>protect the Hua family blindly</i>

237
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,360
<i>without realising what I had done was so...</i>

238
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,800
Get prepared tomorrow morning.

239
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
I'll be going out.

240
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,720
Mistress, where are you going?

241
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,200
I'll go and check on my shops.

242
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,880
Sure. I'll get things ready tomorrow morning.

243
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Forget it.

244
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,480
In the morning, go tell the shops

245
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,200
to prepare their accounts books.

246
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,800
I'll be there in the afternoon

247
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,600
to check on their profit and loss

248
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,240
and see how much money I could draw out.

249
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,560
Mistress, do you need money?

250
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,680
Yes.

251
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,480
Money is power

252
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,440
no matter where we are.

253
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,200
These are the last month's accounts books.

254
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,240
Lord...

255
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,320
Mistress is out of the house.

256
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
Help me sort these out. Do it quickly!

257
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Yes, Lord.

258
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
After you.

259
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Get the bank notes ready

260
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,280
for the amount that can be drawn out.

261
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I'll send someone to pick them up

262
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,480
in the next few days.

263
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,600
Yes, Mistress.

264
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,360
Take care.

265
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,480
Let's go. You've been out with me all day.

266
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,880
I'll treat you to dinner.

267
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,960
Your dishes are ready. Please enjoy.

268
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,640
What are you doing standing there?

269
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,880
Sit down and eat.

270
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,680
Come on!

271
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,200
The food in this restaurant is pretty good.

272
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,640
Eat more. You too. Come on.

273
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,800
Aren't you Rongzhou?

274
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,840
I haven't seen you in half a year.

275
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,240
You're doing well.

276
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,360
My apologies.

277
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,840
I have interrupted you. Enjoy the meal.

278
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,720
Call me anytime if you need anything.

279
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Do you know him?

280
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,040
Before I applied for the job as a guard

281
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,400
I worked here as a choreman for a few months.

282
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
You have had many experiences

283
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,600
despite being young.

284
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,640
Come on, eat more.

285
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,040
Bravo!

286
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Bravo!

287
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Park the carriage.

288
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,480
Let's take a stroll before going home.

289
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,840
Yes, Mistress.

290
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,920
—One more!                        —One more!

291
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,680
Here, this added osmanthus.

292
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,920
Okay.

293
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,800
In the past six months since I was reborn

294
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,800
I hadn't gone out for a walk at night.

295
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,000
After seeing barrenness in the wasteland

296
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,800
the bustling market now seems

297
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,040
quite beautiful.

298
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Give way!

299
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,320
One more...

300
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,280
Why do I feel like you've grown taller again?

301
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,120
Lord, why are you out alone?

302
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,920
You haven't been out for a month.

303
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,360
Why did you suddenly leave the house today?

304
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,040
Do you have spies in Zhong Residence?

305
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,000
Or else how would you know about what I do?

306
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,840
What do you think?

307
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,200
Since I found you, let's go.

308
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,520
Why were you looking for me?

309
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
I'd like to take you somewhere.

310
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,840
Let's go.

311
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,080
Greetings, Miss Meng.

312
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,240
—Is Lord in there?              —Yes, he is.

313
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,920
Then, could you please notify Lord

314
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,520
that my lady has made him some soup

315
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,920
since it is cold today?

316
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,640
Lord has passed down an order.

317
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,200
He's busy with work

318
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,760
so no outsiders are allowed.

319
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,400
How can my lady be considered an outsider?

320
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,440
Please forgive me, Miss Meng.

321
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,640
I can't defy Lord's order.

322
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,080
Why don't you go and notify him

323
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,880
and I'll leave as soon as I deliver the soup?

324
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,840
Miss Meng, just pass me the soup

325
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,600
and I will send it.

326
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,080
Why isn't Steward Gao here?

327
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,440
He is inside, serving Lord.

328
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,400
Well, thank you.

329
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,160
Not at all, Miss Meng.

330
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,040
I just heard about

331
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,840
the falling out between Hua Qian and Master

332
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,360
the day before yesterday.

333
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm surprised to see

334
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,360
another person wallowing in sorrow today.

335
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,920
How nice.

336
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,400
—How nice.                          —Miss...

337
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,680
It would be nice to see

338
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,840
a few more people in misery in this world.

339
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,520
What is this place?

340
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
Star Reaching Tower.

341
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,320
The lower floors are where the Zhong family

342
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,840
develops fragrance formulas during the day

343
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,680
and the upper floors

344
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
are where medicinal herbs are stored.

345
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,200
No one goes up at night.

346
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,120
Why have you brought me here?

347
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,440
Let's head upstairs.

348
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,960
Go upstairs on foot?

349
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
How else?

350
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,520
Lord, take your time to go up there.

351
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,680
I will take my leave first.

352
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,320
How many floors are there in total?

353
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,840
Eleven.

354
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
Which floor are we going to?

355
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
The eleventh floor.

356
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,480
Lord, do you think

357
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,120
I can climb to the eleventh floor?

358
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,440
You can take a rest if you get tired halfway.

359
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,880
Well... I feel pain in my chest all of a sudden

360
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,480
I suppose it's the aftereffect

361
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,120
of the arrow injury.

362
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,600
I'm weak and sickly.

363
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,640
I can't climb so many flights of stairs

364
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,560
so I'd better go home and rest.

365
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Physician Wu said

366
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
climbing stairs

367
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,280
is a way to strengthen your body

368
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
so it will do you no harm.

369
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,000
But I really feel pain in my chest.

370
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,440
Physician Wu may be wrong about this.

371
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,240
Oh, suddenly, the pain subsided.

372
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,680
Let's go.

373
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Here we are.

374
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,240
Come here.

375
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm too tired to move.

376
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,920
Let me show you something nice.

377
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,200
It's pitch dark.

378
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,960
What's there to see?

379
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,040
It seems that you have no fear of me at all now.

380
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,720
Do you want me to drag you over?

381
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,440
Lord, don't you have better things to do?

382
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
It wasn't easy for me to make time for this.

383
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,680
Looking down from here

384
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,920
do you have a feeling that

385
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,120
everything is under your feet

386
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,880
and all your troubles have disappeared?

387
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,400
The troubles will not disappear

388
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,320
just because you're standing on high ground.

389
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,080
When you're on higher ground

390
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,400
the less you see.

391
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,080
You're not making sense.

392
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,000
Have you never heard the saying

393
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,480
"Stand high and look far"?

394
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,680
That's not necessarily the case.

395
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,360
What's the use of looking far?

396
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,720
Even if you could see the overall picture

397
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,560
you may be shackled by your bias

398
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,960
and can't see what's in front of you.

399
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,760
You have to see it with your own eyes

400
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,880
to know that.

401
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,480
If you hadn't taken the effort

402
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,680
climbing up the stairs today

403
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,800
you could only imagine the scenery

404
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,960
that everyone talked about.

405
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,200
If you fear you might overlook certain things

406
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,600
then pay more attention to those around you

407
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
instead of refraining from looking afar.

408
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
Lord, did you bring me here

409
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,160
just to admire the scenery?

410
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,240
Seeing that you have refused

411
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,440
my mother's invitation

412
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,920
I selflessly shared the vantage point

413
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,400
for this breathtaking scenery with you

414
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,520
which ordinary people can't see.

415
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,120
Why do you treat me so well?

416
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,240
Shouldn't allies help each other?

417
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,400
<i>Help each other?</i>

418
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,560
<i>Could it be that he has the same motive</i>

419
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,120
<i>as Wu Shuomo?</i>

420
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
<i>He also wants me to pull myself together</i>

421
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,520
<i>and take Zhong Yelan back</i>

422
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,920
<i>so he can marry the woman he fancies?</i>

423
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,880
—What do you want to do?          —I just...

424
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,080
I didn't bring you here to let you kill yourself.

425
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,000
Lord, this is inappropriate, isn't it?

426
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,320
There's nothing to fear.

427
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,440
At night, only my people are here

428
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,920
in the Star Reaching Tower

429
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,080
and no one else would see us.

430
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,640
Lord, are you encouraging me

431
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,800
to cheat on my husband?

432
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,800
I dare you to say something like this again.

433
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,480
Do you like...

434
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,280
She is already married.

435
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,640
Do you still think about her?

436
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
Yes.

437
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,800
She's such a lucky woman.

438
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,400
<i>Mu Yao has always been so lucky.</i>

439
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
<i>She has many men</i>

440
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,280
<i>who love her unconditionally.</i>

441
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
<i>Unlike me</i>

442
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,600
<i>no matter how hard I try</i>

443
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,080
<i>I can't even change</i>

444
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,320
<i>the prejudice they have against me.</i>

445
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,080
<i>No doubt one mistake leads to another.</i>

446
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,000
Do you want some?

447
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,920
What is that?

448
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,920
Yuelu Wine.

449
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,200
It's said that drinking it could relieve worries

450
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,480
and it's exclusive to the Star Reaching Tower.

451
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,800
It is not for sale.

452
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,040
Relieve worries?

453
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,200
It's easier than done.

454
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,960
Didn't you say this was for me?

455
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,480
Take another bottle for yourself.

456
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,600
How stingy of you to bring out

457
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,720
those tiny wine cups.

458
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,040
Do you know what Yuelu Wine is?

459
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,240
Didn't you say it could relieve worries?

460
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,680
What do you think is the solution

461
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,880
to relieve worries?

462
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,680
That is the strongest fragrance wine

463
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
in the world.

464
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Fragrance wine?

465
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
The strongest?

466
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,120
Lord, enjoy the wine. I'll leave now.

467
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,280
Wait... what's the rush?

468
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,520
—I'll walk down with you.        —It's fine.

469
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,440
I have my maid. Lord, don't follow me.

470
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,080
It'll be terrible if someone sees us.

471
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,000
<i>Yuelu Wine</i>

472
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,640
Mistress.

473
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
—Mistress.                   —Let's go home.

474
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,520
All right.

475
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,200
Mistress.

476
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,560
—Mistress...        —I can't hold my liquor.

477
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm afraid I'll be embarrassing myself.

478
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,920
Please carry me downstairs. Hurry.

479
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,200
Mistress, you know you can't hold your liquor

480
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,360
then why did you...

481
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,960
Hurry up.

482
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,680
—Give me more wine.               —Mistress.

483
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,600
Put me down. I want more wine.

484
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
Let me go.

485
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Put me down.

486
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,280
I want more wine.

487
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,200
—Mistress!                     —Put me down!

488
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,960
—I want more wine!                —Mistress!

489
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,280
Put me down. I want more wine.

490
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,640
No, Mistress.

491
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,400
—Mistress.                        —Mistress.

492
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,800
I want more wine.

493
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,680
I'll go and pull the carriage over.

494
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,360
All right. Mistress!

495
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,920
I want more wine.

496
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,800
Let go of me! I want to drink!

497
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,200
—I want to drink!                 —Mistress.

498
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,680
I'll go and pull the carriage over.

499
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,240
—Star Reaching Tower...     —Look after her.

500
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,440
—Star Reaching Tower's wine.      —Remember.

501
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,040
No one must see Mistress like this.

502
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,920
—Understood.              —I want more wine!

503
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,840
Why are you leaving?

504
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,360
—Mistress.                —I want more wine!

505
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,000
—Mistress.                —I want more wine!

506
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Mistress.

507
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,480
Get up.

508
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,320
—So bright.   —Mistress, don't poke my eyes.

509
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,200
So dazzling.

510
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
So beautiful.

511
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Get up.

512
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,520
It smells so good.

513
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,680
Your hair is so smooth.

514
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,480
What balm do you use to maintain it?

515
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,200
Why is your hair so smooth?

516
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,840
It smells so good.

517
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,960
Don't...

518
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,440
So soft.

519
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,480
What a soft candy.

520
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,720
So soft.

521
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,080
Why isn't it sweet at all?

522
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,200
She ran fast, didn't she?

523
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,560
Send someone to deliver it tomorrow.

524
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,800
I'll see to it, Lord.

525
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,800
Thank you for your hard work, Guard Hua.

526
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,920
I didn't do it on purpose.

527
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,320
Why is Mistress crying?

528
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,160
Get in the carriage. Let's go.

529
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,800
<i>Bonus footage</i>

530
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,120
I didn't do it on purpose.

531
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,120
Mistress?

532
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,920
I didn't know she was Linglong.

533
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,480
After I was reborn

534
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,200
I have never seen Linglong in Hua Residence.

535
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,480
I didn't know she was Linglong.

536
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
Sorry.

537
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,640
None of you believes me

538
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,040
and no one wants to help me.

539
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,640
And I get blamed for everything that happened.

540
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,080
What can I do?

541
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,640
I am not an all-knowing god

542
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,040
how on earth would I know what was happening

543
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,440
behind my back?

544
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,000
Now that I get to relive my life

545
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,640
why are you all still doing this to you?

546
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,480
I am not the magistrate.

547
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,040
Even if I knew that fatty did something wrong

548
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,800
what could I do?

549
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,680
I don't want to die.

550
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,040
I want to live.

551
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,120
I just want to live.

552
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,560
I don't want to watch my family die again.

553
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,960
