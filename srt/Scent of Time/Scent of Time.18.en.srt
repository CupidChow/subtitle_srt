00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Scent of Time

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,960
<i>Episode 18</i>

3
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,920
Mistress.

4
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,200
Shen...

5
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,920
Look at me, Shen.

6
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,520
Shen...

7
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,560
My son.

8
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,200
How could it be?

9
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,840
How could he be dead?

10
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,560
Stop.

11
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,480
Get your hands off him.

12
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,320
What are you doing here?

13
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,560
What are you doing here?

14
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
My dear...

15
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
—I don't want you here.            —My dear.

16
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,840
—You got him killed.               —My dear!

17
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,680
You got him killed. Do you know that?

18
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
My dear!

19
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,000
He was still worried about you

20
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
on his dying breath.

21
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,040
—It was you who got him killed.    —My dear.

22
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,560
—It was you.                         —Madam.

23
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,280
—Madam.           —I don't want you here.

24
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,200
—It was all your fault.              —Ma'am.

25
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,320
Let's go. Come on, Madam.

26
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
You can leave too.

27
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,320
My dear daughter...

28
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,440
It wasn't your fault.

29
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,520
Your mother is overwhelmed by grief.

30
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,520
She didn't mean to say that.

31
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,840
Don't take it to heart.

32
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,800
I thought

33
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,400
I had raised a good-for-nothing son.

34
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,840
And all he did

35
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,800
was causing us trouble.

36
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
But now he's dead

37
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,240
and I don't think it's bad to clean up a mess

38
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,600
for someone anymore.

39
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,920
He was a good-for-nothing

40
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,480
and never turned over a new leaf.

41
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
But...

42
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,080
in the end, he did...

43
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,040
something impressive.

44
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,960
And he made us very proud.

45
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
All these years

46
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,560
I worked hard and did all I could

47
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,720
to move up the ladder.

48
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,080
I had planned to pave the way for him.

49
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,960
Now that he is gone

50
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,960
the position of Head Butler

51
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,880
is meaningless to me now.

52
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,080
Father, do you mean

53
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,760
you'll reconsider what I told you before?

54
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,680
My dear daughter.

55
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,360
You've done a lot for the family.

56
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,720
Maybe...

57
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
I was wrong.

58
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,520
Your brother...

59
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,240
was not fit to be a merchant, to begin with.

60
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,480
If I had given up my greed

61
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,240
for power and wealth earlier

62
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,160
all this might not have happened.

63
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,320
My dear daughter.

64
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,720
We only have you now.

65
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,520
You said you didn't want to stay in Huangcheng.

66
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,440
All right, we won't stay here.

67
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
From now on

68
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,080
I'll heed your advice.

69
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,280
I'll resign from my position.

70
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,400
Are you injured?

71
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

72
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
Qian...

73
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
I got this brocade satin a few days ago.

74
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,800
It's white. Your favourite colour.

75
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,680
It's said to be the only one in the world.

76
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,040
I heard you'd come home today

77
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,160
so I spent a lot of money on it.

78
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,960
Put on a dress made of this

79
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,280
and Master will fall head over heels for you.

80
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Here you go!

81
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
That's great.

82
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Mistress.

83
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,960
Do you smell a familiar fragrance?

84
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
No.

85
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,120
Qian.

86
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,560
Qian.

87
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,840
You've never bought jewellery

88
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,160
since you married into the Zhong family

89
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,800
so I specially got some for you.

90
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,120
Qian...

91
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,520
You're the daughter of our family.

92
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,920
You look pretty

93
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,200
and many people like you.

94
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,520
You don't have to suffer in Zhong Residence.

95
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,240
I bear in mind everything you said.

96
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,040
Why won't you believe me?

97
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Qian...

98
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,400
I've been in prison for so long.

99
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,560
Why haven't you come to see me?

100
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,400
You told me to get some rest

101
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
and that you would come later.

102
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,240
I waited all day but you didn't turn up.

103
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,640
Qian...

104
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Qian.

105
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,040
Did it also hurt so much

106
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,800
when you got hit by an arrow?

107
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,440
I'm your brother.

108
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,600
How could I stand by and do nothing

109
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,360
when I saw that you were in danger?

110
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,760
Don't be afraid, Qian.

111
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,200
Don't be afraid, Qian.

112
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,560
I-I-I'm fine.

113
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,080
I'll protect you.

114
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,040
I'll protect you.

115
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
Qian...

116
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,440
Qian...

117
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,360
Mistress.

118
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
Did you see that?

119
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,160
See what, Mistress?

120
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,560
Mistress?

121
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,520
—Brother...                       —Mistress!

122
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Brother.

123
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Mistress.

124
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,680
Hua Shen.

125
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,400
Mistress.

126
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,200
Hua Shen is dead.

127
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Are you aware?

128
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,120
I was shot

129
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,480
by an arrow to the chest too.

130
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,600
Why did I survive

131
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,480
and he couldn't?

132
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,800
Why couldn't he make it?

133
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,040
Am I dreaming?

134
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,320
Maybe he is not dead.

135
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,280
I can still hear...

136
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,320
I can still hear his voice.

137
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,120
I heard him...

138
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,440
complaining...

139
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
about me.

140
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,400
Mistress, are you all right?

141
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
I don't...

142
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't have a brother anymore.

143
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,640
—Mistress...       —This is the second time.

144
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,000
The second time.

145
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,600
The second time.

146
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,080
The second time.

147
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
It's all right.

148
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,720
I'm here.

149
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,960
I will never leave.

150
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,880
I will be by your side forever, Mistress.

151
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,720
The eldest son of the Hua family died young.

152
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
What happened?

153
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
Look.

154
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,040
My son.

155
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,320
Shen!

156
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,760
Qianzhi.

157
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,680
Mistress.

158
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,440
What's with the noise outside?

159
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Mistress.

160
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,360
It's Young Master Hua's funeral today.

161
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,880
Mistress, do you want to get up and get dressed?

162
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,760
I won't go.

163
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,240
I won't attend the funeral.

164
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,520
Don't wake me up.

165
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,920
You should attend your brother's funeral.

166
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,600
It is late morning.

167
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
If you don't go

168
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,560
tongues will wag.

169
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
You're crying?

170
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
How did you get in here?

171
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,040
I'm invited to attend the funeral.

172
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,400
Who let you in?

173
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,360
Are the servants all dead?

174
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,480
Qian.

175
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,080
I am your husband

176
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,680
so they wouldn't stop me.

177
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,800
What?

178
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,360
Are you being nice to me

179
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
because you sympathise with me

180
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,720
or because you feel guilty towards me?

181
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,600
What do you think I am?

182
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Qian.

183
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,280
—Qianzhi.                             —Qian!

184
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
—Qianzhi.                             —Qian!

185
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,440
I know you are upset

186
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,960
but you should do your hair

187
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,680
and get dressed before going out.

188
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,080
What does it have to do with you?

189
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm here to take you back.

190
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,200
Take me back? Back where?

191
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
Back to Zhong Residence?

192
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,440
To watch you and Mu Yao

193
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,840
show affection for each other

194
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,280
and pretend I don't know that

195
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,760
while I live alone in my compound?

196
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Qian.

197
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,520
The servants at Zhong's Garden must be too busy

198
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,800
and forgot.

199
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,720
Qianzhi, get someone to urge them tomorrow.

200
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,040
Ask them why the divorce letter signed by Lord

201
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,360
hasn't been delivered here yet.

202
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,960
You went to Zhong's Garden to see Lord?

203
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,240
Yes, I did.

204
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,360
I'm done with you.

205
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,920
I will have someone bring back my things

206
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
and my people in Zhong Residence tomorrow.

207
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,640
Let's thrash everything out now

208
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,040
because we will never see each other again.

209
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,200
Qian, are you done?

210
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Let me go.

211
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,480
—Let me go.                           —Qian!

212
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,680
How dare you, you disrespectful slave!

213
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,840
Get out!

214
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,320
Hua Rongzhou is my guard.

215
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,240
You can't give him orders.

216
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Get out of the way.

217
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,240
I only take orders from my mistress.

218
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,800
Get out of here, Zhong Yelan!

219
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,400
What are you trying to do, harassing me?

220
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,880
Stop wavering since you have made a choice.

221
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,640
Do you really want to be driven out?

222
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,080
Hua Qian.

223
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,640
Since you insist on divorcing me

224
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,440
I will...

225
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,440
do as you wish.

226
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,520
Zhong Yelan.

227
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,480
Pass Mu Yao a message when you get back.

228
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,200
She...

229
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,720
owes me two lives now.

230
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
Did Zhong Yelan hit you very hard just now?

231
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,080
Did you get hurt?

232
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,960
You don't look well.

233
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,840
I'm fine.

234
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,280
If you encounter this kind of situation again

235
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,160
remember not to act rashly

236
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,240
and only do as I ask.

237
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,360
Otherwise, instead of helping me

238
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,200
you would be causing me trouble.

239
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,280
I can resolve

240
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,640
my own problems.

241
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,040
You should go and see a physician.

242
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,600
I'm fully awake

243
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
after the commotion with Zhong Yelan.

244
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
Qianzhi, come and help me freshen up.

245
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
Yes, Mistress.

246
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,520
Magistrate Wang.

247
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,640
Have the assassins been caught?

248
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,160
The assassins that showed up

249
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,680
at your Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

250
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,040
had committed suicide after being captured.

251
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,640
No one survived.

252
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,600
You once said

253
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,960
that the fleeing Ge family

254
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,560
were under your control.

255
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,440
First, the assassins stole our fragrance formula

256
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
at the ancestral worship ceremony.

257
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Then came the massacre

258
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet.

259
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,920
They came and went so easily.

260
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,120
At that grand Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

261
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,480
the butlers of the Zhong family

262
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,840
gathered together to celebrate

263
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,120
but it became a good chance for the assassins

264
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,640
to kill us all.

265
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,080
If my mother had gotten hurt in this incident

266
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,640
how would you report it to the government?

267
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Lord Zhong.

268
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,520
Although not all of the assassins were captured

269
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,840
I have discovered something strange

270
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,240
about this attack.

271
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,360
Not again.

272
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,080
Magistrate Wang.

273
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,240
You have indeed discovered a lot of things.

274
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,040
In fact... since last year

275
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,880
the Ge family has been inactive for a long time.

276
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,600
But after the chaos at the ancestral worship

277
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,960
and the assassination

278
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,720
at the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

279
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,160
their movements are getting

280
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,080
more and more suspicious.

281
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,040
After the ancestral worship ceremony

282
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,560
we have intensified our search.

283
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,200
Therefore, I can guarantee that

284
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,760
no more than five of them can escape

285
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,760
and hide in the city.

286
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,320
Dozens of assassins appeared at the banquet

287
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
but you're saying

288
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,200
there are no more than five of them?

289
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,640
This is the second strange point

290
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,440
I want to talk about.

291
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,840
The attire and weapons of these assassins

292
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,440
are different from the previous ones.

293
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,160
After verifying with experienced craftsmen

294
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,520
and clothing shop owners in the city

295
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,880
I am certain

296
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,480
they are from two different groups.

297
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Two different groups?

298
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,760
Indeed.

299
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,200
Those who showed up at the worship ceremony

300
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,320
were from the Ge family.

301
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
As for the other group

302
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,080
they might not have enough people

303
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,600
so they could only hire temporary help.

304
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,160
Plus, they were in a rush.

305
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,320
That's why there was such a big difference.

306
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,880
As I said before

307
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,120
someone from the inside was helping them.

308
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,920
I remember

309
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,360
when Junior Lord Wu came to the city

310
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,600
he made several attempts

311
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,040
to invite Mistress Zhong out

312
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,680
which was really strange.

313
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,320
Are you suspecting

314
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,320
my senior or the Hua family?

315
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,560
I'm merely expressing my doubts.

316
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,760
No wonder you couldn't find out anything.

317
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,400
You're barking up the wrong tree!

318
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,920
The assassination at the banquet

319
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,920
must have been planned in advance.

320
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,320
They wouldn't hire help at the last minute.

321
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,400
If the two groups collaborated as you said

322
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,480
they would at least

323
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
standardise their attire and weapons.

324
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,920
How could they make such a big mistake

325
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
for you to discover?

326
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,000
Please give me more time, Lord Zhong.

327
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,960
I'll try my best to find the culprit behind it.

328
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,400
It remains unverified whether there were

329
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,880
two groups of assassins at the banquet

330
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,560
so keep it to yourself.

331
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,160
I don't want to alert the enemy.

332
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,160
Rest assured. My lips are sealed.

333
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,400
Are you going out, Mistress?

334
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,560
You should bring your guard with you.

335
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,920
No need. I don't want anyone to know.

336
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,600
Can I go out with you, Mistress?

337
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,760
Sure.

338
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
Lord.

339
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,200
Someone over there sent a message again.

340
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Come close.

341
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Lord...

342
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,840
Too many people are watching Magistrate Wang

343
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,880
and they are careful about his every move.

344
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,680
Now that all eyes are on him

345
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,880
you can investigate on the sly.

346
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,200
You know the number of guards

347
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,760
of all the households in the city.

348
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,000
Go find out

349
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,240
where these assassins come from.

350
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Yes, Lord.

351
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,920
<i>Grave of Hua Shen</i>

352
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,680
What's wrong?

353
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,920
This place is quite eerie at nightfall.

354
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,920
Why don't we stay beside Mistress?

355
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,600
That's Young Master Hua.

356
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,120
There's nothing scary.

357
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,960
Brother.

358
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm late again.

359
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,120
I didn't want to send you off with the others

360
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,160
so I came alone.

361
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,920
I said we would talk after the banquet.

362
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,040
I kept my promise this time.

363
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,120
You won't blame me, will you?

364
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,800
This exquisite wine

365
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,800
underwent a long ageing process.

366
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,200
Be sure to treat my sister well.

367
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
Here, a toast to you.

368
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,040
Your brother is looking after you.

369
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,680
I'm going back, Brother.

370
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
I'll see you next time.

371
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,160
How long have you been standing here?

372
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,200
Just half an hour.

373
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,040
How did you know I was here?

374
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,520
I know you are soft-hearted.

375
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,400
You never stood by and did nothing

376
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,320
when Hua Shen got into trouble.

377
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,160
Others think you didn't attend the funeral

378
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,360
because you were heartless.

379
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,360
But I was very sure

380
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,080
you would come here.

381
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,800
Why are you here?

382
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,680
I have something for you.

383
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,480
<i>Letter of Divorce</i>

384
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,920
You could have a servant deliver it to me.

385
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,160
You didn't have to come in person.

386
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,600
I wanted to see you.

387
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,320
That was inappropriate, Lord.

388
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,560
It's getting late. I'd better go back.

389
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,560
Is there any trace of the assassins

390
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,760
at the banquet that day?

391
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,120
Not yet.

392
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,640
They eliminated all the traces.

393
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,960
The captured assassins chose to end their lives

394
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
by poisoning themselves.

395
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
None survived.

396
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,440
They left no traces at the scene as well.

397
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,760
After all, it's always hard

398
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,440
to look for a member of the Ge family.

399
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,720
Marital law has been imposed on the city again.

400
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,320
Did the captured assassins wear

401
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,240
the same attire and carry the same weapons?

402
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,920
Why did you ask this question?

403
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,080
The assassins seemed poorly coordinated.

404
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,760
There were even disputes among them

405
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,280
as if they had different goals.

406
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,440
Your ability to remain calm in any circumstance

407
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,880
is truly admirable.

408
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,400
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

409
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,160
Don't patronise me with such words.

410
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Qian.

411
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
Even if we were alone

412
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,840
this would be an inappropriate act.

413
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
What do you take me for?

414
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,480
Don't you always know how I feel?

415
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,120
Yet, you're throwing rules at me now.

416
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,280
When did you change your target, Lord?

417
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
Nothing has changed.

418
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,600
It has always been you.

419
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,320
What about Mu Yao?

420
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,800
Why do you keep associating me with her?

421
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,400
You said

422
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
the way you looked at her was different

423
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,840
compared to how you looked at me.

424
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,000
Of course, it's different.

425
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,800
I look at you differently

426
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,920
because I fancy you.

427
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,960
It has never changed.

428
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,120
Behind the rockery earlier on

429
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,200
you mentioned Mu Yao. What does it mean?

430
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
Mu Yao is an excellent woman

431
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,960
so even Wu Shuomo has a crush on her.

432
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,320
That's a friendly reminder for you, Lord.

433
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,240
How do you know?

434
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,680
A man cannot hide his affection for his beloved.

435
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,720
The way you look at Mu Yao and me

436
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
are completely different.

437
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,240
Women are sensitive to such matters.

438
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,000
Of course, the way I look at Mu Yao

439
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,720
differs from the way I look at you.

440
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,000
The married woman whom I still think about

441
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
is also you.

442
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,920
She is already married.

443
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,120
Are you still thinking about her?

444
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,760
Yes, I am.

445
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
She's such a lucky woman.

446
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,760
And the one I wanted to make clothes for

447
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
is you as well.

448
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
It's done.

449
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,120
I want to make a piece of clothing for her.

450
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,560
You and she have a similar body shape.

451
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,720
Since you are here

452
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,040
can you help with the measurements?

453
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,080
I only have eyes for you...

454
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,520
the entire time.

455
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Qian.

456
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,960
I... I am married to Master.

457
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,440
I knew you would be burdened

458
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,640
because of your status

459
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,440
so I didn't tell you

460
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,680
until you're divorced.

461
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,320
You once used Mu Yao as an excuse

462
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,800
to reject me.

463
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,480
But why do you look like

464
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,720
you knew nothing of it now?

465
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,720
Since you understood what I meant that day

466
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,480
why did you come here today?

467
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,720
You're the daughter of the Hua family

468
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,840
once again

469
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,560
and there is no restriction anymore

470
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
so I came to ask you.

471
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,880
Are you joking, Lord?

472
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,720
Think about our identities.

473
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,640
We are not right for each other even now.

474
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,080
Perhaps it is not suitable

475
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,920
to talk about it right here right now.

476
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,720
Nevertheless, I want to know how you feel.

477
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,480
If you have a little bit of affection for me

478
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,920
leave the rest to me.

479
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
I'll make you stand rightfully beside me.

480
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,640
Didn't you see it, Lord?

481
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,440
See what?

482
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Qian.

483
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,440
Leave everything to me.

484
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,640
Give the nod

485
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,600
and I am here for you.

486
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,960
<i>Can I hold your hand?</i>

487
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,720
<i>Bonus footage</i>

488
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Grind ink for me.

489
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:39,680
<i>Letter of Divorce</i>

490
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,520
This is what she wanted.

491
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,560
Tell Lin Jiang to keep a close eye on them.

492
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,000
Yes, Lord.

493
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,200
Lord, Miss Meng is outside.

494
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,480
Let her in.

495
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,440
Greetings, Lord.

496
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,280
What's the matter?

497
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,600
Her Highness asked me to bring some food over.

498
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,040
All right. Put it down.

499
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,760
I'm busy.

500
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,720
If there's nothing else, you may leave.

501
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,240
Yes, Lord.

502
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,440
I'm taking my leave.
