00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,560
<i>Episode 28</i>

2
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
Qian!

3
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,400
Qian!

4
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,880
Qian!

5
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,080
"The house deed and money are yours.

6
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,440
If you can make this place

7
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
your permanent residence

8
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,720
and ensure that Hua Qian vanishes forever

9
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,760
the Hua family will always be safe."

10
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,640
Your Highness, you...

11
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,360
You should know that only Xiwu can take

12
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
the position of Lord of the Zhong family.

13
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,480
This was the very reason why the late emperor

14
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,680
wanted me to marry into the Zhong family.

15
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,720
The Zhong family runs

16
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,120
a century-old incense shop.

17
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,160
Over the years, it has saved countless lives

18
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,480
and healed the wounded.

19
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,480
That is why it is loved by the people.

20
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
There have been rumours about

21
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,640
the Zhong family being as rich as the country

22
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,440
which might be true to some degree.

23
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,640
Xiwu is my child.

24
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,960
He's a descendant of the royal family

25
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,960
so only he can be Lord.

26
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
Only he can keep the Zhong family going

27
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,040
and continue to pass down the art of incense.

28
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,120
Your Highness.

29
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,160
You don't have to tell me about this.

30
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,840
As Lord of the Zhong family

31
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,080
it's a taboo to place importance

32
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,360
on love relationships.

33
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,520
If he wants to be successful

34
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,880
he has to direct all his attention

35
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,440
to passing down the art of making incense.

36
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,080
He must not be swayed by one person.

37
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,040
Xiwu has been sensible and polite

38
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,640
since he was a child

39
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,720
but he has repeatedly broken the rules for you.

40
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,920
If you marry into Zhong's Garden

41
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,520
I'm afraid that there won't be peace.

42
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,000
I know what kind of a person you are

43
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,040
and I have no intention to pursue this matter

44
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,160
but he puts you before everything else.

45
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,440
You hurt him yesterday

46
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,720
but he kept it a secret.

47
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
He's still trying to cover up for you.

48
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,240
Please spare a thought for him.

49
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
If he wants to do well in his position

50
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,560
he must not have any weaknesses.

51
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
I'm telling you this as a parent.

52
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Can you see where I'm coming from?

53
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Yes, I can.

54
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,120
Thank you for taking the trouble

55
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
to clear up my doubts, Your Highness.

56
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,280
She may sound harsh

57
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,400
but she has a soft heart.

58
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,840
She's even giving me money and a house.

59
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,840
I'm alive.

60
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,640
It's much better than my previous life.

61
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,120
So be it.

62
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,600
How much did you pay for the vegetables?

63
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,200
—Three wen.                         —Really?

64
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,000
—From where?           —The southern market.

65
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,520
I got it at the northern market for five wen!

66
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,640
Northern market...

67
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,880
You moved here a few days ago, didn't you?

68
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,480
We finally met you.

69
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
We were wondering if we should

70
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,880
come to greet you yesterday.

71
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,600
I live on the street ahead.

72
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,000
Come and visit me when you're free.

73
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,680
Well then, we should get going.

74
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,120
She's so pretty.

75
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Yes.

76
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,480
Be careful with open fires

77
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,960
as the weather is dry.

78
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,880
Be careful with open fires

79
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,520
as the weather is dry.

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,680
Master, that man is here again.

81
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,200
I know.

82
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,360
I can go there by myself.

83
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,600
Close the door and go back to sleep.

84
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,680
All right!

85
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,640
The human body is made of flesh

86
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,520
not iron.

87
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,520
You are only a few years older

88
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,320
than my young apprentice.

89
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,120
You're a young man, aren't you?

90
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,120
You have to take better care of yourself.

91
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,040
Quit getting into fights.

92
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,840
Even if you don't mind these scars

93
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,040
aren't you afraid that

94
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,480
they may scare the girl you like?

95
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,920
Do the scars look scary?

96
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,560
Of course.

97
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,880
Imagine this.

98
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,760
A young lady looking at these scars...

99
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
Don't you think she will be taken aback?

100
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,400
She's not just any girl.

101
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,960
Do you have any medicine for scar removal?

102
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,760
What a silly question.

103
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,000
No medicine can remove scars completely.

104
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,920
Well...

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
If you want to get rid of the scars

106
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,120
I suggest you get into less trouble.

107
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,480
Even if you had accidentally offended

108
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,040
some nobles and they're seeking revenge on you

109
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,720
you should go into hiding.

110
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,040
Nothing beats being alive.

111
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,440
How long has your apprentice...

112
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,640
been with you?

113
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,000
Him?

114
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,480
He's the child of a relative of mine.

115
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,240
His family is poor

116
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,080
sp his parents wanted him to learn from me

117
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,960
ever since he was a child.

118
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
He's now 16 years old

119
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,600
and still a careless kid.

120
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,360
16 years old...

121
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,040
A few days ago

122
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,920
he gave a patient the wrong medicine.

123
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
Fortunately, it was not a serious illness.

124
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
I gave him a light punishment.

125
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,800
He was to skip meals for a day.

126
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,400
However, he seemed upset.

127
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,160
And this kid likes to talk back.

128
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,680
By society standards

129
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,640
he should call me Master.

130
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,600
By blood relations, he should call me Uncle.

131
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,680
He only unwillingly calls me Master

132
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,160
when he is scared

133
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,360
or when he gets into trouble.

134
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,160
I was also 16 years old when I met her.

135
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,760
I have bandaged your external injuries

136
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,400
but when I felt your pulses

137
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,200
I noticed they were disorderly.

138
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,080
Although you're young and strong now

139
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
you can't keep getting injuries.

140
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,800
So, I'm going to give you a prescription

141
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,160
to nurse you back to health.

142
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,520
My prescription...

143
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,520
He leaves one ingot of tael every time.

144
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,160
What a prodigal spender.

145
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,600
He left?

146
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Yes, he left.

147
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Old Wu...

148
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,840
You rascal! How many times do I have to tell you?

149
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,520
Call me Master.

150
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,960
Fine...

151
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,120
Master!

152
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,680
Who on earth is this man?

153
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,480
He comes here on the same day every month

154
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,760
covered in injuries.

155
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,240
This has lasted for more than half a year.

156
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,360
How about we report it to the <i>yamen</i>?

157
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,560
Maybe he is some fugitive.

158
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,000
We'd better be safe than sorry.

159
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,720
Don't let your imagination go wild.

160
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,440
Go to bed.

161
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,360
Report it to the <i>yamen</i>?

162
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,040
Who is it?

163
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
I'll leave him with you.

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,160
Whenever he lives or dies

165
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
it depends on you.

166
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,240
Your elder brother who works at Zhong's Garden

167
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,400
as a family physician

168
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
should have mentioned this token to you before.

169
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,040
Remember to keep your mouth shut.

170
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
Otherwise, you and your brother

171
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,080
will both be in trouble.

172
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,400
<i>In Huangcheng</i>

173
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
<i>I'm afraid even the magistrate</i>

174
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,920
<i>wouldn't dare interfere with this.</i>

175
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,280
<i>At most, he's only about 18 or 19 years old.</i>

176
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
<i>But I don't see the innocent look</i>

177
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
<i>a teenager should possess.</i>

178
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,480
<i>What has been taken away from him</i>

179
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,320
<i>that made him so stubborn?</i>

180
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,080
Miss Hua Qian, my mother made some snacks

181
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,440
and told me to bring them to you.

182
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,280
Thank you, Young Master Xu.

183
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,040
But I haven't finished eating the snacks

184
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,200
that you brought last time.

185
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,760
Please thank Mrs Xu for me

186
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,560
and tell her that I can't eat so much.

187
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,920
I don't want her food to go to waste.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,880
It's all right. My mother has a lot of free time.

189
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
She enjoys making snacks

190
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
and giving them away.

191
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,440
She doesn't even let the servants help her.

192
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,040
She likes you

193
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,600
so she asks me to bring them over.

194
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,160
But it's too much trouble for you

195
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
to run back and forth.

196
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,840
Not at all... I enjoy running around.

197
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Here.

198
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,760
Do you live here?

199
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
I just moved here.

200
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,440
Do you live here too?

201
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,240
Great. I was planning to greet the neighbours.

202
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm new here

203
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,360
so I may trouble you in the future.

204
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,240
Please accept these walnuts.

205
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,760
No wonder you don't look familiar to me.

206
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,280
So, you're a new neighbour.

207
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,320
Great. I love walnuts.

208
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,440
I have some snacks in the house.

209
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,160
Come in and see what you like.

210
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,600
What about mine?

211
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,680
Sorry I can't take the snacks.

212
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,080
Please thank Madam Xu for me.

213
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,760
Let's go!

214
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
I...

215
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
What's so funny?

216
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,840
Haven't you seen a handsome man before?

217
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
I've never seen a handsome man like you

218
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,840
who is so eager to go after a girl.

219
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,000
—You...                               —What?

220
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,320
Are you embarrassed because I spoke the truth?

221
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,920
Xu Ming! What did you bring?

222
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,120
Let me see...

223
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,240
Please have a seat.

224
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,880
My name is Hua Qian. How do I address you?

225
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,360
Just call me Yunniang.

226
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,920
Wait a minute.

227
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,400
I don't have anything nice here.

228
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,480
I made these snacks when I was free yesterday.

229
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,640
If you don't mind having them, bring some home.

230
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,920
I think they taste good.

231
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,720
Thank you.

232
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,600
Are these enough? I have more in the kitchen.

233
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,040
—Let me get you some more.      —No, thanks.

234
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,440
I live alone, so this is more than enough.

235
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,400
All right then. I live alone too.

236
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,640
If you need anything, feel free to come to me.

237
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,720
Here, have some water.

238
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,720
Lord, I shall take my leave.

239
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,240
You may leave. Move quickly.

240
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Yes, Steward Gao.

241
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,600
I will hand over my duty to you now.

242
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
Steward Gao, you can count on us.

243
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Master.

244
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
You little rascal.

245
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,120
I see that you were waiting for me.

246
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
You do care about me.

247
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,480
I'll hold the lantern for you.

248
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,520
Master, what day is the fifth day

249
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,040
of every month?

250
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
How many times have I told you?

251
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,280
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

252
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,800
But there are only you and I now.

253
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,200
I know you dote on me

254
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,840
so that gives me the courage to ask.

255
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,080
You just need to know

256
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,040
that you have to stay away from the study

257
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,600
on the fifth day of every month.

258
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,080
If you can't suppress your curiosity

259
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,280
you may get killed.

260
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,640
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

261
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,800
Let's go.

262
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Just leave.

263
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,160
After defeating Chen Yuan

264
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,800
you have almost exhausted all your strength.

265
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,320
I don't want to send you

266
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,480
to the medical hall again.

267
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Come back next month.

268
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,920
You will fight against me.

269
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,200
Save your energy for next time.

270
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Go home and have some rest.

271
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,200
After some rest, go in and report to Lord.

272
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
How did it go?

273
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,280
I lost.

274
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,680
It's all right. Get up.

275
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,440
If you can't beat him, let Lin Jiang try.

276
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,400
If he can't defeat him either

277
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,080
the two of you will then do it together.

278
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,960
I want to see how long he can keep this up.

279
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,760
Lord, the first time he came

280
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,440
I defeated him in less than 20 moves.

281
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,120
It's only been a year and...

282
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,640
and he has reached such a high level.

283
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
This might cause trouble for us someday.

284
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,600
In my opinion

285
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,520
we should dispose of him as soon as possible.

286
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,720
We can't kill him.

287
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,040
Leave.

288
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Yes, Lord.

289
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Yes, Lord.

290
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,920
That kid surprised me.

291
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,080
It's only been a year

292
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,560
and his skills are on par with mine.

293
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,480
No, his skills are above yours.

294
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,280
Besides...

295
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,040
I could tell he held back.

296
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

297
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,680
Don't tell me you didn't notice.

298
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,360
Clearly, he held back

299
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,640
when the two of you were exchanging blows.

300
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,440
He would rather take your punches

301
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,200
than be hurt by your sword.

302
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,880
He won despite being cautious and hesitant.

303
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,520
I should have killed him the first time he came.

304
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,360
He was conscious about

305
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,560
leaving behind sword wounds.

306
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
How annoying.

307
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
You...

308
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,920
Quit with your grumbling and whining.

309
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,040
Put more time into your martial arts training.

310
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,480
I don't see any sword wounds this time

311
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,280
but it seems that you broke a rib bone

312
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,240
and the scapula is somewhat misaligned.

313
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,800
The moon is exceptionally bright tonight.

314
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,920
Today is the fifth day of the month

315
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,920
how can the moon be bright?

316
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,640
Stretch out your arm...

317
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
All right.

318
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,320
This is going to be very painful.

319
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,400
Doesn't it hurt?

320
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,320
I'm getting one step closer.

321
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,040
<i>Are there people who don't feel pain at all?</i>

322
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,560
Aunt Li, look. I can't sew this part well.

323
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,880
Let me see.

324
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,680
This is correct. Continue sewing it this way.

325
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,280
The first step is always hard.

326
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,640
All right. I got it.

327
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,040
I'll teach you something else later.

328
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,360
All right.

329
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,080
The mandarin ducks they embroidered

330
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,240
are very beautiful.

331
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,560
—Aunt Li, are you busy?                —Yes?

332
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,760
I'm making a coat for my husband.

333
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,920
Aunt Li, you've done a nice job on this.

334
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,640
—Pretty, right?             —It's exquisite.

335
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,440
I put a lot of work into it.

336
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,600
I wish I could embroider as well as you.

337
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Take your time.

338
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,240
I see you're doing a pretty good job.

339
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,520
It's just embroidering.

340
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,920
Why are you exerting so much force?

341
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,680
It looks like you're going to prick someone

342
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,800
with a needle.

343
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,000
It's so beautiful.

344
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,280
I spent a long time choosing this.

345
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Here.

346
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,840
Poke it through here.

347
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,720
Why are your hands so callused?

348
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,680
Maybe it's because I have done

349
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
a lot of manual labour.

350
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,560
Aunt Li, I asked for your help

351
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,480
to get the silk thread from outside of town.

352
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,680
—Did you manage to get it?           —Yes...

353
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,240
My husband just came back

354
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,440
from his business trip yesterday.

355
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,640
Come with me to get it later.

356
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
All right.

357
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
What do you mean by that?

358
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,000
Lord said that you had to defeat his guards

359
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,680
before you could enter the study.

360
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
But he never said that

361
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,160
it would be a one-on-one battle.

362
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,040
What's wrong with you this time?

363
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
Come on.

364
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,520
We should be able to take a break next month.

365
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,040
Judging by that kid's injuries

366
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,040
he probably needs a month or so to get better.

367
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,680
Want a bet?

368
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,680
He will definitely come again next month.

369
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,840
Impossible! He's not a monster.

370
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,360
If he isn't a monster

371
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,360
how could he have gone

372
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,920
from an ordinary guard

373
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,000
to a highly skilled swordsman

374
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,800
that I can barely beat in two years?

375
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,240
Our duty is to protect Lord

376
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,640
but for that kid...

377
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,680
He probably has only one purpose in life now.

378
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,680
If you can put your heart and soul

379
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,240
into just one thing

380
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,880
then you become invincible.

381
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,000
Maybe it's because we're getting old.

382
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,440
That's how that kid could surpass us.

383
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,400
Don't you think that kid

384
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,400
should call us "Master"?

385
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,040
Well, we kind of trained him.

386
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,440
The cheek of you to say that.

387
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,560
Is he having a nightmare?

388
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,760
Mistress!

389
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,640
Here.

390
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,680
Drink up.

391
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,040
I thought you had heeded my advice.

392
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,360
But you got injuries all over again.

393
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,800
And they are more serious than before.

394
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,720
I was too eager to defeat them.

395
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
That's how I lost.

396
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
You...

397
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,680
Didn't I just say

398
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,160
that you were more seriously injured this time?

399
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,400
Where do you think you're going?

400
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,600
Martial arts training.

401
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,720
Training...

402
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,320
Training takes time.

403
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,160
There's no hurry to do it right away.

404
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,480
I can't wait even a day.

405
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,760
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

406
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,160
Your Highness, it's time for lunch.

407
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,280
How long has it been

408
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,080
since the last time Lord came to see me?

409
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,320
The last time was during the Lantern Festival.

410
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,400
It's been about half a year.

411
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,240
Your Highness, do you want to withdraw

412
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,640
the guards at Hua Residence?

413
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,360
Not now.

414
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,680
<i>Name List</i>

415
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,640
These few butlers' daughters...

416
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,440
I feel that they are smart and likeable.

417
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,720
Go invite them

418
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,520
to come and stay at Zhong's Garden

419
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,880
to chat with me if they can.

420
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,520
All right. I got it.

421
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,560
Hua Rongzhou.

422
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
How did you get hurt?

423
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,960
I almost didn't recognise you.

424
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,880
Fortunately, my mouth reacted faster

425
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,000
than my head and I called out your name.

426
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,520
Why...

427
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,640
are you here?

428
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,520
Miss gave me...

429
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,080
my indenture and this shop.

430
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,200
Miss insisted on not taking me with her

431
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,320
to attend that banquet in Zhong's Garden.

432
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,080
When the constables barged into Hua Residence

433
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,560
it then dawned on me that

434
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,680
I had nothing to do with

435
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,280
the Hua family's crime

436
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,520
since I was a free civilian.

437
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,760
How about chatting in the shop?

438
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
There are too many people here.

439
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,400
No, thanks.

440
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,240
I have something to do, so I'm leaving.

441
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
Hua Rongzhou.

442
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Cuizhu got married two months ago.

443
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,320
The marriage was arranged by her family.

444
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,720
Her husband is an honest farmer

445
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,720
and is kind to her.

446
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,160
Miss kicked her out of Hua Residence

447
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,800
so she escaped being implicated.

448
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,960
We were close after living together

449
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,080
for so many years

450
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,840
so we still keep in touch occasionally.

451
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Hua Rongzhou, just let bygones be bygones.

452
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,120
You have to move on.

453
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,240
Miss thought highly of you.

454
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,960
Now that you're so adept at martial arts

455
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,720
you shouldn't let it go to waste.

456
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,840
Do you know why I learned martial arts?

457
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,680
You told me to move on.

458
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
And what about you?

459
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,360
Can you do that?

460
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,200
Miss is the strongest person in the world.

461
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,240
I even saw her talk back to Lord face-to-face

462
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
so I don't believe that

463
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,080
she would set herself on fire.

464
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,400
But even though I tried

465
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,080
to convince myself otherwise

466
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,520
I couldn't deny the fact that

467
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,920
she didn't expect to return home alive that day.

468
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,120
That's why she arranged a retreat plan

469
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
for all of us.

470
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,840
Since you believe that she's...

471
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,040
Why do you bother to keep the shop going?

472
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,280
And why do you pretend

473
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,560
not to see the man who's staring at me

474
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,080
at the corner of the street?

475
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,600
Looks like you know he is there

476
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,160
that's why you're not turning your head.

477
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,840
I just want to keep her shop going

478
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
in case...

479
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,040
in case she does come home one day

480
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,480
and sees that no one is waiting for her.

481
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,440
She might think everyone has forgotten her.

482
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,040
That will break her heart.

483
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Didn't you say that she expected herself

484
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,880
not to return home alive?

485
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,840
So, who are you waiting for now?

486
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,680
She already said that

487
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,560
she wanted you to have this shop.

488
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,080
If you don't want her to be upset

489
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,600
do as she said.

490
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,680
Make the most out of your life.

491
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,000
She doesn't need anyone to wait for her.

492
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,720
I will find her.

493
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,240
Can you find her?

494
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,760
Qianzhi...

495
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,240
You must not mistreat me.

496
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,000
Never.

497
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,320
If you mistreat me

498
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,080
someone will come back and protect me.

499
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,960
Miss Meng...

500
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,480
Lord is busy. He has no time to see you.

501
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,800
Miss Meng...

502
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,920
Miss Meng...

503
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
How dare you!

504
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,480
This is no place to be raising a racket.

505
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,960
Lord, are you going to have my sister

506
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,440
move into Zhong's Garden?

507
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,080
Are you questioning me?

508
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,280
So it is true?

509
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,840
—Miss Meng...                         —Lord!

510
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Only one woman from the Meng family

511
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
will suffice!

512
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,840
You're asking the wrong person.

513
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,400
I believe it was Butler Meng who decided this.

514
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,280
Lord, are you still angry with me?

515
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,400
About Hua Qian, it was...

516
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,840
Do something! Meng Yifei forgot her manners.

517
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,000
And you too?

518
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,960
—Lord...               —Miss Meng, let's go.

519
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,600
—Are you so ruthless?            —Miss Meng.

520
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
—Let's go.                            —Lord!

521
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,360
—Come on.         —Hua Qian deserved to die!

522
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,040
What did you just say?

523
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,320
Miss, let's go back.

524
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,640
Lord, do you remember the soup

525
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
that I made for you?

526
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
It's cold today

527
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,600
so Miss made some soup for Lord.

528
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,240
It's turned cold. Take it away.

529
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,960
Lord, did you try the soup

530
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,240
that I sent the night before yesterday?

531
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,800
Song An brought it to me.

532
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,200
—It tasted good.     —I'm glad to hear that.

533
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,200
I was wondering if I had added too much sugar

534
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,920
and you might think it was too sweet.

535
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,800
It was a tad sweet, but I could still drink it.

536
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,320
It was a savoury soup.

537
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,120
Is that when you started to want to harm her?

538
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,040
Harm her?

539
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,440
Yes. I wanted to harm her.

540
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,600
I wanted to harm her.

541
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,360
Lord, if you had treated everyone equally

542
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,920
I could live with it.

543
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But why did you only have eyes for her?

544
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,040
Lord, don't you see me?

545
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,080
Don't you see my love for you, Lord?

546
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,720
Why her? Did she deserve you?

547
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,480
Did she deserve you, Lord?

548
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,520
Why her? Lord!

549
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,880
Did she deserve you?

550
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Meng Yifei.

551
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,720
You are of a marriageable age.

552
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,080
Staying in Zhong's Garden

553
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,480
will get in the way of your marriage.

554
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,120
Pack your luggage tomorrow

555
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
and return home.

556
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,480
As for the deeds you've done

557
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,160
I'll leave it to Butler Meng to punish you.

558
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,560
Fine.

559
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,560
Fine!

560
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Miss...

561
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Miss...

562
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,840
<i>Zhong's Garden</i>

563
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,520
Miss Meng, we have arrived.

564
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,600
Let's go over there. It's less crowded.

565
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
Let's go.

566
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,160
Hold it steady. Be careful.

567
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,320
Rest assured.

568
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,840
—Don't forget to make a wish.    —Let it go.

569
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,680
Well done.

570
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,680
—All right.                   —Look at this.

571
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,960
Yunniang, why are you not making a lantern?

572
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,240
I don't have a wish I want to fulfil.

573
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,400
I'm sure you have one at least.

574
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,840
Perhaps it's because I wanted too much before

575
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,840
but I ended up with nothing.

576
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,040
So, I'd rather not have anything now.

577
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,360
Yunniang, you've moved here for nearly a year

578
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,880
and it seems that you have never mentioned

579
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
anything about your past.

580
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,720
Nothing about my past is worth mentioning.

581
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,840
Let's go. I'll make you a new one.

582
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,480
—Let's see.            —I want that lantern.

583
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,960
I suppose you know martial arts.

584
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,160
I don't think the calluses on your hands

585
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
are caused by manual labour.

586
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,080
Fine.

587
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,040
It happened a long time ago

588
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
so I don't mind telling you.

589
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,920
What?

590
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,760
I was married before

591
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,240
but I wasn't happy.

592
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,600
<i>Bonus footage</i>

593
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Master.

594
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,080
The embroidery workshop sent this just now.

595
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,720
They said that it took them two and a half years

596
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,480
and used countless brocade silks and satins.

597
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,600
Take it away... quick!

598
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
—What's wrong, Master?        —Take it away!

599
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,840
What's going on?

600
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,040
I'm sorry to disturb you, Lord.

601
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,320
What is this?

602
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,360
The embroidery workshop sent this.

603
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,000
They said the dress was ready.

604
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,400
You imbecile!

605
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,000
<i>Isn't this the dress</i>

606
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,200
<i>for the matriarch of Zhong's Garden?</i>

607
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,280
If she were to put it on

608
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
she would look amazing.

609
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,920
Burn it.

610
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,520
Master, why does he want

611
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,160
the pretty dress burnt?

612
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,520
I heard from the embroidery workshop

613
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,400
that this dress cost thousands of taels to make.

614
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,480
Just burn it.

615
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,200
Why do you have so many questions?

616
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,680
Gao Yu, come with me.

617
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,280
Lord, where are you going?

618
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,320
Do you want me to get the guards?

619
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,440
No need.

620
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,520
I'm going to Star Reaching Tower.

621
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,480
I want to have some Yuelu wine.
