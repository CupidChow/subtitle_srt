00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
<i>Episode 29</i>

2
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Fine.

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,040
It happened a long time ago

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,840
so I don't mind telling you.

5
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
What?

6
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,680
I was married before

7
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,240
but I was unhappy.

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
Slow down.

9
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,720
Isn't this Mistress?

10
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
Why are you doing the laundry yourself?

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,560
My dear.

12
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,720
Sis Qin is your legal wife after all.

13
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,320
It's not nice if she's seen doing the laundry.

14
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
You are so considerate, Xia.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,480
So what if she's seen?

16
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,640
She's like a hen that can't lay eggs.

17
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
Even her maiden family is ashamed of her.

18
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,280
I'm being kind by keeping her here

19
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,280
and providing for her.

20
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,480
Let's go. Take it easy.

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
Take good care of our unborn child.

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,560
Sis Qin, since you enjoy doing the laundry

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,400
why don't you wash my clothes as well?

24
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,520
After all, I am pregnant

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,440
and can't cope without maids by my side

26
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,800
so I have to trouble you.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,480
I'm so forgetful.

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,320
Xiaojuan, bring your clothes here too.

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,320
Since you have to look after me

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,320
you probably don't have time to do the laundry.

31
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Yes, Concubine Xia.

32
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,600
Don't go too far!

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,560
Look at you.

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,280
I have to be careful

35
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,640
since I'm carrying my husband's child.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,160
If you refuse, I'll go tell my husband.

37
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
My dear...

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Xia is pregnant.

39
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,520
How can you make her angry?

40
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,040
If something happens to her

41
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,880
can you give me a child to make up for it?

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,600
When did I make her angry?

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,720
Don't try and deny it.

44
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,800
Her maid told me all about it.

45
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,880
All she did was asked you to do the laundry

46
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,640
and you yelled at her.

47
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,920
I can kick you out any time. You got that?

48
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,920
I am your legal wife.

49
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,640
How can you do this to me?

50
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,840
You can't bear children for me

51
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
so you have fulfilled

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
one of the seven grounds for divorce.

53
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,000
I can divorce you any time if I want.

54
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,200
If you dare make things difficult for Xia again

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,760
just wait to be kicked out!

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
After my first miscarriage

57
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,200
my body became weak

58
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,520
and I couldn't get pregnant.

59
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,400
After that, my husband kicked me out

60
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,080
and my maiden family refused to take me in

61
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,360
so I had to earn my keep.

62
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,040
During the last few years

63
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,720
before I left my husband's house

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,360
I did the laundry day and night.

65
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,480
The four seasons came and went.

66
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,880
My hands suffered from frostbite.

67
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,760
The blisters healed and formed repeatedly.

68
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,440
That was how the calluses came about.

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
I'm so sorry.

70
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,360
I blame my old habit of being paranoid.

71
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,520
I probed and caused you to recall your past.

72
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
It's all right.

73
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,080
Now, I'm happy to live on a day-to-day basis

74
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,480
and let bygones be bygones.

75
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,760
You lead a more carefree life than me.

76
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Hua Qian!

77
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Hua Qian!

78
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
You forgot to make a lantern, didn't you?

79
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
You can have mine.

80
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,600
I feel that this doesn't work

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,160
so this lantern is wasted on me.

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,520
Why do you feel that it won't work?

83
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,040
Yunniang, excuse me.

84
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,920
My mother told me to give it to you.

85
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm sorry. Please thank her...

86
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
You're so gullible.

87
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,880
An old lady like my mother

88
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
won't make such a thing.

89
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,640
Everyone faces difficult times at some point.

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
Besides, I don't need the money.

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,200
I'll treat it as earning good karma points.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,200
You're so gullible.

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,280
It's for you. Take it.

94
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,320
Xu Ming.

95
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,000
We're all busy making lanterns.

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,760
Are you sitting here and slacking off?

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,160
What? I'm not slacking off!

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
Keep your voice down.

99
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
The whole street can hear you.

100
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,760
What's wrong with me talking loudly?

101
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,000
Unless you have done something shameful.

102
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,400
Look at you. You don't behave like a girl!

103
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,960
I don't behave like a girl, but you do.

104
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,080
You!

105
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,520
Wait for me!

106
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,880
What's wrong? Does your chest hurt?

107
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,960
It may be the sequelae of an old injury.

108
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,040
I'll take you to see a physician.

109
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,680
It's all right. I'll be fine in a while.

110
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,840
Well, the incense candle in the lantern

111
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,680
smells familiar.

112
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,880
It seems to provide me

113
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,120
with some pain relief.

114
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
The incense candle won't help.

115
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
You should go see a physician.

116
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
I suddenly feel like placing the lantern

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
on the river.

118
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Let's go.

119
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,120
I underestimated you.

120
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,720
You endured a total of 26 times.

121
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,000
Where did you hide her?

122
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,040
I told you.

123
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
She's already dead.

124
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,520
I don't believe you.

125
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,000
You said that if I could defeat your guards

126
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,000
you'd tell me about her.

127
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,680
Am I not telling you about her right now?

128
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,400
If she is alive

129
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,200
do you think I will let her leave me?

130
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,640
Miss, remember to look for me soon

131
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
or I will come back for you.

132
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
All right.

133
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,120
Where are you going?

134
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,520
I'll go find her.

135
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,920
Don't you want to kill me?

136
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,360
She won't be happy

137
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
if I kill you.

138
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,520
You have been looking for her

139
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,880
for about more than two years

140
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,600
but to no avail.

141
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,200
Where else can you go and look for her?

142
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,080
I'll go to the end of the world if I have to.

143
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,320
I can find her even if you won't tell me.

144
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,760
Anyway, I have plenty of time.

145
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
What if she really died?

146
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,960
I had nothing, to begin with

147
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,360
so I have nothing to lose.

148
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,960
I envy you.

149
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,600
She's in Ju'an town in the south.

150
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
Lord.

151
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

152
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,960
It's not your fault.

153
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Get up.

154
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Yes, Lord.

155
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,640
Lord, just say the word

156
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,760
and Qin Yun can bring her back any time.

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,400
What for?

158
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,240
To die again?

159
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,280
I failed to protect her then

160
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,840
and it will be the same going forward.

161
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,920
My mother made sure I get her point.

162
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,920
But...

163
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,720
she is waiting.

164
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,640
Deliver a message.

165
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,640
Tell Qin Yun to come back.

166
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,560
She doesn't have to send me letters

167
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
reporting about her every five days

168
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,640
because...

169
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,320
someone else will take good care of her.

170
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,640
He's also the one she's waiting for.

171
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Noted, Lord.

172
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,640
<i>From: Qin Yun</i>

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,960
<i>No one knows where I am</i>

174
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,320
<i>I lean on the pine trees wallowing in sorrow</i>

175
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,600
<i>Amitabha Scripture</i>

176
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,560
She's a thoughtful girl.

177
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,000
You can see a thing or two about her character

178
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,560
through the scripture she reproduced.

179
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,240
Mother, who are you talking about?

180
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,800
Butler Li's only daughter, Li Wanyi.

181
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,640
She moved into Zhong's Garden a few days ago.

182
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,440
I met her a few times.

183
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,480
She's quick-witted and likeable.

184
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,160
Li Ji's only daughter?

185
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,320
Mother, you rarely praise someone

186
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,720
whom you just met a few times.

187
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,320
Butler Li only got his daughter at the age of 50.

188
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,040
Why is he willing to send his only daughter

189
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,640
to Zhong's Garden?

190
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,480
I can rarely find a sincere person

191
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,080
in Zhong's Garden

192
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,160
whom I can share a conversation with.

193
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,640
So, Lord, don't be too harsh.

194
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,000
After a long delay

195
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,760
Butler Hua has finally been convicted.

196
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,320
I want to see him off in a few days.

197
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,120
I'll leave it to you to decide

198
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,600
who to be the matriarch of the Zhong family.

199
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,720
I don't feel well

200
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
so I want to take a break

201
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
for a few days next month.

202
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,400
Do you mean

203
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,280
I get to decide on your behalf

204
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,960
who to be the matriarch of the Zhong family?

205
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Yes, Mother.

206
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,320
I'll leave it to you. Are you fine with it?

207
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Good.

208
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,640
In that case, I'll do as you wish.

209
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,560
Thank you, Mother.

210
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,280
What kind of a mother am I?

211
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,400
I held the Hua family hostage

212
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,400
to force my son to compromise.

213
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,560
You did it for Lord's own good, Your Highness.

214
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,720
It's not easy for you too.

215
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Nobody has it easy in Zhong's Garden.

216
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Mistress.

217
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,360
These aroma beads

218
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,520
are made from an entire piece of incense.

219
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
They were even blessed by a noble monk.

220
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,320
Do you like it, Mistress?

221
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,720
It's a thoughtful gift.

222
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,160
Actually, I have been wanting a divorce

223
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,800
ever since I got injured by the arrow.

224
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,840
And I let Master take a concubine

225
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,640
because I don't want to stay married to him.

226
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,520
And now, I can't stand it anymore.

227
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,200
Your Highness, I'm really sorry

228
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,960
for not appreciating your kindness.

229
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,680
I only hope that

230
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
you can spare the lives of the Hua family

231
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,000
and I will be eternally grateful.

232
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,920
You're a filial daughter.

233
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll spare Butler Hua's life.

234
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,240
I'm not a filial daughter.

235
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,720
Withdraw the guards from Hua Residence.

236
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Yes, Your Highness.

237
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,320
She is luckier than me.

238
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,080
I'm tired.

239
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,200
It's time to rest.

240
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,040
Take it.

241
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,920
—Thank you, Physician.           —Take care.

242
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,400
You'er, it's the fifth day of the month today.

243
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,680
Let's close shop earlier.

244
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,560
Go and lock the door.

245
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,440
Old Wu, he's not coming.

246
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,000
Why are you still waiting for him?

247
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,320
Good.

248
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,880
It's good that he didn't come.

249
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,080
This proves that the kid

250
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,080
who isn't afraid of pain

251
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,240
finally got what he wanted.

252
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,800
I doubt it.

253
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,600
Maybe he didn't come because he was dead.

254
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,640
Take this! You little rascal!

255
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Yunniang.

256
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Yunniang.

257
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,160
Hua Qian!

258
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,000
Xu Ming hurt his leg while riding a horse.

259
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,240
Come with me to see him.

260
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,200
Have you seen Yunniang lately?

261
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,960
I don't know. Maybe she has moved out.

262
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Moved out?

263
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,480
No way. She didn't even tell me.

264
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
The two of you are not related.

265
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,360
She's not obliged to tell you.

266
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,800
—Come with me now.       —You go ahead. I...

267
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,960
What?

268
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
You're the person he wants to see now.

269
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Come on!

270
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,040
They obviously like each other

271
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,880
but she insisted on dragging me along.

272
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,680
<i>It's late.</i>

273
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,680
<i>Who is following me discreetly?</i>

274
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,800
<i>Everyone in this small town knows each other.</i>

275
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,320
<i>None of them will follow me</i>

276
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,680
<i>discreetly like that.</i>

277
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,480
<i>He must be an outsider.</i>

278
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,920
<i>He must have ill intentions</i>

279
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,400
<i>following me sneakily like that.</i>

280
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,360
I finally found you.

281
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,880
—Leader.                           —Go home.

282
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,240
Yes, Leader.

283
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,200
It's a small task.

284
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,640
Why did you send her?

285
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,240
Why not?

286
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,560
She set fire to her husband's house

287
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,840
and killed a dozen of people in it.

288
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,320
She's a ruthless person.

289
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,440
Don't you think it's unsafe for you to guard...

290
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,040
her?

291
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,520
I recruited her.

292
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,800
I know what kind of a person she is.

293
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,960
Those of us who work in the shadows

294
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,520
usually have some sort of questionable past.

295
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,840
Besides

296
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,520
Qin Yun's ex-husband deserved to die.

297
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
He drugged his legal wife with aborticide

298
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,880
just to marry a concubine.

299
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,800
He was a lowly rat.

300
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Lord is here.

301
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,640
Greetings, Lord.

302
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Get up.

303
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,520
Leave us.

304
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,400
Huang, go on.

305
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,840
I deserve to die

306
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,040
because I have committed a crime.

307
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,840
Lord, you don't have to come to see me off.

308
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,760
When did you realise Hua Qian was

309
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,960
investigating you behind your back?

310
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,320
She is my daughter.

311
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,480
Of course, I knew what she was doing.

312
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,640
Why didn't you stop her?

313
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,320
Because she's my only child now.

314
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,640
Is that why you didn't blame her

315
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,960
and even took sole responsibility?

316
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,080
Lord, I don't understand what you're saying.

317
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,560
I committed the crime.

318
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,640
I worked hard all my life

319
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,240
but I ended up with nothing.

320
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,720
I disappointed my lord

321
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,000
as well as my family.

322
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,840
If I had known, I would have listened to Qian.

323
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,680
I should have resigned

324
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,160
and returned to my hometown.

325
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
That would be nice.

326
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,480
She said that?

327
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,440
You may fail your duty as a butler

328
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,120
but you're a good father.

329
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,040
I forced her to leave.

330
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,200
She has such a wonderful father.

331
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,960
No wonder...

332
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
She is doing well.

333
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,440
Take care of yourself.

334
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,040
The two of you will see each again someday.

335
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,880
<i>Hanbi Sanctuary</i>

336
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,880
I'm back.

337
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,120
You're covered in dirt.

338
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,920
Are you teaching the children martial arts

339
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,040
or getting bullied by them?

340
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,840
Well, I can't fight back.

341
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,880
Quickly change out of these clothes.

342
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,240
Hua Qian, where is my master?

343
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
In his room.

344
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,480
Hua Qian, is Xu Ming here?

345
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,080
I've finished reading this book.

346
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,240
Do you have anything new?

347
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,000
I knew it. Here.

348
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,520
He's in Hua Rongzhou's room.

349
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,360
Well, well, well.

350
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Xu Ming!

351
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,920
Done!

352
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,040
What happened to them this time?

353
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,720
What did Xu Ming want with you?

354
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,920
He wanted to learn the lightness technique

355
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,440
so that he could escape from Bai Luo.

356
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,720
They are not kids anymore

357
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
yet they are behaving like kids.

358
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,360
Especially Xu Ming.

359
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,720
If he doesn't want to see Bai Luo

360
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,480
there are a thousand ways to do it.

361
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,920
Yet he went along with her.

362
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
Qian.

363
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,880
Is my daughter Bai Luo here?

364
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,800
Why is my place so lively today?

365
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,720
Xu Ming, get this.

366
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
You're a grown man!

367
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
It's improper to come here so frequently.

368
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
—I...                               —Mother?

369
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,400
What are you doing here?

370
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,680
We have a guest.

371
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,960
I came to look for you.

372
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
What guest?

373
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,720
She's the daughter of your grandmother's sister.

374
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,400
That makes her your aunt.

375
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,240
I have not heard of her. A distant relative.

376
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
I don't think I need to see her.

377
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,280
Listen, Xu Ming! Listen to me...

378
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,560
Listen, your aunt used to live in Huangcheng.

379
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,200
The master she was serving got into trouble.

380
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,800
And her master passed away a few days ago.

381
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,000
So, the servants could all return home.

382
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,760
Mother, which master did she serve?

383
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,600
She never visited us when she was rich.

384
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Silly girl.

385
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,640
Look

386
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,640
being rich isn't necessarily a good thing.

387
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
You know something?

388
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,640
Your aunt used to work for Hua Residence

389
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
in Huangcheng.

390
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,440
Butler Hua and his wife...

391
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,800
—lost both their children.         —Xu Ming!

392
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,920
Did you hear me?

393
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,160
I'm not done yet.

394
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,720
Master, that tigress left.

395
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,080
I will come to see you another day.

396
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,040
Look what I did.

397
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,240
This is Bai Luo's treasure.

398
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,000
I must glue it back for her.

399
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,080
If she finds out, she'll make a fuss.

400
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,800
—You'll cook today.      —I'll glue it back.

401
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,440
If you want to go back

402
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,920
I have ways to avoid the guards

403
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,560
and take you there safe and sound.

404
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,120
I have never had a chance to ask him.

405
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,840
I wonder how my father felt

406
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,120
as he watched me quietly

407
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,720
collect evidence behind his back

408
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,880
to try and bring him down?

409
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,560
He won't blame you.

410
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,120
I would rather he did.

411
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,360
I'll light the lanterns.

412
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,520
Don't.

413
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,320
I used to think...

414
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,800
I had an incorrigible brother

415
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,280
a mother who favoured her son over her daughter

416
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,280
and a father who cared only

417
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,480
about money and power.

418
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,360
So, I wanted to get married as soon as I could

419
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,400
and stay away from that family.

420
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,600
Only now do I realise that...

421
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,640
the place I so much wanted to escape from

422
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,640
was the warmest place I could ever have.

423
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,960
The old me

424
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,040
didn't appreciate the happy life I had.

425
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Lin Jiang.

426
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Yes, Lord.

427
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,560
Have they reached outside of town?

428
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,120
They will probably reach

429
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,320
outside of town tomorrow

430
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,680
and Chen Yuan will be able to return after that.

431
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,920
Has the news of Butler Hua's execution got out?

432
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Yes, it has.

433
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,240
We shall set off

434
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,360
once Chen Yuan returns.

435
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,400
How nice.

436
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,800
Those men know nothing.

437
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,320
A while ago, I could get cheap vegetables

438
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,720
in the east market.

439
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,200
—Really?               —And they were fresh.

440
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,720
Come. Get up.

441
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Try some.

442
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
I'll wait for you.

443
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,840
Where did these raspberries come from?

444
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,040
They look pretty fresh.

445
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,760
On the mountain in the east where I hunt.

446
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,160
I noticed flowers blooming

447
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,720
on a raspberry tree branch some time back.

448
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,280
So, I waited for it to bear fruit.

449
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,360
I was wondering why you vanished after lunch.

450
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,920
So, you went to pick raspberries.

451
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,040
I'm glad they can make you happy.

452
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,280
Do I look unhappy to you?

453
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,120
Do you need my help?

454
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,600
All right. Let's go.

455
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,320
I must say you're a quick learner.

456
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,880
Look at you.

457
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,200
You seem pretty good at doing the laundry.

458
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm done with the laundry.

459
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,680
I'll bring them back and hang them to dry.

460
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,320
Remember...

461
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
to come home.

462
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,480
Why are you here, Lord?

463
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,280
Did you hear about

464
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,440
the news of Butler Hua's execution?

465
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
I did.

466
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,000
The truth is, he is alive.

467
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,040
What are you looking at? Go! Now!

468
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,080
The Zhong family's typical way of doing things.

469
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,760
You are completely free now.

470
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
Thank you.

471
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,840
You didn't ask any questions.

472
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,320
Do you not doubt me?

473
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
No, I don't.

474
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,960
What were you doing on the roof?

475
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
To look far.

476
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,400
Hang up the clothes. Quickly.

477
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
All right.

478
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,080
I'm sorry.

479
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,920
I used to always criticise people

480
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,160
of making this mistake.

481
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,200
But in the end, I did the same thing.

482
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,160
I thought I was doing it for your own good

483
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,320
and got Wu Shuomo to watch you.

484
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,560
I never blame you.

485
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,160
I think he hasn't gone far.

486
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,160
This is a thank-you gift.

487
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,800
Please bring it to him.

488
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,600
Come back as soon as you can.

489
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,920
I will.

490
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,160
<i>Bonus footage</i>

491
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,080
Lord, Hua Rongzhou is here.

492
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
This is for you.

493
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,280
She said it's a thank-you gift.

494
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,160
—Lord...                    —It's all right.

495
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,480
Let go.

496
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,040
It's my birthday today.

497
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,000
"I cooked soup for the man I love.

498
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,480
I look forward to him tasting it."

499
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,160
I've waited so long

500
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,040
for the longevity noodles for my birthday

501
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,760
but now it looks like...

502
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,320
I'm not meant to taste it.

503
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,160
That bowl of noodles must be delicious.

504
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,280
Otherwise, why would Lord start tearing

505
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,800
without even tasting it?

506
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,240
You talk too much.
