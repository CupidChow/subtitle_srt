00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,720
<i>Episode 16</i>

2
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,240
Master, Concubine Mu is here.

3
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,320
Come in.

4
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,480
Why did you come here suddenly?

5
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,720
Master

6
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,200
what are you going to do about Hua Shen?

7
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,640
What do you want?

8
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Let him go.

9
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,000
What happened on the day of the wedding...

10
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,200
has nothing to do with him.

11
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,880
Okay.

12
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,400
Concubine Mu, what did Master say?

13
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,960
Will he punish the son of the Hua family?

14
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,680
Don't tell me Master is going to

15
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,800
let the son of the Hua family go unpunished?

16
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,880
How can this happen?

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,000
That man has offended you!

18
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,480
Don't you also know what happened that day?

19
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,560
Have you convinced yourself

20
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,000
that it happened when it didn't?

21
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
This money is enough for you

22
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,200
to enjoy the rest of your life.

23
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,480
Remember, you only need to lure him

24
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,720
to the compound I told you about.

25
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Rest assured.

26
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,560
Remember, do not show your face

27
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,320
in Huangcheng again

28
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,840
and be careful not to be seen

29
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
by outsiders in this house

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
otherwise you may lose both the money

31
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
and your reputation.

32
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,680
Don't worry, Miss. I was planning to

33
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,120
go back to my hometown anyway

34
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,400
so I'll never show up in Huangcheng again.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,960
It took great effort to lure him into the trap.

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,520
Are you going to give up now?

37
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,760
Yes, I am.

38
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,440
Isn't that a waste of time?

39
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,160
Don't you want the son of the Hua family

40
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
to be punished?

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,240
Why do I feel

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,320
that you hate the son of the Hua family

43
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,720
more than I do?

44
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,920
That man is notorious for his wayward ways.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
He has done a lot of evil deeds

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,720
but Butler Hua has been shielding him

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,200
from getting punished

48
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
not to mention that

49
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,880
he has dirty thoughts about you.

50
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,920
Of course, I hate him very much.

51
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,880
Master is displaying favouritism.

52
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
He's always protecting Mistress.

53
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,720
Even when her relatives committed crimes

54
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,080
he hesitates to get them punished.

55
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,080
He doesn't care if you have suffered grievances.

56
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,080
What goes around comes around.

57
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,480
And it's not totally a waste of time.

58
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,960
Really, Concubine Mu?

59
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,480
How have you benefited from it?

60
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,240
At least I discovered

61
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,560
that I have a loyal person by my side.

62
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
If it goes according to the previous life timeline

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,520
it's about time

64
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,560
the adopted daughter of the broker

65
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,160
who escaped showed up.

66
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,480
Miss, spare my life!

67
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,120
Miss, spare my life!

68
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,480
Miss, spare my life!

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,640
Spare my life!

70
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,920
Broker Qian

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
do you think no one will recognise you

72
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,600
by changing your name to Su Ying?

73
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,520
If you were really hard-hearted

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,000
I wouldn't be able to find you.

75
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,040
Despite doing all kinds of evil deeds

76
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,480
you still dreamed about enjoying family joy.

77
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,760
That's too greedy of you.

78
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,680
Miss, you are...

79
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,240
I am the daughter of Mu Yunping

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,120
who was falsely accused of embezzlement

81
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,720
a year ago.

82
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,840
It seems that you remember that.

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,800
I am now seeking revenge on you.

84
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,720
Do you think you're being wronged?

85
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,360
No hatred without cause.

86
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,880
If you want my life

87
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
then just take it.

88
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
But I plead with you

89
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,400
to spare the lives of my daughter and grandson.

90
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,880
They are innocent.

91
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,840
How dare you to say the word "innocent"?

92
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,440
Please, Miss, spare their lives!

93
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,080
Just let them go.

94
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,840
I can let your families go

95
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,000
but I want you to go back to Huangcheng

96
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
and testify that

97
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,240
Butler Hua has framed his compeer

98
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,080
and forced him to his death.

99
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,400
What, are you so loyal to Butler Hua?

100
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,680
No, I am not.

101
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,200
It's just that Butler Hua has great power now.

102
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,560
If I testify against him

103
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm afraid my daughter may...

104
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
If Butler Hua can be convicted

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,040
you don't need to worry about

106
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,480
your family's safety, do you?

107
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,840
Fine.

108
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,200
On one condition. I want you

109
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,920
to send my daughter

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,640
and her newborn baby away first.

111
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,440
Do you know where Huiyang County is?

112
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,720
This county is thousands of miles

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
away from Huangcheng.

114
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,120
Mistress, why did you suddenly ask about this?

115
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,360
Fortunately, this part didn't change.

116
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
What?

117
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,240
Hua Rongzhou, come in.

118
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Mistress.

119
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,600
Come in with me.

120
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,880
Let's go.

121
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,840
Time is running out.

122
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
I need you to find someone

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,800
in the town of the border city.

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,680
Where? Who?

125
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,440
That small town is called Huiyang County.

126
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,560
As for the person I wish to find...

127
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,200
I need you to go and find out

128
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,640
if there is a pregnant woman

129
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,120
who just moved there and lives alone.

130
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,160
What's that woman's name?

131
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,080
I don't remember.

132
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,400
In the previous life

133
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,400
Mu Yao found out about the broker's

134
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,040
adopted daughter who had moved several times

135
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,600
one year after her father's death

136
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,760
with the help of Zhong Yelan.

137
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,960
They lay in wait and found Broker Qian.

138
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,720
It has been more than half a year

139
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,440
since her father was exiled

140
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,960
and it should be around this time

141
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Broker Qian's adopted daughter

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,120
moved to Huiyang County

143
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,600
and Mu Yao probably hasn't found her yet.

144
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,520
I'll give you a rough description.

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,680
She is a woman who is not rich.

146
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,080
She might have just moved to Huiyang County

147
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,240
for a month or two.

148
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,480
She lives alone.

149
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
Her husband might have recently passed away.

150
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
She has no family by her side.

151
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,960
And I can't recall

152
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,280
how long she has been pregnant either

153
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,320
but I'm sure she hasn't given birth yet.

154
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,080
And she has an adoptive mother named Su Ying

155
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,320
which is a pseudonym.

156
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,480
But her adoptive mother could be in hiding.

157
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,760
The person I'm looking for is actually

158
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,040
her adoptive mother.

159
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,240
Is it too difficult for you?

160
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,560
This is all the information I know

161
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
which I had gathered from Mu Yao's statement

162
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,320
in the court in the past.

163
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,240
Zhong Yelan was the one who found her

164
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,320
but I can't ask him for help now.

165
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,680
Mistress.

166
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
I will find this woman.

167
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Really?

168
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,920
You have provided enough information.

169
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,680
If you find her

170
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I'll give you whatever you want in the future!

171
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,800
If I find her

172
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,000
do you want me to bring her back?

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,920
Don't bring her back

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
lest others see her.

175
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,320
If you find her

176
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,880
keep Su Ying safe in someplace.

177
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,920
If she won't admit her wrongdoing, then...

178
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,080
threaten her with the child

179
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,200
in her adopted daughter's womb.

180
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,960
Understood. I'll set off now.

181
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,200
It's just an empty threat.

182
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,920
Don't ever hurt her adopted daughter

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,680
and the child in her womb.

184
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,960
Remember not to frighten her too much.

185
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,480
If she suffers from a fright

186
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,040
it may affect her baby.

187
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Understood.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,360
Do you know what you just said?

189
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,760
Your Highness

190
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,960
please allow me to divorce Master.

191
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,400
If Yelan did something wrong

192
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,520
you can tell me directly.

193
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,720
There's no need to divorce him.

194
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,720
I didn't come here on a whim.

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,440
Master and I are not meant to be

196
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,160
so we should go our separate ways.

197
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
Nonsense!

198
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,560
You're already married.

199
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,240
Destiny doesn't apply to you.

200
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,880
Is it because of that concubine?

201
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,280
It has nothing to do with her.

202
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,600
It's my own idea.

203
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,040
When you took the initiative

204
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,800
to give Yelan a concubine

205
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,480
I thought you had wanted a reconciliation.

206
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,600
How did it get to this?

207
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Actually...

208
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,800
Actually, I have long been wanting a divorce

209
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,480
since I took the arrow for Master.

210
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
Giving Master a concubine

211
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,320
wasn't what I really want.

212
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,680
I've now reached a point

213
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,120
where I don't want to live with it anymore.

214
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,360
You are young.

215
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,360
Understandably, you feel rattled.

216
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,960
Many of us have gone through it.

217
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,520
You have to learn

218
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,800
to accept it

219
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,840
instead of running away like this.

220
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,760
Your Highness, you won't grant me the divorce?

221
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,360
In that case, I have to seek Lord's help.

222
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
You!

223
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,040
Mistress.

224
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
Forget it.

225
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,840
Since you refuse to listen to my advice

226
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,160
I'll give you a month

227
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,480
to calm down and think about it.

228
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,480
If you still insist

229
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,360
I'll send someone to be the witness

230
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
for your divorce.

231
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,640
I will never regret it.

232
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Mistress.

233
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,360
Lord asked me to come and invite you over.

234
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,520
He would like to discuss something with you.

235
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,640
Please lead the way, Steward Gao.

236
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,040
Mistress.

237
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,760
I suppose Mistress is still young.

238
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,760
She will understand

239
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,280
and accept it one day.

240
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,240
Your Highness, don't worry too much

241
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,600
about how to dissuade her.

242
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,160
Dissuade?

243
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,440
Am I right to dissuade her?

244
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,240
She has the freedom to make a choice...

245
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,880
unlike me.

246
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,360
My my.

247
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,560
Mistress, you haven't been to Zhong's Garden

248
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,800
for a long time.

249
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,680
It is much deserted here.

250
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,840
Thank you for taking notice, Miss Qi.

251
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,560
Mistress, did you just come out

252
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,120
of Her Highness' residence?

253
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,680
Yes, I was there for a while

254
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,160
and was about to leave.

255
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,560
Mistress, you are a smart girl.

256
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,840
Knowing that it is useless

257
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
to fawn on your husband

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,560
so you came here to fawn on Her Highness.

259
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Sister Qi and I came at a bad time.

260
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,520
You're about to leave.

261
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,720
Sorry to interrupt.

262
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,720
Lord has something to ask Mistress

263
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,400
and he is still waiting for Mistress.

264
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,680
Then go. No one is stopping you.

265
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,040
Run along.

266
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,640
Mistress, if you come here for a visit again

267
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,400
you're welcome to come and see me.

268
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,040
Mistress, please.

269
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,720
Sister Qi, you don't seem to

270
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,360
like Mistress Hua very much, do you?

271
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,840
Yes, but so what?

272
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,000
Why?

273
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,080
Do you need a reason to hate someone?

274
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Lord.

275
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,360
Mistress, I am the shopkeeper

276
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,480
of the embroidery workshop.

277
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,640
Please raise your hand.

278
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,400
What is this for?

279
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,440
I want to make a piece of clothing for her.

280
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,720
Seeing that you are of similar body shape

281
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,920
and since you are also here

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,280
I need you here to take your measurement.

283
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
You...

284
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,240
Why did you come here to see my mother?

285
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,720
Nothing much.

286
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,040
If you want a divorce

287
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,080
it will be faster to ask me for help.

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Here.

289
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,040
Lord, it's done.

290
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,600
There are many maids in your residence.

291
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,800
There should be quite a few

292
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,000
who have the same body shape as Mu Yao

293
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,360
why do you have to use me?

294
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,000
Besides, she is Zhong Yelan's woman now.

295
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,440
It's inappropriate to desire

296
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
your senior's concubine.

297
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,760
Do you think

298
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,080
there are too many maids around me?

299
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,320
Mu Yao and I have many in common

300
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,960
so we got along

301
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,000
and we know each other well.

302
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,080
Even without Zhong Yelan

303
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,600
she won't want to marry into Zhong's Garden.

304
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,800
Why?

305
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
The Zhong family is

306
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,920
a century-old fragrance family

307
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,360
so everyone will expect a lot

308
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
from the wife of the Lord.

309
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,560
Her Highness enjoys the highest status here.

310
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,680
If Mu Yao were to marry you

311
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,160
she could only stay in the house.

312
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,120
What's more, as a woman once married

313
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,360
Mu Yao won't be allowed to marry you.

314
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
In addition

315
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,000
Mu Yao has learned the art of fragrance making

316
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,240
from his father.

317
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,560
She would wish to explore the vast world

318
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,240
and not waste her skills

319
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,800
to become a mistress who only takes care

320
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,160
of her household.

321
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,200
Do you think so?

322
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
I made speculations about Mu Yao's intentions

323
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,200
based on my own point of view.

324
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,960
Lord, if you don't believe what I said

325
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
you can ask Mu Yao yourself.

326
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,680
If she says so herself

327
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,240
it can't be false.

328
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,800
You may go.

329
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,320
Why does that man look familiar?

330
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,040
He seems to be a new face.

331
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,800
We haven't seen him much in Zhong's Garden.

332
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,200
Mistress, why do you think he looks familiar?

333
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,080
Mistress, I overheard a servant just now.

334
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,760
He told Steward Gao that Young Master Hua

335
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,280
has been released from prison.

336
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,240
Mu Yao sure acted fast.

337
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,560
Let's go home.

338
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,760
Lord, I have found out that

339
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,880
it was Master who gave the order.

340
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,120
He said it was a misunderstanding

341
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,600
and Concubine Mu wouldn't pursue it anymore

342
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,880
so Hua Shen was released.

343
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Come on. Cover yourself with the quilt.

344
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,880
Don't catch a cold.

345
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,160
Be careful.

346
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
Here. Put your hand in.

347
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,440
Butler Hua, Mistress is here.

348
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
—Father.                              —Qian!

349
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,280
Mother.

350
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,480
Qian, I've been in prison for so long.

351
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,320
Why haven't you come to see me?

352
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,680
Father, I have done what I promised.

353
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,120
Would you listen to what I have to say now?

354
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,320
Come with me to the study.

355
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,120
Qian!

356
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,480
Brother, take a good rest.

357
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,880
I'll come and see you later.

358
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
You silly boy!

359
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,640
I've asked Her Highness to grant her consent

360
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,320
for Zhong Yelan and me to get a divorce.

361
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,520
Mu Yao has teamed up with Master.

362
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,480
Her goal is to bring down the Hua family.

363
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,560
You useless thing.

364
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,800
You can't even win a man's heart.

365
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,800
Father, shouldn't your first thought be

366
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,520
"So, this is what I get

367
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,800
for doing so many evil deeds?"

368
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,160
What did you say?

369
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,520
Don't think you can make accusations about me

370
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
just because you rescued

371
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
your brother from prison!

372
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
I don't think I can do that

373
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,960
just because I rescued my brother from prison

374
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,520
but I want to remind you

375
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,120
that the Hua family is now in danger.

376
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,680
I'm sure people have something on you.

377
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,480
In time, you will be caught

378
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
and cannot escape from punishment.

379
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,560
You're kidding me!

380
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,960
Who doesn't have something on them?

381
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,960
I fear nothing! Get this!

382
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,480
As long as I'm in the position of a butler

383
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,240
no one will act rashly.

384
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,760
From your point of view

385
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,920
is your power just good for suppressing others?

386
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't know why you wanted to

387
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,320
become the head butler

388
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,280
but in my humble opinion

389
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,920
you oversee all the butlers.

390
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You should make good fragrances

391
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,560
and benefit the people

392
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,520
and realise your ambition.

393
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,360
But now you're putting the cart before the horse.

394
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,800
You're going after for power and wealth

395
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
and starting to suppress your subordinates.

396
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,120
Standing on high ground

397
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,520
you may be able to look far

398
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,040
but at the same time

399
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,560
you're blind to things that are around you.

400
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,360
Don't you see it, Father?

401
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,280
What do you mean?

402
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,800
What don't I see?

403
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,480
The incident with my brother...

404
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,480
you know why it happened better than I do.

405
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,520
The higher you climb

406
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,920
the more enemies you will make

407
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,320
the more hidden dangers you will have

408
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,200
and the more you will lose

409
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,800
when you are under siege.

410
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,560
This is karma.

411
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,800
When my brother was locked up in prison

412
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,120
you couldn't find anyone to help.

413
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,440
That proves my point.

414
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,720
Why do you seem like a different person now?

415
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,800
You wouldn't think of this in the past.

416
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,360
When you're in the face of death

417
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
even the stupidest person

418
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,080
can see things clearly.

419
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,320
I'm not trying to scare you.

420
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,320
While there is still time

421
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,800
if you resign voluntarily now

422
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,000
the Hua family will be able to

423
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,200
walk away unscathed.

424
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,640
The world is vast.

425
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
We can change our names

426
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
and live in the countryside

427
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,880
and use our skills in making fragrances

428
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
to benefit the people.

429
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,920
That's worth considering, isn't it?

430
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,760
You want me to resign?

431
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,200
As you said

432
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,320
Master and Mu's daughter are coming at me.

433
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,680
If I resign now

434
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,440
won't I become prey for them?

435
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
No, you won't.

436
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,000
They're now trying to

437
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,480
sort out their relationship.

438
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,280
They haven't taken any action yet

439
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,000
and haven't gotten hold of anything on us

440
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,280
so now is the best time for you to resign.

441
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
And besides

442
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,840
Mu Yao and us do not have a blood feud.

443
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,600
She won't come after us

444
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,880
and push us to a corner.

445
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,280
Why should I believe you?

446
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,000
Because I am your daughter.

447
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,600
When a bird's nest is overturned

448
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,840
no eggs remain intact.

449
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,200
One month later

450
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,320
Her Highness will help me

451
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,200
divorce Zhong Yelan.

452
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,560
When the time comes

453
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,920
and if you decide to resign

454
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,400
I will return to the Hua family

455
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,360
to face everything with you.

456
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
If you're reluctant to give up your power

457
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,200
I will leave.

458
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,560
And whether the Hua family rise or fall

459
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,440
will have nothing to do with me.

460
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,600
<i>Huiyang County</i>

461
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,640
Is it too difficult for you?

462
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,640
This is all the information I know

463
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,560
which I had gathered from Mu Yao's statement

464
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,120
in the court in the past.

465
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,040
I can't ask Master for his help now.

466
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,880
If you're tired, take a break.

467
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,640
I'm not in a hurry to review this ledger.

468
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,880
Speaking of which

469
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,240
I found some new clues in the past few days.

470
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
What are they?

471
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
Although there is no trace of the broker

472
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,040
who bought furniture for the Mu family

473
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,560
I found out that she adopted a little girl

474
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,040
whom she tried to sell

475
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,960
and took her as her daughter.

476
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,680
Later, she married her adopted daughter

477
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
to a man in secret.

478
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,280
I guess she loves her daughter very much.

479
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,960
Where does her adopted daughter's

480
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,320
husband live?

481
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,520
They used to live outside the city

482
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,200
but, later on, they moved a few times.

483
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,400
It seems that they live in a border town now

484
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,520
but I don't know the exact location.

485
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,120
Since there is a clue about her husband

486
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,560
it's easier to find the broker's daughter

487
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,760
than the broker.

488
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,000
All right

489
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,440
leave this matter to me.

490
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,240
I have the resources to check this out.

491
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,000
All right. Thank you, Master.

492
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,120
Why are you being so polite to me?

493
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,800
I should say thank you

494
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,360
since I need your help.

495
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,840
I heard Hua Qian went to Zhong's Garden

496
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
to look for Her Highness a few days ago.

497
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,440
Master, do you know about this?

498
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,000
Yes.

499
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,280
Master, what are you going to do about it?

500
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,480
I will follow the previous plan

501
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,280
and wait after the case is overturned.

502
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,760
It's not up to her

503
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,320
on the matter of a divorce.

504
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,040
Zisu?

505
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,320
Who is there?

506
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,080
How are you, Miss Mu?

507
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Why do you do that every time I see you?

508
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,680
Junior Lord Wu, you can't change

509
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,240
the habit of coming uninvited, can you?

510
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,480
Are you so keen to experience

511
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,320
prison life in Huangcheng?

512
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,400
What's the matter?

513
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,680
Nothing.

514
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,240
I missed you

515
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,520
so I came to see you.

516
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,880
You have sent someone to be by my side.

517
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,520
Was it also because you missed me?

518
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,120
I know you are smart.

519
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,280
What exactly do you want?

520
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,920
Get this.

521
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,480
I will not be used by anyone now.

522
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,920
Do you still think

523
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,200
that I approach you out of evil intention?

524
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,880
Ask yourself.

525
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,720
When have I used you?

526
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,040
You never know.

527
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,280
I can't read your mind, can I?

528
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,400
If I were the one

529
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,640
who caught you under the tree

530
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,440
would you not be so doubtful of me?

531
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,920
It's all your fault.

532
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,120
You scared my parrot away.

533
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,360
If you can't find it

534
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,120
you can forget about going back with me.

535
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,400
I will definitely find it!

536
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,680
Master...

537
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,800
Are you calling me?

538
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,640
Master...

539
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,040
That little heartless thing.

540
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,160
It saw a girl and called her "master".

541
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,040
—Get down here!                   —Master...

542
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,880
Get down here!

543
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,600
There's a snake behind you!

544
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,880
Get down now!

545
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,800
Are you going to fly away? If you won't, I'll...

546
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Fly away!

547
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,800
Fly away!

548
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Master...

549
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,800
Someone's coming.

550
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,200
Huangcheng has very strict demands

551
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,760
on unmarried women.

552
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,600
If you go directly to her and get seen by others

553
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,880
tongues will wag.

554
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,240
Strict demands on unmarried women?

555
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,640
She's probably a woman from a lowly family

556
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,200
so her behaviour is rather unruly.

557
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,800
I talked to you for a moment

558
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,080
and someone stole my chance.

559
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,440
Master.

560
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,200
Are you not looking for the parrot anymore?

561
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,280
I looked for you at the feast later

562
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,760
but I never saw you.

563
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,360
When I asked people about you

564
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,400
they all said that they had never seen you.

565
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,040
Miss!

566
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:53,320
Did you see a parrot around here just now?

567
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,360
So that's your parrot?

568
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,280
You saw it?

569
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,520
I think I accidentally scared it away.

570
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,840
Why don't I help you find it?

571
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,240
Thank you.

572
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,360
So she even lied to me about this.

573
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,480
What I said is all true.

574
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,440
I wasn't talking about you.

575
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,840
Since you know how I feel about you

576
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,840
would you believe me now?

577
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,320
Believe you?

578
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
I want to take you away.

579
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,960
How many days has Hua Rongzhou been gone?

580
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,040
About half a month.

581
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,800
Why hasn't he come back yet?

582
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,040
Look, without Hua Rongzhou

583
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,400
the maids in this compound all look listless.

584
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Mistress.

585
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Hua Rongzhou!

586
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
Mistress!

587
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,280
How was it? Did you find her?

588
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,880
Let's talk inside. No one should see this.

589
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,000
It's been hard on you.

590
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,280
Go get some rest.

591
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
<i>Contract</i>

592
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,160
<i>Signed by Qian Ying and Mu Yunping</i>

593
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Father

594
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,920
it's up to you now.

595
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,880
Your Highness

596
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,800
this is a Buddhist sutra I copied recently.

597
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,920
Please have a look.

598
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,040
You've done a pretty good job.

599
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Your Highness

600
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,120
some relatives of the two Misses are here.

601
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,600
Is my second aunt here?

602
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,080
A few days ago, she sent someone

603
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
to inform me that she might come and see me.

604
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,360
It is your aunt, Miss.

605
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
Miss Qi's father also sent someone

606
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,760
from the north with some items

607
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,880
for the Mid-Autumn Festival banquet

608
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,000
in a few days.

609
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,720
Just go ahead.

610
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

611
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,960
You should also go and see

612
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,720
what your father sent you.

613
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,800
No need. I'll send someone to take them.

614
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,840
Miss Qi, Mr Jin who came

615
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,040
said that Butler Qi brought you something.

616
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,240
Mr Jin?

617
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,880
Is his name Jin Lin?

618
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,800
Yes, Miss.

619
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,320
I...

620
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,360
Your Highness, I want to go and see

621
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,560
what my father sent me.

622
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Go on.

623
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,240
Sometimes I envy them.

624
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,280
At least they have family members visiting them

625
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,560
from time to time.

626
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,760
They are still young after all.

627
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,240
I brought them here from their hometowns

628
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,280
to Huangcheng

629
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,440
would they blame me in their hearts?

630
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,160
Your Highness, that's impossible.

631
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,440
Your Highness' invitation

632
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,480
is a great opportunity for them.

633
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,440
Miss.

634
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,720
This is Zhong's Garden. Watch what you do.

635
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,760
Miss...

636
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,120
Miss...

637
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,200
Bring these over there. Be careful.

638
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Mind your step.

639
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,320
It's been a tiring journey.

640
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,280
It's been hard on you, Jin Lin.

641
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,320
I'm here to deliver things on behalf of Master Qi.

642
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,400
Wait.

643
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
This is for Miss Qi.

644
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
It's full of Miss Qi's beloved things.

645
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,560
I didn't expect Master Qi

646
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,400
to care so much about Miss Qi.

647
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Shanzhi, bring the things to my room.

648
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,720
I need Jin Lin to pass a message to my father.

649
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,880
Are you trying to defy my order?

650
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,440
Brother Zhuqing...

651
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,920
Miss Qi, since you came to Zhong's Garden

652
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,040
it's better not to call me by my nickname.

653
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,000
Are you blaming me?

654
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
I dare not.

655
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,560
Do you really want to distance yourself from me?

656
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,240
Miss Qi, you are the master

657
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,440
and I am the servant.

658
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,280
How can I distance you from me?

659
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,520
If I really don't mean anything to you

660
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,920
you wouldn't come all the way

661
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,120
to deliver my things?

662
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,120
This is not your job.

663
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,320
Brother Zhuqing

664
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,040
I embroidered this myself.

665
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,720
Don't worry.

666
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,320
Her Highness doesn't care about me anymore.

667
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
Sooner or later, she will let me leave.

668
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,160
My father has arranged a marriage for me.

669
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,080
<i>Bonus footage</i>

670
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,840
I was sure I saw him.

671
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,080
That little bastard

672
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,560
has been wandering around the county

673
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,080
in the past few days.

674
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
My dear.

675
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,440
Is it true that the little bastard has been here?

676
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,800
Yes, I think so.

677
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,200
What should we do?

678
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,080
I don't think he came for us.

679
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,040
I have already sent someone

680
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,320
to follow him secretly.

681
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,040
His clothes are different from the past.

682
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,560
We have to be sure

683
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,600
before making any plans.

684
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,880
As long as he's not here for us.
