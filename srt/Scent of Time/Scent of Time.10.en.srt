1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Scent of Time

2
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
Episode 10

3
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,880
Three days after

4
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
What is it?

5
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,720
Afraid that I'll suddenly hug you again?

6
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,720
Greetings, Lord Zhong and Your Highness.

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,520
Thank you for coming such a long way.

8
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
Thank you for the invitation.

9
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
We're deeply honoured

10
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
to have the opportunity

11
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,480
to attend this annual incense banquet.

12
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
Please take a seat.

13
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,520
Thank you, Lord Zhong.

14
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,120
The Junior Lord of the Wu family has arrived.

15
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,360
I'm Wu Shuomo from the Wu family.

16
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,000
Greetings, Lord Zhong and Your Highness.

17
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,000
Sorry for being late.

18
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,840
You're not late. You came just in time.

19
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,160
Take a seat.

20
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,360
What a unique fragrance.

21
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
It smells so good.

22
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,400
Only the Zhong family can produce it.

23
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,240
I heard so much about their famous incense.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,560
Nothing beats experiencing it in person.

25
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,440
The incense banquet

26
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,960
becomes grander each year.

27
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,000
Look at the large plumes.

28
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
I wonder how much incense is burned.

29
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,640
That's the only way to create an impact.

30
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,160
Besides, we're talking about the Zhong family.

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,160
They're not lacking in incense.

32
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,800
You're right.

33
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,120
In addition to the incense

34
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,920
the tea and snacks on the table

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,200
are also scented.

36
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,040
Please have a taste.

37
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
After you.

38
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,720
He's already this old

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,440
yet is still so stubborn.

40
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
What was that?

41
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,760
Nothing.

42
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,200
—Please.                              —Okay.

43
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,680
Did you get to the bottom of it?

44
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,280
I told my men to check again.

45
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,560
The incense balls used in this incense banquet

46
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,320
are indeed Zen incense.

47
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,920
Good.

48
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,520
It's just that... Master...

49
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,040
Must we do this?

50
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,720
If the Senior Lord finds out one day

51
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,280
I'm afraid it can't be justified.

52
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,320
If you have doubts

53
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,680
you should just kill her.

54
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,280
We don't need to handle it this way.

55
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,040
The Mu family is already down and out.

56
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,600
I won't do anything to her.

57
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,320
I have my own plan.

58
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,680
Father's health is getting steadily worse.

59
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,240
So, he can't influence any of my decisions.

60
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,000
I know you're hesitant

61
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,600
because of the past.

62
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,600
She's a member of the Mu family after all.

63
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,640
If she finds out...

64
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,600
Then just keep her in the dark forever.

65
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,160
Master, you can make sure of this

66
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,360
but during the ancestral worship

67
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,040
I could clearly see

68
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,440
that she was willing to die for Master

69
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,600
I'm afraid she has...

70
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
I didn't notice it the last time

71
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,440
but now that I have

72
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,960
they are so blatant.

73
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,480
Is he feeling guilty?

74
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,760
That's right.

75
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,320
His arrow almost ended my life.

76
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,520
Since only I know about it

77
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,520
I can threaten him with it.

78
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,840
Put down the chopsticks.

79
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,200
All right.

80
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,800
Now that we've had our drinks

81
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,920
and eaten

82
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,040
the next familiar activity

83
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,480
is the incense quiz.

84
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,680
We shall follow the usual rule.

85
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,160
Whoever can figure out the ingredients

86
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,000
wins the first prize.

87
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,960
This is the Balsa wood incense

88
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,080
a fragrance created by the lord himself.

89
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,640
It can prevent the plague

90
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,960
refresh the mind

91
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,880
and treat traumatic swelling and pain.

92
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,440
Since this is the showstopper

93
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,080
would you show the Jiayin Pill

94
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,840
that's passed down through generations

95
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,960
to your guests who have travelled

96
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
from far away?

97
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,480
Junior Lord Wu, you may not know

98
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,200
that the key ingredient is blood amber.

99
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,800
And premium ones are very hard to find.

100
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,840
What's more, Jiayin Pill

101
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,960
was originally used to treat hallucination

102
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,640
so it should be kept for those who need it

103
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,320
not as the top prize for the banquet.

104
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,120
Sorry, I don't know about it.

105
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,760
I heard about the rarity of this incense

106
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,760
so I wanted to have a look.

107
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
I should have thought further.

108
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,280
Lord Zhong seldom makes incense in person

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,320
and this Balsa wood incense

110
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,360
is also hard to find in the market.

111
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,840
Right...

112
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,480
Let's begin then.

113
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,400
Everyone, if you can guess the ingredients used

114
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,960
then the one who got the most correct

115
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,240
will be the winner.

116
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,840
Why is the smell so familiar?

117
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,800
Isn't it the ordinary Zen incense?

118
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,160
Using this incense for the quiz?

119
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,160
That's a bit rude, isn't it?

120
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,920
I smell something different.

121
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,120
It's more refreshing and calming.

122
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,720
The smell is indeed unique to Zen incense.

123
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,920
Buy why would they use that for the quiz?

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Right.

125
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,440
What's missing?

126
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,640
I see.

127
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,240
Can you behave yourself?

128
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,960
Master, please enjoy the incense here.

129
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,120
I'm going to the washroom

130
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,400
so I won't bother you here.

131
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,960
Sister Qi, this plum wine is sweet and mellow

132
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,400
much better than the one made in the garden.

133
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,520
I thought you'd be in a bad mood

134
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,320
so I invited you for a drink and chat

135
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
but you seem to be in such a good mood.

136
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Why should I be in a bad mood?

137
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,640
Didn't you hear the sounds?

138
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,720
The drum music from the main hall

139
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,600
can be heard in my compound

140
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,840
but we can only sit here and drink

141
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,040
since we weren't invited to the banquet.

142
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,080
Those who attend the incense banquet

143
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,000
have business dealings with the Zhong family.

144
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,120
We girls should stay in the backyard.

145
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Says who?

146
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,520
Hua Qian is right there as we speak.

147
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,120
She's married to Master

148
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
so it's normal for her to attend.

149
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,080
We're all the daughters of the supervisors.

150
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,840
How come she has such good luck?

151
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,880
She always gets what she wants!

152
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,000
She's different from us.

153
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,880
Her father is Chief Butler.

154
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,600
We all work for the Zhong family.

155
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,880
What's the difference?

156
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,440
Besides, that flirtatious girl

157
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,440
doesn't deserve to be with the man she loves!

158
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Miss!

159
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,320
She had too much to drink

160
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,840
and is spouting tipsy talk.

161
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,040
Yes! I'm drunk!

162
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
This incense makes me drunk!

163
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,520
This plum wine also makes me drunk!

164
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,760
It's getting late

165
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,320
so I should go back to rest.

166
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,720
Take good care of Sister Qi.

167
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,600
Mistress, aren't you going to the washroom?

168
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,080
Why are we here?

169
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,720
It's quiet here. I want to get some air.

170
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,520
The banquet is about to last one hour more.

171
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,720
Besides, the incense quiz

172
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,080
isn't so interesting.

173
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,000
We can return when the banquet is almost over.

174
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,400
Why is Mistress here alone?

175
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,120
Why did he follow me?

176
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,600
Qianzhi.

177
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,560
What brings Junior Lord Wu here?

178
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,400
I wanted to say thank you

179
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,840
but I didn't expect

180
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,360
that you're so different from the rumours.

181
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,480
I didn't expect

182
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,400
the Junior Lord to do a lot of research

183
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,040
before coming to Huangcheng this time

184
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,240
which even included researching me.

185
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,960
You're the most talented woman in the city

186
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
so, of course, I've heard about you.

187
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,960
Junior Lord, you flatter me too much.

188
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,400
I've been out for too long

189
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,640
so I'll go back now.

190
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,720
I heard so much about your loving marriage

191
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,480
that draws the envy of others.

192
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,800
But both of you were rather

193
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,840
cold to each other just now?

194
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,200
What's going on?

195
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,120
In the last life, I approached him first

196
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,800
to help break up Zhong Yelan and Mu Yao.

197
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,400
Why is he taking the initiative now?

198
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,200
Wu Shuomo.

199
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,440
You're smart to find this place.

200
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,480
But isn't it a bit indecent for you

201
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,280
to come here dressing like this

202
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,520
in the middle of the night?

203
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,840
Wu Shuomo, why did you choose to hide here?

204
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
What about me?

205
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,920
What's wrong?

206
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,920
You agreed to cooperate with me.

207
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,560
Why did you turn your back on me?

208
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
What did we agree on?

209
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,800
You said you would take Mu Yao away

210
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,040
and I would have Zhong Yelan

211
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,960
but now you don't want to admit it, right?

212
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Don't try me

213
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,760
or I'll report you to the authorities now

214
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
and tell them you're behind everything.

215
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,680
Go right ahead.

216
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,400
If I remember correctly

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,400
all members of your family have been arrested

218
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
and imprisoned.

219
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,720
You came at the perfect time.

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,440
Let me tell you something useful.

221
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,280
I'll leave the city

222
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,920
via Mount Donghuang tomorrow.

223
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,680
So you'd better hurry up.

224
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,480
I'll see who will believe

225
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,760
a fugitive like you.

226
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,920
You...

227
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,680
So, are you going to offer Mu Yao

228
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,520
to Zhong Yelan?

229
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,080
She doesn't want me

230
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,240
so I should let her go.

231
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,440
What about me?

232
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,040
As you offer her kindness

233
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,480
my entire family is going to be exiled!

234
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,560
Weren't the members of the Mu family

235
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,640
killed or exiled previously

236
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
because of your family?

237
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,840
It's karma.

238
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,520
Your family deserves this.

239
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,760
After all

240
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,600
you were the one who hatched the ploy

241
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,240
so now, you can't blame others.

242
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,080
You broke off our agreement

243
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,560
and implicated me afterwards

244
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,160
so you can't just leave me in the lurch.

245
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,320
Do you mean

246
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,560
you want to be my woman?

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm the most talented woman in this city

248
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,160
and also the best here in all literary arts.

249
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,960
If you really turn against me

250
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,400
I won't let you leave

251
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,360
Mount Donghuang so easily.

252
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,680
Don't forget that

253
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
a member of the Wu family

254
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,160
who should be thousands of miles away

255
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,600
shouldn't be in Huangcheng right now.

256
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,760
Butler Hua will head to the gallows tomorrow

257
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,200
and your whole family will be exiled.

258
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,080
And now, you're here to offer yourself.

259
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,880
You want to threaten and tempt me.

260
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,040
I'm really impressed by

261
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,840
how cold-blooded and selfish you are.

262
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,760
But

263
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm not interested in used goods.

264
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,160
You...

265
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,960
I feared that you would be indecisive

266
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
so when you came just now

267
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,520
I had someone notify your magistrate.

268
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
When you see him later

269
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,720
let's see if he'll pay more attention

270
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,520
to a foreigner like me

271
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,680
or a wanted person like you.

272
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,640
Can't believe such a coward like her

273
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
tried to threaten me.

274
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,800
What a stupid woman.

275
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,880
How ridiculous.

276
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,560
Am I wrong?

277
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,520
Marriage isn't that straightforward.

278
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,480
A lovey-dovey couple

279
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,880
might have a rocky relationship

280
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,800
but two people who truly respect each other

281
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,280
can remain together for a long time.

282
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,160
Junior Lord, you're not married

283
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,480
so you won't understand.

284
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,000
Speaking of marriage

285
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,440
I do have someone I fancy.

286
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,560
The maid behind Master caught my eye.

287
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,560
But he seems to feel for her, too,

288
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
so I'm afraid

289
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,520
that he wouldn't let her go.

290
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,360
You should speak to him yourself.

291
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,480
I can't decide for him.

292
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,520
Mistress, don't you understand what I mean?

293
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,080
We can collaborate

294
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,680
and get what we each need.

295
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,800
Help me and...

296
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,720
Please forgive me, Junior Lord Wu.

297
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,080
Ever since I was shot with an arrow

298
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,560
at the ancestral worship

299
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
by a shameless assassin

300
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,480
my health has been worsening.

301
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,840
I can't stop coughing when it turns cold.

302
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,920
Wait a minute, Mistress.

303
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,920
—I haven't finished my...   —Junior Lord Wu.

304
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,720
Why are you here?

305
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,280
I drank so much wine

306
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
that my head was starting to ache

307
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
so I came out to get some fresh air.

308
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,880
I should get back now.

309
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,440
Mistress.

310
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,440
Let's chat another day.

311
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
There's nothing else left to say.

312
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,480
Lord, did you hear the entire conversation

313
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,920
between Junior Lord Wu and me just now?

314
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,080
What do you think?

315
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,000
It's not what you think.

316
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,320
Then tell me.

317
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,120
What do you mean, "it's not what I think"?

318
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,760
I have no intention to hurt Mu Yao.

319
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,200
He told me

320
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,280
that he has his eye on Mu Yao.

321
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
But that's his business.

322
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,600
It has nothing to do with me.

323
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,600
I never said that I'd help him

324
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,960
or promise to marry Mu Yao to him.

325
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,320
It was just his wishful thinking.

326
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,480
It has nothing to do with me.

327
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,600
If you don't believe me

328
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,480
you could just go and ask him.

329
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
Why should I do that?

330
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,120
Don't worry.

331
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,240
I told you I just wanted a peaceful life

332
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,600
without any dispute.

333
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,680
So we should fight for the one we want

334
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,200
on our own.

335
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
On our own?

336
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,320
What did she mean?

337
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,760
I don't know either.

338
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't get Mu Yao in trouble anymore.

339
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,320
Why?

340
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,360
I-I haven't gotten her in trouble anyway.

341
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,760
Now that the three men who love her so much

342
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,800
are coming together, let's stay away

343
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,360
lest they fight and hurt us.

344
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,480
Who are those men?

345
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,480
What's the use of knowing?

346
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
Hold it steady.

347
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,480
I made this anti-hangover soup for the lord.

348
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't worry, Sister Man.

349
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,600
Shouldn't you be at the banquet?

350
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,760
Why are you here?

351
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,120
Are you meeting your lover secretly?

352
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,960
What audacity! How dare a maid like you

353
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,400
slander Mistress!

354
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,520
Look at how upset you got.

355
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,320
—Did I guess correctly?              —You...

356
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,560
This kind of person isn't worth our time.

357
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,720
What's the hurry?

358
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,160
Tell me what kind of person I am.

359
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,040
The kind who has a corrupted mind

360
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,960
and views everything with that filter.

361
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,400
Do you think that you're still

362
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,640
that revered Mistress?

363
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,520
Everyone in Huangcheng knows that

364
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,400
the master ignores you

365
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,160
even after you took that arrow for him.

366
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,280
Cousin Qian, you always seem so cheerful

367
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,320
but I've been feeling sorry for you.

368
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,920
You think I've lost Master's favour?

369
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,040
Is that why you have the nerve to humiliate me?

370
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,760
You're overthinking.

371
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,240
How would I dare do that?

372
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,360
I just felt so sorry

373
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,560
to watch you risking your life for nothing.

374
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,280
Speaking of which, Butler Hua

375
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,200
must be embarrassed by this, too.

376
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,280
Otherwise

377
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,080
why would he suddenly ask about me recently?

378
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,920
You brought this upon yourself.

379
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,400
It's wrong of me to make you worry about me.

380
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,920
You were in such a hurry. Where are you going?

381
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,360
I heard that Lord Zhong drank a lot

382
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,880
so I made some anti-hangover soup.

383
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,280
I've wasted enough time

384
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,440
so I should leave now.

385
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,800
Please don't stand in my way, Sister Qian.

386
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,400
Didn't you insist on stopping me just now?

387
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
How did it end up

388
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,000
being me standing in your way?

389
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,960
You're so caring

390
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,880
but the lord is of noble birth

391
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,320
and fragrance alone can relieve his hangover.

392
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,640
How can he drink such a vulgar thing?

393
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,400
Hua Qian, what do you mean?

394
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,800
After all, you're born vulgar.

395
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,680
It seems that you can't elevate yourself.

396
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,600
You're serving Lord Zhong

397
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,400
yet you're still clueless

398
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,200
about incense therapy.

399
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,200
You...

400
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,000
Sister Man

401
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,520
let's hurry up and deliver the soup

402
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,000
before it gets cold.

403
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,080
—Cousin...                        —Hua Qian.

404
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,520
Have you lost your mind?

405
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,800
That's a very hurtful thing to say.

406
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,160
You just missed your step.

407
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,680
How could you blame me for that?

408
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,400
You've always looked down on me.

409
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,760
I've delivered messages for Butler Hua

410
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,320
countless times.

411
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,120
Not only do you still treat me poorly

412
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,320
you're even biting the hand that feeds you!

413
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,000
Do you really want to go against your father?

414
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,960
I don't understand what you're saying.

415
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,040
Don't feign ignorance.

416
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,800
Without my help

417
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,920
your father wouldn't have been hired

418
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
to be the butler here.

419
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,840
You're just an ingrate

420
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
who turns against her benefactor!

421
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,320
Eventually, you'd still need help from me.

422
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,120
Cousin, you're getting ludicrous.

423
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,240
My father was trained by the former lord.

424
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,840
You've only been working here

425
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,680
for two or three years.

426
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,440
Why would he need your help?

427
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,320
Besides, what capability do you have

428
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
to support the whole Hua family?

429
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,280
Are you plain stupid

430
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,880
but just too proud to know this?

431
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,160
Do you think Butler Hua

432
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
is willing to submit to the lord?

433
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,040
He needs me to know the lord's movements.

434
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,080
I may not know everything about my father

435
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,760
but at least I know him better than you.

436
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,200
If he's indeed so ambitious

437
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,760
why would he turn a blind eye

438
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,320
to the people you sent over to woo him

439
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,640
these few months?

440
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,400
You need to get this straight.

441
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,040
My father never needed your help.

442
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,920
The reverse is true instead.

443
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,120
Really?

444
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,560
You may not know this.

445
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,040
But, over the past few days

446
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,280
Butler Hua fawns over me

447
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,000
by sending me a lot of gifts.

448
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,360
I need to tell him this then.

449
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,360
It's better to cut off some family ties

450
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,880
than risk having well-intentioned gifts

451
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,480
be misunderstood.

452
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,520
Do you think I need his help that badly?

453
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,240
Without him

454
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,880
I can still make it here.

455
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,240
Just you wait and see.

456
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,440
Sooner or later

457
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,480
I'll become the Lady of Zhong Residence

458
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,680
and your entire family will kneel before me.

459
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,480
You're even stupider than I used to be.

460
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,800
Since when can you make decisions for me?

461
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,520
—Lord...                —You're just a maid.

462
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Do you think you can just turn yourself

463
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,000
into the Lady of Zhong Residence?

464
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,120
No wonder you were provoking me. You...

465
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,000
You haven't answered my question yet.

466
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,040
You're just a maid.

467
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,920
I treat you kindly because of Butler Hua

468
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,320
but I didn't expect you to aim that high.

469
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,920
No, Lord. I...

470
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,720
It was Butler Hua! He forced me to do this!

471
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,280
Didn't you just say

472
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,880
that you don't need my father at all?

473
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,840
Why are you blaming this on him now?

474
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,200
Please consider the merits of my family

475
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,200
and not punish my cousin too much.

476
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,920
I'm too weak to stand amidst the elements

477
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,480
so I must go now.

478
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,680
Hua Qian, you slut!

479
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Be careful!

480
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,320
Mistress!

481
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,040
—Lord!                                 —Lord!

482
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,360
Lord, please forgive us.

483
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,640
Mistress, are you okay?

484
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,640
Lord, you...

485
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,240
Lock the two of them up

486
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
gag them...

487
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,640
tight.

488
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Got it.

489
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,080
Lord, please forgive us.

490
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,240
Would you stay in a nearby compound

491
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,400
for a moment?

492
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,920
I'll hurry and find you some clean clothes.

493
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,520
Lord...

494
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,280
Let's go.

495
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,680
Lord...

496
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Aren't you coming?

497
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Master.

498
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,840
Go check on the mistress

499
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,040
in case she should lose her way.

500
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,200
Noted.

501
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,400
It's very likely.

502
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,360
This is too easy.

503
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,800
I've long heard of you, Master Zhong.

504
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,640
I'm glad to meet you

505
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,640
and you look even more impressive in person.

506
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,680
Junior Lord Wu, I'm flattered.

507
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,880
Master, the maid next to you

508
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
is really pretty.

509
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,880
Junior Lord Wu, that was a bit rude.

510
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,800
Really? Then I must apologise.

511
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,240
After all, we don't have so many rules

512
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080
so I'm used to doing whatever I want.

513
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,040
Get someone to find the lord.

514
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
The banquet is coming to an end.

515
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,200
It will look bad on us if he's absent.

516
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,920
Yes, Your Highness.

517
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,040
Go find Lord Zhong.

518
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,040
Have your maid stand guard outside

519
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,800
and lead Gao Yu in when he arrives.

520
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,040
Then I won't go in as well.

521
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,640
It's out of etiquette.

522
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,000
If neither of us tells, who will know?

523
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,440
Or do you want others to know

524
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
that I'm in this situation

525
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,080
because of you?

526
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,760
What is this?

527
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,160
Jinhua Powder, a pain relief medicine.

528
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,560
I'm injured because of you

529
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,280
so you should apply the medicine for me.

530
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,320
I can't reach my back.

531
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,920
Have your maid guard at the door.

532
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,320
What... what are you doing?

533
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,040
I'm getting ready for you to apply medicine.

534
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,000
How about...

535
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,720
I get Qianzhi to help you instead?

536
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
Do you think just anyone

537
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,160
gets to see the body of the lord?

538
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,400
Then let's wait for Gao Yu to come help you.

539
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,480
Hua Qian.

540
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,080
If we delay any longer

541
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,960
then everyone in the banquet

542
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,240
would notice our absence.

543
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,680
No way...

544
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,120
What kind of porcelain did Hua Man use?

545
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,120
Why do you ask?

546
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,880
The jar has such good insulation effect.

547
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,920
The maid next to her

548
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,040
had been carrying it for a long time

549
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,600
but I did not expect it to still be this hot.

550
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,400
He must have been too sheltered

551
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,680
to withstand the heat.

552
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,160
Do you think I'm too pampered?

553
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,720
Lord, don't move.

554
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,920
I'll apply the medicine for you now.

555
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,680
Why do you carry with you

556
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,320
a pain relief medicine?

557
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,920
Doing business is like battling in a war.

558
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,440
It's always better to be prepared.

559
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,280
All done. You can get changed now.

560
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,520
Gao Yu hasn't brought me my clothes yet.

561
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,160
Then I'll go outside and wait for him.

562
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Hua Qian.

563
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,520
You kept mentioning Mu Yao earlier.

564
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,000
What was your intention?

565
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,000
Mu Yao is an exceptional woman

566
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,520
so Wu Shuomo also has a crush on her.

567
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,960
I meant it as a kind reminder for you.

568
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,080
Why do you...

569
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,480
How do you know...

570
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,800
If you like someone

571
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,080
it shows in the way you look at them.

572
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,360
You look at us differently.

573
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,960
I'm a woman, so I can tell.

574
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,960
Of course, I look at her

575
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,560
differently from how I do you.

576
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,720
Thank you for saving me just now.

577
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,680
Please take this incident with Hua Man

578
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,840
as my gift to you in return.

579
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,720
A person with evil intentions

580
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,400
will never risk their own well-being.

581
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,360
My father is old

582
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,080
and my elder brother is too frivolous

583
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,960
to inherit his career

584
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,440
so you don't have to be wary of my family.

585
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,640
Based on what you said

586
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,920
did you trick Hua Man to expose her thoughts

587
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,920
for my well-being?

588
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,800
How many times must I convince you

589
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,200
that I won't speculate about you anymore?

590
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,440
It's not that I don't believe...

591
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,400
Mistress, is Lord Zhong inside?

592
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,960
Lord, I brought you clothes and medicine.

593
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,600
Let me apply the medicine for you.

594
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,160
No need. It's already done.

595
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,040
Mistress, what happened just now?

596
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,720
Nothing. We've been out for too long.

597
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,960
Let's hurry back.

598
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,200
Mistress, if someone else finds out

599
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,960
what happened today, I'm afraid...

600
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
Don't worry.

601
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,200
Lord will want to keep it secret, too,

602
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,200
so no need to worry about covering it up.

603
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,920
But, even if others don't know

604
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,560
it's too outrageous for you

605
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,120
to apply the medicine to him.

606
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,440
In that situation, I had to help him.

607
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,920
I feel no shame

608
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,200
so don't think too much about it.

609
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
Why did he change his outfit?

610
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,360
I didn't expect Junior Lord Wu

611
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
to be so knowledgeable.

612
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Among all the guests here

613
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,920
only you got all the ingredients right.

614
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,520
I was lucky.

615
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,200
Isn't it the ordinary Zen incense?

616
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,200
There should be no mistakes in our answers.

617
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,800
—Right.                 —We should be right.

618
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,520
Right, this is indeed Zen Incense

619
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,280
but it's not an ordinary one.

620
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,680
A special ingredient was added

621
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,880
which can make the scent of incense

622
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,520
more serene and comfortable.

623
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,520
The newly added ingredient

624
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
is on the table in front of you.

625
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,720
That's the wild tea from southern Yunnan.

626
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,640
It's different from the type you drink.

627
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
The one used in this incense is made

628
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,040
from tea trees over a thousand years of age

629
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
so it has a strong circulatory property.

630
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,280
Only a person with an innocent soul

631
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,200
can guess what it is

632
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,680
without relying on its scent.

633
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,920
I see.

634
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,440
Congratulations to you, Junior Lord Wu.

635
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
Lord Zhong, thank you for your hospitality.

636
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,400
Regardless of

637
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,840
how precious this Balsa wood incense is

638
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,120
it's not what I want.

639
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,000
I'd like to exchange this prize for a person

640
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,360
if you don't mind.

641
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,200
What does this Junior Lord Wu want to do?

642
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,440
I don't know

643
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,120
but Lord Zhong rejected his request

644
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,520
for the Jiayin Pill just now.

645
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,720
If he rejects him again

646
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,040
it'd be a bit embarrassing to the Wu family.

647
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Junior Lord Wu, can you tell me

648
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,320
who is the person you want?

649
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,320
The maid from Zhong Residence.

650
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,120
What?

651
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,680
I thought Junior Lord Wu would aim high

652
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,120
to marry into the Zhong family.

653
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,920
But all he wants is a maid.

654
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,680
Exactly.

655
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,800
When he got the quiz right

656
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,040
I thought he was an incense connoisseur.

657
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,280
So I didn't expect him

658
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,200
to have a crush on a pretty lass.

659
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,200
You can't command the people in my household

660
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
to come and go as you please.

661
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,360
She's just a maid.

662
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,400
You're being too stingy.

663
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,200
Who said she's just a maid?

664
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,680
She is from Zhong Residence

665
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,520
so naturally...

666
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,880
she's my woman.

667
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,880
This...

668
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,640
This is absurd!

669
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,600
—What's going on?                     —Yeah.

670
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,600
What is he talking about?

671
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,400
Those were the same words he used before.

672
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,880
This is a great opportunity for me.

673
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,200
I can use this

674
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
as the reason for the breakdown of our marriage

675
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,400
and others wouldn't find it odd

676
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,160
when I eventually demand a divorce.

677
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,520
Your woman?

678
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,680
What about the one next to you?

679
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,600
—What do you mean by that, Master?     —I...

680
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,240
I... don't understand.

681
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,720
Butler Hua, you're overreacting.

682
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,160
It's not odd that a man has many concubines.

683
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,920
My wife, Qian, has always been generous

684
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,400
so why is it a problem for you?

685
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,280
Perhaps you should stay out of my business.

686
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,400
All right...

687
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,840
I was being rude.

688
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,040
Please regard this cup of tea

689
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,800
as an apology.

690
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,800
A disappointing daughter!

691
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
There are so many people here.

692
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,120
Don't embarrass your sister.

693
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,520
Be good. Come back home with me.

694
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,880
Let's go, hurry up.

695
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,000
Master really went too far today.

696
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,920
He didn't save his wife's face at all

697
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,040
because of a maid.

698
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,320
That's right

699
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,640
Mistress is Butler Hua's daughter.

700
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,560
How can she be humiliated like this?

701
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,120
Forget it. Let's drop it.

702
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Get on the carriage.

703
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,560
Mistress, let's go.

704
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,280
Let's go.

705
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,560
Bonus footage

706
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,800
Why haven't I been seeing Hua Rongzhou?

707
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,080
What do you want him for?

708
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,640
I underestimated him before

709
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,400
so I lost when I was sparring with him.

710
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,400
Now I'm ready

711
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,960
and I want to defeat him.

712
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,960
Does any of you know where he is?

713
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,520
I also want to spar with him!

714
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,880
Don't you know?

715
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,200
He's still guarding Mistress' residence.

716
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,440
But there is no benefit in working for her now

717
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,840
and others have found excuses

718
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,200
to transfer to another place.

719
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,400
Perhaps he is...

720
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,080
also thinking hard about how to escape.

721
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,080
He deserves it!
