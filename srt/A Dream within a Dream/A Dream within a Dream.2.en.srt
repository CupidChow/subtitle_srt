00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,780
You can take down Youcheng

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,860
without losing a single soldier.

194
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,020
If I want to take Youcheng,

195
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,480
I can do it by attacking
with 30,000 soldiers.

196
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,120
Why should I fight this
small battle with you?

197
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,870
If you attack,

198
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,300
my 3,000 Xuanjia warriors

199
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,140
will fight with our lives too.

200
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,720
One life

201
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,600
for 10 lives.

202
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,710
Lord Qianyu, top general of Jing,

203
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,720
just died under my sword.

204
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,510
And his son,

205
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,320
known as the son of a War God,

206
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,360
Chu Guihong,

207
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,670
also became my prisoner.

208
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,920
You've lost three of four border cities.

209
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,800
Even if you have heavenly skills,

210
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,490
you won't be able to guard
this last lonely city.

211
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,810
People fear my bloodthirstiness

212
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,950
and insult me as the God of Death.

213
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Are you afraid too, General Fang?

214
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,860
If I win,

215
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
you'll die.

216
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,120
If I lose,

217
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,840
what do you want?

218
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,400
Give Chu Guihong to me.

219
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,660
Everyone knows you didn't
get along with Lord Qianyu.

220
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,870
Why would you save his son?

221
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,120
I'm not trying to save him.

222
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,700
I want to

223
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,110
kill him myself.

224
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,390
You want to kill Chu Guihong?

225
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,120
Yes.

226
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,190
I've guarded the border for three years

227
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,340
without any accomplishments

228
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,200
because I was restrained by Lord Qianyu

229
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,150
and trapped in Youcheng.

230
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,400
The Emperor of Great Jing sent you
to guard Youcheng,

231
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,300
while having Lord Qianyu
discipline you strictly.

232
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:31,270
I'm afraid he had ulterior motives.

233
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,380
Do you know what Youcheng is?

234
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,330
[Youcheng]

235
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,350
It means confinement.

236
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,370
You are so frank.

237
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,700
This game is interesting.

238
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,600
Very interesting.

239
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,000
General Fang.

240
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,200
You lost.

241
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,630
Can you hand him over now?

242
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,270
Hold on.

243
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,960
Wait for me to get my brush,
ink and inkstone,

244
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,910
and write down this legendary chessplay.

245
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,870
Don't bother.

246
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,720
These ivory and ebony pieces

247
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,840
are top grade.

248
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,960
Take this

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
as a gift from me to you.

250
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:26,830
[Youcheng]

251
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,160
Your Highness, let's go quickly.

252
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,680
What if they shoot at us?

253
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,320
Don't worry. They dare not.

254
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,370
This...

255
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,320
They don't dare to shoot you,

256
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,480
but they dare to shoot me.

257
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,200
Who would care about my cheap life?

258
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,390
If I were turned into a porcupine,

259
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,480
who would serve you?

260
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,440
I'm leaving.

261
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,450
[Youcheng]

262
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,000
Hurry up.

263
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,320
General.

264
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,150
Don't let his Empty Fort Strategy

265
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,120
scare us.

266
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,200
Please give the order to attack the city!

267
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,460
Please give the order to attack the city!

268
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,770
Please give the order to attack the city!

269
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,690
Those who cross the line

270
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,370
will be killed!

271
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,740
With 10 times the soldiers,

272
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,340
I'll only surround the city.

273
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,150
I don't need to attack the city at all.

274
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,360
I just need to wait until the provisions
in the city run out.

275
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,710
Then in three days,

276
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,980
we'll fight to the death.

277
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,380
The Emperor of Great Jing wants you dead.

278
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,770
He won't send reinforcements to save you.

279
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:37,340
[Youcheng]

280
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,790
Nan Heng,

281
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,930
do you have a special name for
the game of life and death?

282
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,840
The sound of wind and cranes.

283
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,120
The sound of wind and cranes...

284
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,200
General, he insulted us.

285
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,290
Excuse me.

286
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,240
If I remember correctly,

287
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,750
we were discussing

288
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,150
my marriage, right?

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,320
Then why did you keep talking about

290
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,910
that demon Nan Heng?

291
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,440
What does

292
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,320
my marriage have to do with him?

293
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,150
Could it be...

294
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,150
I was talking about

295
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,720
Nan Heng, the one who broke
the tortoise shell

296
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,320
when the State Preceptor
of Jing was divining?

297
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,840
Girl, duh.

298
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,030
I...

299
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,720
But...

300
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,630
But I clearly wanted to
talk about General Chu.

301
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,510
Why did I...

302
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,240
Yingqiu.

303
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,870
I...

304
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,390
If you hadn't said anything,

305
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,750
I wouldn't have felt something
was wrong either.

306
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,010
What happened?

307
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,870
I don't know.

308
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,020
Enough.

309
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
It already happened.

310
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,120
But listen.

311
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
What was he even saying?

312
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,750
What was he even doing?

313
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,100
He thought he was so cool

314
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,580
with that Empty Fort Strategy.

315
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,200
He must be a crazy fan of Zhuge Liang.

316
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Isn't he cringey?

317
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,530
What kind of fan is that?

318
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,550
A crazy fan.

319
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,720
Is it food?

320
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,640
I don't know. I haven't tried it.

321
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,430
Okay, I got it.

322
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,750
It's a mandatory plot

323
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,630
forced to happen, right?

324
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,320
But the most important thing now

325
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,750
is my marriage,

326
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,670
ladies.

327
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,550
Yes.

328
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,320
Marriage.

329
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,860
That day,

330
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,960
he had the most dangerous battle

331
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,660
of his army life.

332
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,200
In November,

333
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,440
the Seventh Prince used three days

334
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,720
to attack Heyuan's granary

335
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,540
with an earth attack.

336
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,980
What are you doing?

337
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,290
If you delay His Highness...

338
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,900
Get to work!

339
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,840
Keep up.

340
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,870
The fire blazed

341
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,510
and the Heyuan people's grains
were burned completely.

342
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,500
Where are the Xuanjia soldiers?

343
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,550
Kill!

344
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,170
Then the Seventh Prince
launched a surprise attack

345
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,630
with the black ribbon as a symbol.

346
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,080
The Xuanjia soldiers
who'd infiltrated Heyuan's army

347
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,290
killed Heyuan's senior generals.

348
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,960
Fang Shiming was furious.

349
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,550
He held the Cold Moon Blade in his hand

350
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,280

under the Seventh Prince's war drum

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,150
went up one against 100

362
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,200

Amazing.

379
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,630
He's really amazing.

380
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,870
Such an arrogant attitude

381
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,630
is truly unprecedented.

382
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,510
Strange.

383
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,150
Why did I just blurt out how

384
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,550
the Seventh Prince took
the enemy general's head

385
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,280
from within a million soldiers

386
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,400
and is so brave and invincible?

387
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,670
Yes.

388
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,240
It's my first time hearing

389
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,360
the stories of Great Jing's God of Death.

390
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,280
But...

391
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,220
I can't help but admiring him,

392
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,870
like I want to kneel by his feet.

393
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,720
What's wrong with me?

394
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,750
I finally understand.

395
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,160
In this world,

396
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,000
no one can escape from

397
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:13,150
his halo as the main character.

398
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,240
It's like this for you characters.

399
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,470
Me too.

400
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,349
My Lady,

401
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,510
give me another chance.

402
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,960
I'll say it well this time.

403
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,720
No need.

404
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,920
I've heard about his brain and brawn.

405
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
Anyway,

406
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,200
his sinister image as the God of Death

407
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,000
is very stable.

408
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,880
Go on.

409
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,790
Go on.

410
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,680
I'd like to hear

411
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,270
what else you can say.

412
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,880
Go ahead.

413
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:40,920
That day,

414
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,430
[Youcheng Execution Ground]

415
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,680
he personally opened the gate

416
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,790
to return to the capital.

417
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,640
-Kneel!
-Kneel!

418
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,200
Criminal Chu Guihong,

419
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,520
you misjudged the enemy
and acted recklessly,

420
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,310
losing three cities at the border

421
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,570
and letting all civilians be massacred.

422
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,000
It's noon.

423
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,590
Execute him!

424
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,310
Jixiang?

425
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,520
The Eighteenth Prince is here too.

426
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,880
[Jixiang, Nan Rui's Attendant]

427
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,880
Jixiang, no!

428
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,680
The horse is deaf.

429
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,110
It won't listen to me.

430
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,510
Cousin, don't be afraid.

431
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,310
I'm here.

432
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,340
No one dares to bully you anymore.

433
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,550
[Eighteenth Prince, Nan Rui]

434
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,560
Heng,

435
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,680
let him go.

436
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,400
What are you waiting for?

437
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,240
What are you doing?

438
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,030
Stand there.

439
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,440
What are you doing?

440
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,500
What are you doing?

441
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Heng, I'm telling you,

442
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,480
Father has ordered

443
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,070
to pardon my cousin.

444
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,830
If you're smart,

445
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,070
let him go right now.

446
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,040
Where is the imperial edict?

447
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,550
Imp...

448
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,960
Imp...

449
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,440
Where is it?

450
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,030
The Chief Secretariat asked for it

451
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,480
and it's being written.

452
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,790
He's on his way here.

453
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,280
That means there isn't one.

454
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,350
Kill!

455
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,120
Don't kill him!

456
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,270
Heng!

457
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,340
Stop!

458
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,710
Seventh Prince,

459
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,160
it's me.

460
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,200
Isn’t this

461
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,310
Mr. Song, the Duke of Guangping,
Vice Minister of Personnel,

462
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,790
and Minister of War?

463
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,640
What took you so long?

464
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,240
I was so worried.

465
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,640
Wait, Mr. Song,

466
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,750
why do you look like this?

467
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,590
Did you run into

468
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,960
bandits on the way?

469
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,160
No, no.

470
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,110
I dressed like this

471
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,830
to observe the people

472
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,450
in disguise.

473
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,570
Last night, the guards reported that

474
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,550
a creepy old beggar

475
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,480
hid in a tavern in the west of the city.

476
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Could it have been

477
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,440
you, Mr. Song?

478
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,020
It turns out that Your Highness
has already made plans.

479
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,710
Sorry for being rude.

480
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,350
Hey,

481
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,400
Mr. Song,

482
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,440
you've been here since last night?

483
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,590
Why did you just show up now?

484
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,440
Well,

485
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,400
I caught a cold last night.

486
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,510
After sleeping all day,

487
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,830
I still feel a little dizzy.

488
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,720
Rui,

489
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,220
don't you understand?

490
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,200
Mr. Song was hiding in the shadows,

491
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
waiting for you to stand up
for Chu Guihong.

492
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,150
Mr. Song,

493
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
don't tell me

494
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,820
you wanted to see me
make a fool of myself in public?

495
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,610
Actually,

496
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,510
Mr. Song

497
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,400
just wanted to see brothers
fight against each other,

498
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,200
then

499
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,380
reap the benefits.

500
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,240
No, no, no.

501
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,310
Why are you...

502
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,550
His Majesty has issued an edict.

503
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,530
Kneel and listen.

504
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,170
As there remain

505
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,230
doubts in the case of Chu Guihong

506
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,690
under your jurisdiction,

507
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,830
he shall be

508
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,500
[Imperial Edict]

509
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,500
brought to the capital

510
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,820
for a separate adjudication.

511
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
Father is wise.

512
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,590
Your Highness,

513
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,070
accept the edict.

514
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,680
I

515
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,920
believe His Majesty's judgment

516
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,030
is unfair.

517
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,970
I can't follow the order.

518
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,200
I...

519
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,260
Your Highness,

520
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,840
are you going against the imperial edict?

521
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,350
When a general is on a campaign,

522
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,400
imperial orders may not be fully obeyed.

523
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,590
That is exactly what

524
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,720
His Majesty worries about.

525
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,200
I

526
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,480
can share his burden.

527
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,880
How so?

528
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,790
As long as His Majesty allows me
to return to the capital,

529
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,070
I'm willing to only bring
my personal soldiers

530
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,880
to personally

531
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,260
escort Chu Guihong to the capital.

532
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,240
Oh no.

533
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,400
My father is involved in this too?

534
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,920
Master was His Majesty's study partner.

535
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,830
His Majesty favors him the most.

536
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,110
Since the late Empress passed away,

537
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,070
His Majesty has been depressed.

538
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:31,830
Apart from meetings,

539
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,830
he rarely sees officials,

540
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,830
but Master is the most trustworthy.

541
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,540
Isn't it good to be a rich
and powerful official?

542
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,140
Why does he have to be involved
with choosing the crown prince?

543
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,720
I want to slack off,

544
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,830
but my teammates hold me back.

545
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,350
From now on,

546
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,680
there is only one rule,

547
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,480
which is to

548
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,110
draw a line with
all the people surnamed Nan.

549
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,320
If you don't want to
die in Nan Heng's hands,

550
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,520
hanging in there

551
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,390
is the most important thing.

552
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,570
[Suzhang Gate]

553
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,070
Run! The God of Death is back!

554
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,630
Prince Qi Nan Heng, commander of
the Xuanjia Army, returned to the capital.

555
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,490
The court and people were in shock.

556
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,590
In the capital,

557
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,740
the emperor favored the son
of the late empress, Prince Teng Nan Rui.

558
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,780
However, Nan Heng and his mother's
Gao family are powerful

559
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,040
His Majesty feared them.

560
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,510
So,

561
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:29,960
since the cavalry entered the city gate,

562
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,680
a bloody storm

563
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,680
was imminent.

564
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,310
Mother, he's going to eat people.

565
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,110
Shush.

566
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,720
The imperial prison is ahead.

567
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,680
Bring him out.

568
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,350
Your Highness, we’ll take him away.

569
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,160
General Chu, you’ve suffered.

570
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,590
General Chu, you’ve suffered.

571
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,000
-You’ve suffered.
-You’ve suffered.

572
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,040
[Disciples of the Chu Family]

573
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,730
General Chu, you’ve suffered.

574
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,160
Quickly get up.

575
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,310
No need to do this.

576
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,850
You safeguarded borders,
achieving numerous victories.

577
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,790
But now,

578
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,400
you were harmed

579
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,850
and ended up like this.

580
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,390
This is a great injustice.

581
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,170
General Chu is innocent!

582
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,440
General Chu is innocent!

583
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,240
Shut up!

584
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,070
Where did these scoundrels

585
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,750
spouting nonsense come from?

586
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:46,030
The hero who defeated
the million Heyuan soldiers

587
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:47,480
is the invincible and heroic

588
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,110
Seventh Prince!

589
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,000
If it weren’t for his wise trick,

590
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,790
Chu Guihong

591
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,000
would've been killed by the Heyuan people.

592
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,200
You wouldn't get to stand up for him now.

593
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,880
A tyrant’s dog barking at a virtuous king,

594
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
spewing filth with every word!

595
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,200
I...

596
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,740
Your Highness,

597
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,680
I understand the "spewing filth" part,

598
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,830
but what does the other part mean?

599
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,410
Be careful, Your Highness!

600
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,030
As expected,

601
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,680
no one cares about me.

602
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,650
Your Majesty,

603
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,970
Seventh Prince has entered the palace.

604
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,430
[Nan Xu, Emperor of Great Jing]

605
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,830
Summon him.

606
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,000
Summoning

607
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,750
the Seventh Prince, Nan Heng,

608
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,070
to have an audience.

609
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,460
Greetings, Your Majesty.

610
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,960
Long live Your Majesty.

611
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,310
Seeing you are healthy,

612
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,160
I am very happy.

613
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,880
Rui.

614
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:52,240
Recently, there is a rumor in the capital.

615
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,240
Have you heard of it?

616
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,440
I don't know.

617
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,510
Please tell me.

618
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,350
Everyone says the God of Death

619
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,720
is ambitious

620
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,670
and colluded with the enemy,

621
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
killed Lord Qianyu by the enemy's hand,

622
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,730
and took the four cities at
the border as his own.

623
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,920
If this is true,

624
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,200
what crime is this?

625
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,550
Colluding with the enemy

626
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,830
is unforgivable.

627
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,640
He deserves to be killed.

628
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,440
Yes.

629
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,550
Your Majesty,

630
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,830
if I really colluded with the enemy,

631
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,410
why would I have killed Fang Shiming,

632
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,750
top Heyuan general, in front of

633
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,160
thousands of people?

634
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,300
Yes, Father.

635
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:42,590
He killed Fang Shiming

636
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,580
and stole his Cold Moon Blade.

637
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,680
I saw the sword

638
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,920
with my own eyes.

639
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,880
It's a rare and valuable sword.

640
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,410
The Cold Moon Blade is real,

641
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,490
but Fang Shiming was a body double, right?

642
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,830
Otherwise,

643
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,510
how could Heyuan's top general

644
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,590
be so weak?

645
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,200
Then...

646
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,310
Deceiving His Majesty

647
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,240
is unforgivable.

648
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,640
He deserves to be killed.

649
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,350
Yes.

650
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,760
Your Majesty,

651
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,310
if I really lied to you,

652
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,350
I wouldn't have dared to
only bring 300 soldiers

653
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,750
to the capital in a hurry.

654
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,200
Yes, Father.

655
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,270
That's all he has.

656
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,310
You can punish him

657
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,000
however

658
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,590
you want.

659
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,400
Even a vicious tiger won't eat its cubs.

660
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,240
Moreover,

661
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,750
his Xuanjia elites

662
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,520
are still guarding the border.

663
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,400
The Qianyu Army, the only army that
can counter the Xuanjia Army,

664
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,130
lost half their soldiers
in the Pingrong Battle.

665
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,440
They haven't regained their strength yet.

666
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:40,900
Then...

667
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,880
Wielding troops to elevate oneself

668
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
is unforgivable.

669
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,280
He deserves to be killed.

670
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,920
Yes.

671
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,040
Your Majesty.

672
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,510
My Xuanjia elites guard the border

673
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,600
to prevent the Heyuan from invading again.

674
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,040
This is also what you agreed to.

675
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,240
The emperor

676
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,570
must keep his word.

677
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

678
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,720
The emperor must keep his word.

679
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,160
Since you've promised him,

680
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,920
how can you go back on your word?

681
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,110
He's already bullying us.

682
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,720
Why are you still defending him?

683
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,400
I...

684
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,270
Isn't he kneeling here?

685
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,590
This counts as bullying?

686
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,720
Can't you see?

687
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,400
Although he kneels,

688
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,240
he stands taller than you.

689
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,920
How is that possible?

690
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,680
Father,

691
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,790
about this matter,

692
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,110
Heng and I have our own advantages.

693
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,160
He has long legs,

694
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,070
but

695
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,270
I have a long torso.

696
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,510
Father, look.

697
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,440
Father, please take a look.

698
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,310
We're the same height when kneeling.

699
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,110
No.

700
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,810
I'm better than him.

701
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,270
You idiot!

702
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,550
We can't be the same height?

703
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,640
Rui,

704
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,910
don’t kneel.

705
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,000
Get up.

706
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,750
Find him a mansion outside the city.

707
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,450
Tell him not to enter the palace
for no reason.

708
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,500
Thank you, Your Majesty.

709
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,550
Father, wait.

710
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,680
You...

711
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,070
You haven't finished painting
the escaping tiger.

712
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,180
Father, look.

713
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,830
Oh, yes.

714
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,440
This painting

715
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,550
is just missing an unsharpened sword.

716
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,400
Since you are so capable,

717
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,000
how about

718
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,550
you add it in for me?

719
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,640
Father,

720
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,350
actually, I can paint
such a trivial thing too.

721
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,480
Painting is soothing

722
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,010
but also lowers ambitions.

723
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,830
I'll ask Song Yude to
teach you historical books

724
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,350
and learn the ways wise rulers

725
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,480
governed their countries.

726
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,960
Okay.

727
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,060
I will work hard!

728
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,130
When a tiger escapes their cage

729
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:14,050
and a treasure is ruined inside its case,

730
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,330
whose fault is it?

731
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,920
Your Highness,

732
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,730
I don't think you need to
worry about this.

733
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,920
Even if the Eighteenth Prince

734
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,310
has Song Yude and Chu Guihong's help,

735
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
he's not your match.

736
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,440
Back then,

737
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,960
you went to the battlefield alone at 16

738
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,160
and became famous with one battle.

739
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,350
At 17, you pacified the rebellion in Shu.

740
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,030
At 18, you recovered the western border.

741
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,550
At 19, you killed Dongshuo's top general.

742
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,400
May I ask

743
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,460
which prince has such achievements?

744
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,070
Besides,

745
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,750
Chancellor Gao

746
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,960
is your uncle.

747
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,880
He's going to the Huai region to
do disaster relief in your name.

748
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,640
Your reputation will...

749
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,240
Enough.

750
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,440
How much do you know

751
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,960
about Song Yude?

752
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,720
Well...

753
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,920
I don't know much about him.

754
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,640
I only know that he's the head
of the six ministries.

755
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,510

763
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,310
He only wants to take care of himself.

764
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,640

765
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,620

anything to do with Rui.

785
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,460
If she entered your residence
in the future,

786
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,000
her father would help you,

787
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,070
even if it was for

788

791
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,040
is the eldest daughter of the Song family.

not only is she alive and well,

798
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,670
but also developed a pretentious

799
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,360

00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,360
it will be bad.

944
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,360
Jixiang,

945
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,310
do you see that?

946
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,550
Those two ladies were so smart.

947
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,800
They know I've always kept a low profile

948
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,260
and don't like to show off.

949
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,320
Not bad.

950
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,400
Yes.

951
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,360
I came here

952
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,320
for the Song family's two daughters.

953
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,190
It wouldn't be good if I

954
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,860
got involved with others.

955
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,640
By the way, Jixiang,

956
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,590
did you see the Song family's daughters?

957
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:44,450
Where are they?

958
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,670
It's the Second Miss of the Song family!

959
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,440
The famous Second Miss

960
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,190
lives up to her reputation.

961
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:25,510
Seeing beautiful women makes one
forget all worries.

962
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,550
Xiang,

963
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,800
it's time to give her

964
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,800
a chance to approach me.

965
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,510
His Highness ordered

966
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,110
to invite you over for a chat.

967
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,070
The Seventh Prince ordered

968
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,920
you must be brought to him today.

969
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,570
Gentlemen, here's the thing.

970
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:47,280
I have diarrhea today.

971
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,800
If I act out of hand
in front of His Highness,

972
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,230
that won't be good, right?

973
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm sorry.

974
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,400
I need to go to the toilet.

975
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,190
I don't dare to disobey

976
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,190
His Highness's order.

977
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,880
Miss.

978
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,760
Please.

979
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,670
Second Miss,

980
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,920
I am 18 years old

981
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,650
and good at writing and poetry.

982
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,590
I'm from the Zhao family,
a wealthy family in Jin.

983
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,390
I have countless grand mansion.

984
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,360
Having mansions is nothing.

985
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,150
My parents died last year.

986
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,800
If you are willing to marry me,

987
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,400
you'll have no family drama.

988
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,280
This woman is a player.

989
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,930
She's not a good match.

990
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,400
Xiang,

991
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,710
you should

992
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,550
listen to me about love.

993
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,840
The more competitors there are,

994
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,800
the more it shows that
I'm the best

995
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,030
among all.

996
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:36,750
[Improve Daily]

997
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,150
Isn’t this Song Yiting,

998
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,320
daughter of Mr. Song,
Duke of Guangping, Vice Minister of the

999
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,720
Ministry of Personnel and Minister of War?

1000
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,070
You are extraordinary.

1001
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:39,840
I

1002
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,500
admire you very much.

1003
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:43,730
Greetings, Your Highness.

1004
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,330
Greetings, Your Highness.

1005
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:50,650
As the saying goes,

1006
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,360
a famous flower for a beauty.

1007
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,630
I am Nan Rui,

1008
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,150
meaning "auspicious kirin and phoenix."

1009
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,110
When I was born,

1010
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,360
there were auspicious clouds.

1011
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,670
It was an auspicious sign.

1012
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,480
Thus, I was named

1013
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,400
Nan Rui.

1014
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,320
I wonder

1015
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,630
if I can

1016
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,440
invite you for a chat?

1017
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,740
Your Highness,

1018
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,880
I

1019
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,480
don't like chrysanthemums.

1020
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,230
No?

1021
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,110
It's okay.

1022
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,000
No?

1023
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,070
Still no?

1024
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,710
Sorry.

1025
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,000
I took the wrong one.

1026
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,400
I have it in other colors.

1027
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,830
Your Highness.

1028
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,820
A chrysanthemum is a chrysanthemum.

1029
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,230
No matter the color,

1030
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,480
I won't like it.

1031
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,280
What I like

1032
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,030
is a heroic man,

1033
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,120
instead of a prince born into nobility.

1034
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,590
Goodbye.

1035
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,280
I...

1036
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,590
No, I am a heroic man!

1037
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,880
Get to know me!

1038
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,920
Judging from the situation,

1039
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,850
they're dragging me into the plot.

1040
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,550
No.

1041
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,710
I'll die here

1042
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,030
if I see Nan Heng.

1043
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,760
It's only been a few days.

1044
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,840
My good days have just begun.

1045
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,960
Isn't this Ling Meishi?

1046
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,440
The cast list said that
she plays Jia Ruru.

1047
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,960
She's always looked down on Song Yimeng.

1048
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,920
I must fight fire with fire.

1049
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,820
Everyone is moving the plot along now.

1050
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,320
Jia Ruru is the antagonist.

1051
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,320
I can use her to stop the plot.

1052
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,510
Why am I so unlucky?

1053
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,590
As soon as I came out,

1054
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,400
I met such an annoying person.

1055
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,900
[Jia Ruru, 1st Daughter of
Imperial College's Dean]

1056
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,670
Song Yimeng.

1057
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,840
What's wrong today?

1058
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:40,190
Usually when we meet,

1059
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:41,850
you're either crying or sick.

1060
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:44,230
Why are you talking like this today?

1061
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,960
Xuanjia Army?

1062
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,130
The Seventh Prince's men.

1063
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,320
I'll be frank with you.

1064
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,070
Today,

1065
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:56,550
the Seventh Prince invited me here.

1066
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,630
Are you crazy?

1067
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,400
How dare you flirt
with the Seventh Prince?

1068
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,480
What can I do about it?

1069
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,320
In the past,

1070
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,280
Chu Guihong wanted to marry me.

1071
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,150
Now,

1072
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,210
the Seventh Prince wants to marry me.

1073
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,230
Tell me, why am I

1074
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:13,880
so lucky?

1075
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,760
Lucky?

1076
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,770
I don't think you'll survive.

1077
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,620
Why don't you play by the book?

1078
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,510
Shouldn't we do some palace intrigue now?

1079
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:24,320
Jia Ruru.

1080
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,840
Aren't you angry?

1081
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,760
Don't you want to drag me
to some dark room

1082
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,800
and beat me up?

1083
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,050
What palace? What intrigue?

1084
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,980
Do you have a fever?

1085
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,740
All you think about is making trouble.

1086
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,960
We are in the palace.

1087
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,630
Be careful of being flogged.

1088
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,230
I haven't finished yet.

1089
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,030
Jia Ruru,

1090
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,030
won't you consider

1091
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,710
locking me up in a dark room

1092
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,070
and beating me up?

1093
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:01,520
What's going on?

1094
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:03,000
Why aren't they moving?

1095
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:12,190
Help! The script is killing me!
