I know you must find it

19
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,740
puzzling.

23
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,430
He'll pull one foot back at the doorsill

no records of Qianyu Army
being deployed last night.

Shanhu asked his friends
in relevant fields

Aren't we going to discuss
something important about Lord Qianyu?

Don't you think it's a bit too early

look.

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,250
I'm right, aren't I?

57
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,280
That's because I've experienced

58
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,910
all of today's events twice.

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,870

So,

happen as scheduled,

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
I have a question.

96
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,000
Would things repeatedly happen

It does exist.

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,600
Song Yimeng experienced it

105
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,240
At that time,

she kept getting married.

107
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,680
Things started all over after she died.

108
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,190
In our words, it is called

109
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,250
"stuck with a bug."

110
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,650
Things started again after she died?

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,480
Back then,

112
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,830
didn't she consistently
try to avoid Nan Heng

113
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,720
and marry you?

114
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
But the story disallowed it,

115
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
so she died and was reborn

116
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,390
many times.

Reborn.

119
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,560
Then she experienced

120
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,270
the same events
at that given point in time repeatedly?

121
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes.

When she is reborn,

124
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,300
will she have the memories
of her past lives?

Memories?

If that's the case,

130
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,830

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,960
Red tangerines were

194
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
Her Majesty's favorite.

195
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,120
were Her Majesty's favorite.

196
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,240
At this time every year,

197
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,200
the Eighteenth Prince

198
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
and Your Majesty would eat
red tangerines together

199
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,320
in memory of the late Empress.

200
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,480
How come I feel Heng has said it here too?

201
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,600
Not many people in the palace
know about this.

202
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,910
My guess is

203
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,840
that the plotter

204
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,550
must be

205
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,080
very close to Your Majesty

206
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,610
and the Eighteenth Prince.

207
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,910
Chu Guihong,

208
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,100
what are you implying?

209
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,850
How dare you!

210
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,080
You're hurling

211
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,360
a baseless accusation at the crown prince!

212
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:07,870
Yeah.

213
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,480
Guihong,

214
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,120
Heng is the crown prince now.

215
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,320
He has no reason to poison Father...

216
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,270
So what?

217
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,150
He has diabolical ambitions.

218
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,510
Out of fear of being replaced

219
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,480
if His Majesty changes his mind,

220
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,810
the crown prince might take a precaution.

221
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,670
Your Majesty,

222
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,010
this could be a rebellion.

223
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,030
To avoid further turmoil,

224
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,860
Your Majesty had better stay
in the bed chamber.

225
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,440
I'll bring Qianyu Army

226
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,960
into the palace to safeguard Your Majesty.

227
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,760
Chu Guihong,

228
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,700
are you trying to confine me here?

229
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,120
Protecting the sovereign

230
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,590
is my duty as an officer.

231
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:17,900
[Huanning Hall]

232
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,150
We're late.

233
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,360
The Emperor has ordered

234
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,550
to relieve the Imperial Guards.

235
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,180
Have this place guarded now.

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,720
Without my permission,

237
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,780
no one can be admitted to the chamber.

238
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,150
If there are violators,

239
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,750
kill them.

240
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,270
Got it.

241
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,550
Remember,

242
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,880
do whatever it takes to make him write

243
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,560
an imperial edict to eradicate Nan Heng.

244
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,870
Rest assured, General.

245
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,470
I'll get the imperial edict.

246
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,910
Last time,

247
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,510
he took action ahead of time.

248
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,430
Why is he doing it again now?

249
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,660
Qianyu Army

250
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,130
has quickly taken control of the palace.

251
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Is the Emperor...

252
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,270
We must find out a way

253
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,530
to rescue the Emperor.

254
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,240
H-Heng...

255
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,040
Heng!

256
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,910
Heng!

257
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,240
I...

258
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,840
Why are you here?

259
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,440
When Father attracted their attention,

260
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,970
I snuck out of the hall
through a hole for dogs.

261
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,320
That's the whole story.

262
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,100
He must've gone crazy!

263
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,070
He boldly confined the Emperor?

264
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,870
This is bad.

265
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,650
We must rescue Father now.

266
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,870
Heng,

267
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,670
listen,

268
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,750
before I escaped,

269
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,030
Father reminded me

270
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,750
to warn you

271
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,550
not to act rashly.

272
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,120
He will

273
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,270
try stalling for time.

274
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,480
Father also said,

275
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,480
my cousin...

276
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,670
Chu Guihong

277
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,670
is eager to get
an imperial edict to attack you.

278
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,670
Going out there now

279
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,670
is handing yourself over, isn't it?

280
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
He's right.

281
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,720
The first time the Emperor got in danger,

282
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
many people in the palace witnessed

283
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,790
Nan Rui

284
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,790
feeding him poisonous tangerines.

285
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,870
But things are different this time.

286
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,050
A street vendor's testimony alone

287
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,960
can hardly convince everyone.

288
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,600
What?

289
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,030
It...

290
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,320
When did I ever poison my father?

291
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,720
It was done by Chu Guihong.

292
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,780
He just framed you.

293
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,330
Chu Guihong put poison in the tangerines?

294
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,000
That's impossible.

295
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,360
H-H-He...

296
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,760
How could he have done it?

297
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,270
It was he who stopped Father
from eating the tangerines.

298
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,080
Right.

299
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,600
What made Chu Guihong
change his plan this time?

300
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,550
He has

301
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,910
either predicted our action,

302
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,960
or...

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,240
Is he also part of the unlimited flow now?

304
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,270
Does he have any memories

305
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,510
of the last two occasions?

306
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,440
Definitely not.

307
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,640
Then he must have

308
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,150
got some information in advance,

309
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,390
which changed his mind.

310
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,320
But his ultimate goal remains.

311
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,030
What "unlimited flow"?

312
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,490
It is to kill you in person.

313
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,120
Wait.

314
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,720
Why is this all so befuddling?

315
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,550
What do you mean

316
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,480
by "unlimited flow"?

317
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,790
What... I...

318
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,440
I know each word,

319
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,200
but I'm puzzled

320
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,120
when they combine.

321
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,600
We'll explain it to you later.

322
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
Now, I'll ask Fugui to send

323
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,630
you and my mother

324
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,290
to the Waning River Crescent.

325
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,980
Okay.

326
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,630
We lost on the previous two occasions

327
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,690
due to the lack of military strength.

328
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,000
This time,

329
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,470
I'm going to meet someone first.

330
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,470
[Righteousness]

331
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,640
Stop!

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,720
You've secretly transferred
Qianyu Army to the capital.

333
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,600
Why do you still need the command token?

334
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,480
As I told you,

335
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,030
I must change my fate.

336
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,480
What don't you understand?

337
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,670
After finishing all the iconic scenes,

338
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,910
I'll write a new ending

339
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,720
to your satisfaction!

340
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,850
No need to go the extra length, Father.

341
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,510
If I become the next emperor,

342
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,760
you'll be the Imperial Father.

343
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,630
The cold palace
where Nan Heng used to be confined

344
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,150
must be familiar to you.

345
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,000
Would you like to

346
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,440
spend the rest of your life there?

347
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,530
Chu Guihong!

348
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,150
You promised to let me
go back to the modern times!

349
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,610
-You...
-If you do go back,

350
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,030
my fate will fall in the palm
of your hand again, won it?

351
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,670
You...

352
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,030
From now on,

353
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,600
only I can decide my fate.

354
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,020
If you don't want
to live in the cold palace--

355
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,600
in the script, Nan Heng turns Song Yimeng

356
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,030
into a mutilated living corpse,
doesn't he?

357
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,810
How do you like it if you end up

358
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,550
that way?

359
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,820
Stay!

360
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,490
Guards!

361
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,000
I need help!

362
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,000
Guards!

363
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,330
Help me!

364
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,240
Hurry.

365
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,960
Take Chu...

366
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,390
I am Lord Qianyu.

367
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,450
What are you doing?

368
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,320
Take him away.

369
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,600
Chu Guihong,

370
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,680
you crazy man!

371
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,840
I curse you!

372
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,670
When I go back,

373
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,120
I'll make you die in the script

374
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,240
a thousand times!

375
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,320
Too bad

376
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,240
that you can never go back.

377
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm Lord Qianyu.

378
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
How dare you defy me?

379
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,840
Move!

380
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,480
Let go of me!

381
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,210
Keep moving!

382
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm Lord Qianyu!

383
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,750
You...

384
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,380
Nan Heng!

385
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
Don't yell.

386
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,200
Nan Heng,

387
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,200
Chu Guihong has gone crazy.

388
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,150
He placed 5,000 soldiers outside the city.

389
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,870
Precisely at nine tonight,

390
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,070
they'll besiege you.

391
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,200
If you don't want to die,

392
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,360
quickly finish the iconic scenes
with Song Yimeng.

393
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,030
When I'm back to...

394
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,290
Still thinking about the iconic scenes?

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,130
Do you know you've already died twice?

396
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,590
I've died twice?

397
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,320
When?

398
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,030
According to Song Yimeng,

399
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,380
First,

400
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,000
Rong Hua killed you.

401
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,840
Then,

402
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,000
Chu Guihong killed you.

403
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,800
It was I who collected your body.

404
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,250
That reincarnation thing is true.

405
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,810
I'm telling you,

406
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,349
a new round of reincarnation has begun.

407
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,680
If you want to survive,

408
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,240
collaborate with me

409
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,720
to fight Chu Guihong.

410
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,530
Fight Chu Guihong?

411
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,920
Are you out of your mind?

412
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,240
I'm just a screenwriter.

413
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,960
I know how to type,

414
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,089
but not how to fight.

415
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,970
You looked down on us
fictional characters, didn't you?

416
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,680
I...

417
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,080
Weren't you omnipotent?

418
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:34,890
How about this?

419
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,070
You're here already.

420
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,030
Might as well make this visit count,

421
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,720
right?

422
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,880
Help me out of here.

423
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,030
I'll hide somewhere.

424
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,070
Then, you guys can
proceed to political struggles

425
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,030
or fights.

426
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,720
I won't hold you back, okay?

427
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,310
Hide somewhere?

428
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,270
This is a critical time.

429
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,400
Are you even a man?

430
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,850
Don't be so mean.

431
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,200
I'm just pointing out my incompetence,

432
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,920
aren't I?

433
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm a tiny screenwriter,

434
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,550
not the male lead.

435
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,270
These glorious moments
of fighting and killing

436
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,800
should be reserved for you.

437
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,110
Nan Heng.

438
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,450
Heng...

439
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,310
My dearest Heng,

440
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,350
I've already had a hard time

441
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,790
in reality because of you.

442
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,510
I-In the script world,

443
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,400
please spare me from trouble.

444
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,270
Cut the crap.

445
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,030
I...

446
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,720
No matter who you are,

447
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,100
you can only be Lord Qianyu today.

448
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,850
Lord Qianyu?

449
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,450
Have some water.

450
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,590
Thank you.

451
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,270
Nan Heng,

452
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,490
how are you holding up?

453
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,790
If you really can't manage...

454
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,510
Don't worry.

455
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,880
I...

456
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,060
I'm coping well.

457
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,300
Don’t tell me you can die

458
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,060
and let reincarnation happen again

459
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,340
if the worst happens.

460
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,510
Listen,

461
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,240
this time,

462
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,240
I won’t let you get hurt.

463
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,120
But Chu Guihong commands

464
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,830
5,000 soldiers now.

465
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,880
Lord Qianyu hasn't agreed to help us yet.

466
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,210
What do you have
to fight Chu Guihong with?

467
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
Don't tell me you can count on

468
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,240
your plot armor as the male lead.

469
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,580
As you said, I'm the male lead.

470
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,450
The male lead has to

471
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,750
come up with

472
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,210
certain solutions
that only he can think of.

473
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
What's your plan?

474
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,110
My uncle told me before his execution

475
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,310
that he had 3,000 private soldiers
outside the city.

476
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,510
I have 3,000 private soldiers

477
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,270
stationing outside the city in secret.

478
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,550
Once Your Highness gives an order,

479
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,350
they'll raid the capital
from inside and outside.

480
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,350
The capital prefecture's office
has failed attempt to find this troop.

481
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,160
Therefore,

482
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,700
I asked Yao Qian
to lead the Nightwalkers

483
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,110
to look for clues.

484
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,440
They'll search every corner
on the outskirts

485
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,170
till these soldiers are found.

486
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,110
But it was you who revealed
Chancellor Gao's crimes.

487
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,440
Will his private soldiers

488
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,700
follow your commands?

489
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,350
I had Yao Qian take
a crown prince's edict with him.

490
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,240
These soldiers can choose to hide

491
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,030
and conceal their identities forever,

492
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,750
or to make amends by following me

493
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,880
to quell the unrest.

494
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
I believe most of them

495
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,700
will go for the latter.

496
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,030
The more people join us,

497
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,820
the higher the odds of us winning.

498
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,880
More people?

499
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,670
Perhaps

500
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,090
before your uncle's private soldiers
enter the capital,

501
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,550
we can recruit some people

502
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,770
and have them stall Chu Guihong for us.

503
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,960
What people?

504
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,560
Officials.

505
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,720
People from the martial arts world.

506
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,960
Residents in the capital.

507
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,360
They can all be our aides.

508
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,590
I-I'm having a stomachache.

509
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,270
Jia Ruru,

510
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:52,350
please hear me out.

511
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,000
Y-You...

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,980
Mrs. Li,

513
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,170
why wouldn't he help us?

514
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,960
Yunlong and I

515
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,590
even offered him a luminous pearl.

516
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,720
This big.

517
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,790
To fear is human.

518
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,590
The idea of fighting Chu Guihong

519
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:13,120
who holds a large army,
scares them even more.

520
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,120
I wish there were helpers from thin air.

521
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,790
Mrs. Li!

522
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,070
Mrs. Li.

523
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,030
Mrs. Shangguan

524
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,240
and Mr. Song are here.

525
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,000
Dad!

526
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,590
Yimeng,

527
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,510
what's the emergency?

528
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,110
Why did you tell us to come?

529
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,400
Let's talk over there.

530
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,030
Come on.

531
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,590
The Eighteenth Prince is here as well?

532
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,920
Nan Heng needs to
explain something to him.

533
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,110
I just hope he won't faint

534
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,160
upon hearing Heng's words.

535
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,960
Faint?

536
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,560
What exactly is going on?

537
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,080
Jixiang,

538
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,640
they must've reached the part
about the script world.

539
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,510
When I first heard it,

540
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,070
I reacted the same way.

541
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,590
Now, they must be
talking about the reincarnation.

542
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,120
This beautiful world
is filled with wonders.

543
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,220
Ignorant people are easily shocked.

544
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,440
The Eighteenth Prince and you

545
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,560
seldom travel far.

546
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,840
It's understandable for people

547
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,310
with scanty information like you

548
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,720
not to know these bizarre things.

549
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,380
Hope you don't feel inferior.

550
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,250
[Jixiang]

551
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,720
I've said too much.

552
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,800
You need time to process it.

553
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,210
Though Chu Guihong
has set you up three times,

554
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:41,140
his real target has always been me.

555
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,070
If

556
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,860
you can't bring yourself to fight him,

557
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,860
-I will...
-Heng.

558
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,350
Look,

559
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,590
you died so many times.

560
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,590
You must've been in a lot of pain.

561
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,310
This is all my fault.

562
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,350
When I first bought
those red tangerines,

563
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,110
if I had discovered the poison in them...

564
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,750
No.

565
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,680
I shouldn't have bought
those red tangerines at all.

566
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,440
Wait.

567
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,370
Do you understand what I'm saying?

568
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,440
I do.

569
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,610
Thoroughly and completely.

570
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
You're saying

571
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,830
that the Nightwalkers and you

572
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,160
will lure Chu Guihong's rebel forces
to the South City

573
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,070
to create a chance for me

574
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,200
to lead 300 Xuanjia soldiers

575
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
to charge into the palace
to rescue Father.

576
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,750
But, Heng,

577
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,750
we only have a small number of soldiers.

578
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,960
You've been defeated by Chu Guihong twice.

579
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,920
What if

580
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,060
you die again?

581
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,440
But we've gone this far now.

582
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,920
I...

583
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,000
I have an idea.

584
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,930
See if you find it feasible.

585
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
I'll lead Xuanjia Army to lie in ambush

586
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,040
in the South City in advance,

587
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,720
while you lure Chu Guihong
to go there alone.

588
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
Once he falls into our trap,

589
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,790
I'll suddenly appear from nowhere.

590
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,920
He'll be thrown into utter panic

591
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,880
and erupt into fury.

592
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,830
We'll be able to change our fate
when that happens.

593
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,400
Isn't it a good idea?

594
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,240
Not at all.

595
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,470
Heng,

596
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,160
you can count on me, your brother!

597
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,660
Stop with that gibberish.

598
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,690
Just do as I say.

599
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,680
I'll head to the South City.

600
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,830
You'll storm the palace.

601
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,790
But...

602
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,860
Without you...

603
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,900
If I do it alone, I'm afraid...

604
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Those 300 Xuanjia soldiers
will be with you, right?

605
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,890
Plus, that great fighter

606
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,680
Jixiang will await you in the palace.

607
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,410
I'm sure you can rescue Father.

608
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,750
Don't worry.

609
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,830
Nan Rui,

610
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,070
you are my brother.

611
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,880
You can definitely do

612
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,590
what I can,

613
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,520
or even perform better than me.

614
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,260
Besides, don't forget

615
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,720
that you are heaven's chosen one

616
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,140
and Great Jing's symbol
of good fortune.

617
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,200
Okay.

618
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,770
I'll protect the palace.

619
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,600
You'll protect the capital.

620
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,640
The two of us

621
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,350
will definitely survive this time.

622
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,440
What did you say?

623
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,450
Chu Guihong is going to start a coup?

624
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,200
In less than six hours,

625
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
Qianyu rebels

626
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,330
will enter the capital.

627
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,720
How is that possible?

628
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,200
Lord Qianyu is reputed for his loyalty.

629
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,800
Why would he allow his son
to rise in rebellion?

630
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,590
Dad,

631
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,850
I don't have time

632
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,730
to explain everything to you.

633
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,510
But we must

634
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,000
stop Chu Guihong now.

635
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,480
Otherwise, Nan Heng, his people

636
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,940
and the entire Song family
will be in danger.

637
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,750
My goodness.

638
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,380
What can we do?

639
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,560
Alright.

640
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,830
Say no more.

641
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,660
It's just that this matter...

642
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,810
I...

643
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,480
Dad,

644
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,920
if Great Jing is in jeopardy,

645
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,350
will you brave all dangers

646
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,710
to protect the country?

647
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,160
This is my obligation.

648
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,100
I'll resolutely fulfill my duty.

649
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,720
That's enough.

650
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,680
Yiting,

651
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,510
what about you?

652
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,530
Will you do it too?

653
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,310
No need to give me lectures on morals.

654
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,110
I will go

655
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,350
wherever you go.

656
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,160
Madam,

657
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,540
what about you?

658
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,240
M-Me?

659
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,700
I...

660
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,880
I...

661
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,200
I'm gutless and afraid of death.

662
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,240
I'm weak and...

663
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,090
You show great strength

664
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,480
when you hit me.

665
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,070
Can...

666
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,350
can that be the same thing?

667
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,960
Cut it out.

668
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,830
Tsk.

669
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,850
What about you guys?

670
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,720
It's okay.

671
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,600
If you are afraid,

672
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,830
you may leave now.

673
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,790
I won't force you to stay.

674
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,880
Let's go!

675
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,110
They...

676
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,310
They really left?

677
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,370
There are only the four of us now.

678
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,280
Nonetheless,

679
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,480
every new helper

680
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,270
represents new hope.

681
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,350
Right?

682
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,160
Your Highness!

683
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,020
Your Highness!

684
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,540
Your Highness, we'll all go with you.

685
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,400
I'll make those who dare to hurt

686
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,680
the Song family pay a price!

687
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,270
This

688
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,070
can't move fast.

689
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,530
I'll go get some more rods.

690
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,740
Where did you get all these?

691
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,880
They were lying around
in the Waning River Crescent's Hall.

692
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,000
Put them down now.

693
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm not planning to send you
onto the battlefield.

694
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,920
Yimeng,

695
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,930
what are you planning for us then?

696
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,960
I'm taking you lot to the South City

697
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,360
to join the Nightwalkers

698
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,920
in stallling Chu Guihong,

699
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,920
so he can't unite
with Qianyu reinforcements in time.

700
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:09,120
[Clear Waters and Serene Woods]

701
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,610
Your Highness,

702
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,480
you gave me a drink
before a battle starts.

703
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,160
It means you're discarding me.

704
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,960
How could Your Highness be so cruel to me?

705
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,530
How am I discarding you?

706
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,510
I'm simply letting you
accompany Rui to the palace.

707
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,370
Your Highness,

708
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,440
whenever you're up
for an important mission,

709
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,550
you'd always discard me

710
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,280
and bring Chu He along instead.

711
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,180
Your Highness,

712
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,920
Lord Qianyu is his godfather.

713
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,830
Chu He might harm you!

714
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,350
Let me ask you.

715
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,120
Who is the Emperor to me?

716
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,270
Your father.

717
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,680
What about Rui?

718
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,590
Your brother.

719
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,640
I'm assigning you to protect
my father and brother.

720
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,770
Yet you think of it as a trivial matter?

721
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,010
Your Highness, do you mean

722
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,110
I'm more important than Chu He?

723
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,720
It's unnecessary
to compare yourself with others.

724
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,920
Over all these years,

725
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,400
we've braved many deadly dangers together.

726
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,240
In my heart,

727
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,530
you're already my family.

728
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,320
Do you understand?

729
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,960
Rest assured, Your Highness.

730
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,160
I will complete this important task

731
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,420
Your Highness gave me.

732
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,660
Your Highness,

733
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,430
I'm heading to protect
your father-in-law and brother-in-law.

734
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,510
Guys,

735
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,710
[Big Fortune]

736
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,510
I'm not bragging here.

737
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,880
When I was only 15 years old,

738
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,720
I met a gang of bandits in the woods

739
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,480
on the outskirts of the capital.

740
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,750
Guess what?

741
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,880
I stood up to them...

742
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,270
I beat down ten of them on my own

743
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,730
and didn't get hurt at all.

744
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,660
How impressive.

745
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,120
You think that's a remarkable achievement?

746
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,240
Shanhu,

747
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,750
when I was being chased after

748
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,920
by officers and soldiers
in Jiangnan Province,

749
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,350
I defeated 100 enemies and safely escaped.

750
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,400
100?

751
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,400
100!

752
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,490
That's amazing.

753
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,350
Yunlong,

754
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,570
how many people can you fight at a time?

755
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,200
One.

756
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:06,140
Yunlong, you're seldom this humble.

757
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,530
I only have one target now-- Chu Guihong.

758
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,610
He's considered
as Great Jing's God of War.

759
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,000
Just leave him to Chief.

760
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,390
We should

761
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,830
stay out of it.

762
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,870

763
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,190
[Big Fortune]

764
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,440
are you slacking off again?

765
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,720
Mrs. Shangguan,

766
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,440
I'm going out to dig for information.

767
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,240
You guys talk.

768
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,400
Have you done the preparation

769
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,200
for the ambush against Qianyu Army?

770
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:27,640
Hurry up.

771
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,310
Go get it done!

772
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,350
[Big Fortune]

773
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,200
Don't stick around here.

774
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,960
Hurry!

775
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,960
Move!

776
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,530
Come on.

777
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,590
What's in it?

778
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,110
Wedding apparel.

779
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,440
Wedding apparel?

780
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,660
For whom?

781
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,640
We're getting married?

782
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,350
Right now?

783
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,640
Right here?

784
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,110
Shouldn't our wedding include

785
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,050
proper rituals

786
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,340
and our friends and family?

787
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,240
I don't care for

788

790
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Our marriage

791
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,330
is only about you and me.

792
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,800
Since you truly want to marry me,

793
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,870
we might as well get married today.

794
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,790
Yiting,

795
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,440
if I can come back alive,

796
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:09,510
the first thing I'll do is marry you.

797
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,300
Yimeng told me

798
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,850
that men who make promises of that kind

799
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,440
would usually end up

800
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,720
tragically.

801
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,920
The tombs of some of them

802
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,320
are even nowhere to find.

803
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,110

00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,270
Today,

805
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,330
I will

806
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,120
either become your wife,

807
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,210
or...

808
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,720
cut your hair off

809
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,850
and tie it with mine.

810
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,070
As our hair strands entwine,

811
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,000
nothing can part this love divine.

812
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,910
Let the sky and earth be our witnesses.

813
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,240
We vow to the sun and moon

814
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,110
before this red knot

815
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,040
that we will be partners for life.

816
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,480
Song Yiting,

817
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,590
do you take me, Shangguan He,
to be your husband?

818
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,750
From now on...

819
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,430
No.

820
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:05,640
You don't want to get married now?

821
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,590
I mean,

822
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,630
that is not a good enough vow.

823
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,960
Isn't that a common wedding vow?

824
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,470
Let me take care of it.

825
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,620
Shangguan He,

826
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,260

827
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,890
to be your lifelong partner?

828

830
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,200

832
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,030

00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,960

something said by the screenwriter.
