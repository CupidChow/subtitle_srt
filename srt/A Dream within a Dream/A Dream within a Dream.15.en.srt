[A Dream Within A Dream]

00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,910
[Episode 15]

3
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,350
I'm Song Yimeng.

4
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

5
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,400
Kneel.

6
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,080
It's late,

7
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,190
and I'm tired.

8
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,320
So I won't beat around the bush.

9
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,550
You're already engaged,

10
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,750
yet you're tangled up with a prince,

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,120
even pitting Rui and Heng
against each other.

12
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,650
Tell me.

13
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,750
What exactly are you
and your family plotting?

14
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,230
Your Majesty,

15
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,450
please don't misunderstand.

16
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,000
My father raised me to steer clear

17
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,280
of political factions.

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
My engagement to Chu Guihong

19
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,240
was arranged years ago.

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,890
The rumors about the Seventh Prince and me

21
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,560
are completely baseless.

22
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,620
[Exceptional Love]

23
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,450
You're a woman,

24
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,540
and women should have womanly virtues.

25
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,150
Since you're engaged,

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,400
you should

27
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,550
stay at home,

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,630
do some embroidery,

29
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,080
and read a book or two.

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,590
You dressed to the nines

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,060
for the fancy banquet in the capital.

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,240
You just wanted
to attract attention, didn't you?

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,970
Not everything that goes wrong

34
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,280
is a woman's fault.

35
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,870
What a sharp tongue!

36
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
Today, two princes drew swords
against each other

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,280
all because of you.

38
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,120
Everyone saw it,

39
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,079
and you're still trying to deny it.

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,560
Are you trying to start

41
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,560
a war between the two princes?

42
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,030
Take her away

43
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,360
and give her 20 strokes.

44
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,000
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,840
Your Majesty!

46
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,560
Hold on!

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,740
Your Highness,

48
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,079
what are you doing

49
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,010
barging into the Imperial Study?

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,600
Your Majesty,

51
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,170
everything that happened

52
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,800
was entirely my fault.

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,030
I knew

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,730
she was already engaged,

55
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,060
but I still pursued her.

56
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,950
I was the one
who had those books made

57
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,360
and circulated.

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,850
I also begged Mother

59
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,310
to issue a marriage decree

60
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,130
for us.

61
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,870
I didn't set you up.

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,770
The marriage decree came from Mother.

63
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,370
What's that got to do with me?

64
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,000
None of this
has anything to do with Miss Song.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,950
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,650
please punish me instead.

67
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,310
Very well.

68
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,430
In these 28 years,

69
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,560
my seventh son

70
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,000
has never

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,140
made a single mistake—

72
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,870
flawless in every way,

73
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,990
not once

74
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,220
giving anyone anything to use against him.

75
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,020
Yet now here you are,
kneeling and admitting guilt

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,310
all for the sake of a woman.

77
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,120
Fine.

78
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,120
Then tell me.

79
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,270
Aside from the Song family behind her,

80
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,070
what makes her so special?

81
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,630
Your Majesty,
you loved the late Empress

82
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,890
not because of the Chu family behind her.

83
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,680
How dare you speak out of turn

84
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,920
about the Emperor?

85
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,560
Listen,

86
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,070
her engagement was arranged long ago.

87
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,810
It cannot be changed!

88
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,630
Be it ruler or subject,

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,480
in this world,

90
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,420
everyone must follow the rules.

91
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,830
I wouldn't dare to break the rules.

92
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,950
You wouldn't dare?

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,950
You drew your sword against Rui

94
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,510
at the musical banquet.

95
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,420
How was that following the rules?

96
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,230
It was because

97
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,430
he insulted the Gao family

98
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,590
and my mother.

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,800
The law of Great Jing makes it clear:

100
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,120
those who turn on their own kin

101
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,980
must be imprisoned and executed.

102
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,120
But today,

103
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,700
I won't kill you.

104
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,380
The hand you used

105
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,600
to dislocate Rui's arm—

106
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,950
cut it off.

107
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,510
What?

108
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,720
You want to

109
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,040
defy my order?

110
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,610
This is treason!

111
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,420
Your Majesty,

112
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,290
everything that happened today

113
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,540
was my fault.

114
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,930
His Highness had nothing to do with it.

115
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,240
Besides,

116
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,700
the Eighteenth Prince
also wounded the Seventh Prince.

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
What's this?

118
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,830
You're a prince,

119
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,400
and now you're scared

120
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,870
and need a woman to plead for you?

121
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,720
Your Majesty,

122
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,960
as you wish.

123
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,820
Your Highness.

124
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,390
[Exceptional Love]

125
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,690
Your Highness!

126
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,520
No, Your Highness!

127
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,820
I was just joking.

128
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,890
Why take it so seriously?

129
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,850
Or do you want the whole world

130
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,850
to call me a cruel tyrant
who maimed his own son?

131
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,510
I…

132
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,049
I wouldn't dare.

133
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,520
Your Majesty.

134
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,919
Your Majesty,

135
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,130
the Noble Consort fainted in her chambers.

136
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,560
She's delirious

137
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,960
and keeps calling for

138
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,390
the Seventh Prince and Miss Song.

139
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,520
Your Majesty,

140
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,630
I'll answer for this another day

141
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,090
and accept
whatever punishment you see fit.

142
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,870
But now,

143
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,810
my mother has suddenly collapsed.

144
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,070
Please, Your Majesty,

145
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,720
let me go to her.

146
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,110
Get lost.

147
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,840
Thank you, Your Majesty.

148
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,470
I shall take my leave.

149
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,000
Your Highness,

150
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,360
please go and see her.

151
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,320
Mother!

152
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,420
Your Highness.

153
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,120
Mother!

154
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,240
What's this?

155
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,800
Her Ladyship said

156
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,730
Your Highness and Miss Song
should go to bed.

157
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,370
Open the door!

158
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,230
My Lady,

159
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,150
how did it go?

160
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,340
My Lady,

161
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,320
they didn't let go

162
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,250
of each other's hands the whole way.

163
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,370
Heng.

164
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,440
I've done

165
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,960
all I can for you.

166
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,020
The rest

167
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,050
is up to you.

168
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,510
Master.

169
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,120
Where is she?

170
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,630
The palace attendants said

171
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,080
Her Ladyship summoned Miss Song

172
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,910
midway.

173
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,670
Then send someone

174
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,670
to inquire
at Noble Consort Gao's place.

175
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,030
I did.

176
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,590
The maids there said

177
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,910
Miss Song had already left the palace

178
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,910
and gone home.

179
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,000
Master,

180
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,280
that's impossible.

181
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,480
If she had really gone home,

182
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,120
Zhixia would've sent word.

183
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,910
She…

184
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,440
she…

185
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,080
she must still be in the palace.

186
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,600
Something must've happened.

187
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,880
Don't panic.

188
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,920
No one enters the palace
at night unless summoned.

189
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,250
Let's wait a bit longer.

190
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
Just as I thought.

191
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,030
Don't waste your energy.

192
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,630
This is Her Ladyship's plan.

193
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,350
What do you mean?

194
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,910
A classic costume-drama scene.

195
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,720
The male and female leads

196
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,910
end up stuck in a room,

197
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,910
forced to bond.

198
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,200
Since Her Ladyship came up with this idea,

199
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,320
there's no way

200
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,240
we're getting out of here tonight.

201
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,440
How do you know that?

202
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,670
Of course I know.

203
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,160
It's a classic scene.

204
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,240
I've played it out

205
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,770
more times than I can count.

206
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,440
You know what?

207
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,170
We might as well just go with it.

208
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,000
Wait.

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,130
You're a young lady…

210
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,910
alone in a room with a man.

211
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,040
Shouldn't you behave with propriety?

212
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,870
I…

213
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,960
It's too tight.

214
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,030
What's wrong with
making myself more comfortable?

215
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,150
Why are you so nervous?

216
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,910
I...

217
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,390
You didn't seem this nervous

218
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,910
when you spread the rumors.

219
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,230
Now you're afraid
I'll take advantage of you?

220
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,430
Why would I be afraid?

221
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,080
What do I even have
for you to take advantage of?

222
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,210
Then explain this—

223
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,000
what was that marriage decree
from Her Ladyship all about?

224
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,440
And just now, in front of the Emperor,

225
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,030
you took all the blame for me.

226
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,760
What was that supposed to mean?

227
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,670
Also,

228
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,640
I really want to know—

229
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,960
if His Majesty
hadn't stopped you just now,

230
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,070
would you really have cut off your hand?

231
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,770
I was just gambling,

232
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,460
like I've been doing

233
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,720
all my life.

234
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,890
Gambling that if I obey and behave,

235
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,720
I'll be let off one more time.

236
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,600
Well then.

237
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,910
Looks like

238
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,860
the fake couple in "Exceptional Love"

239
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,340
has made its way to the Emperor.

240
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,790
I gotta say, you're pretty bold,

241
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,910
daring to touch the Emperor's sore spot.

242
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,720
I've already told you,

243
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,580
this whole thing wasn't my doing.

244
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,910
You think I'm dumb enough

245
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,630
to risk being accused of treason

246
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,720
just to…

247
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,800
to play a fake couple with you?

248
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,200
Are you out of your mind?

249
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,430
That does sound absurd.

250
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,120
Fair point.

251
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,230
So you saved me

252
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,020
just because of...

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,240
Don't think I don't know

254
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,550
why you helped me.

255
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,950
You're overthinking it.

256
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,100
I helped you

257
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,080
only because of

258
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,670
the rules you mentioned.

259
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,750
The rule that when the female lead

260
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,010
is in danger, the male lead must save her.

261
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,060
Miss Song, you're really clever.

262
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,440
Brilliant, even.

263
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,030
You…

264
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,090
What are you doing?

265
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,100
What do you think I'm doing?

266
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,870
Going to sleep.

267
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,550
It's already 10 PM.

268
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,280
You want me to stay up all night?

269
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,790
Does a workaholic
like you even need sleep?

270
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,870
Even the King of Hell

271
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,270
has to sleep.

272
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,840
But this place is so big.

273
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,720
Why do you have to

274
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,930
sleep on the bed?

275
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:47,720
Well, if not here,

276
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,670
am I s-supposed to

277
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,730
sleep on the floor?

278
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,600
But if you sleep here,

279
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,440
where am I supposed to sleep?

280
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,910
Wherever you want.

281
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,030
Didn't you just tell me

282
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,560
to go with

283
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,910
the flow?

284
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,720
You…

285
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:11,340
[Seventh Prince's Mansion]

286
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,550
Guard the mansion.

287
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,350
I'll go bring His Highness back!

288
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,930
[Seventh Prince's Mansion]

289
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:18,960
General Chu.

290
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,020
Guard the mansion.

291
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,540
I'll go bring Yimeng back.

292
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,480
[Qianyu Mansion]

293
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,910
You all head back first.

294
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,420
[Guangde Gate]

295
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,480
I'll go bring Yimeng back.

296
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,390
[Xumian Hall]

297
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,850
Why is it getting
colder and colder in here?

298
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,240
Let…

299
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,110
Let go of me!

300
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,000
Let go of me!

301
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,960
Get off me!

302
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:31,870
Forget it.

303
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,240
I'd rather freeze to death

304
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,360
than deal with him.

305
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,360
In a sweet romance script like this,

306
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,870
you've got to tread carefully.

307
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,960
One wrong move,

308
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,290
and you'll fall right into a cliché plot.

309
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,110
None of this
has anything to do with Miss Song.

310
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,370
Please, Your Majesty,

311
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,460
punish me instead.

312
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,600
Fine.

313
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,510
Then tell me,

314
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,750
apart from the Song family behind her,

315
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,510
what makes her so special?

316
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,530
Your Majesty,
you loved the late Empress

317
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,790
not because of the Chu family behind her.

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,790
You…

319
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,000
You can't sleep either?

320
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,200
Not with all that noise you're making.

321
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,790
I…

322
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,000
What do you want?

323
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,810
Apply the ointment.

324
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,590
For you?

325
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,030
The wound is on your back.

326
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,490
Isn't that a bit improper?

327
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,920
I took care of my wound
as soon as I left Waning River Crescent.

328
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,680
It's for you.

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,060
So you do have a conscience after all.

330
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,240
Song Yimeng,

331
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,000
do you have to be so frivolous?

332
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
What's wrong?

333
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,560
Your Highness,

334
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,270
didn't you just say

335
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,550
you weren't afraid
I'd take advantage of you?

336
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,620
Now you're afraid?

337
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,480
Weird.

338
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,490
Where did you

339
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,740
get this ointment?

340
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,470
I bought it on the street.

341
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,590
Your Highness,

342
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,430
you went to
Waning River Crescent to buy it?

343
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,750
So what?

344
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,400
By the way,

345
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,310
let me ask you something.

346
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,170
Isn't the annual musical banquet

347
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
usually held

348
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,330
in the bamboo grove outside the city?

349
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,440
Why was it held
at Waning River Crescent this year?

350
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,130
Are you planning something

351
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,200
against Waning River Crescent?

352
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,300
I'm a prince.

353
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,930
Why would I be bothered
by a bunch of nobodies?

354
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
But you—

355
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,050
you've gotten so close
to that martial-world guy—

356
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,280
Li Shiliu.

357
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,210
Don't tell me

358
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,590
you've got a thing for him.

359
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,880
I...

360
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,760
Are you kidding me?

361
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,270
He's from the martial world.

362
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,330
I'd never fall for someone like that.

363
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,080
Why are you blushing?

364
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,530
I…

365
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,730
I'm not blushing at all.

366
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,550
You're mistaken.

367
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,400
Look at you—

368
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,230
you're stammering.

369
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,310
All flustered.

370
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,320
It's obvious that you like him.

371
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,560
I know.

372
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,850
You're just trying to trick me into

373
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,830
telling you who I like, aren't you?

374
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,960
Let me be clear.

375
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,680
There is no way I'll marry you.

376
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,880
No matter how many
betrothal gifts your mother sends,

377
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,350
no matter what tricks you pull,

378
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,200
it's never happening.

379
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,030
Got it?

380
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,440
I told you already.

381
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,790
That was all my mother's doing.

382
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,120
I knew nothing about it.

383
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,920
Don't tell me you think

384
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,720
I arranged for us to be stuck here

385
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,000
together tonight.

386
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,750
Well, who knows?

387
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,680
I knew it.

388
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,920
You're impossible

389
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,890
to reason with.

390
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:55,920
Excuse me?

391
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,960
What do you mean?

392
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,920
Me? Unreasonable?

393
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Make it clear.

394
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,440
I'm saying you're unreasonable.

395
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,240
I've helped you again and again,

396
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,270
never once asking for anything in return.

397
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,070
At the musical banquet,

398
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,350
I stepped in to help you,

399
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,310
and what did I get?

400
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,830
You teamed up with Chu Guihong

401
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,090
and turned against me.

402
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,350
I didn't plan to hold it against you.

403
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,550
What more do you want?

404
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,160
I...

405
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,070
You what?

406
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,720
Say it!

407
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,920
What more do you want?

408
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
Now you're the one feeling wronged?

409
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,510
What?

410
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,530
Can't I feel wronged?

411
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,360
Of course I feel wronged.

412
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,920
That ridiculous musical banquet.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,510
I said

414
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,350
I wasn't going; I said it over and over,

415
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,950
but my father forced me to go.

416
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,460
Fine, I went.

417
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,400
But what did you do there?

418
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,340
You talked nonsense

419
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,710
in front of everyone.

420
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,830
Did you consider my feelings?

421
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,750
Did you?

422
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,290
And your father!

423
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,750
You were the one arguing
and fighting with the Eighteenth Prince.

424
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,640
Why was I the one
who had to kneel all night?

425
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,200
You know what?

426
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,350
My knees are red now.

427
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,510
Red and swollen,

428
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,570
hurting like hell.

429
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,960
It's not just my knees.

430
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,200
My whole body aches.

431
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,640
I'm also cold and hungry.

432
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,910
What did I do to deserve this?

433
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,100
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

434
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,550
Fine.

435
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
It's all my fault.

436
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,130
Is that how you apologize?

438
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,660
You're not sincere at all.

439
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,120
Come on, don't push your…

440
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:37,400
Sorry.

441
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,000
I shouldn't have dragged you into this.

442
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,400
I shouldn't have pulled you into politics.

443
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,370
I shouldn't have

444
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,230
let you face others' criticism.

445
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,320
I didn't handle it well.

446
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,230
But from now on,

447
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,250
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

448
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,590
Now,

449
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,440
go sleep

450
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,860
on the bed.

451
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,610
I'll sleep here.

452
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,930
But if you dare wake me up again,

453
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,200
I'll kill you.

454
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:03,830
[Xumian Hall]

455
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,720
Fugui?

456
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,650
Your Highness!

457
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,220
Why are you…

458
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,200
Your Highness,

459
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,640
I searched for you all night.

460
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,790
I was worried sick.

461
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,550
I thought something
had happened to you.

462
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,070
Your Highness!

463
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,310
Wait,

464
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,970
what on earth are you wearing?

465
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,020
I willingly ruined my image

466
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,030
just to be reunited with you!

467
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,000
What did I do

468
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,510
to be reunited

469
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,070
with a bearded maid like you?

470
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,920
I can't believe this.

471
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,040
Get up now.

472
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,880
Entering the palace
without permission is a crime.

473
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,270
Dressing up as a maid
only makes it worse.

474
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,590
I...

475
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,720
Let's talk outside.

476
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,750
Yimeng.

477
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,460
Yimeng.

478
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,280
Yimeng.

479
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,600
C-Chu Guihong?

480
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,720
Go, go, go.

481
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,400
Get in.

482
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,160
Get in.

483
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:34,310
Chu Guihong.

484
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,030
Yimeng,

485
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,920
are you okay?

486
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,790
Why are you…

487
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,790
Nan Heng.

488
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,110
You spent the night alone with her.

489
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,180
Don't you think you need to explain it?

490
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,240
Why should I explain anything to you?

491
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,200
You…

492
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,310
Alright, alright,

493
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,640
enough.

494
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,790
Stop fighting.

495
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,900
You want to attract even more attention?

496
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,000
Chu Guihong,

497
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,920
you need to leave.

498
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,400
If someone finds you here,
there'll be serious trouble.

499
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:01,880
He...

500
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:02,790
Yimeng.

501
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,070
Yimeng.

502
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,000
Yimeng.

503
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,200
My father?

504
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,830
Yimeng.

505
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,640
Oh no.

506
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,680
If my father sees us like this,

507
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,480
he'll definitely get the wrong idea.

508
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,160
Come on,

509
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,960
you need to hide.

510
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,480
Hide.

511
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,350
Don't make this harder for me.

512
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,610
Stay hidden, alright?

513
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,720
You…

514
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,130
We all snuck in without permission,

515
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,530
so no one rats anyone out.

516
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,520
A palace maid,

517
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,330
a guard…

518
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,590
Throw in a eunuch,

519
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,120
and we've got a full lineup.

520
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,170
Yimeng.

521
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,550
Father.

522
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,110
Yimeng.

523
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,350
Father.

524
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,000
Why are you here too?

525
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,640
And why

526
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,270
are you dressed like this?

527
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,790
I thought I just

528
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,720
heard the Seventh Prince's voice.

529
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,500
Is he here too?

530
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,920
No,

531
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,520
I'm the only one in this room.

532
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,140
You didn't leave the palace all night.

533
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,880
Did something happen?

534
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,650
Did someone plot against you,

535
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,510
set you up,

536
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,640
and lock you in here?

537
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,830
N-No.

538
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,780
It was Nan Heng?

539
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,160
That scheming snake.

540
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
It has to be him!

541
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,200
Stop.

542
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,750
L-Let's not stay here.

543
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,160
Come on,

544
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,640
let's go home.

545
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,900
His Majesty is here!

546
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,160
Crap.

547
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,660
Why is His Majesty here?

548
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,920
Seal off the whole place.

549
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,030
No one is allowed near.

550
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,680
Yes.

551
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,200
We're done for.

552
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,750
Yimeng.

553
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,590
Yimeng,

554
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,240
go chat with His Majesty for a bit.

555
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,650
I need to hide.

556
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,670
Father, no, no!

557
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:42,820
Don't go in there!

558
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,050
Don't go in there!

559
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,640
You…

560
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,310
You…

561
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,650
Mr. Song,

562
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,490
you're welcome to join us.

563
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,650
It's so screwed up.

564
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,550
Song Yimeng!

565
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,880
Your Majesty,

566
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,790
what a surprise.

567
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,100
You're here too.

568
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,270
How dare you

569
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,540
not kneel at the sight of His Majesty?

570
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,400
Guards!

571
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,200
Wait.

572
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,890
Don't call the guards.

573
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,640
Please don't.

574
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,400
I'll kneel,

575
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,750
I'll kneel.

576
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,070
Don't kneel!

577
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,310
Your Highness.

578
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,160
It's Her Ladyship.

579
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,830
She...

580
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,370
Greetings, My Lady.

581
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,200
What did you say?

582
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:30,400
I asked her not to kneel.

583
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,790
Song Yimeng is my daughter-in-law.

584
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,460
I won't let anyone bully her.

585
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,610
Daughter-in-law?

586
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,640
Ridiculous!

587
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,160
She's been engaged
to Chu Guihong since childhood.

588
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,510
I personally approved that match

589
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,220
when Lord Qianyu was still alive.

590
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,560
Noble Consort,

591
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,410
are you ignoring my promise?

592
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,070
Back then,
my engagement to Prince Pingyang

593
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,000
was arranged by the late Emperor.

594
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,310
But once Your Majesty took the throne,

595
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,310
you threw all that aside
and brought me into the palace

596
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,070
just to get heirs

597
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,870
and keep the Gao family in check.

598
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,750
If you could break

599
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,960
the late Emperor's promise,

600
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,110
why can't I break yours

601
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,680
for Heng's sake?

602
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,890
How can you compare the two situations?

603
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,200
Why not?

604
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,970
You ruined my life

605
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,690
for your own selfish desires.

606
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,760
And now,

607
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,880
you want to ruin Heng's life too.

608
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,640
I won't allow it!

609
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,920
Wasn't she

610
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,910
a gentle, weak consort in the script?

611
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,680
Why has she suddenly
changed so much?

612
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,310
Are you insane,

613
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,170
Gao Changrong?

614
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,830
How dare you speak to me like this

615
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,640
for a girl from the Song family?

616
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,200
I've wanted

617
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,550
to say this for a long time.

618
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,000
I've held back for decades.

619
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,020
All I've ever wanted

620
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,380
is for Heng to be safe and happy.

621
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,600
But what about you?

622
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,690
What have you done?

623
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,530
Shall I list every injustice

624
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,130
Heng has suffered,

625
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,110
right here in front of Miss Song?

626
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:05,350
Fine.

627
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,200
Since you've made up your mind,

628
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,110
don't blame me for…

629
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,070
What will you do?

630
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,580
The Gao family and I

631
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,060
are determined to make

632
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,400
Miss Song our family.

633
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,280
Farewell, Your Majesty.

634
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,650
Gao Changrong

635
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,720
has been my consort for over 30 years,

636
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,620
always quiet as a mouse.

637
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,750
But look at her now!

638
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,720
Your Majesty, please calm down.

639
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,680
Your Majesty,

640
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,720
Mr. Song is here.

641
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:04,400
Let him in.

642
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,350
Mr. Song.

643
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,880
Your Majesty.

644
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,510
You old fox,

645
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:18,770
what brought you here?

646
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,310
I'm exhausted today.

647
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,610
I don't have time for your mind games.

648
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,720
The medical texts say

649
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,880
fatigue stems from blocked qi.

650
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,550
Your Majesty,
you're troubled and stressed.

651
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,540
Of course you feel tired.

652
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,860
I've come today

653
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,470
to bring you a miraculous remedy.

654
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,750
My Lady,

655
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,550
I thought you died in the palace.

656
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,480
If you had died,

657
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,030
I wouldn't go on living.

658
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,750
My Lady,

659
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,960
I'll serve you

660
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,400
in this life and the next.

661
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,380
Alright, alright.

662
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,590
You've been crying all day.

663
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,590
Yingqiu.

664
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,700
Come on.

665
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,730
Aren't I alive and well?

666
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,240
If you keep crying like this,

667
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,300
people will think I'm actually dead.

668
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,750
My Lady,

669
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,110
the Seventh Prince used to stir up rumors

670
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,200
even when nothing happened
between you two.

671
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
And now that you two spent
the whole night alone in a room,

672
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,880
he's suddenly gone all quiet?

673
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,370
I just don't believe that a bad guy

674
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,140
can suddenly turn good.

675
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,480
With insight like that,

676
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,860
saving you was worth it after all.

677
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,310
Here,

678
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,160
try this.

679
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,500
It's brewed with mountain spring water.

680
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:37,830
Thank you.

681
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,680
Sit up straight.

682
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,200
Eyes forward.

683
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:53,960
Use three fingers

684
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,750
to hold the cup steadily.

685
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,300
Observe the color.

686
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,000
Smell the aroma.

687
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,590
Taste the tea.

688
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,510
Let the flavor
sit on your tongue for a bit.

689
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,030
Don't gulp it down.

690
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,830
It ruins the good tea.

691
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,550
You heard me.

692
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,240
You know nothing about music, art,

693
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,680
poetry, or etiquette.

694
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,160
If you go out as my elder sister,

695
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,020
I'll definitely be embarrassed.

696
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,320
Song Yiting,

697
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,250
if I've offended you somehow,

698
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,200
you could just tell me.

699
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,910
Why are you suddenly
talking about etiquette?

700
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,940
Look at you—

701
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,680
shaking over one cup of tea.

702
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,560
Then yesterday,

703
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,920
at the musical banquet,

704
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,480
how did you have the courage

705
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,160
to say such bold things?

706
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,420
What did I say?

707
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,200
"Exceptional Love"

708
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
and "Illusory Dream"

709
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,720
are just made-up nonsense!

710
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,750
I'm telling you,

711
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,070
if anyone dares gossip

712
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,510
about me behind my back again,

713
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,030
I won't go easy on them.

714
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,640
I used to think

715
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,350
you were just like everyone else

716
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,640
in the capital,

717
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,680
dreaming of

718
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,080
marrying a powerful man.

719
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,240
But yesterday, I realized

720
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,680
you're actually

721
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,880
not bad.

722
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,070
So today,

723
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,590
I came to warn you.

724
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,880
As soon as Father
returned from the palace,

725
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,940
he told Mother to prepare your dowry.

726
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,670
He said His Majesty gave the order—

727
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,320
you're getting married next month.

728
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,280
What?

729
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,820
Next month?

730
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,389
[Qianyu Mansion]

731
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,480
About our wedding date,

732
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,400
I was planning to talk to you about it,

733
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,730
but you came to me first.

734
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,110
You like kapok flowers.

735
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,310
They bloom in spring,

736
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,400
but that's still a while away.

737
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,670
So I had the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

738
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,070
pick the nearest auspicious date.

739
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,880
I'm sorry.

740
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,540
I didn't understand

741
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,190
my feelings at first.

742
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,850
But now I do.

743
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,989
This

744
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,639
was left to you by the late Empress.

745
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,380
I can't accept it.

746
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,670
If you don't like this jade pendant,

747
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,660
I'll get you something else.

748
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,070
The Eighteenth Prince
just gave me a great piece of jade.

749
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,510
I'll use it to make something

750
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,630
with kapok flower patterns for you.

751
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,070
What do you say?

752
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:07,920
Chu Guihong.

753
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,960
I...

754
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,480
I don't want to get married.

755
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,510
Don't worry.

756
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,320
All the required gifts

757
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,030
and rituals—

758
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:20,920
we won't skip anything.

759
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,920
It has nothing to do with that.

760
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,550
Or would you prefer to

761
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,550
have the ceremony somewhere else?

762
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:23,760
I remember…

763
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,070
I can't marry you!

764
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,110
Yimeng.

765
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,820
We've been engaged

766
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
for 18 years.

767
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,190
There were so many times

768
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,320
when I almost died.

769
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,170
What kept me going
was the thought of you waiting

770
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,370
for me in the capital.

771
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,630
If you haven't thought it through,

772
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,610
I can wait.

773
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,640
I've waited so many years already.

774
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,970
However long it takes,

775
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,030
I'll wait for you.

776
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,000
Chu Guihong,

777
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,110
don't wait anymore.

778
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,210
The Song Yimeng you love

779
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,450
isn't me.

780
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,980
Do you understand?

781
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,390
At first, I thought

782
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,480
maybe

783
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,030
we could be together.

784
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,440
But as time passed, I realized

785
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,930
we were not from the same world.

786
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,200
That night during the Lantern Festival,

787
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,480
you did what you thought was right.

788
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,820
And that, more than anything,

789
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,850
proved how wrong

790
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,520
we are for each other.

791
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,680
[To Pingrong, from Song Yimeng,
addressed to Chu Guihong]

792
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,880
These

793
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,780
are all the letters we exchanged.

794
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,800
1,632 of them.

795
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,670
You say the person I love isn't you.

796
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,210
Then who is it?

797
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,920
Tell me.

798
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,400
Yimeng.

799
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,600
This marriage

800
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,160
was decided by both
His Majesty and Mr. Song.

801
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,440
If we go against the imperial edict

802
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,110
and anger the Emperor,

803
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,760
it could cost countless lives.

804
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,550
So

805
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,180
please don't overthink this, okay?

806
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,510
In the future,

807
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,990
I'll treat you really well.

808
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,070
I...

809
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,560
Yimeng!

810
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,800
A gathering of heroes,

811
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,320
talents from everywhere,

812
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,070
and the brightest minds under one roof.

813
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,510
Legendary generals and commanders,

814
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,070
talents emerging one after another,

815
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,280
all marvel at Chief's unmatched presence.

816
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,360
What does that mean?

817
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,110
Explain it.

818
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,280
Something new I picked up from Yao Qian.

819
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,510
You don't like it?

820
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,690
Everyone, get out!

821
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,440
Wait,

822
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,110
Chief.

823
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,190
Yesterday, Chu

824
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,150
and that consort both wanted Miss Song.

825
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,110
We can't just sit around and do nothing.

826
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,880
We're waiting for

827
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,710
your further instructions.

828
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,400
I said get out.

829
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,360
Didn't you hear me?

830
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,070
But…

831
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,510
Get out!

832
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,320
What's wrong?

833
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,360
Who upset you this time?

834
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,880
Go burn every last copy

835
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,200
of "Exceptional Love."

836
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,550
From now on, I don't want to see

837
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,410
a single copy of it in the capital.

838
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,470
What happened?

839
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,680
Chu Guihong was right.

840
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,970
He really does love Song Yimeng.

841
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,040
If we marry,

842
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,840
the original plot will still play out.

843
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,460
But if we break up

844
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,920
and go against the imperial edict,

845
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,320
could something else go wrong?

846
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,760
Whoever solves this riddle

847
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,360
will get 1,000 taels of gold.

848
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,070
What's this?

849
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,030
Take a look.

850
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,450
1,000 teals of gold!

851
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,850
[Clues to decode this message will be
rewarded at Waning River Crescent.]

852
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,440
Keep hammering.

853
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,440
Keep hammering.

854
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,400
Turn your rage into strength.

855
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,670
Keep this up and you might actually

856
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,670
learn the method of weapon forging.

857
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
Whether I'd learn it or not, I don't know,

858
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,210
but if you keep talking,

859
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,110
I swear I'll smash your head in

860
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,400
with this hammer.

861
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,800
The wedding is on the 18th of next month.

862
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,960
That's only a few days away.

863
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,310
What do you plan to do?

864
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,230
It's their wedding.

865
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,690
What's it got to do with me?

866
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,550
If you mean that,

867
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,680
why are you so upset?

868
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,000
Am I upset?

869
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,520
Am I upset?

870
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,920
Which eye of yours saw me upset?

871
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,580
Fine, you're not upset at all.

872
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,210
Wipe your sweat.

873
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,150
Actually,

874
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,550
the Emperor is pushing for this marriage

875
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,590
because he's thinking of naming an heir.

876
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,440
If the Song family won't side with you,

877
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,480
just give up

878
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,840
and try something else.

879
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Why should I give up?

880
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,440
Then what are you going to do?

881
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,360
His Majesty has made it clear

882
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,590
that he's backing Nan Rui

883
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,190
and shutting the door on you.

884
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,960
Are you planning to defy him
and steal the bride?

885
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,840
Listen,

886
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,550
until they're married,

887
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,920
I've still got a chance.

888
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,920
A chance of…

889
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,430
of winning the Song family back.

890
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,000
Sure,

891
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,670
of course,

892
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,070
you still stand a chance.

893
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,770
You just can't get over Song Yimeng.

894
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,860
What does this have to do with her?

895
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,670
We've been planning this for so long.

896
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,440
If we give up now,

897
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,170
all our efforts will be wasted.

898
00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:15,030
You just can't get over Song Yimeng.

899
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,000
Give me a break.

900
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,480
When did I ever mention Song Yimeng?

901
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,410
I brought her up.

902
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,880
I brought her up.

903
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,150
Anyway,

904
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,290
we can't give up on
winning over the Song family.

905
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,150
Also,

906
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,630
there've been a lot of eyes

907
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,470
on the prince's manor lately.

908
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,400
I'll be meeting Chancellor Gao
at Waning River Crescent.

909
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,630
Go make the arrangements.

910
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,150
Don't let a single word get out.

911
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,080
Understood.

912
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,440
What are you looking at?

913
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,150
You…

914
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,590
Song Yimeng, Song Yimeng.

915
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,120
You just can't get over her.

916
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:54,320
She's getting married?

917
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,440
Stop talking nonsense.

918
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,840
No way Miss Song would marry someone else.

919
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,260
Anyone who tries to steal Chief's woman

920
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:58,930
is asking for death.

921
00:41:58,930 --> 00:41:59,600
Exactly.

922
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,460
Like I said,

923
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,560
pretty women can't be trusted.

924
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,480
Chief treated her so well,

925
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,190
and she still chose

926
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,960
the rich general.

927
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,800
Yeah.

928
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,320
Just wait and see.

929
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,590
She used to come by all the time.

930
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,190
Now we'll probably never see her again.

931
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,340
Yunlong, Shanhu.

932
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,320
Where's Li Shiliu?
