[Episode 23]

3
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,060
So you plan to frame me.

4
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,400
How clever.

5
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,900
You flatter me.

6
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,040
I've just been dealing with
Your Highness too long

7
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,240
and picked up a few tricks.

8
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,500
I'm just fighting fire

9
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,750
with fire.

10
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,150
Mr. Chu, since you understand that,

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,910
do you also know

12
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,190
I could

13
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,520
make a clean getaway?

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,240
Nightwalkers,

15
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,290
leave Waning River Crescent now.

16
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,310
[Big Fortune]

17
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,710
Nan Heng,

18
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,870
I will find proof

19
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,470
that you're colluding
with the Nightwalkers.

20
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,960
General Chu, you must be joking.

21
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,750
I'm here today because you invited me.

22
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,910
What does that have to do
with Waning River Crescent?

23
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,960
Or are you saying

24
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,280
you brought me here on purpose

25
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,590
just so you could frame me
for helping from the inside

26
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,790
and using the chaos
to bust someone out?

27
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,470
Right after you entered
the celestial prison,

28
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,070
there was a prison break.

29
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,470
Was that just a coincidence?

30
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm puzzled about that too.

31
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,030
How did the thugs know I'd be here?

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,480
Besides,

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,520
I was injured here, wasn't I?

34
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,560
Could it be that

35
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,600
there's a mole in your Qianyu Army
or in the office

36
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,640
of the capital prefecture?

37
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,040
Nan Heng,

38
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,240
that's slander!

39
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,280
You spoke out of turn

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,360
and framed a prince.

41
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,620
That's unforgivable!

42
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,560
You even set trap after trap

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,350
to take down both
Waning River Crescent and me.

44
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,030
Your crimes are really numerous.

45
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,710
However,

46
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,150
you still don't know me well enough.

47
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,920
You call me the God of Death,

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
so why would someone like that

49
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,700
hesitate to take a life?

50
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,870
If Shangguan He really worked for me,

51
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,960
why would I have let him live?

52
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,310
Why didn't I kill him

53
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,590
during the chaos just now?

54
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,180
Why would I bother

55
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,910
having people disguised as thugs

56
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,120
to rescue him?

57
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,170
Shangguan He's sentencing
is still days away.

58
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,430
I don't believe
his accomplices will sit still

59
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,480
and just watch.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,370
If they make a move,

61
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,630
they're bound to slip up.

62
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,140
If you ask me,
the one who can't sit still here

63
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,070
is you, General Chu.

64
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Yimeng.

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,270
Father.

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,510
How is she?

67
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,270
The physician said it's nothing serious.

68
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,070
She just needs a few days of rest.

69
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,870
Don't worry.

70
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,560
Father,

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
where is Nan Heng?

72
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,909
Is he still in Yiting's room?

73
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,720
He's already left.

74
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,190
I'll go check on her.

75
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,120
Not right now.

76
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,340
Yiting said

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,560
she doesn't want
to see anyone at the moment.

78
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
Why not?

79
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,940
She wants to see Nan Heng

80
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,470
but not us?

81
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:18,750
That Seventh Prince is so manipulative,

82
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,610
making your sister fall so deeply for him.

83
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,950
Don't worry, Father.

84
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll never let Nan Heng

85
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,440
hurt Song Yiting again.

86
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,800
His Majesty has arrived!

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,750
Greetings, Mr. Song.

88
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,630
Eunuch Liu.

89
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,000
I didn't know His Majesty was coming.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,680
Forgive me for not receiving him properly.

91
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,330
No need for such formalities, Mr. Song.

92
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,040
His Majesty is visiting

93
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,480
in disguise.

94
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,280
He's not here for state affairs.

95
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,000
Then may I ask what matter

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,659
has brought His Majesty here?

97
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,770
Mr. Song, no need to pretend.

98
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,510
The Eighteenth Prince
has gone to His Majesty

99
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,170
and reported
the Seventh Prince's misconduct.

100
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,720
Then I should go see His Majesty at once.

101
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,920
Don't rush, Mr. Song.

102
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,510
The person His Majesty wishes to see

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,630
is not you.

104
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,310
Not me?

105
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,870
Then who is it?

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,800
Me?

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Your Majesty,

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,270
Song Yimeng is here.

109
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,870
I'm Song Yimeng.

110
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,409
Greetings, Your Majesty.

111
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,790
I'm Song Yimeng.

112
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,770
Greetings, Your Majesty.

113
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,240
[Seventh Prince's Mansion]

114
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,780
Your Highness,

115
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,510
all Nightwalkers are gone.

116
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,180
The Qianyu Army got there
and found nothing.

117
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,000
Good.

118
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,750
I was worried about that on my way here.

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,390
What's wrong?

120
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,720
Your Highness,

121
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,909
something terrible has happened.

122
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:39,480
The Eighteenth Prince
went to see His Majesty

123
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,430
and reported you

124
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,760
because of Song Yiting.

125
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,159
What did His Majesty say?

126
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,310
His Majesty was furious.

127
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,970
He kept scolding Song Yimeng.

128
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,070
Why was he scolding Song Yimeng?

129
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,040
H-He said

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,550
Song Yimeng shouldn't
have brought you, a terribl…

131
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,750
a terribly wise man,

132
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,430
into the Song Residence.

133
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,360
That's what caused all this mess.

134
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,190
He also said she acts improperly

135
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,390
and lacks feminine virtues.

136
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,000
Song Yiting followed her example

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,720
and became the wild,
unruly girl she is now.

138
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,240
His Majesty scolded Song Yimeng,

139
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,390
but the one he resents is me.

140
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,480
Your Highness,

141
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,480
His Majesty is really angry this time.

142
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,720
He couldn't even wait
to summon Song Yimeng to court

143
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,190
and personally went to the Song Residence

144
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,880
to teach her a lesson.

145
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,680
Eunuch Liu.

146
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,720
Why did His Majesty

147
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,680
summon me today?

148
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,480
His Majesty condescended
to visit the Song Residence.

149
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,909
What do you think it's for?

150
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,140
The Emperor has always despised Nan Heng.

151
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,330
Could it be that he plans
to use the Zijin Pavilion incident

152
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,790
to charge him with a crime?

153
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,240
If I tell him everything

154
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,070
about Nan Heng secretly seeking
the method of weapon forging,

155
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,410
maybe I can stop

156
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,270
what's about to happen.

157
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,600
The Song family wouldn't be wiped out,

158
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
Yiting wouldn't be deceived,

159
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
and I wouldn't be mutilated.

160
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,200
Should I

161
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,750
expose him?

162
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,050
If I explained it to you,

163
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,750
would you believe me?

164
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,640
People call me the God of Death.

165
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,780
Isn't that what you think too?

166
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,840
The world insults and curses me.

167
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,300
Haven't you done the same?

168
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,910
It's true that I don't trust anyone.

169
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,550
That's because no one's ever trusted me.

170
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,040
Not even you!

171
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,000
You need to understand—

172
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,030
things in this world

173
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,120
aren't always

174
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
what they seem.

175
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,750
If I didn't fight to survive,

176
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,880
then I'd be the one forced to a dead end.

177
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,240
Your Majesty.

178
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,360
I've already heard about

179
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,850
what happened last night.

180
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,990
Song Yimeng,

181
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,880
if you testify

182
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,010
that Heng seduced your sister

183
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,890
and has poor moral conduct…

184
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,760
Your Majesty,

185
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,320
I don't want

186
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,520
to testify against the Seventh Prince.

187
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,180
I just want an imperial edict.

188
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,650
You just want me to back you up

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,400
to secure your position
as the principal consort, don't you?

190
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,960
Fine then.

191
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,150
On the ninth day of next month,

192
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,610
you'll marry Heng.

193
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,600
The next day,

194
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,700
Song Yiting will join
the household as a concubine.

195
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,480
Your Majesty…

196
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,550
I'm not finished.

197
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,720
The scandal between you Song sisters

198
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,790
and Heng

199
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,150
has already stirred up

200
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,240
quite a storm.

201
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,030
Song Yude's reputation
has taken a huge hit.

202
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,600
He likely won't be able to stay
in the capital anymore.

203
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,480
I'll advise him to resign and retire

204
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,750
and serve as a retainer under Heng,

205
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,030
following him to his fief.

206
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,280
Your Majesty,

207
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,520
that's not the edict

208
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,720
I want to ask for.

209
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,480
You wouldn't testify

210
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,890
or get married.

211
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,670
What more do you want?

212
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,130
Do you really think
I'd hesitate to kill you?

213
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,320
Your Majesty,

214
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,510
what I'm asking for

215
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,150
is an imperial edict to call off
my engagement to the Seventh Prince.

216
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Neither I,

217
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,840
nor my sister,

218
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,700
nor the entire Song family

219
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,320
wishes to have anything to do
with the Seventh Prince.

220
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,290
Song Yimeng,

221
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,230
a prince's marriage

222
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,200
is both a family matter

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,260
and a state affair.

224
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,320
It's not a children's game

225
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,670
where you can change

226
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,240
your mind at will.

227
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,250
If you

228
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,320
can't give

229
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,240
a legitimate reason…

230
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,360
Your Majesty,

231
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,480
if the engagement is canceled,

232
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,390
the Seventh Prince can never

233
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,710
pull the Ministry of War to his side.

234
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,320
That'll

235
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,240
buy you enough time

236
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,150
to plan the path forward

237
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
for the future crown prince.

238

00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,770
or cancel the engagement—

241
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,550
the pros and cons

242
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,900
are worth your careful thought.

243
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,420
I really did

244
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,750
underestimate you.

245
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,720
But I must warn you,

246
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,240
Heng

247
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,150
has worked hard to secure this marriage.

248
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,810
If you turn your back on him now,

249
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,720
he'll never let you

250
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,210
or the Song family off the hook.

251
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,580
I've been looking for you.

252
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,450

What is it?

254
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,580
This is the imperial edict

255
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,450
calling off our engagement.

256
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,680
Calling off the engagement?

257
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,590
Song Yimeng.

258
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,600
I told you

259
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,480
I'd explain to you

260
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,340
what happened at Zijin Pavilion.

261
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,510
Why won't you trust me?

262
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,960

263

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,720

267
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,240
Or that you're not someone

268
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,550
who schemes,

269
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:44,900

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,359

337
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,790

has promised to take care of everything.

338
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,050
Why did you have to break the engagement?

339
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,720
I never had feelings for him.

340
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,640
Why couldn't I end it?

341
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,349

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,680
you're caught up

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,920
No matter what I say

344
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,960

345
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,220
you won't listen to me.

346
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,830

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,440
I still have to say this—

348
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,440

100 taels.

562
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,550
It's more than enough
to last you for a lifetime.

563
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,540
Did you hear me?

564
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,280
Take the money and get lost.

565
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,270
Chief…

566
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:14,960
Shut up!

567
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,390
Who are you to call me your brother?

568
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,530
And you,

569
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,150
a good-for-nothing
who can't even speak properly.

570
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,550
What use do I have for you?

571
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:36,350
And the rest of you rabble,

572
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,680
listen up.

573
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,880
If one day

574
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,880
you wreck my plans,

575
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,660
none of you will walk away alive.

576
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,240
Did you hear me?

577
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,970
Chief.

578
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,510
Let's drink our fill tonight.

579
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,510
Yeah.

580
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:13,960
Come on.

581
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,680
Bottoms up!

582
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:15,790
Fill it up.

583
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,510
Come on.

584
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,270
Fill it up.

585
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,920
Good.

586
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,450
Here's your wine. Drink up!

587
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,110
Cheers.

588
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,110
You must finish it all.

589
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,570
Come on.

590
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,310
Here.

591
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:24,250
Here's to you.

592
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,480
Come on.

593
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,000
Chief,

594
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,120
here's to you.

595
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,030
Drink.

596
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,660
Drink up, drink up.

597
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,580
Come on.

598
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,710
Second Master.

599
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,740
Second Master.

600
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,670
Second Master.

601
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,690
Second Master.

602
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,640
Come on, drink.

603
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,000
You two, come here.

604
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,160
Drink up.

605
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,110
Drink up.

606
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,220
Chief,

607
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,950
do you remember a year ago

608
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,480
when you told me

609
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,460
to run Waning River Crescent for you?

610
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,070
We agreed then that

611
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,270
you'd be the cold-hearted Chief,

612
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,550
and I'd be the cold-hearted Second Master,

613
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,680
doing all the dirty work you couldn't.

614
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,480
So why is it now

615
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,610
I'm out there giving disaster relief,

616
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,930
fighting floods,

617
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,240
handing alms to the weak,

618
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,170
and even looking for missing cats?

619
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,700
I sent you to do a few good deeds

620
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,640
so you, a sinner, could earn yourself

621
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,800
some good karma.

622
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,120
Get it?

623
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,550
A few good deeds?

624
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,880
It's been a few hundred already.

625
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,640
Chief,

626
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,440
open your eyes and look at us.

627
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,920
You're a viper,

628
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,160
not a Bodhisattva.

629
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,400
And I'm a notorious thief,

630
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,680
not a walking saint.

631
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,360
Look at me—

632
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,790
do I look like a saint to you?

633
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,510
Do I?

634
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,750
If you don't do it,

635
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,830
do you expect me to do it myself?

636
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,720
If you want me to do it,

637
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,550
then I'm charging more

638
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,610
for the extra work.

639
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,800
I'm famous, after all.

640
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,310
I committed over ten major thefts

641
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,960
in half a month,

642
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,310
and now I'm here helping people

643
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,710
look for their lost pets.

644
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,260
What's with that look?

645
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,480
Fine.

646
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,400
Two years.

647
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,830
You'll be free

648
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,070
in two years.

649
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,090
You'll let me go?

650
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,160
Like hell I believe you.

651
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:28,720
No offense,

652
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,030
but the capital prefecture's office

653
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,240
collects a fair bit
of tax money from the capital.

654
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,770
Where did all that money go?

655
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,440
Why is the food here so terrible?

656
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,520
If you tell me every last thing

657
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,400
you know about Nan Heng,

658
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,160
forget about pig knuckles—

659
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,940
you could have
a whole roast pig to yourself.

660
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,030
We both know

661
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,270
Nan Heng's been
supporting the Nightwalkers

662
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,600
with ulterior motives.

663
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,830
The fact that he left you in this cell

664
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,640
means he's already abandoned you.

665
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,490
Yet you'd still risk your life
to protect him.

666
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,290
Why?

667
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
General Chu,

668
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,830
I'd like to make a deal with you.

669
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,480
What deal?

670
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:16,550
If you list out all the bad things

671
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,540
Waning River Crescent has done,

672
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,270
I'll tell you everything
about Nan Heng's collusion

673
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,010
with the Nightwalkers.

674
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,300
What do you say?

675
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
You can't come up with anything?

676
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,680
What's wrong?

677
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,270
Aren't both Waning River Crescent

678
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,260
and the Nightwalkers utterly
wicked in your eyes?

679
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,270
It shouldn't be hard

680
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,530
for you to list hundreds of their crimes.

681
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,510
The Waning River Crescent case

682
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,770
involves a lot of people.

683
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,440
I need time to investigate.

684
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,960
No problem.

685
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,270
Take your time.

686
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,770
If you can find even one crime,

687
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,370
I'll cut off a finger myself.

688
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,980
You ended up here because of Nan Heng,

689
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,490
yet you still can't tell right from wrong.

690
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,570
It was because of Nan Heng?

691
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,760
Nan Heng didn't throw me
in this celestial prison.

692
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,440
Mr. Chu,

693
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,900
I ended up eating pig knuckles
down here because of you.

694
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,590
We both know

695
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,310
there's no good end
for anyone who trusts Nan Heng.

696
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,239
I trusted him twice,

697
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,960
and I lost my aunt and my father.

698
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,590
This time,

699
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,670
it's your turn.

700
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,760
Have you looked into

701
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,139
the Empress's death and the truth

702
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,230
behind the Pingrong Battle?

703
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,880
The late Empress
died during the autumn hunt.

704
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,590
That day,

705
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,880
it was Nan Heng who led my aunt

706
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,630
to where the assassins were hiding.

707
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,000
During the Pingrong Battle,

708
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,710
I sent a letter asking the Xuanjia Army

709
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,150
stationed in Youcheng for reinforcements.

710
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,630
But even after the city gates
were breached

711
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,430
and all 20,000 Qianyu soldiers
were slaughtered,

712
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,730
Nan Heng still didn't show up.

713
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,020
Have you ever asked him

714
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,920
about these things?

715
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,550
What killer

716
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,920
ever admits to murder?

717
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,920
But there are many truths

718
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,280
that remain hidden.

719
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,150
What you believe to be true

720
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,750
might not be the truth at all.

721
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,770
There's no kindness without reason,

722
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,740
nor evil without cause.

723
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,070
Fine.

724
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,050
Then in your view,

725
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,840
why did Nan Heng
run Waning River Crescent?

726
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,590
Why did he take in

727
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,670
fugitives like us
from the martial arts world?

728
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,270
To secretly expand
his influence, obviously.

729
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,360
He went to so much trouble
for bigger influence,

730
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
but he gave away all the club's income

731
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,110
for disaster relief.

732
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,250
He even had us outlaws

733
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,440
set up businesses in the west of the city

734
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,700
so more displaced folks could find jobs.

735
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,840
What's even more ridiculous is

736
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,510
that a bunch of nobodies like us

737
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,920
were forced to patrol

738
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,590
the streets every night

739
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,280
to keep the people safe in their sleep.

740
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,840
Tell me,

741
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,120
does this make any sense?

742
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,960
Stop avoiding the real issues.

743
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,840
Nan Heng did all that

744
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,790
in order to seize the throne.

745
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,320
As far as I know,

746
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,480
after the Pingrong Battle was lost,

747
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,000
you and that cousin prince of yours

748
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,960

the late Empress's death at nine.
