00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,720
but the other Nightwalkers are innocent.

186
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,120
Don't try to defend them.

187
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,080
They're all on Nan Heng's side.

188
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,540
None of them are innocent.

189
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,640
What are you saying?

190
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,570
When have you become like this?

191
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,140
You made an oath

192
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,910
before your aunt's
memorial tablet in childhood.

193
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,000
Have you forgotten it?

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,460
I have never forgotten it.

195
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,350
I made a vow to prevent innocent people

196
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,200
from being wrongfully killed.

197
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,260
It's a principle I've always upheld.

198
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,410
Everything I've done is

199
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,510
in accordance with the law,

200
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,640
fair and square.

201
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,230
But by shutting down
the Waning River Crescent

202
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,840
and going after the Nightwalkers,

203
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,900
you're embroiling innocent people.

204
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,220
The Nightwalkers once saved my life

205
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,440
and lent a helping hand

206
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,780
to you and Qianyu Army.

207
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,000
But now, you are

208
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,270
driving them into a corner.

209
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,730
You're just feeling sorry

210
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,260
for Li Shiliu, aren't you?

211
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,080
Yimeng,

212
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,010
I'm not suffocating them.

213
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,490
You are suffocating me!

214
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,320
I'm suffocating you?

215
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,390
How come?

216
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,280
You're turning me into
someone like Nan Heng!

217
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,730
He's a villain in your eyes,

218
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,910
so you're not surprised when he tricks

219
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,000
and deceives you.

220
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,050
By contrast,

221
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,200
you consider me as

222
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,800
a good person from Qianyu Army.

223
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,670
You question me when I
take slightly harsh measures.

224
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,640
Why?

225
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,360
Why does a good person

226
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,960
have to lose to a bad person?

227
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,360
Why can't a good person do something

228
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,270
as he watches the girl he likes

229
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,800
being drawn to a bad person?

230
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,130
Just in order to prove himself
to be a good person?

231
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,940
Chu Guihong,

232
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,820
being a good person

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,260
isn't about proving anything to others,

234
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,210
but about keeping a clear conscience.

235
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,510
Your father spent
20-odd years nurturing you.

236
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,600
If he saw what you're doing now...

237
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,200
If I hadn't chosen to be
a good person years ago,

238
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,540
perhaps my father wouldn't have died.

239
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,000
If being a good person means

240
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,150
not to fight back

241
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,750
when his next of kin dies,

242
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,880
or to lose the love of his life
to someone else again and again,

243
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
then I'd rather be

244
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,740
a more brutal and despicable man

245
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,550
than Nan Heng.

246
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,790
Long live Your Majesty!

247
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,280
[Calm, Respectful, and Sincere]

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,170
All rise.

249
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,600
Thank Your Majesty.

250
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,750
Your Majesty,

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,880
I have a report to make.

252
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,010
The capital prefecture's office

253
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,210
is said to be making big moves lately.

254
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,960
Speak up.

255
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,120
Recently,

256
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,320
I've caught a man
from the martial arts world,

257
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,720
named Shangguan Baihe.

258
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,440
Investigation results

259
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,670
prove him to be
the absconding culprit

260
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,740
of the theft case in Jiangnan
Province three years ago.

261
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,360
Now, he has adopted a new identity

262
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,000
as the second master of the Nightwalkers,
an organization in the martial arts world.

263
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,200
The theft case in Jiangnan Province...

264
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,540
It was handled by Heng, wasn't it?

265
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,570
I remember

266
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,480
all the offenders were
executed at that time.

267
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,069
Your Majesty is correct.

268
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,680
I suspect

269
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,680
that the Seventh Prince proceeded with

270
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,740
the case unjustly,

271
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,359
and that he is now in collusion
with the Nightwalkers.

272
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,790
I humbly request Your Majesty's

273
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,550
authorization for me to lead Qianyu Army

274
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,720
to search and seize his  residence

275
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,000
for an investigation.

276
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
In view of your concerns,

277
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,750
I hereby...

278
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,280
Think twice, Your Majesty.

279
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,599
General Chu has exhibited no evidence.

280
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,400
If Your Majesty is to make a ruling,

281
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,300
please at least hear what
the Seventh Prince has to say.

282
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,820
What can Heng say?

283
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,200
When Guihong completes the investigation,

284
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,400
he will present all the evidence

285
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,920
before your eyes, Chancellor Gao.

286
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,520
How can a prince's residence

287
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,660
be searched and seized

288
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,960
based on a false allegation?

289
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,920
Minister Song,

290
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,370
as head of the six ministries,

291
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,580
would you care

292
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,400
to share your insights?

293
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,830
Mr. Song?

294
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,830
Mr. Song!

295
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,750
He's asking you.

296
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,660
About what?

297
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,000
Did you doze off?

298
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,640
About Heng.

299
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,270
The Seventh Prince?

300
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,990
A family member of mine has
connections with His Highness.

301
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,880
So, it's appropriate for me to

302
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,940
comment on matters

303
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,730
concerning His Highness.

304
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,000
It is me that General Chu
finds suspicious.

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'd like to prove my innocence on my own.

306
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,730
Others shouldn't be involved.

307
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,000
What a coincidence.

308
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,530
I also have a report to make today.

309
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,330
Your Majesty,

310
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,080
the one colluding

311
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,290
with those from the martial arts world

312
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,710
and stirring up trouble non-stop recently

313
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,750
is not me, but the general of Qianyu Army

314
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:51,400
and the capital prefect
who is falsely accusing me,

315
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,660
Chu Guihong.

316
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,350
Nonsense!

317
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,350
This is slander!

318
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,850
Heng,

319
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
anyone who falsely
charges against an official

320
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,610
will be punished for
inciting factional fights.

321
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,590
Your Majesty is right.

322
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,560
But the fact is,

323
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,530
despite the heavy protection

324
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,480
provided by General Chu's Qianyu Army,

325
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,940
I was nearly assassinated

326
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,200
at the Lantern Festival.

327
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,010
Now that I think of it,

328
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,990
I still feel frightened.

329
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,620
Today, General Chu

330
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,070
is confusing the officials

331
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,130
and fabricating charges against me.

332
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,440
So, I feel the need

333
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,270
to make a statement.

334
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,400
Go ahead.

335
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,080
That assassination case has been closed.

336
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,750
Some people from the martial arts world
attacked me in the disguise of Nightwalkers.

337
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,280
But I'm puzzled

338
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,200
by two things.

339
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,940
First,

340
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,290
the security arrangements for the festival

341
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,680
were made by Qianyu Army.

342
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,780
Yet an injured man
from the martial arts world

343
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,060
managed to escape
in the presence of General Chu

344
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,820
and dozens of Qianyu soldiers.

345
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,640
Something must've gone wrong.

346
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,900
I contend that this man

347
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,140
was assisted by someone in Qianyu Army.

348
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,110
Second,

349
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,990
the assassin showed up

350
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,770
and retreated without cause.

351
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,940
Besides, he was instructed by no one.

352
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,070
At that time, I already had many doubts.

353
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
But Your Majesty didn't want
to pursue the matter further,

354
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,000
so, to maintain political stability,

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,350
I had to set it aside.

356
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,680
A few days ago,

357
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,070
General Chu made me go to
the capital prefecture's prison

358
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,460
for Shangguan Baihe's case.

359
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
Coincidentally,

360
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,890
some thugs broke in,
trying to rescue the prisoner.

361
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,420
I was wounded in the course.

362
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,880
What bewilders me is

363
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
that General Chu

364
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,220
shifted all the blame to the Nightwalkers

365
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,500
before catching

366
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,970
the mastermind.

367
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,440
Are you saying

368
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,680
that neither the assassin

369
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,480
nor the prisoner's rescuers

370
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,050
are members of the Waning River Crescent?

371
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,310
Yes. It is wise of Your Majesty.

372
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,270
I suspect

373
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,960
that General Chu hired people
from the martial arts world

374
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,070
to assassinate me and rescue the prisoner.

375
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,270
Then, he framed the Waning
River Crescent for the crimes.

376
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,450
Your Highness,

377
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,280
if a man can be convicted without proof,

378
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,460
then what is the use of the law?

379
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,350
Did you hear that, Heng?

380
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,830
Convictions can't be made without proof.

381
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,070
If you're just venturing a speculation...

382
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,110
I have proof.

383
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,130
Bring it in.

384
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,670
[Calm, Respectful, and Sincere]

385
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,550
Bring it in!

386
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,550
Mr. Chu, do you recognize this mask?

387
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,300
If Mr. Chu can't recall,

388
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,350
I believe the Eighteen Prince

389
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,350
must know the origins of this mask.

390
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,190
I...

391
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,160
Heng,

392
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,280
don't keep me in suspense.

393
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,070
Just tell the truth.

394
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,070
Your Majesty,

395
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,750
several days before I was attacked

396
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,150
at the Lantern Festival,

397
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,510
General Chu caused a disturbance

398
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,000
in the Waning River Crescent
with this mask on,

399
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,980
and antagonized the Nightwalkers.

400
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,180
There were many witnesses at the scene,

401
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,040
including the Eighteenth Prince.

402
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,660
What else do you have to say, General Chu?

403
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,220
Chu Guihong,

404
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,830
how do you explain this?

405
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,830
I impersonated Li Shiliu

406
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,510
only to figure out
if the Seventh Prince was

407
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,350
in collusion with the Nightwalkers.

408
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,160
Collusion?

409
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,550
General Chu, did you start taking me

410
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,880
and the Nightwalkers as outlaws long ago?

411
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,590
Anyone who falsely
charges against an official

412
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,320
will be punished for
inciting factional fights.

413
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,860
Your Majesty,

414
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,380
it is my belief

415
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,120
that the assassination and
the attempted prison break

416
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,300
were done by Chu Guihong
out of spite and revenge,

417
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,740
for the purposes of harming me

418
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,780
and incriminating the Nightwalkers.

419
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,830
As the capital prefect, Chu
Guihong abused his power

420
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,940
for personal vendettas

421
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,070
and knowingly broke the law.

422
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,530
He should be executed.

423
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,770
Nan Heng,

424
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,590
you're committing the crime
of deceiving the sovereign

425
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,660
by distorting the truth!

426
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,710
Stop bickering!

427
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,750
A prince and the capital prefect
are hurling accusations at each other.

428
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,010
What a disgrace!

429
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
A nobody from the martial arts world

430
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,460
has caused such chaos in the court.

431
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,640
In my opinion,

432
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,310
Shangguan Baihe

433
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,670
must be killed.

434
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,920
Why not

435
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
behead him in public

436
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,200
tomorrow?

437
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,000
Your Majesty,

438
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,790
the truth of the case
is yet to be revealed.

439
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,720
Please don't make a rash decision.

440
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,850
Your Highness is merciful.

441
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,170
I understand that.

442
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
But this case will never be resolved

443
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,760
until Shangguan Baihe is dead.

444
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,890
To prove your innocence,

445
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,930
Your Highness should
oversee the execution.

446
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,140
If the Seventh Prince
truly executes that criminal,

447
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,270
General Chu, you must pay for
falsely accusing His Highness,

448
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,480
confess that you colluded

449
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,610
with outlaws to plan an
assassination against a prince,

450
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,760
resign from your position
as the capital prefect,

451
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,610
and be demoted to be a commoner.

452
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,590
Don't try to intimidate anyone!

453
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,480
What if Heng sides with Shangguan Baihe

454
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,750
and can't bring himself

455
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,200
to kill that criminal?

456
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,830
If so,

457
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,350
I'll take my own life in the court

458
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,970
to atone for falsely accusing General Chu

459
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,070
today!

460
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,780
You crossed the line today, Uncle.

461
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,300
Your Highness,

462
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,160
you almost gave yourself away

463
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,420
in the court just now.

464
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
I thought that move was

465
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,240
the last chance to deter Chu Guihong.

466
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,000
Hesitation could only

467
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,570
lead to a giant failure.

468
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,590
What stands between

469
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,720
you and success is mercy.

470
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,880
Nan Heng,

471
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,980
I told Shangguan He yesterday

472
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,830
that trusting you

473
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,200
would cost him his life.

474
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,840
What you did today proves me right.

475
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,230
Thank you.

476
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,060
Now,

477
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,070
I'm free of moral restraints

478
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,050
when I do anything.

479
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,790
Guihong, why even bother talking to him?

480
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,360
Breathing the same air

481
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,110
as a vile person like him

482
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,530
really disgusts me!

483
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,750
Let's go.

484
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,240
My Lady!

485
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,640
Please eat something.

486
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,310
My Lady,

487
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,550
you've locked yourself inside

488
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,350
for a day and night.

489
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,640
What happened to you?

490
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,070
You can tell us about it!

491
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,880
My Lady!

492
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,000
My Lady!

493
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,110
My Lady!

494
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,000
Yimeng!

495
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,930
[Laiyi House]

496
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,720
My Lady!

497
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,790
Yimeng!

498
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,230
An imperial edict was made today.

499
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,920
Shangguan He will be executed tomorrow.

500
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,320
I beg you to save his life!

501
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,740
Your Highness,

502
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,830
Chancellor Gao has destroyed

503
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,270
all the clothes of Li Shiliu

504
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,160
in the mansion.

505
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:42,130
As for Shangguan He...

506
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,110
Now,

507
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,720
the capital prefecture's prison

508
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,390
is guarded by Qianyu Army

509
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,310
and

510
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,920
some elite calvary forces
borrowed by Chancellor Gao

511
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,160
from the Emperor.

512
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,310
My uncle truly

513
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,830
is a scheming man.

514
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,240
He's trying to cut

515
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,350
all my ties with the Nightwalkers,

516
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,310
so he will be

517
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,720
the only one I can rely on.

518
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,260
Your Highness,

519
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,330
will you really

520
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,190
kill Shangguan He tomorrow?

521
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,640
The Emperor is forcing

522
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,170
me to depart for my fiefdom.

523
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,350
Chu Guihong is forcing me to plead guilty.

524
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,880
Even my uncle

525
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,240
is forcing me to kill.

526
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,790
Everyone is trying

527
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,550
to manipulate me.

528
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,880
But even if I'm in a dead end,

529
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,430
I'll fight my way through.

530
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,580
[Laiyi House]

531
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,750
There is only one way

532
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,120
to save Shangguan He.

533
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,340
What is it?

534
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,880
To clear his name by finding out

535
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,080
the truth of the case he was involved in.

536
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,640
I'm afraid we can't

537
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,040
make it in just one night.

538
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,440
Yiting,

539
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,620
don't fret.

540
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,030
The situation is not desperate yet.

541
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,490
We can turn things around.

542
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,010
But we don't have helpers now.

543
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,210
We can't turn to Nan Heng or Chu Guihong.

544
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,100
Nor can we let Dad know about this.

545
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,120
We can turn to

546
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,560
the Nightwalkers

547
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,400
and try postponing the execution.

548
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,030
Shanhu!

549
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,070
Shanhu!

550
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,920
Shanhu!

551
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,400
Spill it.

552
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,540
What did you find?

553
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,160
Chancellor Gao has sent 200
more elite calvary troopers

554
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,480
to guard the capital prefecture's prison.

555
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,160
200?

556
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,200
That'll make tonight's

557
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,480
rescue mission even harder.

558
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,400
How can we save him?

559
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,420
Yeah.

560
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,240
The prison is heavily guarded.

561
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,100
So what if it's difficult?

562
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,860
Have we Nightwalkers
been afraid of anything?

563
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,110
At worst,

564
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,000
we'll die before Second Master does.

565
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,840
We can be brothers again in hell.

566
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,110
If you're scared,

567
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,680
then don't follow me!

568
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,110
Yunlong,

569
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,530
what do you mean by this?

570
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,850
There are many guards.

571
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,670
You'll all die if you go.

572
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,720
Let me do it.

573
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,000
If I survive,

574
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,800
meet me outside the city.

575
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,110
If I die,

576
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,270
leave me there.

577
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,870
No!

578
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,240
The masters' women are here.

579
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,030
Who?

580
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,400
The Song sisters.

581
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,160
Open the door.

582
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,620
Nan Heng took off his mask

583
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,270
in front of you guys?

584
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,640
He threatened us,

585
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,070
saying that we had to leave the capital,

586
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,830
or

587
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,170
he would kill us.

588
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,280
He addressed those harsh words

589
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,890
only to persuade you
not to risk your lives.

590
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,330
What a model of probity
at this critical moment.

591
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,030
That is what Li Shiliu

592
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,590
would normally say.

593
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,960
But he is Nan Heng,

594
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,230
Great Jing's brutal God of Death.

595
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,430
What are the odds of him being our chief?

596
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,110
Li Shiliu and the Seventh Prince...

597
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,960
Which identity represents Nan Heng best?

598
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,870
Mrs. Li,

599
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,000
don't be upset.

600
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,640
Nan...

601
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,680
Chief really loves you.

602
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,510
Though the way he treats us...

603
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,110
Cut it out.

604
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,440
I don't want to talk about that now.

605
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,400
Li Shiliu

606
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,070
on longer exists in this world.

607
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,770
Chief is still with us.

608
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,170
We need to rescue

609
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,850
Second Master as well.

610
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,370
You're planning to rescue him from prison?

611
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,960
-Don't!
-Don't!

612
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,640
But Second Master will
be executed tomorrow.

613
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,200
What else

614
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,510
option do we have?

615
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,920
There is one, of course.

616
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,480
We'll stall the execution

617
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,710
and clear his name.

618
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,480
Mrs. Shangguan,

619
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,400
can we really save
Second Master this way?

620
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,590
Don't call me that,

621
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,050
or I'll make you regret it.

622
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,880
Shangguan He's conviction

623
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,920
comes from

624
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
stealing disaster relief funds.

625
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,910
If this charge drops,

626
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,720
he won't be executed.

627
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,770
Think it through, Yimeng.

628
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,570
By revealing the truth of this theft case,

629
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,480
you'll make

630
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,350
an enemy of Nan Heng.

631
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,780
Even Li Shiliu is a fake identity.

632
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,830
You think I'd care about
Nan Heng's opinion?

633
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:50,300
I'm helping Shangguan He

634
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,400
for friends

635
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,840
and everyone.

636
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,860
It has nothing to do with Nan Heng.

637
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,880
You know you're lying.

638
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,990
Mrs. Li,

639
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,350
you're wrong about Chief.

640
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,530
Don't call me that.

641
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,920
What's between us is more
complicated than you think.

642
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,180
You don't understand.

643
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,410
I do.

644
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,590
How do I not?

645
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,200
You like Li Shiliu,

646
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,730
and Li Shiliu likes you too.

647
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,750
You're mad because Chief lied to you.

648
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,160
But

649
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,760
that's just the way Chief is.

650
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,110
He just can't bring himself

651
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,240
to say nice things.

652
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,750
Beneath that poker face of his,

653
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,000
there is a warm heart.

654
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,830
He is usually indifferent

655
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,830
when he sees women.

656
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,880
But whenever he sees you,

657
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,210
he is especially happy.

658
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,220
He always has a mask on.

659
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,880
How do you know if he is happy or not?

660
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,510
I...

661
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:33,960
Mrs. Shangguan,

662
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,590
whose side are you on?

663
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,650
Don't call me that!

664
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,000
Stop looking for trouble

665
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,090
where none exists.

666
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,480
It's not easy to find

667
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,880
someone you love

668
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,470
amidst so many men, is it?

669
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,480
Yiting,

670
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,000
if Shangguan He deceives you like this,

671
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,680
will you believe he loves you?

672
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,000
Has he not deceived me the same way?

673
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,750
Well...

674
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,720
It's different.

675
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,430
Yes.

676
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,410
It is different.

677
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,480
My situation is worse than yours.

678
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,300
He runs away when he sees me.

679
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,280
Even when I catch up, he runs again.

680
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,670
But does it matter?

681
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,740
Nan Heng did lie to you.

682
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,820
But you lied to him too, didn't you?

683
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,900
Aren't you clear if Nan Heng

684
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,570
is in love with you or not?

685
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,330
I saw something.

686
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,920
Chief secretly drew
portraits of you in his room.

687
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,880
He stashed the files
about your information

688
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,740
and read them several times a day.

689
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,880
Oh right,

690
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,000
do you remember

691
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,950
those two fish?

692
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,720
When you two argue,

693
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,480
Chief would

694
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,140
separate them with a stick.

695
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,440
Blatant abuse, isn't it?

696
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,520
That's abuse.

697
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,340
I don't know

698
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,950
what Nan Heng is like.

699
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,550
But the Nightwalkers

700
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,680
all trust Li Shiliu.

701
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,760
If he says he likes you,

702
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,170
then he must mean it.

703
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,840
We respect you as Mrs. Li.

704
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,030
You have

705
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,480
that respect now

706
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,080
and forever.

707
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,300
How magnificent.

708
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,080
So many people are bidding me farewell.

709
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,280
It's worth dying.

710
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,700
You look sad. Why?

711
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,080
Are you friends with

712
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,550
Shangguan Baihe?

713
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,320
Do I look sad?

714
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,360
I'm bursting with impatience.

715
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,280
I'm ecstatic.

716
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,010
People mourn the passing

717
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,840
of those of their kind.

718
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,180
Your Highness.

719
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,330
All the eyes of Qianyu
Army are on you today.

720
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,110
No slip is allowed.

721
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,700
Your Highness,

722
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,480
Shangguan Baihe must die,

723
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,260
or I'll be the one to die

724
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,830
tomorrow in the imperial court.

725
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,820
Your Highness,

726
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,760
sort out your priorities.

727
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,530
You're an important official

728
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,460
with immense power and influence.

729
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,670
You must be kidding.

730
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:24,920
[Yongde Gate]

731
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,840
Shangguan Baihe, a leader of thugs,

732
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,880
shall be executed for committing

733
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,110
numerous atrocities.

734
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,880
The Emperor has granted
a written approval,

735
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
appointing the Seventh Prince

736
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,000
to supervise the execution,

737
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,110
which will be carried out in no time.

738
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,940
Your Highness,

739
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,360
please order to proceed.

740
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,960
Verify his identity.

741
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,910
Verify his identity?

742
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,890
Why the unnecessary move, Your Highness?

743
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,060
I'd hate to give you the satisfaction

744
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,860
by executing the wrong criminal

745
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,070
and being punished by the Emperor.

746
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:08,670
