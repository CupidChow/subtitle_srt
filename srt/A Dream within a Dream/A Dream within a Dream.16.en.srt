[A Dream Within A Dream]

2
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,960
[Episode 16]

3
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,150
Are you restless

4
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,540
because of the marriage between
the Song and Chu families?

5
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,400
It's not difficult.

6
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,920
Doesn't Song Yude have a second daughter?

7
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,290
If you can't marry Song Yimeng,

8
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,980
then marry Song Yiting.

9
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,960
There's always a second option.

10
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,520
No.

11
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,590
Why not?

12
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,280
Song Yiting is meticulous

13
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
and intelligent.

14
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,360
If I marry her,

15
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,030
won't I be asking for trouble?

16
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,400
Being meticulous

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,750
and intelligent

18
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,720
are the character traits of a good wife.

19
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,710
Do you have to marry a crazy woman

20
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,840
like Song Yimeng?

21
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,040
Song Yimeng is pretending to be crazy.

22
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,460
Those are her tricks to hide herself.

23
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,800
That's strange.

24
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,080
Instead of an intelligent wife,

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,870
you want a cunning woman
who pretends

26
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,240
to be crazy.

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,360
It doesn't matter.

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,120
What matters is to stop the marriage
between the Song and Chu families.

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,380
Then marry both daughters.

30
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,720
Marry a virtuous wife

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,600
and have a pretty concubine.

32
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,430
Ridiculous!

33
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,910
With all due respect,

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,190
if you want to fight for the throne,

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,750
you mustn't waste your time on love.

36
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,470
With your tactics,

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,150
it won't be difficult to
ruin this marriage.

38
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Why bother being upset

39
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,640
and affecting the important plan?

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,860
Your Highness,

41
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,910
your attendant is too hot-tempered.

42
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,910
He crossed
a high-ranking official's daughter.

43
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,750
Please

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,870
take a look.

45
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,910
Why didn't you stop her?

46
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,150
You haven't learned your lesson
from last time?

47
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,750
No,

48
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,190
Chief.

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,680
It’s not my fault.

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Miss Song

51
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,030
came in with the notice for the
method of weapon forging.

52
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,230
Who dares to stop her?

53
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,260
What notice?

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,510
Don't tell me you took an important thing

55
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,310
like the method of weapon forging

56
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,510
and posted it all over the streets.

57
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,480
I didn't put that up.

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
Don't yell at me.

59
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,690
Who else could it be?

60
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,820
[A few days ago]

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,510
Go secretly find

62
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,800
knowledgeable people

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,950
and see if anyone

64
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,280
can read these words.

65
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,190
Okay.

66
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,830
Yunlong,

67
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,360
find the clues in secret.

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,490
If you can't find it,

69
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,600
don't bother coming back.

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,430
Got it?

71
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,270
Shanhu,

72
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,600
find clues.

73
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,950
What is this gibberish?

74
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,409
Where can I find any clues?

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,960
What if I can't find any?

76
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,390
Yunlong already told me

77
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,600
that if you can't find any clues,

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
he'll chop your head off.

79
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,480
Yes.

80
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,360
Chief has given the order.

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,750
If any of you can't find any clues,

82
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,270
he'll chop off your head.

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
I have a lot of work to do,

84
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,800
so I had Yunlong and Shanhu do it.

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
But I didn't expect

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,480
they'd be so stupid.

87
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes,

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,190
you're not stupid.

89
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,270
You're just lazy!

90
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,950
I didn't save you from
the celestial prison

91
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,410
for you to be a freeloader.

92
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,510
Wait.

93
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,970
Mechanical arm.

94
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,880
Hurry up.

95
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,040
You're so slow.

96
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,120
This...

97
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,680
Are you doing this on purpose?

98
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,390
-Let me.
-How many times has it been?

99
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,560
Let me do it.

100
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,390
You are so stupid.

101
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,190
Don’t move.

102
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,000
Mr. Li!

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,430
Let me.

104
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:42,870
Mr. Li!

105
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,920
You’re pressing my hair.

106
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,720
Be gentle.

107
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,560
S-Sorry.

108
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,000
Excuse me.

109
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:03,950
No.

110
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,480
He...

111
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,190
He...

112
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,800
He...

113
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,430
Song Yimeng!

114
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,750
Hey.

115
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,750
Miss Song!

116
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,680
Miss Song, just now...

117
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,430
Mr. Li.

118
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,560
Just now...

119
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,120
You don't have to explain to me.

120
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,920
You...

121
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,800
It's not a big deal.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,920
Don't be nervous.

123
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,680
I understand everything.

124
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,160
What do you understand?

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,680
No,

126
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,190
I just...

127
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,870
Chief.

128
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,670
What do you want?

129
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,500
What are you doing?

130
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,040
The notice.

131
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,000
Clues.

132
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,370
Second Master said

133
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,060
I must report intimately.

134
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm talking to Miss Song.

135
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,680
Let's talk about it later.

136
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,390
Chief!

137
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,000
The new guys from
the northwest are here.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,970
They're all so muscular.

139
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,000
Most importantly, they have good skills.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,460
Do you want to give it a try?

141
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,620
We'll talk later.

142
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,300
No,

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,240
he's talking about weapon forgers.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,340
Weapon forgers?

145
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,270
I understand.

146
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,400
I understand it all.

147
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,210
I understand everything.

148
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:23,800
What do you understand?

149
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,000
You don't look like you understand.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,720
He's talking about weapon forgers!

151
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,360
He...

152
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,630
Shangguan He, come here.

153
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,160
Hurry. You're just in time.

154
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,040
Now,

155
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,920
tell Miss Song

156
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,270
about everything that just happened

157
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,120
in the room.

158
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,800
I can't tell her about

159
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,460
your identity change, right?

160
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,750
Mr. Zhang from the west of the city
came to see you.

161
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,360
He said

162
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
the lives of his three sons

163
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
are in your hands now.

164
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,159
Please treat them...

165
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,240
Gently.

166
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,870
Okay.

167
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,270
I told you to explain what happened
in the room.

168
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,680
Did you explain it to her?

169
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:16,870
Wait,

170
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,800
what should I explain?

171
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,630
Mr. Li,

172
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,170
you really don't have to explain to me.

173
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,390
I understand.

174
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,950
Don't show

175
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,920
this thing

176
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,270
to others again.

177
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,450
Since you are...

178
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,750
You are...

179
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,360
You...

180
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,080
You all...

181
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,600
I...

182
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,960
You...

183
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,200
You...

184
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,030
Take it as my wishful thinking.

185
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,930
In the future,

186
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,800
let's never meet again!

187
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,750
Song Yimeng!

188
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,960
No, I...

189
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,720
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

190
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,510
I...

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,330
No wonder

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,000
your men

193
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,970
said you're not interested in women.

194
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,240
No wonder

195
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,640
you're with that
Shangguan He all day long.

196
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,670
And that day,

197
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,630
you let me take a look at the wound.

198
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,150
It's late and we're alone.

199
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,750
We'd better keep a distance.

200
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,910
But that's Chief's private domain.

201
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,240
But don't worry.

202
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,960
There are definitely no women there.

203
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,620
The Chief doesn't like women!

204
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,310
So that's where you hide your lover.

205
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,000
What a pity.

206
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,270
My love

207
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,080
has ended

208
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,390
before it even started.

209
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,120
Song Yimeng.

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,960
You're here?

211
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,400
My bestie.

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,030
Sit down.

213
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,610
Have a seat.

214
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,480
It's dangerous to drink on a rooftop alone

215
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,940
in the middle of the night.

216
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,330
Let me tell you.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,960
I thought you were good to me

218
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,600
because you liked me.

219
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,360
I didn’t expect this, Mr. Li.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,080
I didn’t expect

221
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,480
you only see me as a bestie.

222
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,510
It's not what you think.

223
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,150
I...

224
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,000
Shush!

225
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,600
Shush!

226
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,790
There are so many people here.

227
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,690
It won't be good if they hear your secret.

228
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,910
It's bad for you.

229
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,320
Understand?

230
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,030
Enough.

231
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,480
Listen to me, Song Yimeng.

232
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,240
Listen to me carefully.

233
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,120
I...

234
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,200
don't like men.

235
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,080
Do you hear me?

236
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,840
You...

237
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,440
don't like men?

238
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,080
Yes.

239
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,030
So you just

240
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,700
simply like Shangguan He?

241
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,240
Are you an idiot?

242
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,120
If my relationship with Shangguan He
is like that,

243
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,790
then is everyone in Waning River Crescent

244
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,050
blind and can't see it?

245
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,520
What's wrong?

246
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
You don't only like Shangguan He?

247
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,600
Who else?

248
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,650
Yunlong

249
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,750
and Shanhu?

250
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,790
Or is it that...

251
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,550
That...

252
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,200
Those Northwestern boys?

253
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,720
I mean...

254
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,510
Alright.

255
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,600
Don't say anything.

256
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,130
I’m afraid it’ll be harder
for me to accept it.

257
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,600
I know, Mr. Li.

258
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,640
You can’t force yourself

259
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,240
to like someone.

260
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,200
I know all of this.

261
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,630
I really know.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,900
So,

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,200
me liking you

264
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,000
is just

265
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
my own business.

266
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,720
It has nothing to do with you.

267
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,440
No matter what kind of person you like,

268
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,830
or whatever,

269
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,640
in my heart,

270
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,440
you’ve always been the best.

271
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,720
You're the best.

272
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,390
I’ll always support you.

273
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,430
Really.

274
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,730
Cheers.

275
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,630
So no matter what I say,

276
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,830
you won't believe me?

277
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,120
Then I'll prove it to you.

Your qin skills are excellent.

293
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,510
You expressed the great passion

294
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,240
of Mr. Chu's sword dance piece.

295
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,000
The qin still can't express

296
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,660
the decisiveness of killing.

297
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,120
People say

298
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,870
our lady is extremely talented,

299
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,000
but I know

300
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,790
you have your own

301
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,200
ambitions in your heart.

302
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,790
In this case,

303
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,200
Mr. Chu is indeed

304
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,080
more suitable for you.

305
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,670
A martial artist

306
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,790
is despicable.

307
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,440
He's just a homeless dog.

308
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,600
Then,

309
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,440
do you like the Seventh Prince?

310
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,200
He's scheming

311
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,440
and calculative.

312
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,870
He's just a bug in the gutter.

313
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,790
In that case,

314
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,790
only the Eighteenth Prince is left.

315
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,840
Yinzhu.

316
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,360
Humans

317
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,000
can't fall in love with idiots.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,030
They're another species.

319
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,960
Don't you understand?

320
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,930
Someone like me

321
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,630
should cultivate immortality.

322
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,010
It's a pity that my mother is forcing
me to get married

323
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,270
and fall into the mortal world.

324
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,730
My heart is full of sorrow.

325
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,750
I can't find solace.

326
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,030

within one day,

349
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,540
I want all of his information.

350
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,920
I was drunk last night.

351
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,680
You two carried me back to my room?

352
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,160
Did you see anyone else?

Someone else?

354
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,480
My Lady,

355
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,750
I don't know how you came back.

356
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,750
In the skies, may we be birds
flying side by side.

357
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,550
On the ground, may we be besties.

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,640
My Lady, you...

359
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,350
Don't worry about having no soulmates.

360
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,590

362
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,640
My Lady,

363
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
what's wrong?

364
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,960
You're rambling while looking like

365
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,110
you've lost your soul.

366
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,640
What should we do?

367
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
How could Li Shiliu

368
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,000
do this to you?

369
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,680
I think you should break up with him

370
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,480
and date General Chu.

371
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,070
My Lady, you have no idea

372
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,200
General Chu visits us every day
these days.

373
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,350
He's about to flatten our doorsteps.

374
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,790
How about

375
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,640
you meet him?

376
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,750
Meet him.

377
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,830
What a bad idea!

378
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,480
You're treating him like a backup.

379
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,350
What?

380
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,480
Forget about that.

381
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,000
You can't be depressed forever.

382
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,430
The best way is to heal a broken heart

383
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,160
is to cut off the old relationship

384
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
and start a new one.

385
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,000
If you don't like someone,

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,800
you have to reject them clearly.

387
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,030
Acting hesitant and ambiguous

388
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,400
is scumbag behavior.

389
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,500
Anyway, I've thought it through.

390
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,830
I will definitely break off

391
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,500
the engagement with Chu Guihong.

392
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,110
I won't get him involved.

393
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,110
Regardless of the fact that the marriage
is an imperial edict,

394
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,440
My Lady, think about it.

395
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,070
You've only liked Li Shiliu for a few days

396
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,720
and you’ve become like this.

397
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,480
Mr. Chu has liked you
for a dozen years.

398
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,790
Will he do something extreme?

399
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,270
Bravo!

400
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,030
Bravo!

401
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,110
What's going on?

402
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,310
Who are these people?

403
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,200
Mr. Chu,

404
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,400
what's this for?

405
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,970
The Waning River Crescent

406
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,140
posted notices without authorization.

407
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,790
The capital prefecture's office

408
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,400
is here to investigate.

409
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,350
Ridiculous.

410
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,910
What shop in capital doesn't post notices?

411
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,030
Mr. Chu paid a visit

412
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,590
just for

413
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,090
this small matter.

414
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,250
Tell Li Shiliu to come out.

415
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,250
Chief is not here.

416
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,550
I make the decisions

417
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,320
for Waning River Crescent.

418
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,640
Since Li Shiliu is not here,

419
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
we'll take you back to
the capital prefecture's office.

420
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,160
Guards!

421
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,830
Stop!

422
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,030
Mr. Chu,

423
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,590
didn’t we work together
on restorations a few days ago?

424
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,250
What's this supposed to mean?

425
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,480
The Qianyu Army received a report.

426
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,690
Last night at midnight,

427
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,750
you sneaked into the Song Residence.

428
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,130
Mr. Li,

429
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,180
can you explain

430
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,160
why you flipped over

431
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
the wall at midnight and even entered

432
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,240
the women's ward?

433
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
Mr. Chu,

434
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,720
didn’t you just say it's about us posting

435
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,310
notices without authorization?

436
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,640
Why is it about me breaking into
the Song Residence now?

437
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,240
I've been in and out of there many times,

438
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,600
but no one reported it to the officials.

439
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,470
I think

440
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,810
you brought so many people here today

441
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,550
to make a scene, right?

442
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,300
So what?

443
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,940
You told Yimeng to break off
the engagement with me.

444
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,070
Song Yimeng wants to
break off the engagement?

445
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,450
Stop pretending.

446
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,720
Yimeng is getting married with me.

447
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,960
Please stay away from her.

448
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,000
What if I refuse?

449
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,790
[Invitation]

450
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,520
The wedding invitation is here.

451
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,030
No matter how unwilling you are,

452
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,960
don't forget to come to our wedding.

453
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,790
I've been on the battlefield for years.

454
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,920
She has been waiting for me for years.

455
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,970
The wedding date

456
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,270
was decided by Mr. Song and His Majesty.

457
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,640
Li Shiliu,

458
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,640
no matter how capable you are,

459
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,240
you will never affect this marriage.

460
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,790
Mr. Chu,

461
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,900
since you are so confident,

462
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,400
let's make a bet.

463
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,240
I bet I can force you to

464
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
cancel

465
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,510
this engagement within 10 days.

466
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,130
[There will be a banquet at my residence
on March 18—Chu Guihong]

467
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,920
Didn't you just say yesterday

468
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,350
you didn't want to get
Song Yimeng involved?

469
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,210
Why did you make her
break off the engagement today?

470
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,830
Things are different now.

471
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,480
Elaborate.

472
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,420
How are things different?

473
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,510
Didn't you hear just now?

474
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,380
Song Yimeng

475
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,680
took the initiative to
break off the engagement.

476
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,830
She doesn’t want to get married.

477
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm helping her.

478
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,480
I heard it clearly,

479
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,750
but I have to remind you.

480
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,350
Song Yimeng doesn’t want to
marry Chu Guihong,

481
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,610
but she doesn’t want to marry you either.

482
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,200
Let me put it this way.

483
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,480
She might've considered you
before yesterday,

484
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,440
but now,

485
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,410
because of our relationship,

486
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,240
I don't think so anymore.

487
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,590
Why are you so upset?

488
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,440
Listen.

489
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,850
From now on, stay three steps away

490
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,400
when talking to me.

491
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,200
Otherwise,

492
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
I'll stuff you back
into the celestial prison

493
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,070
like how I pulled you out before.

494
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,880
Understand?

495
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,070
Yes, yes.

496
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,030
You talk about sending me back every day.

497
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,760
You don't even spice things up.

498
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,620
No wonder you can't even
handle Song Yimeng.

499
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,830
[Song Residence]

500
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,460
You help me break off the engagement?

501
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,680
Do you think I'm a fool,

502
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,540
Your Highness?

503
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,160
If I break off the engagement
with Chu Guihong

504
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,640
and then marry you,

505
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,240
I'll be the one doing

506
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,680
all the offensive things.

507
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
You, on the other hand,

508
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,480
will get all the benefits
of a political marriage

509
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,000
and attacking your enemy.

510
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,650
Wake up, Your Highness.

511
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,030
Stop dreaming.

512
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,830
Song Yimeng,

513
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,510
when can you

514
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,480
be honest with me?

515
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,230
Am I not being honest?

516
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,750
I am.

517
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,200
Here.

518
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,760
Look at this.

519
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,750
The mechanical arm?

520
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,090
What did you do to him?

521
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,830
In your heart,

522
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,070
I'm just a cruel and merciless person.

523
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,690
All of this is normal for me.

524
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,830
Now,

525
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,980
I've only made him suffer a little.

526
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,660
But as long as I want to,

527
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,680
I can kill him anytime.

528
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,040
What makes you think

529
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,190
you can threaten me with him?

530
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,920
Stop pretending with me.

531
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,680
I have many spies in the capital.

532
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,960
I know clearly when you went to

533
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,290
Waning River Crescent,

534
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,750
and when you left.

535
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,540
As long as I want to,

536
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,480
I can also find out

537
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
what you said

538
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,430
to Li Shiliu.

539
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,260
As a prince,

540
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,580
you're really rich and idle.

541
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,720
Is a martial artist

542
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,790
worth all your efforts?

543
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,150
It's not him I care about.

544
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,310
It's you.

545
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,110
If you marry Chu Guihong,

546
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,200
the Song family

547
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,600
will definitely fall into Nan Rui's hands.

548
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,830
I'm doing this

549
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,440
to protect myself.

550
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,480
Now, Chu Guihong is holding

551
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,720
a sword over my head.

552
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,400
How can I just sit by and do nothing?

553
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,040
That's why you're threatening me
with Li Shiliu?

554
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,240
How despicable.

555
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,900
Whatever you say.

556
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,270
Anyway,

557
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,680
you have to listen to me.

558
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,830
Stop!

559
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,010
Do you really care about
Li Shiliu this much?

560
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,440
Could it be...

561
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,240
you like him?

562
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,060
Yes.

563
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,110
That's right.

564
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,680
I like him.

565
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,840
What does it have to do with you?

566
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,440
You like him so much

567
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,620
that you're not afraid

568
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,980
I'm manipulating you?

569
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,700
He won't like me anyway.

570
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,790
You can manipulate me however you want.

571
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,070
What if he likes you?

572
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,550
Would you marry him?

573
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,110
Hey,

574
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,570
are you really this bored?

575
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,870
Does this have anything to do with you?

576
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,330
It has nothing to do with me,

577
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,050
but...

578
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,450
I heard that Li Shiliu

579
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:06,240
and Shangguan He, the Second Master

580
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,000
of Waning River Crescent...

581
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,160
Shut up.

582
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,790
Don't worry about this.

583
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,040
Breaking off the engagement

584
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,830
is not that easy to do.

585
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,510
Give me some time

586
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,810
to think about it.

587
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,230
But before that,

588
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,160
if you dare to hurt Li Shiliu,

589
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,570
I'll make you die with me.

590
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,480
I'll keep my promise.

591
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,200
You hear me?

592
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:58,160
I thought you'd have to show up
personally as Li Shiliu.

593
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,120
Unexpectedly,

594
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,720
you only used one arm

595
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
and Song Yimeng agreed to do the rest.

596
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,070
Why are you still unhappy?

597
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,730
It's not that I'm unhappy.

598
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,160
I just think it's too smooth.

599
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,380
It's strange.

600
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
Doesn't Song Yimeng think

601
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
Li Shiliu and a loser like you...

602
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,130
Have that kind of relationship?

603
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,960
Then why would she be threatened by me

604
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,620
and break off the engagement?

605
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,440
If it weren't for a loser like me,

606
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,680
Song Yimeng wouldn't have

607
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,290
realized her feelings.

608
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,480
Look,

609
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,350
she knows it's impossible with Li Shiliu,

610
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,010
but she still protects him
without hesitation.

611
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,280
This is love.

612
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,030
Your Highness,

613
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,570
you finally understand love.

614
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,960
[Peace and Serenity]

615
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,380
Anyway,

616
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,470
this is the situation.

617
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,310
I won't marry

618
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,640
someone I don't like.

619
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,720
Father,

620
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,150
I think you should

621
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,730
break off the engagement.

622
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:04,960
Father,

623
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,750
what are you doing?

624
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,550
Stop!

625
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:08,880
This thing

626
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,830
was originally prepared

627
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,590
to negotiate with your stepmother, Zhou.

628
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,830
I didn't expect

629
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,480
my good daughter would force me

630
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,270
to this step today.

631
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:23,480
We can talk.

632
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,240
Come down first.

633
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,110
Don't fall.

634
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,770
What do you want to talk about?

635
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,960
I begged and pleaded

636
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,160
for this engagement's

637
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,880
imperial edict.

638
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,200
The emperor's fury

639
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,200
can cause a million deaths.

640
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,480
Do I have to watch as you jump into danger

641
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,830
and fall into the Seventh Prince's trap

642
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,430
to be used and tricked by him?

643
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,070
The love of parents

644
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,310
is a long-term plan.

645
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,880
Yimeng's mother,

646
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,680
I'm coming to join you!

647
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,480
Alright, alright.

648
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,400
Stop.

649
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,030
Please come down,

650
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,550
Father.

651
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,680
No need to speak further.

652
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,200
I don't need your help anymore.

653
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,920
You

654
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,200
don't need to threaten me with death,

655
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,030
okay?

656
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,830
Alright?

657
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,880
Come on. Get down.

658
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Come down!

659
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:11,400
Unbelievable.

660
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,540
Your Highness.

661
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Miss Song is here.

662
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,210
Bring her here.

663
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:25,960
Yes.

664
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,480
Why aren't you saying anything?

665
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,770
Didn't you swear yesterday that

666
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,760
you'd break off the engagement?

667
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,580
Are you here

668
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,290
to give me the good news?

669
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,350
Something happened

670
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,830
with my father.

671
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,350
Anyway, I failed.

672
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,000
Oh?

673
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,680
What?

674
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,480
It's because my father has sharp eyes

675
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,270
and knows you're a vicious villain.

676
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,720
He's sure we have something between us.

677
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,000
That's why he won't break it off.

678
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,200
Are you blaming me?

679
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,240
Of course.

680
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,720
You...

681
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:29,990
You're so cunning.

682
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,670
Give me an idea.

683
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,460
What should I do?

684
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,290
In the end,

685
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,190
you still need me.

686
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,410
[Song Residence]

687
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,110
Really?

688
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,920
It can't be wrong.

689
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,750
I paid

690
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,400
my cousin's

691
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,880
uncle's

692
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,350
cousin's

693
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:54,830
aunt's

694
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,270
aunt's

695
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:55,830
nephew.

696
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,720
Get to the point.

697
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,310
The person who came to
the Song Residence that night

698
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,510
was indeed Li Shiliu.

699
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,140
The capital's top fighter

700
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,750
and Chief of the Waning River Crescent.

701
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,120
I've heard of him before,

702
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,670
but I didn't expect it

703
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,070
to be him.

704
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,480
My Lady,

705
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,880
it's been so many years.

706
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,150
This is the first time

707
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,840
you've ever met someone you liked.

708
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,800
Why don't we

709
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,880
go to Waning River Crescent now?

710
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,630
How about it?

711
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,940
Mother has been watching me closely.

712
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm afraid I'll be brought back

713
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,400
before I arrive at a place

714
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
like Waning River Crescent.

715
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,830
You're right.

716
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,780
Yiting!

717
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,070
Madam.

718
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,230
Song Yimeng of the first wife's side

719
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,290
has started to prepare for marriage.

720
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,360
How come

721
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,000
there's nothing on your side?

722
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,920
Do you really want to

723
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,449
make Eighteenth Prince
wait until next year?

724
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,360
I'm talking to you.

725
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,110
I'll ask His Highness

726
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,670
to meet up at the Waning River Crescent.

727
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,400
Is that okay?

728
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,320
You finally got it.

729
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,180
How is it?

730
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,480
With my glamorous outfit today,

731
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,840
even if I say I'm the most handsome man
in Great Jing,

732
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,630
I'm afraid

733
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,880
it's not an exaggeration.

734
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,480
Jixiang,

735
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,710
you don't know,

736
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,710
but this is Yiting's

737
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,510
first time asking me out.

738
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,760
I'm afraid

739
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,480
she's finally broken through her fear

740
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,470
and can meet me with confidence.

741
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,590
It's not easy.

742
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,710
What if

743
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,510
she can’t help herself today

744
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,230
and proposes to me?

745
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,840
Should I agree to her immediately

746
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,670
or should I

747
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,840
delay it for a few days

748
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,400
and think about it

749
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,110
before I agree?

750
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

751
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,570
This kind of trouble won't come to you.

752
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,840
Nonsense!

753
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,630
I...

754
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,490
Your Highness,

755
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,210
she's here.

756
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,300
Yiting!

757
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:14,880
Yiting,

758
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,670
you're here.

759
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,030
Slowly.

760
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,670
Here.

761
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,530
Let me help you.

762
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,920
Let's go.

763
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,920
Yiting, this way.

764
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,710
Yes.

765
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,960
You know the way.

766
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,880
A toad wants to eat swan meat.

767
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,640
The good cabbage has been taken by a pig.

768
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,280
What's this supposed to mean?

769
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,840
Your idea to break off the engagement

770
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,160
is horseback riding?

771
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,300
Your Highness,

772
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,060
you'd better give me a
reasonable explanation.

773
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,030
This is

774
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,580
the imperial stables.

775
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,920
The guards around here

776
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,480
are the Imperial Guards of His Majesty.

777
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,080
If I ride with you alone here,

778
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,280
then within an hour,

779
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,240
His Majesty will hear about it.

780
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,360
This trick again?

781
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,540
So old-fashioned.

782
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,320
How old a trick is doesn't matter,

783
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,580
as long as it works.

784
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,760
The problem is it doesn't work.

785
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,800
A scandal between us

786
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,550
is not enough

787
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,320
to make His Majesty cancel the engagement.

788
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,030
Didn't you fail last time?

789
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,480
You made such a commotion in the palace

790
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,880
and implicated Her Ladyship.

791
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,480
Now you're doing this again.

792
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,170
Aren't you afraid of
offending your father?

793
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,730
I've offended him many times.

794
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,690
Once more won't make a difference.

795
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,480
Come up.

796
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,450
We're riding one horse?

797
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,980
Help!

798
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,110
We're gonna crash!

799
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,320
Slow down!

800
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:45,800
I'm here.

801
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,710
Why are you so scared?

802
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,840
I'm not afraid of the horse.

803
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,320
I'm afraid of you!

804
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,880
Sky blue Ru porcelain.

805
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
Good taste.

806
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,390
Wang Muqing's painting
from the last dynasty.

807
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,890
It's indeed classy.

808
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,740
This table

809
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,440
is Siamese rosewood

810
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,760
with golden thread.

811
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,620
The craftsmanship is exquisite.

812
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,030
The owner of Waning River Crescent

813
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,690
is indeed a wonderful person.

814
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,400
Your Highness,

815
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,800
what's this for?

816
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,800
Miss Song,

817
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,190
pick to your heart's content.

818
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,840
I'll buy anything that you

819
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,110
have a fancy for

820
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,030
and send them to your residence.

821
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,670
Are you flaunting your wealth?

822
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,440
No.

823
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:52,990
I...

824
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,960
I'm not.

825
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,670
I...

826
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,400
Can you

827
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,280
not be so mean when you see me?

828
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,110
I...

829
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,230
Jixiang, Jixiang.

830
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,800
Put these down.

831
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,630
Yiting,

832
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:07,840
I want to say

833
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,940
that I pay attention

834
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,380
to your words.

835
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:12,220
I never treat others like this.

836
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,020
You want to marry me.

837
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,550
Why?

838
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,690
Men and women should marry
when they become of age.

839
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,110
A gentleman pursues a beautiful woman.

840
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,480
What's the problem?

841
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,820
Eighteenth Prince, may I ask you

842
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,710
what marriage means?

843
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,540
It means...

844
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,630
It means...

845
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,480
Well...

846
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,070
Marriage

847
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,490
is when a man and a woman

848
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,510
are willing to accept each other

849
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,120
as their companion.

850
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,840
In sickness and in health,

851
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,620
for richer, for poorer,

852
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,800
they're willing to comfort,

853
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,840
protect,

854
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,590
love,

855
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,710
and respect each other,

856
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,840
never leaving

857
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,320
till death

858
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,710
do them part.

859
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
Wait, this...

860
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,400
Which famous

861
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,120
author wrote this line?

862
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,150
Song Yimeng.

863
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,440
My older sister,

864
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,320
Song Yimeng, told me this.

865
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,600
Miss Song,

866
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,400
are you playing with me?

867
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,320
You know very little about me.

868
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,880
You want to marry me

869
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,650
because you don't want to
lose to Seventh Prince.

870
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,480
If it weren't for the matter between
my sister and Seventh Prince

871
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,000
causing a stir in the city,

872
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,480
it wouldn't matter

873
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,710
whether you married

874
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,880
me or not,

875
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,590
right?

876
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,280
No.

877
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,590
Absolutely not.

878
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:42,840
I really like you.

879
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,840
And Father also thinks you are good.

880
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,030
You're the one getting married,
not His Majesty.

881
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,440
You keep talking about His Majesty.

882
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,880
Are you getting married

883
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,440
or is His Majesty getting another consort?

884
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,280
I... No.

885
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,480
I mean, I...

886
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,630
This...

887
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm sorry.

888
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,230
Forgive me for being rude.

889
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,030
Yiting.

890
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,960
Yiting?

891
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,670
Hey,

892
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,440
did I not make myself clear?

893
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,960
It's only been an hour

894
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,480
and I've learned how to ride horses.

895
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,840
How is it, Your Highness?

896
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,960
Not bad, right?

897
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,510
It's because I'm a good teacher.

898
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,320
However,

899
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,710
the battlefield's war stallions

900
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,960
aren't as good as
the palace's tame horses.

901
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,090
On the battlefield,

902
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,250
there's not enough food for the horses.

903
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,850
Many of them are injured too.

904
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,880
In a battle, no matter if it's an arrow

905
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,920
or cannons,

906
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,480
they'll all affect
your control of the horse.

907
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,280
Don't make it sound so miserable.

908
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,150
Isn't it your choice?

909
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,550
Everyone knows that Seventh Prince

910
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,320
fights on the battlefield

911
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,030
to win military merits.

912
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:41,840
Am I right?

913
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:45,400
Yes.

914
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,880
Winning military merits and seeking fame.

915
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,960
You're right.

916
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,690
You sound sarcastic.

917
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,490
You won't believe me no matter what I say.

918
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,760
Everyone in Great Jing knows

919
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,690
His Majesty doesn't like me
because of the past.

920
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,840
If I don't go to the frontier
to kill the enemy,

921
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,160
is there any other way for me to survive?

922
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,320
Going to war is a dangerous thing.

923
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,510
Why is it

924
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,920
a means to save yourself?

925
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,650
When I was nine,

926
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,280
I was banished to the cold palace.

927
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,150
I'll starve you to death!

928
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,150
I was mistreated,

929
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,350
and went hungry.

930
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,410
I was even thrown into the fire

931
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,080
and had my food poisoned.

932
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:27,340
His Majesty knew about all of this,

933
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,740
but he never cared about it.

934
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,150
I won't kill you.

935
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,980
Chop off the hand

936
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,550
that you used

937
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,620
to break Rui's arm.

938
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,280
Or do you want people to insult me

939
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,260
as a tyrant who kills his subjects?

940
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,220
You are father and son.

941
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,950
How can you be such enemies?

942
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,800
There are no father and son
in the imperial court.

943
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,230
Everything I have now

944
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,620
was earned by fighting

945
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:10,040
through seas of corpses and blood.

946
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,880
With this kind of backstory,

947
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,880
it's no wonder his personality is twisted.

948
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,740
No, no.

949
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,070
How can I sympathize with him?

950
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,860
Song Yimeng,

951
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,590
don't be a Mary Sue.

952
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:27,550
Wake up.

953
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:45,740
We're in the capital now,

954
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,550
but we can't become out of shape.

955
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:48,360
Have our men

956
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,480
practice hard.

957
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,480
Yes, General.

958
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,550
General.

959
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,070
General.

960
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,360
Look.

961
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,840
Here.

962
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,550
I can come down by myself.

963
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,510
Let go of me!

964
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:19,800
Let go!

965
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,930
Chu Guihong is here.

966
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,670
Don’t look.

967
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,440
A short pain is better than a long one.

968
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,550
Whether you can break off the engagement
or not depends on this.

969
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:27,750
What do you want to do?

970
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:33,580
What are they doing?

971
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,230
Nan Heng,

972
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,590
do you want to die?

973
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:39,840
Let go of me!

974
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,650
Do you hear me?

975
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,530
General.

976
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,480
General.

977
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,510
Calm down.

978
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,990
He is a prince.

979
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,610
Nan Heng!

980
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:54,670
Let go of her!
