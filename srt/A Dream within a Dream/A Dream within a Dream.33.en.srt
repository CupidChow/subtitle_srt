00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,120
Nan Heng.

5
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,000
Nan Heng.

6
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,570
You don't have a fever.

7
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:10,910
Didn't the physician say

8
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,170
you'd be fine as long as there's no fever?

9
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
Why aren't you waking up?

10
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,710
What's gone wrong?

11
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,810
Why are you still bleeding?

12
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,120
Is the wound inflamed again?

13
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,870
Nan Heng!

14
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,590
-Your Highness.
-You're awake?

15
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,390
You're awake?

16
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,420
Let me check on you.

17
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,190
Can't you read the room?

18
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't mind us.

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,710
Carry on.

20
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,470
What are you doing?

21
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,000
I need to serve His Highness.

22
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,730
-Go, go.
-Your Highness, it's me!

23
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,680
I'm Fugui!

24
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,630
Let me look after you,

25
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,030
Your Highness!

26
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,870
He doesn't need you,

27
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,980
you idiot!

28
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
Let go of me.

29
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,160
I may press on your wound.

30
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,580
You're finally awake!

31
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,970
Have you been awake for a while?

32
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,600
Why didn't you tell me

33
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
when you woke up?

34
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,810
Everyone was worried sick all night.

35
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,870
I didn't even dare

36
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,000
close my eyes once.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,630
I was so scared
something might happen to you!

38
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,110
You know that?

39
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,310
Yet you

40
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,910
woke up and didn't say a word.

41
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,730
What's wrong with you?

42
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,750
Sorry.

43
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,290
Did I hurt you?

44
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,950
-You scared the hell out of me.
-I'm sorry.

45
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,750
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,860
You think "sorry" fixes everything?

48
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,409
You think that's enough?

49
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,480
Okay, okay.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,170
I made you worry.

51
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,190
Don't bite, don't bite.

52
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,330
If you ever lie to me again,

53
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,690
I'll bite you to death.

54
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,190
Fine.

55
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,270
I won't do it again.

56
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,870
You scared the hell out of me.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,070
Just now,

58
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,750
the two of them

59
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,190
were…

60
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,840
Enjoying their married life

61
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,910
as newlyweds.

62
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,240
So I didn't need to blame myself at all.

63
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,870
Look,

64
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,390
even though the wedding

65
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,190
got interrupted by an assassin,

66
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,920
nothing actually got delayed in the end.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,330
His Highness really is something.

68
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,310
Wounded like that,

69
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,710
but still full of energy.

70
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,840
Fugui,

71
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,560
in the coming year,

72
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,120
we need to work hard

73
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,720
and try to get a raise,

74
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,240
but we still need
to be careful with spending.

75
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,100
Why?

76
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,530
My guess is,

77
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,750
by this time next year,

78
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,000
we'll be bringing a full-month gift

79
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,560
to His Highness's baby.

80
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,480
His Highness's baby?

81
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,010
His Highness really doesn't waste time.

82
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,570
Now that it's finally clicked for him,

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,260
he's like a late bloomer
making up for lost time.

84
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,160
Come.

85
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,720
Okay.

86
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,680
Mr. Wang, you're back.

87
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,310
Tie it tighter.

88
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,370
All right.

89
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,190
Father?

90
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,260
My good son,

91
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,730
you're finally awake!

92
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,240
Father.

93
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,990
Son.

94
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,030
Father.

95
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,480
Father!

96
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,070
Son,

97
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,950
you're strong.

98
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,750
Chop the firewood for me.

99
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Your Highness,

100
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,610
you're finally up and about.

101
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,440
I've been bored out of my mind

102
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,680
these past few days.

103
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,310
You…

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,800
Slow down.

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,540
Careful.

106
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,450
It's fine.

107
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,330
You can't even lift your arm.

108
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,480
How are you supposed to eat?

109
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,050
Yeah,

110
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,560
how am I supposed to eat?

111
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:34,460
Fugui.

112
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,220
Feed His Highness.

113
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,010
Okay.

114
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,480
No, no, that's not necessary.

115
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,070
Well,

116
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,920
he's too clumsy.

117
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,230
Your Highness, don't tell me

118
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,590
you want me to feed you instead.

119
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,430
No need for that.

120
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,640
But if you're offering,

121
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,430
I wouldn't say no.

122
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,040
Alright.

123
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,120
I'll do it.

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,960
Thank you.

125
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,950
Here,

126
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,770
open your mouth.

127
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,460
Wait.

128
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
It's too hot.

129
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,740
You want me to blow on it for you?

130
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,510
Come on, you're like six-foot-three,

131
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,040
and you're acting all cutesy with me?

132
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,390
Oh, just blow on it already.

133
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,049
It's not a big deal. I'll do it!

134
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,320
If you blow on it,
how am I supposed to eat it?

135
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:37,909
But

136
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,960
isn't it hot?

137
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Still, I don't need you to blow on it.

138
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,330
Fine.

139
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
I'll do it. I'll do it.

140
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,410
I'll blow on it.

141
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,440
Happy now?

142
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,320
Wait a moment.

143
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,790
Go out.

144
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,670
You guys eat.

145
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,550
I want some pickled veggies.

146
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,770
Go buy some for me.

147
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,670
We already have so many pickled veggies.

148
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,800
You want more?

149
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,910
Well, I'm craving

150
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,200
the ones from that shop
in the south of the city—

151
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,460
Xu's Pickled Veggies.

152
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,790
You've never had them.

153
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,320
Let him go buy some so you can try too.

154
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,550
That's too far.

155
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,440
I'll have Zhong ride a horse over.

156
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,200
You go. Don't send someone else.

157
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,330
But, Your Highness,

158
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,000
I haven't seen you for so long.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,200
We'll be seeing a lot of each other.

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,060
Can't you spare this one morning?

161
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,960
Go now!

162
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:40,840
Go!

163
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,290
Alright, Your Highness.

164
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,960
Can you finally have some porridge now?

165
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,560
Open your mouth.

166
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,890
Slow down.

167
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:12,620
Chief.

168
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,070
This is Waning River Crescent's
expense report for this month.

169
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,130
Please take a look.

170
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,590
Go fetch Song Yimeng.

171
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,480
Song Yimeng?

172
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,030
You…

173
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,130
You're putting me to work
right after we got married?

174
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,670
Aren't newlyweds

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,660
supposed to go on a honeymoon?

176
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,640
What's a honeymoon?

177
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,990
It's…

178
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,880
going on a trip together.

179
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,630
There'll be plenty of chances to travel.

180
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,270
But you're the crown princess now.

181
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,790
It's your duty to help the crown prince

182
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,920
with state affairs.

183
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,020
No one told me this was part of the deal.

184
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,630
I kinda regret it now.

185
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,720
My wound suddenly started hurting.

186
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,050
I'll read it.

187
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,670
I'll read it, okay?

188
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,360
It's just reading.

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,790
Top to bottom.

193
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,490
Don't you know how to read?

194
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,840
I do!

195
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,200
"Expenses."

196
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,510
"Water tank main…"

197
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
"Water tank…"

198
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,720
"Water tank main…"

199
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,550
Nan Heng,

200
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,170
what's this character?

201
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,770
"Maintenance."

202
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,400
"Water tank maintenance."

203
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,720
"Water tank maintenance."

204
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,420
"Yangtze dolphins…"

205
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,600
"Yangtze dolphins…"

206
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,150
"Chui…"

207
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,120
"Chui…"

208
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,280
"Chui…"

209
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
"Chui and Ben."

210
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,080
"Daily food expenses: 20 taels."

211
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,530
"River cleaning…"

212
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,680
This character…

213
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,340
Your Highness,

214
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,600
I can't do this job.

215
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,780
I never got the hang of

216
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,390
semi-cursive script in school.

217
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,360
And anyway,

218
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,630
why do I have to read it?

219
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,910
I feel dizzy,

220
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,960
and my vision's blurry,

221
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,510
which means I can't read,

222
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,120
so you have to read it for me.

223
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,710
Why not let him read it?

224
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Don't point at me.

225
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The one who started the trouble
has to fix it.

226
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,770
W-Why am I dizzy?

227
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,150
Because I got injured.

228
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,910
Why did I get injured?

229
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,000
Because of you.

230
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,750
Because of me?

231
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,700
You're just being unreasonable.

232
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,910
It was the script rule
that made you take the hit for me.

233
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,550
How is that my fault?

234
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,550
Besides,

235
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,440
if I hadn't acted fast that night

236
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,790
and told Mr. Zhao to stop the bleeding,

237
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,910
you'd be long gone by now.

238
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,040
Do you realize that?

239
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,150
Yes.

240
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,390
But what about the next morning?

241
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,960
The next morning,

242
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,770
didn't you suddenly…

243
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,760
Fine.

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,870
I'll read it.

245
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,750
I'll read it, okay?

246
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,440
Hold on. Let him finish.

247
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,800
What did you do to him?

248
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,790
Nothing.

249
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,910
What does it matter to you what she did?

250
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,970
Why don't you go out?

251
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,230
I'll teach her myself.

252
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,000
No, I've got actual business

253
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,060
to report.

254
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,080
The Axe Gang

255
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,550
came to mess with us again.

256
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,200
It's just the Axe Gang.

257
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,480
You're the Second Master
of Waning River Crescent,

258
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,630
and you need me
to step in for something like that?

259
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,440
Get out.

260
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,440
Go deal with it.

261
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,390
Get out.

262
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,520
Go deal with it.

263
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,320
So nosy.

264
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,020
Continue reading.

265
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,120
I'm telling you,

266
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,320
I wasn't feeling you up that day.

267
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,080
I was checking on you.

268
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,410
Don't bring it up again.

269
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,910
[Xu's Pickled Veggies]

270
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,860
You got kicked out too?

271
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,840
Have a seat.

272
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,260
Let's drink together.

273
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,530
Looks like His Highness

274
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,550
cares less about us now.

275
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,910
Cares less?

276
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,230
He doesn't care for us at all.

277
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,840
Song Yimeng
is the only one he cares for now.

278
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,600
What about us?

279
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,440
Ever since he got married,

280
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,390
he's been head over heels in love

281
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,450
and has long forgotten about us.

282
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
I've wanted nothing
more than to support His Highness.

283
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,550
But in the end?

284
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
I've ended up in the same boat as you.

285
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:49,840
However,

286
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,840
to be honest,

287
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,550
you haven't had it easy
these past few years.

288
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,550
Look at you,

289
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,960
not very bright,

290
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,010
and always putting on airs.

291
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,900
But your loyalty is truly rare.

292
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,660
You're not so bad yourself.

293
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,360
Without your help these years,

294
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,720
His Highness wouldn't
have made a comeback

295
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,320
and become the crown prince.

296
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,990
I can't take credit for that.

297
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,960
I only did all those things

298
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,830
because Chief forced me to.

299
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,110
I just wanted to coast through life.

300
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,130
If I'd known we'd both end up
in the same boat,

301
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,370
I wouldn't have wasted time
butting heads with you.

302
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,600
You mean that?

303
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:29,960
Of course.

304
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,430
Shangguan,

305
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,000
here's to you.

306
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,000
In the past,

307
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,440
I was being petty.

308
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,130
I have to admit

309
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,620
you're quite capable.

310
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,100
You flatter me, Fugui.

311
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,360
In this world,

312
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,200
there aren't many sincere people.

313
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,120
But you

314
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,960
deserve to be called my friend.

315
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
Here's to you.

316
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,260
It's a great honor for someone like me

317
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,560
to be friends with you,

318
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,630
a famous figure in the martial world.

319
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,840
I'm just a nobody.

320
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,000
I never thought I'd be drinking

321
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,790
with the Deputy General

322
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,960
of the Xuanjia Army.

323
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,550
Cheers!

324
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,320
Cheers!

325
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,670
We've been

326
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,390
through hard times together.

327
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,120
Why don't we become sworn brothers?

328
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,050
Sworn brothers?

329
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,480
Sure.

330
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,150
Two poor souls

331
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,230
and one pot of wine.

332
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,270
Well,

333
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,630
no time like the present.

334
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,300
From this day forward,

335
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,450
we'll call each other brothers.

336
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,440
Cheers!

337
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,840
I swear,

338
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,750
from now on,

339
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,690
your friends are my friends,

340
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:41,910
and your enemies

341
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,030
are my enemies.

342
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,960
I swear,

343
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,000
from this day forward,

344
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,450
Shangguan and I

345
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,750
will stay single forever

346
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,610
and dedicate our lives
to protecting His Highness.

347
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,480
What's wrong?

348
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,150
Why do we need to stay single forever?

349
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,150
What do you think?

350
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,440
Look at His Highness.

351
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,790
Ever since the wedding,

352
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,450
he's been ignoring both of us.

353
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
That's why the two of us

354
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,849
must never be the kind of men
who abandon friends for women.

355
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:07,569
Okay, fine, I get that.

356
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,810
But don't you think "stay single forever"

357
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,569
sounds a bit dramatic?

358
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,339
What do you mean, Shangguan?

359
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,599
Are you already in love with someone?

360
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,310
No!

361
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,829
No?

362
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,940
Is she

363
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,240
Miss Song Yiting?

364
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,790
No!

365
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,680
I knew it!

366
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
No wonder Yunlong and Shanhu call her

367
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,600
Mrs. Shangguan every time they see her.

368
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,510
So

369
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,400
you two are secretly engaged, aren't you?

370
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,510
No, no, no!

371
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,160
Fine.

372
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,310
You

373
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
and His Highness,

374
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,600
you two,

375
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,990
well done!

376
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:43,580
Have you ever considered my feelings?

377
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,270
Fine.

378
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,100
From this day forward,

379
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,680
I, Fugui, am sworn enemies
with the Songs!

380
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,060
Drink by yourself!

381
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,160
The magic of love spins and spins.

382
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,350
Thinking of you
makes me burst with joy day and night.

383
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,880
But I'm worried that

384
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,750
love only lasts a moment…

385
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,750
You're done washing?

386
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,680
Father.

387
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,960
Father.

388
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,720
There are so many things
I've wanted to ask you today.

389
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,480
Go ahead.

390
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
During the Pingrong Battle,

391
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,840
many soldiers
witnessed your death in battle.

392
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,270
How come you're still alive?

393
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,640
And if you were alive,

394
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,960
why didn't you come back for me?

395
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,050
Do you know that

396
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,720
I, Rong Hua,

397
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
and all the Qianyu soldiers
have been waiting for you?

398
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,160
I knew you'd ask me
these questions sooner or later.

399
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,550
But first,

400
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,810
you have to understand
the logic of my character

401
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
and how hard it's been for me.

402
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Father,

403
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,280
what do you mean?

404
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,350
Who am I?

405
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,480
An invincible commander of Great Jing,

406
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,830
undefeated on battlefields for decades.

407
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,960
Everyone had high expectations of me.

408
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,820
But I personally caused

409
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,920
the tragedy at Pingrong.

410
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,200
When I woke up,

411
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,680
I truly wished I had died

412
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,540
rather than go on living in shame.

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,270
You understand how I felt, don't you?

414
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,100
I do, Father.

415
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,790
But the shame of defeat

416
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,050
weighs just as heavily
on all the Qianyu soldiers.

417
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,710
No matter what, you shouldn't

418
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,350
have abandoned
the Qianyu Army in the capital.

419
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,740
Do you have any idea

420
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,240
what kind of hell we've been through?

421
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,310
Of course I do.

422
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,350
The truth is…

423
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,440
I struggled with it

424
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,820
more than you can imagine.

425
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,060
But Guihong,

426
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,750
under the wings of Lord Qianyu,

427
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,820
you could never truly stand tall.

428
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,070
Only by stepping away

429
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,830
could I give you the space to grow.

430
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,690
Look at you now.

431
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,280
Aren't you doing just fine?

432
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,370
As your father,

433
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm genuinely proud of you.

434
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,080
You truly mean that, Father?

435
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you truly…

436
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,550
proud of me?

437
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,860
Creating you

438
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,680
is what I'm most proud of in my life.

439
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,260
In the past 20 years,

440
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,080
you've never acknowledged me like that.

441
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,010
It's different now.

442
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,000
If not for you,

443
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,640
I'd still be hesitating about coming.

444
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,250
One day,
the two of us, father and son,

445
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,680
will take back everything

446
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,880
Nan Heng took from us.

447
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,480
30 taels of this.

448
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,270
Eggs.

449
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,830
20 taels.

450
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,960
Eat something.

451
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,000
Sesame oil.

452
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,790
Eggs.

453
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,200
20…

454
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,260
Have some water.

455
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,940
Don't talk to me. Be quiet.

456
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,440
Sugar.

457
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,660
What was the amount again?

458
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,500
This is your fault!

459
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,000
I was doing just fine with the math.

460
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,550
Then you talked,

461
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,240
and I lost track of everything.

462
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,550
How is this my fault?

463
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,480
I've already told you

464
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,790
I don't like reading Archaic Chinese,

465
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,100
and I hate math.

466
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,920
But you still… you still forced me

467
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,780
to deal with your stupid ledgers.

468
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,810
You're getting impatient already?

469
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,070
I just wanted

470
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:59,600
to spend more time with you.

471
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,720
Besides,

472
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,050
you're the crown princess now.

473
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,240
Someday you'll be Empress,

474
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,440
Mother of the Nation.

475
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,880
I just wanted you

476
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,680
to learn more about my world.

477
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,880
It's not a bad thing.

478
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,400
I quit.

479
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,110
I don't want
to be the crown princess anymore.

480
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,310
Find someone else.

481
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,390
What do you mean
you don't want to be the crown princess?

482
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,880
You've made me so upset

483
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,740
that my wound is starting to hurt.

484
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,290
You're not worried at all?

485
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,480
Go on.

486
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Keep acting.

487
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,750
I'll just watch you act.

488
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,310
I really don’t know what to do with you.

489
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,880
Fine.

490
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,720
Let's call it a day

491
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,920
if you don't want to learn anymore.

492
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,380
We'll pick it up tomorrow.

493
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,350
Really?

494
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:58,960
Really.

495
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,750
That's great.

496
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

497
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,640
I'm going to bed.

498
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,590
Come back.

499
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,480
You're just leaving me like that?

500
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,790
I'm a patient now.

501
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,860
I really can't move.

502
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,550
Help me.

503
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,920
Look at you,

504
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,330
always acting.

505
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,590
The blanket is not on properly.

506
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,590
Pull it up for me.

507
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,830
The pillow isn't comfortable either.

508
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,110
Adjust it for me.

509
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,150
You're just

510
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,640
holding a grudge
because I used to bully you,

511
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,900
so now you're finding ways

512
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,060
to get back at me.

513
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,360
When we're alone together,

514
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,880
can we forget
you're a prince for a moment?

515
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,260
Maybe it can feel
more real to me that way.

516
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,040
What do you mean?

517
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,480
I mean,

518
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,480
I want this life to feel real.

519
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,590
Well,

520
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,600
you know,

521
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,970
the iconic scene in the script

522
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,270
didn't happen,

523
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,160
and the male and female leads

524
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,880
live happily ever after.

525
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,200
It feels a bit unreal to me.

526
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,860
It's because this prince here…

527
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,790
It's all thanks to me.

528
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,740
But if I hadn't given you intel,

529
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,200
how could you, a fictional figure,

530
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,600
have changed the ending?

531
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,730
Alright.

532
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,600
I'm just a fictional figure.

533
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,830
But

534
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,650
have you ever considered this:

535
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,570
maybe you're a fictional figure too.

536
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,650
What if the world you lived in

537
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,000
wasn't real either,

538
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,500
but just another

539
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,270
scripted story someone made up?

540
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,510
You have a point.

541
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,480
It's possible that

542
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,790
the modern world

543
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,690
is also just a world in a script.

544
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,620
Or maybe

545
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,640
a world in a game

546
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,270
or a dream.

547
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,460
And the whole universe

548
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,540
is just one giant

549
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,850
Russian nesting doll.

550
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,020
You get what I mean?

551
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,640
Not really.

552
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,260
But I think it's similar to the meaning of

553
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,080
Zhuangzi's butterfly dream

554
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,240
or the saying,

555
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,700
"Nothing really exists."

556
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,480
Anyway,

557
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,770
no matter where we are,

558
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,830
just don't drag me into any rat race.

559
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,310
Rat…

560
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,790
race?

561
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,240
I mean,

562
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,770
don't make me work,

563
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,230
and don't boss me around.

564
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,930
I don't have

565
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,160
great ambitions.

566
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,480
My only life philosophy is that

567
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,710
life is about staying still.

568
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,920
If I can lie down,

569

574

This

594
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,640
is a math equation.

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,160
stands for…

606
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,880

611

23 chickens

613

00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,440
To our new home?

761
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,440
His Majesty will give
this mansion to someone else later,

762
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,920
and the Crown Prince's Residence
has its own plaque.

763
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,000
You don't understand.

764
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,190
No one else

765
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,389
can use this plaque.

766
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,840
Only you can.

767
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,590
Think about it.

768
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:28,139
[Male Lead's Mansion]

769
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,510
Zhixia, Yingqiu.

770
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:23,960
Why…

771
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,000
Get in the carriage.

772
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,800
Why are you being so mysterious?

773
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,650
[Male Lead's Mansion]

774
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:37,630
Your Highness,

775
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,840
everything is ready.

776
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,880
Shall we depart?

777
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,810
Y-Your Highness,

778
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:45,739
what's wrong?

779
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,690
The plaque actually reads
"Male Lead's Mansion."

780
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,389
[Male Lead's Mansion]

781
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:52,460
How did I never notice this before?

782
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,440
I don't recognize this font.

783
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,800
Male lead?

784
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,880
Isn't that what Her Highness

785
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,400
calls you?

786
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:02,970
Your Highness,

787
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,340
what is a male lead?

788
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,230
Could you explain it to me?

789
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,090
Your Highness.

790
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,370
Your Highness!

791
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,280
We've struck gold!

792
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,260
Hurry, hurry!

793
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,840
We've struck gold!

794
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
We've struck gold!

795
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,110
This is incredible!

796
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,920
Mr. Chu!

797
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,440
Mr. Chu!

798
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,000
Mr. Chu,

799
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,510
you really are something else.

800
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:23,920
Yeah!

801
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,320
How did you know there was a ginseng field

802
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,810
behind the West Mountain?

803
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,210
And it's all
thousand-year-old ginseng!

804
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,260
Mr. Chu,

805
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,350
take this. It's good for your health.

806
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,920
Come to think of it,

807
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,050
it's quite strange.

808
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,590
My family has lived here for generations,

809
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,590
but we've never heard

810
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,790
of this land being able to grow ginseng.

811
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,060
That's because the universe
keeps its secrets.

812
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,360
And sometimes,

813
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,920
it sends you the right person

814
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,150
to clear the fog and show the way.

815
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,170
Mr. Chu, we shall leave.

816
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,670
Let's go.

817
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,480
Let's go.

818
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:13,920
Your Majesty,

819
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,230
you've given my second daughter
many gifts lately.

820
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,590
I'm deeply grateful.

821
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,480
Does she like them?

822
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,720
She does, very much.

823
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,360
If it's from Your Majesty,

824
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,880
it's bound to be the best.

825
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,350
It's just that

826
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,750
I noticed a pair of wild geese

827
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,040
among the gifts.

828
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,070
Now that

829
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,130
Heng is married,

830
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,440
it's time to consider Rui's marriage.

831
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,800
I'm no longer as healthy as I used to be.

832
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,800
Before I close my eyes for good,

833
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,070
I hope to see both princes married.

834
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,230
So, Your Majesty, you wish…

835
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,870
to arrange a marriage

836
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,550
between Yiting and the Eighteenth Prince?

837
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,150
Don't you always
pride yourself on being fair?

838
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,410
Now that your eldest daughter
is the crown princess,

839
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,180
your wife

840
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,160
must've given you quite an earful.

841
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,990
If you ask me,

842
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,960
why not let both your daughters

843
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,220
marry into the palace?

844
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,160
We'd become family in every sense.

845
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,670
Your Majesty, don't tease me like that.

846
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,360
Besides, Yiting is far inferior to Yimeng.

847
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,880
My second daughter

848
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,280
is hot-tempered and impatient,

849
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,810
and she's got a mind of her own.

850
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,840
S-She's not…

851
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,190
She's not…

852
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,590
I think she's great.

853
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,800
She has a strong character,

854
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,400
perfect for supporting Rui

855
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,880
and straightening
that useless boy out a little.

856
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,590
But

857
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,550
Yiting doesn't have feelings

858
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,230
for the Eighteenth Prince.

859
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,590
I know.

860
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,440
She's already in love with someone else.

861
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,840
Then why did you
send the engagement geese?

862
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,000
Rui has feelings

863
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,440
for Miss Yiting.

864
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,130
From the way he acts,

865
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,030
that's not just a casual crush.

866
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,400
But…

867
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,510
But he…

868
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,960
he can't just like her and marry her!

869
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,440
I mean...

870
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,670
he's gotta ask if she agrees first.

871
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,030
I only have two daughters.

872
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,510
I can't marry them both into your family!

873
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,070
Isn't that how it should be?

874
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,800
That's forced marriage!

875
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,130
You're the Chancellor.

876
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,520
Shouldn't you help me with my concerns?

877
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,230
And also,

878
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,030
why are you glaring at me?

879
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,510
You also yelled at me.

880
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,930
Are you trying to offend your emperor?

881
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,360
I wouldn't dare.

882
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,110
I apologize.

883
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,560
You placed your piece there?

884
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,170
No take-backs.

885
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,120
I win.

886
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,360
You're terrible at this.

887
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,840
This tastes really good.

888
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:23,590
Father.

889
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,280
Don't you think you owe me

890
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,960
an explanation for what happened today?

891
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,670
Yesterday, you told me
why you didn't return to the capital,

892
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,400
and I understand that.

893
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,030
But how could you pretend
to have superpowers

894
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,090
and live off trickery in the village?

895
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,070
Watch your language, young man.

896
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,070
Don't be so judgy.

897
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,080
Let me ask you—

898
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,860
did the villagers dig up real ginseng?

899
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,760
And was that ginseng
already in the ground?

900
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,710
Lying about things that don't exist—

901
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,670
that's a scam.

902
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,510
But I'm seriously

903
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,400
helping the villagers get rich.

904
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,840
But

905
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,890
how did you know there was ginseng there?

906
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,350
With a feather fan in hand

907
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,590
and a quick divination,

908
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,870
I reveal the future…

909
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,010
with the power of prophecy.

910
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,230
If you really had the power of prophecy,

911
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,630
how would we have lost
the Pingrong Battle?

912
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,510
Hey,

913
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:17,800
do you have to keep bringing up
the Pingrong Battle?

914
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,110
It's been so long.

915
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,810
It's time you let it go.

916
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,480
Let it go?

917
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,030
Father,

918
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,380
you've changed.

919
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,030
The man you used to be
would never have let go of

920
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,800
the 20,000 Qianyu soldiers we lost,

921
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,730
nor would he believe in
such supernatural nonsense.

922
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,110
Son,

923
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,330
have you ever heard that

924
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,820
people can awaken certain gifts

925
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,290
on the brink of death?

926
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,230
Take me, for example.

927
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,800
I awakened the gift of prophecy.

928
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,280
If it hadn't been for saving you,

929
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,550
why would I have come here in advance,

930
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,880
befriended the villagers,

931
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,190
and helped you out during your escape?

932
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,890
So you knew in advance

933
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,480
that I'd flee here?

934
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,230
Yes.

935
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,590
Not just that. I also know

936
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,710
you were rejected by the Song family,

937
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,640
that Song Yimeng fell for Nan Heng,

938
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,230
that His Majesty no longer trusts you,

939
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,400
and that Nan Rui
has given up on the throne.

940
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,800
Now you're isolated,

941
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,190
and you feel like no one in this world

942
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,730
can understand what you're going through.

943
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,440
Am I right?

944
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,730
You really do know everything?

945
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,030
You've been watching over me
this whole time?

946
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,000
Of course I have.

947
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,920
You're my son.

948
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,150
Now that we've reunited,

949
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,440
you're not alone anymore.

950
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,590
As for the assassination,

951
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:46,440
I sent Physician Zhao
ahead of time to save Nan Heng

952
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,570
so they'd spare you from punishment.

953
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,590
Also,

954
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,490
I sent letters to Rong Hua

955
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,850
and Nan Rui yesterday.

956
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,070
From now on,

957
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
you'll have nothing to worry about.

958
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,920
Father, you've really done so much for me.

959
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,840
I'm sorry.

960
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,670
I failed to carry out

961
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:09,200
the responsibilities
you entrusted me with.

962
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,190
I've let you down.

963
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,960
As long as you trust me,

964
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,280
nothing else matters.

965
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,440
Guihong,

966
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:22,170
His Majesty seems
to have turned his back on you,

967
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,070
but once something happens to him,

968
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,300
that will be our chance

969
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,200
to make a comeback.

970
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,280
Something will happen to His Majesty?

971
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,070
Father,

972
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,130
do you know something?

973
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,730
Some secrets cannot be revealed.

974
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,630
Son,

975
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,700
just wait for the good news.
