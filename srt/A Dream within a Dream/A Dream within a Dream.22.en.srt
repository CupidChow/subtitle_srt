the capital prefecture's office is handling a case.

5
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,590
How dare you obstruct us?

6
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,320
So what if it's the capital prefecture's office?

7
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,320
Without my approval today,

8
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,639
you won't take anyone away.

9
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,970
What if I insist on taking him away today?

10
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,120

Li Shiliu,

13
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,710
I'm taking him back

14
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,590
to investigate an old case.

15
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,860
If he isn't Shangguan Baihe,

16
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,660
I will release him.

17
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,570
But if he is—

18
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,070
sorry—

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,480

Calm down.

It's alright, Chief.

The innocent have nothing to fear.

26
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,000
Since I'm innocent,

27
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,020
what harm is there in going with him?

28
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,780

On the way here,

if you wanted to see me one last time.

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,670

97
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
It's where my father

98
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,690
and Yimeng's mother pledged their love.

99
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,430
That day,

100
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,520
it was also snowing heavily.

101
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,770
I didn't listen to my father

102
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,230
and wait in the corridor;

103
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,800
I sneaked into the hall.

104
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,800
Unexpectedly,

105
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,460
I saw my father crying.

106
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,000
Since I was old enough to remember things,

107
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,480
my mother told me

108
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,700
Yimeng's mother came from a humble background.

109
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,950
But that day,

110
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,110
I was curious for the first time—

111
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,570
what kind of love

112
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,760
could make a proud Minister of War

113
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,159
hold his late wife's memorial tablet

114
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,630
in this broken house

115
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,520
and cry uncontrollably?

116
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,020
I understand what you're saying.

117
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,950
You want to find someone

118
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,430
like your father.

119
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
But Miss Song,

120
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,170
can we talk about this another day?

121
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,040
Without a soulmate,

122
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,240
wandering the world alone is fine.

123
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,120
But after meeting you,

124
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,340
I feel that

125
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,250
spending time with you

126
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
would be a good thing.

127
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,120
Mr. Li,

128
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,830
I don't know

129
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,830
what I like about you.

130
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,049
Maybe I just don't want to enter a blind marriage

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,720
with someone I don't love.

132
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,400
That man

133
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,549
matches my status,

134
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,030
but it's only a match of status.

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,080
Having witnessed true love,

136
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,930
how could one settle for less?

137
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,700
Mr. Li,

138
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,600
are you the one I should wait for?

139
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,550
Miss Song,

140
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,960
I can't

141
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,360

142
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,410
How about this?

143
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
Wait a few more days,

144
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,570
and I believe you'll find your answer.

145
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,400
What if I don't want to wait?

146
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,550
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It's the incense.

148
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,200
Miss Song!

149
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,910

I'm sorry.

151
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,320
Miss Song.

152
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Please calm down.

153
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Please calm down.

154
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,610
Miss Song...

155
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,630
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,620
I'm sorry!

157
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,990
Miss Song!

158
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,720
The snow is too heavy.

159
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,390
Yimeng,

160
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,360
you should go back.

161
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,120
I know the place;

162
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
I can go by myself.

163
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,320
No.

164
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,600
Since I'm already in this world,

165
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,630
I have to stop her from making a mistake.

166
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,440
Otherwise,

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,060
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

168
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,390
Miss Song!

169
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,270
Miss Song!

170
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,150
If you don't want to marry Nan Rui, there are plenty of ways.

171
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,240
You don't have to go down this path

172
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
and ruin your reputation.

173
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,240
Without Nan Rui,

174
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,030
my mother would make me marry someone else.

175
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,510
I want the whole world to know

176
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,000
that I'm an immoral woman.

177
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,720
That way, from the emperor to commoners,

178
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,840
no one will be able to control me anymore!

179
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,390
I'm sorry!

180
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,080
Don't!

181
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,840
Wait.

182
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,440
You said you liked me,

183
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,000
but you don't

184
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
even show the basic respect—

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,910
how can that be called liking?

186
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,240
I really have no other choice.

187
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,600
Don't!

188
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm sorry!

189
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,880
Please don't!

190
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,570
Seventh Prince?

191
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,170

Was it the Seventh Prince Nan Heng

381
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,310
who helped you?

382
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,690
Not long after you escaped,

383
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,000
you appeared in Waning River Crescent.

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,070
You and Li Shiliu

385
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,130
are both working for Nan Heng.

386
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,030
Is he running Waning River Crescent with great effort

387
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,750
to secure the succession?

388
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,350
Yes.

389
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,590
But not entirely.

390
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,330
What do you mean?

391
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,710
It is for the succession,

392
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,740
but not for himself—

393
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,200
it's for

394
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,870
the Eighteenth Prince.

395
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,430
The power behind Waning River Crescent

396
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,390
is the Eighteenth Prince,

397
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,920
Nan Rui.

398
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,550
How dare you!

399
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,720
Falsely accusing a prince

400
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,490
is a serious crime punishable by exile.

401
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:28,270
I'm telling the truth.

402
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,930
How is that false accusation?

403
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,300
I see.

404
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,580
You've never gotten along with the Seventh Prince.

405
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,240
And everyone in Qianyu Army

406
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,590
follows the Eighteenth Prince's lead.

407
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,110
Are you trying to use me as a pawn

408
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,980
to frame the Seventh Prince?

409
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,030
You should've just said so.

410
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,520
If you promise to release me,

411
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,550
I'll go with you to His Majesty

412
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,220
and slander Nan Heng.

413
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,820
What do you say?

414
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,440
Our general wants the truth.

415
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,270
If you keep talking nonsense,

416
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,080
I'll beat your teeth out!

417

No matter whether I cooperate with you

418
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,510
or not, you're never satisfied.

419
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,440
Mr. Chu,

420
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,160
what exactly do you want?

421
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,720
I'm telling you,

422
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,370
cases involving princes

423
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,720
must be jointly investigated and tried

424
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,180
by the Three Departments.

425
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,270
So I'll need to testify

426
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,440
before His Majesty?

427
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,210
What if

428
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,050
I suddenly change my statement there,

429
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,910
saying you, Chu Guihong, forced me to confess falsely

430
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,640
and framed the Seventh Prince?

431
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,320
What would happen to you

432
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,040
and your Qianyu Army?

433
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,460
Keep a close watch on him

434
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,980
and wait for His Majesty's decree

435
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,510
to execute him.

436
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,960
General.

437
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,440
General,

438
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,920
are we really going to let him die so easily?

439
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,640
How about

440
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,440
I find some torturers

441
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,830
to interrogate him again?

442
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,640
No need.

443
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,030
Shangguan He is already a useless pawn.

444
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,160
No amount of torture will change that.

445
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,510
So we're just letting it go?

446
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,190
Even a useless pawn can be useful.

447
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,120
Let's set a chain trap for Nan Heng.

448
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,120
A chain trap?

449
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,410
General, you mean...

450
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,020
Shangguan Baihe's capture

451
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,820
has proven Nan Heng's failure to handle the case.

452
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,140
Once we review all the records

453
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,240
and find the executioners from that day for questioning,

454
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,300
we'll know exactly

455
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,970
where the tampering occurred.

456
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,720
But what if Nan Heng

457
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,000
has covered his tracks perfectly?

458
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,450
Then we'll pass this hot potato to him—

459
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,920
let him investigate it himself

460
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,320
and prove his innocence.

461
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,150
If he protects Shangguan He,

462
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,750
we can trace his connections

463
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,830
and charge him.

464
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,400
If he tries to sacrifice his right-hand man to save himself,

465
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,810
we can take the opportunity

466
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,020
to weaken him.

467
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,180
If Shangguan He

468
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,940
really works for Nan Heng,

469
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,110
then the entire Waning River Crescent,

470
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,430
including the highly skilled Li Shiliu,

471
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,030
are all his accomplices.

472
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,360
Given Waning River Crescent's ways,

473
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,970
they won't just stand by and watch him die.

474
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,070
By then,

475
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,550
we can use this useless pawn as bait

476
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,110
to lure Waning River Crescent into a trap

477
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,830
and completely crush Nan Heng's faction's

and deploy troops to surround the Song Residence.

570
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,110
You sealed off the news, surrounded Song Residence,

571
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,350
and even slipped a note into my clothes.

572
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,550
Your Highness, what exactly

573
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,350
are you scheming?

574
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,830
And also,

575
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,070
who exactly is Li Shiliu?

576
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Actually,

577
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,270
since you were provoked by the Axe Gang

578
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,030
at Waning River Crescent,

579
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,630
the Li Shiliu you've been seeing

580
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,060
has always been Shangguan He.

581
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,230
Shangguan He?

582
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,090
That's impossible.

583
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,790
He's just a pervert.

584
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,540
How could he possibly be Mr. Li?

585
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,770
Miss Song,

586
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,750
this Li Shiliu

587
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,480
is another identity of mine.

588
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,630
Shangguan He happened

589
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,790
to meet you under this identity.

590
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,270
I didn't want to interfere

591
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,000
in this matter between you two.

592
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,000
Yesterday I went to Zijin Pavilion

593
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,600
because he asked me

594
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,960
to return these paintings to you.

595
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,930
But I didn't expect

596
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,830
what happened afterward.

597
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,670
Your identity must remain secret,

598
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,740
so you sent the Xuanjia Army to the Song Residence,

599
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:48,410
hoping to explain everything to me first.

600
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,920
Yes.

601
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,450
Seventh Prince, well played.

602
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,960
But today,

603
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
the one who should be talking to me

604
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,270
is not you.

605
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,450
Where is Shangguan He?

606
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,820
Doesn't he even have the courage to explain to me?

607
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,590
He is currently

608
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,350
in the prison of capital prefecture's office.

613
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,920
Please calm down, Mrs. Song.

614
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,680
Let me in.

615
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,920
His Highness did this for a reason.

616
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,440
He will certainly give you an explanation.

617
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,290
What explanation?

618
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,110
That he wants to marry our Yiting?

619
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,240
Should I just let his wolfish ambitions

620
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,960
drag Yiting into the fire?

621
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,890
How can you say that about His Highness?

622
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,030
If it weren't for Miss Yiting poisoning the incense burner,

623
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,830
would His Highness be like this?

624
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

625
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,030
How could our Yiting do such a thing?

626
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,240
It's clearly that Nan Heng...

627
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,750
It was your Miss Yiting who wanted to frame His Highness.

628
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,000
If you don't believe me,

629
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,830
Xuanjia Army has already brought back the incense burner

630

His Highness just wants to calm things down.

634

Why do you

635
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,880
keep causing trouble here?

636

638
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,000

644
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,640
I didn't act recklessly.

645
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,880
His Highness ordered us

646
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,590
not to fight back or talk back.

647
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,400
I wouldn't dare disobey.

are all quite something,

653
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,160
and His Highness still gets entangled with them.

654
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,020
Isn't he just asking for trouble?

655
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,590
You two, master and servant,

656
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,190
have played me like a fiddle,

657
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,610
and now you want me to help hide the truth.

658
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,500
Your Highness,

659
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,360
why do you think I'd agree to that?

660
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,110
Shangguan He told me once

661
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,160
that your knowledge and talent

662
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,590
surpass most women.

663

Since you've read history,

664
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,810
you should know the lessons of the past.

665
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,310
Since you're good at chess,

666
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,570
you should understand gains and losses.

667
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,840
You said all this

668
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,550
just to warn me

669
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,260
that revealing your identity

670
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,880
will only make things worse,

671
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,510
that I'd get the reputation of seducing my brother-in-law,

672
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,110
and that Yimeng would become a laughingstock.

nor the Song family.

As long as you understand this,

677
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,690
I will immediately withdraw my men from Song Residence.

678

you're ruthless

692
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,590
and far from a decent person.

693
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,650
Now that Shangguan He's been exposed,

694
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,240
if you don't step forward and take responsibility,

695
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,790

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,790
According to the Ministry of Justice's records,

758
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,410
Shangguan Baihe was already executed.

759
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:16,610
Your Highness, as the official in charge of that case,

760
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,010
aren't you curious how someone

761
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,480
who supposedly died three years ago

762
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,890
is now alive?

763
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,940
So you are saying

764
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,880
that I should

765
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,150
watch over every prisoner

766
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,620
I arrest

767
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,160
all the way until their execution?

768
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,100
You can come up with 1000 reasons to deny it.

769
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
However,

770
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,920
yesterday, I went to the Secretariat

771
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,450
to check the old case files.

772
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,230
Guess what happened?

773
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,480
The archives caught fire.

774
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,090
All records from those years

775
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,340
were destroyed.

776
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,530
Your Highness,

777
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,180
if you were in my position,

778
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:12,050
wouldn't you suspect that someone powerful

779
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,210
was pulling the strings behind this case?

780
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,790
Every time you fail,

781
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,890
you blame me.

782
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,700
It was like this during the Pingrong Battle,

783
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,290
and it's still the same now.

784
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,280
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it.

785
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,060
Aren't you skilled at forcing confessions?

786
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,070
Then why don't you ask

787
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,970
Shangguan Baihe

788
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:49,320
how he came back from the dead?

789
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,970
Oh, and I forgot to tell you—

790
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,030
this case has already been reported to His Majesty.

791
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,400
What I'm doing today

792
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,180
is giving you a chance

793
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,470
to prove you didn't collude with court officials

794
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,050
to falsify the case files.

795
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,500
Catch them!

796
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,190
Your Highness,

797
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,120
are you alright?

798
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,620
Qianyu Army is truly useless.

799
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,800
You can't even keep watch over a prisoner.

800
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,400
Is there any place still safe

801
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,800
in the capital?

802
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,030
Fugui,

803
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,630
go back and lead the troops

804
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,050
to capture the men in black.

805
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,880
Yes.

806
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,670
Seventh Prince, you're known as the God of Death,

807
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:50,730
yet you were injured by a man in black.

808
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,370
Or were you just faking the injury

809
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,530
to cover up

810
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,670
a prison break?

811
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,590
Even the God of Death

812
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,030
has his limits.

813
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:06,600
Is that so?

814
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,190
It's a pity.

815
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,340
Looks like

816
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,120
you saved the wrong man.

817
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:18,880
Put him down!

818
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,590
Oh no!

819
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,990
That's not Shangguan He.

820
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,130
Stop right there!

821
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,380
Arrest them all!

822
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:46,440
This

823
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,440
is the real Shangguan He.

824
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,840
The ones who just broke into the prison

825
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,360
were Nightwalkers from Waning River Crescent, right?

826
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,230
Too bad.

827
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,490
They're probably surrounded by Rong Hua's men now.

828
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,440
Once Rong Hua captures them,

829
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,890
Seventh Prince,

830
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,550
what do you think about

831
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:06,030
sentencing them to exile a thousand miles

832
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,890
for the crime of prison breaking?

833
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,440
Sounds good.

834
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,550
But General Chu,

835
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,010
why are you so sure

836
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:20,150
the prison breakers are Nightwalkers?

837
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,990
I'm really not from Waning River Crescent.

838
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,800
Someone paid me five hundred taels

839
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,590
to lead people to break the prison

840
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,910
and promised

841
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,110
another five hundred after success.

842
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,150
That person

843
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,050
was a Nightwalker, right?

844
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,380
That person never showed up.

845
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,490
A little beggar

846
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,590
handed me the letter

847
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,190
and silver.

848
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,250
You hired people to break the prison?

849
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,880
General Chu, you must be joking.

850
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,130
I'm not Shangguan He's accomplice.

851
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,070
Why would I do that?

852
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,200
I'm just telling you this

853
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,760
to remind you

854
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,190
not to be...

855
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,550
overconfident.

856
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:06,840
It doesn't matter.

857
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,150
No matter who they are,

858
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,440
they'll only be Nightwalkers

859
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,840
from Waning River Crescent.

860
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,000
Officers, you must be joking.

861
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,120
How could that little beggar be a Nightwalker?

862
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,030
Enough.

863
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,190
I say it is so.

864
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,030
If there's no evidence,

865
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,440
then we'll fabricate it.

866
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,490
Today, Waning River Crescent must be shut down.

867
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,420
Brothers!

868
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,440
Follow me to Waning River Crescent.

869
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,110
Yes!

870
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,590
Framing?

871
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,360
Impressive.

872
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,890
You flatter me.

873
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,610
I've just been dealing with you for so long

874
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,050
that I picked up these tricks.

875
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,210
Now I'm just using

876
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,550
your own methods against you.

877
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,110
Mr. Chu, since you understand this,

878
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,800
do you also know

879
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,030
what the art

880
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,360
of escape means?
