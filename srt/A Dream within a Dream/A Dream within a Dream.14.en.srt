00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,940
[Episode 14]

3
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,400
Father.

4
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,000
How did you get this?

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,610
What happened to your face?

6
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,650
It's nothing, just a small scratch.

7
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,940
Where did you get this note from?

8
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,590
You recognize this?

9
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,030
There's a secret rumor going around

10
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,550
that this is

11
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,540
a formula for weapon forging.

12
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,210
This is actually a pun that means

13
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,480
your "beauty"

14
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,220
stole my "heart."

15
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,130
Father,

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,250
this is just a cheesy pickup line

17
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,590
that has nothing to do
with weapon forging.

18
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,710
You still haven't answered me—

19
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,770
How did you

20
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,960
get this note?

21
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:46,790
Not important.

22
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,840
Didn't you just mention

23
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,760
pickup lines?

24
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,280
If you can recognize them,

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,430
it means you're of marriageable age.

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,520
Black tea or green tea?

27
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,180
Stop beating around the bush.

28
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,400
What exactly

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,810
do you want to discuss about marriage?

30
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,030
Recently in the capital,

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,680
rumors about you and the Seventh Prince

32
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,550
have been spreading wildly.

33
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,240
It hurts both you
and the Song family.

34
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,980
That Chu Guihong

35
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,950
is almost 30.

36
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,230
And you, a young lady,

37
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,800
are already 24,

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,870
no longer a child.

39
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,079
As your father, I think

40
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,460
it's time to fulfill
your marriage agreement.

41
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,800
I swear, everyone in this drama

42
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,280
has nothing better to do

43
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,079
than push romance plots.

44
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,190
Father.

45
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,470
Chu Guihong and I

46
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,240
have only known each other for days,

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,030
with zero connection.

48
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,080
You've to

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,430
nurture it gradually
by experiencing things

50
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,240
together.

51
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,190
I'm just worried that

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,280
if the court ever becomes chaotic,

53
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,920
there will be no one to protect you.

54
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,640
My darling daughter—

55
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,070
Enough already.

56
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,830
Stop with the theatrics

57
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,030
and tell me straight.

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,070
Why are you suddenly

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,870
insisting on the marriage?

60
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,540
Yimeng, oh Yimeng.

61
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,180
Rumors are spreading about you
and the Seventh Prince.

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,870
If it were someone else,

63
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,240
I might consider it.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,040
But he's no ordinary man's son.

65
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,310
Someone who grew up

66
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,240
struggling in the cold palace,

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,800
he has developed such a heart of stone,

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,510
the nature of a wolf.

69
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,000
For him,

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,480
self-preservation always comes first.

71
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,560
All those sweet words
and tender affection

72
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,060
that come with romance

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,190
are merely

74
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,820
manipulable pawns at his disposal.

75
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,100
Treasured when needed

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,170
and discarded like worn-out shoes.

77
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,070
He approaches you strategically,

78
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,330
plotting against you.

79
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,270
I don't trust anyone

80
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,120
because no one has ever trusted me,

81
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,430
not even you!

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,510
You should know

83
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,830
that things are

84
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,480
not what they appear to be on the surface.

85
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,030
What people say isn't
necessarily the truth.

86
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,060
If

87
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
you truly want to understand me,

88
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,480
don't use your eyes.

89
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,480
Use this.

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,460
I'm just worried that the longer we wait,

91
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,090
the more likely
he'll take advantage of you.

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,630
Of course I know
Nan Heng isn't a good person,

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,000
but I can't sacrifice

94
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,720
Chu Guihong's happiness
just to save myself.

95
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,930
Alright, alright.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,870
I may be old

97
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,920
and don't understand you youngsters,

98
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,430
but I can't stand by and watch

99
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,690
you jump into the fire.

100
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,600
At the musical banquet,

101
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,030
try to build a connection
with Chu Guihong.

102
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,160
In the coming days,

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,560
I'll personally go
to the prince's residence

104
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,020
to discuss your marriage.

105
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,070
It's settled.

106
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,230
Father!

107
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,720
I didn't say yes!

108
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,630
It's not up to you.

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,310
She's getting married?

110
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,190
I'm sure!

111
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,630
I saw it with my own eyes.

112
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,680
After court, Mr. Song and Chu Guihong

113
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,330
were all smiles.

114
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,630
Today I give you gifts;

115
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,020
tomorrow you return the favor.

116
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,720
At one point, they even
addressed each other

117
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,650
as father-in-law and son-in-law.

118
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,510
The wedding must be soon.

119
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,390
Song Yude must be hastening

120
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,450
that old marriage arrangement again

121
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,390
so he wouldn't have to

122
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,680
join under my command.

123
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,120
And that Song Yimeng,

124
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,190
does she think she can escape me

125
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,650
by relying on Chu Guihong?

126
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,680
Song Yude is my father.

127
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,100
Chu Guihong is my fiancé.

128
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,490
Isn't that enough?

129
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,120
Do you already have a plan?

130
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,440
The musical banquet
is the perfect opportunity.

131
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,270
I'll humiliate Chu Guihong

132
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,240
in front of all the capital's elites.

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,100
By then, let's see if

134
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,510
Song Yimeng still has
any desire to marry him.

135

[Musical Banquet]

136
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,950
Why did the Seventh Prince
choose such a place?

137
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,720
The southern district has always been home
to the lowest classes,

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,230
way beneath our status.

139
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,410
Waning River Crescent

140
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,940
is renowned in the capital.

141
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,040
Since we're here,
let's make the best of it.

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,370
I think it's quite nice.

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,070
Today is a big day
for the Seventh Prince

144
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,120
and our Xuanjia Army.

145
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,630
Today is a big day
for Waning River Crescent

146
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,510
and us Nightwalkers too.

147
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,210
In the past, we dominated the battlefield,

148
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,920
guarding the borders
against powerful enemies.

149
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,650
In the past, we stood united,
commanding respect

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,600
throughout the martial world.

151
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,630
Today, for His Highness,

152
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,720
we must make this banquet a success

153
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,110
and connect with renowned figures
from all over!

154
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,909
Today, we must

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,840
host this banquet well for our Chief,
and establish our dominance

156
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,440
among the capital's guilds.

157
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,120
For His Highness to connect
with renowned figures!

158
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,669
For our Chief to dominate
the capital's guilds!

159
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,530
For His Highness to connect
with renowned figures!

160
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,260
For our Chief to dominate
the capital's guilds!

161
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,200
Isn't this Mr. Shangguan
from Waning River Crescent?

162
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
What a unique way of
managing your subordinates.

163
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm just working for the Chief Master,

164
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,220
nothing worth mentioning.

165
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,200
But I must say,

166
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
Mr. Fugui, you're usually so subservient

167
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,670
by Seventh Prince's side,
kneeling and kowtowing,

168
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,870
but you're actually quite commanding

169
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,510
in front of the Xuanjia Army.

170
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,080
It seems you've been paying
close attention to me.

171
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,510
Have we met before?

172
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,870
Don't be mistaken.

173
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,410
Unattractive things
don't leave an impression on me.

174
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, well.

175
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:26,640
[Graceful and Composed]

176
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,200
Through changing seasons,
His Highness maintains his grand spirit.

177
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
As empires rise and fall, only
His Highness's vision remains constant.

178
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,000
-Yes.
-Indeed.

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,710
Talents gather from all corners,

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,860
embracing the world's brilliant minds.

181
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,480
Throughout history,
great generals and talents have emerged,

182
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,750
but none compare to
His Highness's unmatched elegance.

-Bootlicker.
-Bootlicker.

What's wrong with you?

187
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,910
Please don't call me Cousin.

188
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,710
I don't deserve it, truly don't.

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,440
I was confined for 20 days,

190
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,080
but you didn't come visit me once.

191
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,510
Am I still your family?

192
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,650
Your Highness.

193
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,440
I was busy renovating the south
with Yimeng

194
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
during those days.

195
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
I understand. I get it.

196
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,870
Gals before pals.

197
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,170
I wonder who it was

198
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
who accompanied you
to make trouble all his life,

199
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,270
who helped you fight battles,

200
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:19,840
and who...

201
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,970
You've got it wrong.

202
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
That's what General Chu did for you.

203
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,120
Is that so?

204
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,840
Chu Guihong!

205
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,840
Yimeng!

206
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,430
Your Highness, I was wrong about that.

207
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,630
I'm really sorry.

208
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,150
No need.

209
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,080
Listen,

210
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
principle matters the most as a prince.

211
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,500
We wouldn't need the capital prefect

212
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,960
if apologies were useful!

213
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:45,870
Also,

214
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm a mature adult

215
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,130
who's had my coming-of-age ceremony.

216
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,910
I'll never get upset

217
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,550
because you care more about women

218
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,720
than me.

219
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
It'd be so childish.

220
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,980
Extremely, thoroughly,
and utterly childish!

221
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,550
Like a three-year-old kid.

222
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,200
Watch your words.

223
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,840
Who are you calling a three-year-old?

224
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,570
How can you insult me like this?

225
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,200
Also, you and Father

226
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,910
both treat me

227
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,510
like a child who never grows up,

228
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,910
never consulting me on anything,

229
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,080
yet now suddenly expect me
to mature overnight.

230
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,600
You get to make all the arguments,

231
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,720
while all the faults are mine.

232
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
Is that fair? Is it?

233
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,370
Your Highness,

234
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,080
if you're truly upset,

235
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,480
let's find a private place

236
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,810
to clear everything up.

237
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,030
This will only make us a laughingstock.

238
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,860
What are you doing?

239
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,790
Mind your behavior!

240
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,240
Don't pull at me like that!

241
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
What would others think if they saw us?

242
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Wait, I'm stepping on my robe.

243
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,910
I never noticed before

244
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,520
that those two are quite interesting.

245
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,520
But weren't you

246
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,750
planning to

247
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,950
clear things up with General Chu today?

248
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,510
The Eighteenth Prince was right—

249
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,440
You're the one he cares about most.

250
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,530
If he finds out you like Mr. Li,

251
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,720
won't he be heartbroken?

252
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,480
What can I do about it?

253
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,370
Feelings

254
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,000
can't be faked.

255
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,840
Better to come clean soon

256
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,510
so I don't waste his time.

257
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,840
Is everything in place?

258
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,890
Don't worry.

259
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,710
Everything is under control.

260
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,390
Chu Guihong will definitely

261
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,790
make a fool of himself
in front of Miss Song.

262
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,720
Come here.

263
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,170
Not you.

264
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,630
Come here!

265
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,280
Sorry,

266
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,320
but being popular with women

267
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,150
has nothing to do with rank.

268
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,390
Miss Song.

269
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:52,840
Come here!

270
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,210
Why are you hanging out with Nan Heng?

271
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,720
Don't you know how cunning

272
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,480
he is?

273
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,880
You'd better be careful.

274
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,120
Okay.

275
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,120
I don't see Mr. Li anywhere.

276
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,080
Where is he?

277
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,390
The Chief is on a mission.

278
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,320
If you have a message,

279
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,920
I'd be happy to pass it along.

280
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,790
Well, maybe this is better.

281
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,510
If Chu Guihong found out,

282
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,380
who knows what might happen.

283
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,580
I'll show you to your seat.

284
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,270
Yiting, here,

285
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,640
try these two dishes.

286
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:35,040
[Big Fortune]

287
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
If you want more, let me know.

288
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll get you more.

289
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,630
The deer calls.

290
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:35,910
All tables are full.

291
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,550
Yimeng.

292
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,270
There's one there.

293
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:37,840
Sit here!

294
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,600
Sit there.

295
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:40,870
Come.

296
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,420
The food here's good.

297
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,540
Why are you everywhere I go?

298
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,870
Didn't you know that I'm the host

299
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,040
of this banquet?

300
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,770
What were you talking about

301
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,330
with Shangguan He?

302
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,700
Is that any of your business?

303
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
What,

304
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,150
do you have a cold?

305
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,450
I'm just concerned about you.

306
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,120
Is the food to your liking?

307
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,080
If there's anything you'd like to eat,
just say so.

308
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,740
Don't hold back like last time

309
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,000
in my mansion.

310
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,270
When was I ever in your mansion?

311
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,030
Song Yimeng.

312
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,970
So it's true that you dined
at Seventh Prince's

313
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,130
mansion?

314
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,330
Enough, don't pry.

315
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
She's quite shy.

316
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,320
Don't embarrass her.

317
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,070
What are you on about?

318
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,790
This must be from Chapter 16,

319
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,510
when the Seventh Prince
pours his heart out over wine

320
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,900
[Exceptional Love]

321
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,770
after the beautiful maiden
sneaks into his mansion.

322
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,150
[Exceptional Love]

323
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,720
Are you sure?

324
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,240
It sounds more like the part where

325
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,790
the young general forces marriage

326
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,820
and breaks up the true lovers.

327
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,720
W-What's going on?

328
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,250
Everyone has a copy?

329
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,390
So you've all read it?

330
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,760
[Exceptional Love]

331
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,580
Who's read it?
Don't slander me!

332
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
I know nothing about any "Illusory Dream."

333
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,120
Yimeng,

334
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,630
the Songs' reputation is at stake.

335
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,360
Don't you have anything to say?

336
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,510
Of course I do—

337
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,070
Rumors end with the wise.

338
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,570
No need for explanations.

339
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,480
Of course you don't need to explain.

340
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,540
You're clearly scheming against me.

341
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,900
Fine, whatever you say.

342
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,630
Seventh Prince, I disagree.

343
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,410
A rumor must be clarified.

344
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,970
Yimeng is my fiancée.

345
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,630
Regarding this novel,

346
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,290
I've been wanting to explain.

347
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,790
Since everyone is here,

348
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,120
I request Your Highness
to clarify this in person.

349
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,120
Neither of the involved parties
has spoken.

350
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,930
You're just an outsider. Why so anxious?

351
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,250
General Chu, aren't you
a bit too insecure?

352
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,190
Your Highness.

353
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,510
Yimeng and I've been engaged
since childhood.

354
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,120
You've repeatedly harassed her.

355
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,520
What exactly do you want?

356
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
What do I want?

357
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,720
Isn't it clear?

358
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,480
You—

359
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,200
Enough!

360
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,320
Will you two ever stop?

361
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,600
Fine, I'll take this opportunity

362
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,600
to make things clear today.

363
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,570
You and you!

364
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,670
I'm not interested in either of you.

365
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,270
What "Illusory Dream"
and "Exceptional Love"?

366
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,750
Utter nonsense!

367
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,670
From now on,

368
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,030
if anyone gossips behind my back again,

369
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,510
I won't be so polite.

370
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,270
Alright, stop staring.

371
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,600
Just eat your food!

372
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,320
Your Majesty.

373
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,120

have always been at odds,

yet she continues to get involved
with the Seventh Prince.

378
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,360
She's calculating and cannot be tolerated.

379
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,480
Your Majesty, I suggest issuing

380
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,480
an imperial decree right now

381
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,920
to severely punish her.

Ladies and gentlemen,

386
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,000
this is the first year
Waning River Crescent

387
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,720

[Big Fortune]

389
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,720
I've been instructed to spice things up

390
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,790
for all our distinguished guests.

391
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,640
Legend has it that
the ancient kingdom of Rulan,

392
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,790
standing in the desert,

393
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,070
nurtured a Seven-Jewel Snow Lotus
within a mirage.

394
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,640
Later, skilled craftsmen
adorned it with fine gold.

395
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,970
Another iconic scene from period dramas:

396

Bravo! Bravo!

Bravo! Bravo!

401
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,340
I've heard that

402
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,880
whenever the Qianyu Army
returns victorious,

403
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,400
they play their military anthem

404
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,640
to showcase their might to the world.

405
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,450
Unfortunately,

406
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,790
General Chu has suffered
consecutive defeats in recent years,

407
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,920
and we haven't heard
that anthem for a while.

408
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,130
I wonder if General Chu is in the mood

409
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,680
to bless us with the magnificent tune?

410
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,510
Heng.

411
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,680
Don't go too far!

412
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,640
As a prince of Great Jing,

413
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
is the defeat of Qianyu Army

414
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,320
something to be proud of?

415
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,180
At the Battle of Pingrong,

416
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,830
General Chu was defeated

417
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,510
and fled in panic.

418
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,560
If not for the Seventh Prince's
clever strategy

419
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,720
to rescue General Chu

420
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,350
from the Heyuan prisoner's cage,

421
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,270
the so-called war god of Great Jing

422
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,400
would now be nothing
but bones on the northern frontier.

423
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,450
Shut up!

424
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,350
Y-You're just a demoted official.

425
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,510
What do you know?

426
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,270
If you're so capable,
go fight them in Heyuan yourself!

Eighteenth Prince,

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,480
you must be joking.

430
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,160
I am but a civil official.

431
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,030
Officials advise with words,
soldiers fight with weapons.

432
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,440
Don't you know this principle,
Your Highness?

433
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,070
What nonsense are you talking about?

434
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,590
After General Chu's defeat,

435
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,520
not only did he escape punishment,

436
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,680
but His Majesty favored him even more,

437
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,070
promoting him twice.

438
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,920
Naturally, many in court and beyond
are displeased.

439
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,680
Therefore,

440
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
I'm hosting this musical gathering

441
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,480
to help restore General Chu's morale.

442
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,770

For this musical banquet,

445
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,930
the Seventh Prince is the host,
and I'm merely a guest.

446
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,310
A guest shouldn't

447
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,130
steal the host's thunder.

448
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,880
Guihong is right.

449
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:37,540
Heng, as the host,

450
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,030
you should perform the opening piece.

451
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,980
Very well.

452
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,490
Look at that sinister look on his face.

453
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,850
I bet he is up to no good.

454
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,750
Everyone,

455
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,360
the opening piece for today's banquet

456
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,240
is really significant.

457
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,130
It's called

458
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,440
"Pingrong Battle:

459
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,750

460
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,880
Fu...

461
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,680
Guihong,

462
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,050
isn't that Fugui?

463
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,720
Look at his crazy getup.
Who is he supposed to be?

464
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,850
Eighteenth Prince,

465
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,790
Fugui is portraying the person beside you,

the brave and mighty General Chu.

467
00:20:59,030 --> 00:20:59,830
Guihong,

468
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,310
why is Fugui dressed up like you?

469
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,070
Why did you make Fugui dress up

470
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,110
like Chu Guihong?

471
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,840
Aren't you deliberately
mocking Jing's war god?

472
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,750
I know nothing about this.

473
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,750
As if!

474
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,030
What's going on?

475
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,310

This depicts General Chu
scouting the enemy camp at night.

478
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,770
Now the Heyuan forces are
surrounding the Qianyu Army.

479
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,190
He's been captured.

480
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,640
What a failure.

It's Nan Heng at the banquet
who's the real troublemaker, isn't it?

483
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,480
Are you really a prince of Great Jing?

484
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,720
A noble prince of Great Jing

485
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,110
actually let his subordinates

486
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,640
humiliate the Qianyu Army.

487
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,120
Have you no shame?

488
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,050
Where are you going?

489
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,280
To beat the drum.

490
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,440
You know how to?

491
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,880
Sorry, just about two years' practice.

492
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,330
Seventh Prince.

493
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,080
What's going on with Fugui?

494
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,510
Fugui volunteered

495
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,960
to perform this scene.

496
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,240
I couldn't stop him.

497
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,650
I only want Chu Guihong humiliated,

498
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,630
not the Qianyu Army.

499
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,150
As the war drum sounds,

500
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,600
thousands of troops follow my command!

Yimeng is helping me.

503
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,190
The drumbeat is all wrong.

504
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,810
How can we perform like this?

505

00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,510
Bravo! Bravo!

560
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,440
Wasn't I supposed to
humiliate Chu Guihong?

561
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,840
How did he end up winning?

562
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,070
I was practically possessed

563
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,670
by His Highness's drumming.

564
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,400
Guihong,

565
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
why do I feel like

566
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,960
Heng was actually helping you?

567
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,090
He wasn't helping me

568
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:22,720
but Yimeng.

569
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,750
Don't think I don't know

570
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,110
why you helped me.

571
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,590
Let me tell you,

572
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,740
no matter how many rumors you create,

573
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,640
you and I

574
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,260
will never happen.

575
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,640
You're overthinking it.

576
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,910
I was only helping you

577
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,400
because of those rules you mentioned.

578
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,080
Rules?

579
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,970
Like saving the damsel in distress?

580
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,750
Why did

581
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,030
His Highness help Chu Guihong

582
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,380
and Song Yimeng?

583
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,070
Could he be infatuated

584
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,070
and lost his mind?

585
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,900
I think you're the confused one.

586
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,030
What was the point of this performance?

587
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,030
To humiliate Chu Guihong.

588
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,440
And who is Song Yimeng to Chu Guihong?

589
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,310
His bride-to-be.

590
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,640
And who is the Seventh Prince
to Chu Guihong?

591
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
A bitter romantic rival.

592
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,830
Isn't it clear now?

593
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:07,960
What's clear? Don't leave me hanging.

594
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,880
The performance we put on

595
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,960
had two acts:

596
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,270
"Pingrong Battle: Guihong Scouts the Camp"

597
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,310
and

598
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:17,910
"Musical Banquet:
Nan Heng Seizes His Love."

599
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,310
I get it now.

600
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:23,160
His Highness not only
turned defeat into victory

601
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,910
but also won Miss Song's favor.

602
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,810
What a brilliant move!

603
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,920
I need to go

604
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,590
add fuel to this fire.

605
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,680
Those two had so much chemistry.

606
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,070
They must be more than friends.

drummed together,

[Big Fortune]

614
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,380
the lingering sound
truly deserved first place.

615
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,510
It's just a pity there's only one hairpin,

616
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,650
difficult for the two of you to share.

617
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,270
Just give it to her.

618
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,960
To be honest,

619
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,790
I have also read "Exceptional Love."

620
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,720
Your deep bond moves everyone to tears.

621
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,640
This chance doesn't come easy.

622
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,110

623
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,440
why don't you personally
pin it on Miss Song

624
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,640
to satisfy

625
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,550
everyone's wishes?

626
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,680
Nice!

627
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,500

630
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,240
I doubt it's necessary.

631
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,400
Why don't you...

00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,160

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,220
So don't spoil everyone's fun.

636
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,580
The music competition isn't over yet.

637
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,930
Isn't this prize

638
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,480
awarded a bit prematurely?

639
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,170
Chu Guihong,

Miss Song just helped you out
of a difficult situation.

642
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,030
It's one thing if others object,

643
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,590
but you?

644
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,420
Or have you changed your mind

645
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,390
and want to play
the Qianyu Army's victory song?

646
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,010
The Qianyu Army's anthem
is not to be disrespected.

647
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,640
However, I do have a piece

648
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,470

From what Chu Guihong implied,

during Pingrong Battle
when Heyuan forces surrounded the city,

677
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,480
the Qianyu Army sent carrier pigeons
asking for our help.

any of their pigeons.

Would he believe you?

throughout Great Jing.

Being immersed in it for too long

716
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,760

of people at the border

747
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,770
What if I object?

748
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,040
The latest update on "Exceptional Love"!

749
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,590
An emotional crisis in "Illusory Dream,"

750
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,360
with Chu Guihong's marriage proposal
creating imminent conflict!

751
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,400
New love or old flame?

752
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,510
Accept or reject?

753
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,440
How will she choose?

754
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,840
All in today's update!

755
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,400
Give me one!

756
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,110
Latest edition or not?

757
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,080
I want to see

758
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,000
how incompetent Nan Heng is,

759
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,780
letting Chu Guihong take the lead.

760
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,360
Great, great.

761
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Give me ten copies!

762
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,400
I support Chu Guihong!

763
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,960
I'll pay to support him, okay?

764
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,590
Nice!

765
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:14,670
One at a time!

766
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,000
Ten copies, here you go!

767
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,480
Mother, why'd you

768
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,960
come unannounced?

769
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,880
If I hadn't come,
what would you have done?

770
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,230
Just wait patiently.

771
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,470
Today, I won't disappoint you.

772
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,860
The Noble Consort has a decree:

773
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,750
The eldest daughter of the Songs,
descendant of a noble house in the capital,

774
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,320
is intelligent and accomplished in music,
calligraphy, and painting.

775
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,760
The Seventh Prince Nan Heng,

776
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,110
young and unmarried,

777
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,880
is of gentle nature and well accomplished.

778
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,760
The two families shall unite
in matrimonial bliss.

779
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,230
So all these betrothal gifts

780
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,110
are for me.

781
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,670
This is too much!

782
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,180
Fine, Heng.

783
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,540
I finally understand.

784
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,550
Everything today

785
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,010
was all planned by you
in advance, wasn't it?

786
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,760
Creating buzz with "Exceptional Love,"

787
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,150
then the seduction at the musical banquet.

788
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,630
And now just as Guihong proposes marriage,

789
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,030
you pull something like this!

790
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,320
You sly fox.

791
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,320
Rui,

792
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,800
how can you slander
your brother like this?

793
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,360
Am I wrong?

794
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,400
Since childhood,

795
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,930
he's always been the most calculating.

796
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,260
Back then,

797
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,710
who knows what methods he used

798
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,440
to harm my mother, the Empress.

799
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Now you're even occupying her position!

800
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,110
You're all thieves,

801
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,510
nothing but robbers—

802
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,150
Nan Rui!

803
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,600
I'll say this one last time.

804
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,550
The former Empress's death had

805
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,480
nothing to do with me nor my mother.

806
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
If you dare disrespect my mother again,

807
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,720
I won't hold back.

808
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,500
And what if I do?

809
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,840
Your family only knows how to use

810
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,320
disgraceful, dirty tactics!

811
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,230
Your uncle is like that,

812
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,190
and so is your mother!

813
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:51,840
You!

814
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,070
Heng!

815
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,680
Your Majesty!

816
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,620
Seventh Prince...

817
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,190
Wait, the plot has changed.

818
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,280
Nan Heng shouldn't be here

819
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,940
having a falling out with Chu Guihong.

820
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,070
What's going on?

821
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:21,920
-Your Highness!
-Stop!

822
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,480
His Majesty orders

823
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,410
the Seventh Prince and Miss Song
to enter the palace.

824
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,920
I...

825
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,120
Eunuch Liu,

826
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,760
the princes were fighting.

827
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,150
Why am I arrested?

828
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,320
Miss Song,

829
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,840
His Majesty has given his royal word

830
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,230
that he must see you in person.

831
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,360
Please come with me.

832
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,880
My Lady! My Lady!

833
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,070
Gently, gently.

834
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,070
Be gentle.

835
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,760
Oh no.

836
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,770
What should we do now?

837
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,580
Why are you panicking?

838
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,720
Greetings, Second Miss.

839
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,510
My father should be hosting
guests at Juxian Tower.

840
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,840
Come find him with me

841
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,660
to ask him to go to the palace now.

842
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,360
Yiting,

843
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,670
is this matter really that serious?

844
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,400
The two princes just drew weapons
against each other.

845
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,190
Such actions

846
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,590
will surely provoke His Majesty's wrath,

847
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,990
and someone must bear the Emperor's anger.

848
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:30,090
Song Yimeng,

849
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,280
the situation looks grim.

850
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,850
[Imperial Study]

851
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,730
How long do we have to kneel here?

852
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,980
Pad your knees.

853
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,950
Drop the act.

854
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,040
Stop scheming against me already.

855
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,460
Who schemed against you?

856
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,130
The arranged marriage
was my mother's idea.

857
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,790
What does it have to do with me?

858
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,630
Yes, yes, yes,

859
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,580
You're the kindest person in the world.

860
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
How could you possibly be involved?

861
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:51,320
Can you stop being so

862
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,030
sarcastic?

863
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,030
This was clearly a fight
between the three of you.

864
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,700
Why do the Eighteenth Prince

865
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,990
and Chu Guihong get away with it?

866
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,330
I didn't do anything,

867
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,880
yet I have to keep kneeling here.

868
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,440
Who did I offend?

869
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:10,320
Can the royals just do
whatever they want?

870
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,550
His Majesty didn't even
get the facts straight.

871
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,440
Miss Song.

[Imperial Study]

873
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,920
His Majesty summons you
to the Imperial Study.

874
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Sure, sure.

875
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,730
As long...

876
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,190
As long as I don't have to kneel anymore,

877
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,030
I'll do anything.

878
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,800
My legs are numb!

879
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,190
I...

880
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,920
Watch your words inside.

881
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,780
I know!
