I have no other choice, Your Majesty.

215
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,910
Liangzhou is harsh and cold,

with sand storms everywhere.

217
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,120

219
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,880
I beg for Your Majesty's mercy.

220

224
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,150

what must I do

for you to spare my brother?

228
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,840
As long as Nan Heng surrenders
the Xuanjia Army's command token,

229
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,960
I can spare Gao Changyin.

230

They are your precious son
and your dear brother.

But what wrong has Heng done?

241
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,790
He personally sent his own uncle

243
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,200
why do you still
make things difficult for him?

Is it

245
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,150
just because he is my son?

246
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,520
Fine.

247
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,120

00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
how are you?

571
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,670
My God.

572
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,330
Why is it so cold?

573
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,780
Nan Heng,

574
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
wake up and tell me

575
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,989
what was with

576
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,840
all those assassins just now.

577
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,360
Nan Heng,

578
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,480
wake up.

579
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,670
Say something!

580
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:12,970
Nan Heng?

581
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,070
Stop pretending.

582
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,240
I've never seen a male lead

583
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,800
die from jumping off a cliff.

584
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,670
Stop faking it!

585
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,290
Nan Heng.

586
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,630
Nan Heng.

587
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,390
Nan Heng?

588
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,400
Nan Heng, don't scare me like this.

589
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,140
Nan Heng!

590
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:45,960
Nan Heng!

591
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,710
We're in the middle of nowhere.

592
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,040
What am I supposed to do?

593
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,000
I'm telling you,

594
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,630
I don't care if you live or die.

595
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,890
Wake up now,

596
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,030
do you hear me?

597
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,110
Nan Heng!

598
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,670
Nan Heng!

599
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,360
Nan Heng!

600
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,650
This is a script world.

601
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,300
Scripts always have clichés.

602
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,370
Nan Heng.

603
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,960
Please wake up!

604
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,580
Why aren't you waking up?

605
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,140
Don't people in costume dramas
wake up after a kiss?

606
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,370
Nan Heng.

607
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,510
Nan Heng!

608
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,480
Nan Heng.

609
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,550
Nan Heng.

610
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,180
You can't die.

611
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,100
I haven't forgiven you yet.

612
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,060
What gives you the right to die first?

613
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,230
Get up now!

614
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,760
If you can't do something,

615
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,480
don't make empty promises.

616
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,730
Who asked you to save anyone?

617
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,180
Why did you have to play hero?

618
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,700
Who needs your protection?

619
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,520
Get up now.

620
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,280
Wake up, do you hear me?

621
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,400
I told you,

622
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,930
I haven't forgiven you yet.

623
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,320
Get up right now!

624
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,960
Nan Heng.

625
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,820
Nan Heng.

626
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,080
Nan Heng!

627
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,320
Please wake up.

628
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,080
Please wake up now!

629
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,200
You're awake?

630
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,890
You finally woke up.

631
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,030
I thought you were going to die.

632
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,560
Couldn't you say something nicer?

633
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,730
You didn't die.

634
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,810
Why were you pretending to be dead?

635
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,840
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

636
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,960
I just fell off a cliff

637
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,320
and barely survived.

638
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,830
Give me a break, will you?

639
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,330
How did your hand get injured?

640
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,150
What's it to you?

641
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,310
Don't touch me.

642
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,230
You got hurt because of me?

643
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,370
Stop flattering yourself.

644
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,030
You'd better worry about yourself.

645
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,670
You've lost so much blood.

646
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,910
Don't die on me again.

647
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,320
Wouldn't it be better if I died?

648
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,590
Then you wouldn't have to cry like this

649
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,320
and still refuse to forgive me.

650
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:57,890
It's too exposed here.

651
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,040
The assassins might catch up.

652
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,100
Let's find somewhere to hide.

653
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:12,950
Let's go.

654
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,920
You...

655
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,070
I-I'm injured

656
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,340
because of you.

657
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,510
Let's go.

658
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,670
Careful.

659
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,640
Sit there first.

660
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,620
Take it easy.

661
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,530
We're in the middle of nowhere,

662
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,630
and you're injured.

663
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,160
Will we ever get out of here?

664
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,400
Don't worry.

665
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,670
If Fugui can't find me,

666
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,400
he'll surely bring
the Xuanjia Army to search,

667
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,190
and by

668
00:39:58,190 --> 00:39:59,940
dawn at the latest, they'll find us.

669
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,000
Tomorrow morning?

670
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,550
With injuries like yours,

671
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,550
I'm afraid you won't make it till then.

672
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,480
You'll freeze to death here first.

673
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,000
Here.

674
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,670
Help me

675
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,730
gather these branches,

676
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,480
and then

677
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,400
find a thicker stick.

678
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,190
Are you trying to

679
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,290
make fire by drilling wood?

680
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,190
Bro,

681
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,760
can you do it or not?

682
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,690
Why don't you try?

683
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,130
No, no,

684
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,280
you go ahead.

685
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,190
You did it!

686
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,710
How was that?

687
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,400
I did pretty well, right?

688
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:22,160
It took you an hour

689
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,630
and you're proud of that?

690
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,030
I've seen male leads in other scripts

691
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,710
who succeed in one swift move.

692
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,920
Well, did your script

693
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,960
ever mention

694
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,250
that jumping off cliffs can kill you?

695
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,190
Did you die?

696
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,330
I got injured.

697
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:44,550
That was from the assassin's blade.

698
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,150
Besides,

699
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,400
I've never seen

700
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
any protagonist in a costume drama

701
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,920
who actually died
from jumping off a cliff.

702
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,400
Ever heard of plot armor?

703
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,970
I have no idea what you're talking about.

704
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,760
Alright,

705
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,570
stop acting tough
when you're so badly hurt.

706
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:22,000
Song Yimeng.

707
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:26,960
I didn't send those assassins.

708
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:31,030
I know.

709
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,400
Then why did you

710
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,480
come back to save me?

711
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,070
Because

712
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,550
I made a bet with myself.

713
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,400
What bet?

714
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,230
Did you win?
