192
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
your left-hand side or mine?

193
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,560

208
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,510

209
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,240
thrust your sword through.

210
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,720

Like ants trying to shake a tree,

231
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,640
utterly overconfident.

This is the Great Jing,

369
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,770

370
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,030
and your Nan family

371
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,840
have safeguarded together for generations.

372
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,050
Isn't it beautiful?

373
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,790
In the future,

374
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,880
when we grow up,

375
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,480
we'll protect the land
of the Great Jing together, too.

376
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,680
We'll ride big horses

377
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,070
and wield heavy swords,

378
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,800
slashing the enemy
till they’re running scared,

379
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,920
so that everyone in the Great Jing

380
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,680
knows our names,

381
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,640
Nan Heng and Chu Guihong.

382
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,590
How does that sound?

383
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,400
Sounds great.

384
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,160
Mr. Screenwriter.

385
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Didn't you say that you could wipe out

386
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,690
thousands of fictional characters
with just a flick of your wrist?

387
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:42,680
But in the end,

388
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,510
you still helped us

389
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,140
as a fictional character.

390
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,830
Who said I'm a fictional character?

391
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,490
I'm the God of War of the Great Jing,
Lord Qianyu.

392
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,550
Then may I ask, Lord Qianyu,

393
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,960
why are you still here?

394
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Expecting me to stick with you
through all the iconic scenes?

395
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,480
How dare I?

396
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,130
I just came to realize something.

397
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,930
You're right.

398
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,550
In this world,

399
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
no matter if you're the lead,

400
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,240
a supporting character,

401
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,270
or just a nobody,

402
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,040
everyone is a living person.

403
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,200
I was too shallow before,

404
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,400
always stubbornly trying

405
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,200
to dictate everyone's destiny.

406
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,750
It's good that you realize that.

407
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,310
By the way,

408
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,110
let me ask you.

409
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,510
Does the script rule still exist?

410
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,270
Why does Nan Heng

411
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,600
seem to have recovered?

412
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,720
Actually,

413
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,920
many things have changed long ago.

414
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,710
Think about it carefully.

415
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,640
It's been a while since you last heard
the sound of typing, right?

416
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,550
When Nan Heng disrupted the original
rule mechanism with a new one,

417
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,550
the old rules like "the male lead must
save the heroine in danger"

418
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,080
and "iconic scenes must play out
as scripted"

419
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,640
had already ceased to work.

420
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,200
Besides,

421
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,810
now that all the fictional characters
have awakened,

422
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,880
the rule that "anyone who
alters iconic scenes

423
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,310
will suffer backlash"

424
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,240
has also lost its effect.

425
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,160
In other words,

426
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,980
now,

427
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,910
not only are you no longer
controlled by fate,

428
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,190
I'm free from it too.

429
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,050
Just now, when I saw the people

430
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,480
risking their lives
to protect their homeland,

431
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,400
I suddenly felt...

432
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,880
Felt like I had an out-of-body experience.

433
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,370
Yeah, right.

434
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,110
Out-of-body experience? Give me a break.

435
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,370
It's true.

436
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,890
Maybe in a few days,

437
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,550
you won't be able to find me anymore.

438
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,150
I'll already be back by then.

439
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,200
Okay then.

440
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,260
I wish you'll never

441
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,730
write a lousy script again.

442
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,440
Goodbye.

443
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,740
Forget it.

444
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,310
Give me a hug,

No need.

450
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:39,870
I'll go beat him up.

451

Bixiong really traveled back
to the modern times.

Before he left,

462
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,470
he kept reminding me that

463
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,300
if this world

464
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,230
were to have tremendous changes one day,

465

it definitely wouldn't be his doing.

Balance-of-pairing logic?

What is that?

484
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,240
It basically means the male lead
ends up with the female lead,

485
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,480
the male lead's best friend pairs with
the female lead's bestie,

928
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:39,890
Right? I think it's okay.

929
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,350
I think

930
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,820
the schedule is a bit tight.

931
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,480
Why don't you just go to the heaven
and leave us for good?

932
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,500
The whole crew has been waiting
just for you!

933
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,650
I'm talking to you.

934
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,430
Later,

935
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:56,920
go talk to the director...

936
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,230
Song Xiaoyu!

937
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:00,760
Director.

938
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,590
Xiaoyu!

939
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:02,850
Look at the camera.

940
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:04,230
Director.

941
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:05,480
Hurry up and put on makeup.

942
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,210
Okay. I'm sorry.

943
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:25,090
What are you doing?

944
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,400
Nothing.

945
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:47,880
-What's that about?
-Exactly.

946
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,160
Song Yimeng.

947
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:04,510
What did you just call me?

948
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,070
Song Yimeng.

949
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,190
Is that a character's name?

950
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,180
White head.

951
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:19,320
