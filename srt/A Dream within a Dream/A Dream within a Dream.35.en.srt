00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,030
I didn't expect there to be such a place

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,310
in the script world.

00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,150
The people and stories I didn't even write

10
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,280
are so interesting,

11
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,750
even better than the ones I did write.

12
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,480
No offense, Mr. Screenwriter,

13
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,460
but what you wrote
really wasn't that great.

14
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,870
Look at the stories we actors
came up with ourselves.

15
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,840
They're way better than yours,
don't you think?

Tell me,

17
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,680
why did you bring me here?

18
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,840
I wanted you to understand what it means

19
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,560
to respect the characters.

20

But in my eyes,

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,190
they're living, breathing people.

Yes.

Madam, I understand what you're saying.

75

But if you're asking me to hand
Yiting over to someone else,

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,460
I'm afraid I can't do that.

What?

78
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,160
How dare you say that to me?

79
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,070
Don't tell me you want to marry Yiting?

80
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,510
If she's willing to marry me,

81
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,630
then I'm willing to marry her.

82
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,960
So they love each other.

you're worthy of my daughter?

00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,680
You are right.

85
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,980
That's what I thought just a few days ago.

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,840
Song Yiting is truly

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,270

A man like me,

00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,000
how could I ever be good enough for her?

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,630
And how could I ever

92
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,120
give her the life she wants?

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,580
Good that you understand!

94
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,659
But later, I realized I was wrong.

95
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:54,800
Because what Song Yiting wants
isn't a marriage,

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,260
nor a match
that just looks perfect on paper.

97
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,950
She wants someone
who can roam the world with her

98
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,830
and live a life of freedom and joy.

99
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,000
Mrs. Song,

100
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,440
I'll say all this

101

to her myself.

102
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,430
If she wants a life free of constraints,

103
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll gladly go with her.

104

If she wants to experience
the joys of marriage,

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,460
I'll marry her with proper rites
and tradition.

106
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,000
Or perhaps,

107
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,040
I can marry into her family.

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,330
You're absolutely insane!

109
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:25,790
You...

110
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Screenwriter,

111
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,160
how much heartbreak

112
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,190
have you been through in real life

113
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,390
to come up with
a character like Mrs. Song,

114
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,240
someone who likes to break couples up?

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,430
If you had just been merciful

116
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,950
and let Song Yiting marry Nan Heng,

117
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,480
wouldn't this whole drama
have been avoided?

118
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,630
What's wrong with His Highness?

119
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,040
Strange.

120
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,870
It's truly weird.

121
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,430
Your energy and blood are both depleted.

122
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,159
Your Highness,
this looks like a serious injury.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,980
Could it be...

124
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
that the wound
he suffered on his wedding day

125
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
still hasn't healed?

126
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,200
No, that can't be it.

127
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,040
Even during the worst days of his injury,

128
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,630
his body wasn't this weak.

129
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,480
So why has it only gotten worse

130
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,270
over time?

131
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,190
It feels more like

132
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,210
that injury

133
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,560
triggered some deeper illness.

134
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,650
Is there any way to treat it?

135
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,360
I can only

136
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,000
try some tonics

137
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,040
to replenish your energy and blood,

138
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,500
and observe how things go.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,870
Your Grace?

140
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,990
What are you doing here?

141
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,950
I just returned to the capital.

142
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,680
I shouldn't be interfering
in your family affairs.

143
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,950
Then please don't.

144
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,190
Madam, what you said

145
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,140
is rather unpleasant to hear.

146
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,390
Unpleasant or not,

147
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,680
this is still the Song family's business,

148
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,720
not something for outsiders to meddle in.

149
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,720
That may have been true before,

150
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,510
but now

151
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,450
it's also the business of the Chu family.

152
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,650
Don't you want a son-in-law

153
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,360
who's a good match in status?

154
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,750
Then today,

155
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,870
I'll officially adopt
Shangguan He as my son

156
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,530
and give him the status
of a prince's household.

157
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,120
Adopted son?

158
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,120
That's great.

159
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,560
My father and the old lord

160
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,760
were sworn brothers.

161
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,950
And now Yiting and Chu He are in love—

162
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,650
what could be more perfect?

163
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,680
Madam,

164
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,560
if Father knows about it,

165
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,630
he'll be thrilled.

166
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,310
Wait.

167
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,440
You're already calling him Chu He now?

168
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,730
Our Second Master sure gave up
a lot just to get a wife.

169
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,200
He's a real man.

170
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,460
Family name is just a superficial thing.

171
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:40,360
Mrs. Song,

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,270
didn't you keep saying he was just

173
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,330
a nobody from the martial arts world?

174
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,870
Are you satisfied now?

175
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,670
I... I...

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,790
I...

177
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,670
What are you waiting for?

178
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,120
Hurry up and call him Father.

179
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,960
Well...

180
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,630
It's...

181
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,600
In the blink of an eye,
I suddenly have a father.

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,060
Isn't this all too sudden?

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,440
Don't hesitate.

184
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,120
Shanhu,

185
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,250
get paper and brush.

186
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,200
There's no better time than the present.

187
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,660
Today, let's sign the marriage contract
between the Song family and Chu family.

188
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,030
He finally did something good.

189
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,890
Father, what exactly
was your intention with this?

190
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,090
Naturally, it's to deal with Nan Heng.

191
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,330
Deal with Nan Heng?

192
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,910
What does this marriage
have to do with him?

193
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,440
Could it be...

194
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,270
that you want to bring Shangguan He
and the Song family

195
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,270
into our camp

196
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,810
to drive a wedge
between them and Nan Heng?

197
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,880
From your character's point of view,

198
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,440
whatever you think is right.

199
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,510
I had my reasons

200
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,790
for doing this.

201
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,600
Nan Heng should be

202
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,750
close to death from his illness by now.

203
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,530
[Your Majesty, I am willing to take Shangguan as my adopted son
and personally teach him to serve the country. I humbly ask for your gracious consent.]

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,670
He used to be Shangguan Baihe,

205
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,600
then Shangguan He.

206
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,770
Now, look at him.

207
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,360
He's lost even the Shangguan surname.

208
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I must say, He,

209
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,070
you're really generous.

210
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,320
Shut up.

211
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,600
Lord Qianyu came at a strange time

212
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,730
and acts strangely.

213
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,480
Though he seems to strike blindly,

214
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,210
I suspect...

215
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,030
there's more to this.

216
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,630
Fugui.

217
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,380
Dismiss everyone.

218
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,490
There's nobody else here, Your Highness.

219

[Lofty Aspirations]

220
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,630
What's so secret

221
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,160
that even Fugui can't hear?

222
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,360
Have you ever heard of

223
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,830
the script world?

224
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,570
[As per custom, we respectfully ask for your daughter's name
and seek your approval for the marriage. Chu Li.]

225
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,800
Come on, Father,

226
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,200
I've already taken care of it.

227
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,120
why do you still look so worried?

228
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,550
Yimeng,

229
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,270
why did Chu Li

230
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,080
help Shangguan He and Yiting?

231
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,730
He certainly wanted
to prove that, in this world, he...

232
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,470
He wanted to solve
your biggest problem, of course.

233
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,030
Father,

234
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,720
you actually quite like Shangguan He,

235
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,390
don't you?

236
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,150
And you don't want Yiting
to marry into the royal family,

237
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,360
right?

238
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,240
Nothing escapes your sharp eyes.

239
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,600
See?

240
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,150
The family's long-lasting conflict

241
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,030
is finally coming to an end.

242
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,700
Let me enjoy some peace and quiet now.

243
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,140
Song Yude!

244
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,820
I've been looking all over for you!

245
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,630
Come, come.

246
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,830
Honey.

247
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,840
The marriage contract is already signed.

248
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,120
Please stop causing trouble.

249
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,910
Wait.

250
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
I'm not the one causing trouble.

251
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,360
Get your facts straight.

252
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,790
It's your precious daughter
who is causing trouble.

253
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,000
She says she won't marry him.

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,910
She says

255
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,150
she won't marry Chu He until she hears him

256
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,960
confess his feelings to her in person.

257
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,880
You're really driving me crazy!

258
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,600
Wait a moment.

259
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,150
Let me process this.

260
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,720
Are you saying
this storybook created its own world

261
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,450
and we are all characters in it?

262
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,080
When I first heard this,

263
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,170
I had the same reaction as you.

264
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,600
This...

265
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,530
This is absolutely preposterous.

266
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,120
I understand

267
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,720
it's hard

268
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
to accept now.

269
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,320
No, no, no.

270
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,880
I've long thought something was strange.

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,840
How could

272
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,390
such an

273
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,990
incredibly handsome face exist
in this world?

274
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,120
So you are from a storybook?

275
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,640
That explains everything.

276
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,080
Tell me,

277
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
what kind of ending

278
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,010
could someone like me have?

279
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
I'm sure I'm more popular with the readers

280
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,850
than you, a cold-faced prince.

281
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,870
You

282
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,990
don't have an ending.

[One with Light and Dust]

284
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,870
Which means

285
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,270
Shangguan He wasn't even

286
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,120
in the original script.

287
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,110
What?

288
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,870
How is that possible?

289
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,050
Then how did I come into existence?

290
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,960
I think

291
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,390
you must be a character born

292
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,150
from the workings of this script world,

293
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,440
someone who appeared out of nowhere

294
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,300
and could vanish just as quickly.

295
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,720
Someone who appeared out of nowhere

296
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,580
and could vanish just as quickly.

297
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,030
Yes.

298
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,720
I believe the identity of Li Shiliu

299
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,910
came about because of

300
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,550
the unpredictable changes

301
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,200
during the script's progression.

302
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,360
The changes became too overwhelming

303
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,510
to control,

304
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,270
so the screenwriter took the form
of Lord Qianyu and came here.

305
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,260
Then tell me,

306
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,150
does this storybook

307
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,840
include Song Yiting?

308
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,840
Yes.

309
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,080
Who did she end up marrying?

310
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,410
The Eighteenth Prince?

311
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,420
She married me.

312
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,360
You?

313
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,270
Don't worry.

314
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,910
I have absolutely
no interest in Song Yiting.

315
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,910
I'm telling you this

316
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,240
because I think there's something fishy

317
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,570
about this Lord Qianyu.

318
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,200
But it's strange.

319
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,720
According to the storybook,

320
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,670
he should be trying hard to match you

321
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,030
with Song Yiting.

322
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,910
So why did he end up arranging
for her to marry me instead?

323
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,240
The one controlling the game

324
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,750
only needs to move
a single piece to change everything.

325
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,550
So,

326
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,910
we need to figure out

327
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,720
his next move quickly.

328
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Know yourself and know your enemy,

329
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,140

you're not saying

332
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,640
I should do the investigation, are you?

333
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,360
You've been around Song Yiting
so long that

334
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,480
you've even learned
to jump in and answer questions.

335
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,550
And now,

336
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,070
you're Lord Qianyu's adopted son.

337
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,910
That makes you

338
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,080
the perfect person to look into this.

339
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,840
We're all just fictional characters,

340
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,910

get to act all high and mighty,

00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,020
don't even get a chance to fight back?

344
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,930
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

345
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,480
I'm the male lead.

346
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,970
What the hell is a male lead?

347
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,080
So your fate is completely

348
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,120
controlled by the writer, isn't it?

349
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,170
Is that interesting?

Wait.

I came from nothing

It's normal that he doesn't know
how to express his feelings.

But everything he said
at Waning River Crescent today

375
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,790
he cares about you,

376
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,680
likes you,

377
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,010
and wants to be with you.

378
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,750
A confession

379
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,240
is just one way to express one's feelings.

380
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,840
Is it really that important?

381
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,220
You don't understand.

382
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,030
I've made my feelings clear
to him for so long,

383
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,110
but he has never once
said anything in return.

384
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,240
I don't understand?

385
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,440
Me, a married woman with experience,

386
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,570
I don't understand?

387
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,750
You just lie there doing nothing.

388
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,590
That's how you are in life,

389
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,590
and in love.

390
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,130
Between you and Nan Heng, he took 99

391
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,160
out of 100 steps to get to you,

392
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,790
dragging himself forward the whole way.

393
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,590
Do you

394
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,770
really understand?

395
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,510
What's up?

396
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,690
Your Highness,

397
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,200
I heard everything

398
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,530
you said to Shangguan He

399
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,080
in the courtyard today.

400
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,240
So...

401
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
you know about the script world now?

402
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,790
I do.

403
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,360
And you've accepted it?

404
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,130
Your Highness,

405
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:57,510
you thought that,

406
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,480
with my personality, I'd make a huge scene

407
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,210
when I found out, didn't you?

408
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,790
I was shocked at first.

409
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,750
But after eating eight buns

410
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,750
and running ten laps around
the Crown Prince's Residence,

411
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,680
I suddenly understood everything.

412
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,180
Have I ever seen
this so-called "real world"

413
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,680
outside the storybook?

414
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,910
I haven't.

415
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,130
So it doesn't exist.

416
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,680
And since it doesn't exist,

417
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,110
why can't I treat this place

418
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,640
as the real world?

419
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,800
I didn't expect
you'd come to that conclusion.

420
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,640
Well, I did grow up with you.

421
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,270
Not like that Shangguan He—

422
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,870
who knows where he came from.

423
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,970
Your Highness,

424
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,940
why didn't you tell him

425
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,890
you've been coughing up blood?

426
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,520
I didn't tell him

427
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,370
because I didn't want him to worry.

428
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,480
And you're keeping it
from the Crown Princess too?

429
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,280
That's right.

430
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,270
She absolutely cannot know.

431
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,830
If Lord Qianyu is really that powerful,

432
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,220
what will happen if you

433
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,500
[Cultivate Virtue and Pursue Knowledge]

434
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:02,000
go against him, Your Highness?

435
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't know yet.

436
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,110
But no matter what,

437
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,130
I must find a way to change the ending,

438
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,720
because when we got married,

439
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,160
I promised her
I would protect her for life.

440
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,020
Your Highness,

441
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,150
that's my wish as well.

442
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,550
I may be slow,

443
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,400
but I'm not stupid.

444
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,310
If what you told Shangguan He

445
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,510
wasn't dangerous,

446
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,040
then why didn't you tell me?

447
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,720
Isn't it because you were afraid

448
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,830
I'd expose your health issues

449
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,720
and mess up the plan against Lord Qianyu?

450
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,920
I have my own plans.

451
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,900
Yes!

452
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,530
You always have your plans—

453
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,070
when we were beyond the border,

454
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,800
when we returned to the capital,

455
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,190
when you were wronged,

456
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,270
even when your life
was hanging by a thread.

457
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,130
Your Highness,

458
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,710
let me ask you one thing:

459
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,070
in your plans,

460
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,280
have you ever considered your own safety?

461
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,350
Of course I'll consider

462
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,660
my own safety.

463
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,040
Really?

464
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,930
If there really is a storybook,

465
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,210
then I was written

466
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,310
to protect you.

467
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,790
I know everything

468
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,720
you plan to do.

469
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,880
If—

470
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,200
I'm just saying if—

471
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,510
I knew that wound would hurt you so badly,

472
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,830
I definitely
wouldn't have listened to you—

473
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,000
I would have tried my best
to kill Chu Guihong first.

474
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,440
Your Highness,

475
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
-Enough.
-you...

476
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,480
I know you're loyal.

477
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,440
Then promise me

478
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,270
you'll include your own safety

479
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,350
in your plans.

480
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,440
Fine.

481
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:23,110
I still don't believe you.

482
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,510
Unless you tell me

483
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,440
your detailed plan now,

484
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,500
I can't be at ease.

485
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,030
Don't push it too far.

486
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,350
Fine.

487
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,110
From now on, take me with you

488
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,840
when you go to discuss matters.

489
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,100
Your Highness,

490
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,400
remember this:

491
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,830
in the storybook, I was written

492
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,490
to be completely loyal to you.

493
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,830
Unlike that Shangguan He,

494
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,270
who could vanish any moment

495
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,270
and just fly away.

496
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,870
When that happens, who will you turn to?

497
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:48,920
It'll still be me.

498
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,920
I got it.

499
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,830
Nan Heng.

500
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,230
Nan Heng.

501
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,680
Today, on my way back to my room,

502
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,810
I smelled medicine.

503
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,000
Is your injury still not fully healed?

504
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,750
Come.

505
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,970
Turn around.

506
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,920
Let me see.

507
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,640
No, no, no.

508
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,510
I'm fine now.

509
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,350
I've been fine for a while.

510
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,550
The imperial physician
gave me some prescriptions,

511
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,950
and now I'm out of danger.

512
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,400
Really?

513
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,400
Really.

514
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,240
You're lying.

515
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,250
You always pretend to be fine
when you are not.

516
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,000
I need to see for myself to be sure.

517
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,750
Let me take a look.

518
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,480
I have something to ask you.

519
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,590
Just one quick look.

520
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,350
No, no, wait.

521
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,880
I need to ask you something.

522
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,270
What did you and Lord Qianyu do

523
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,960
at Waning River Crescent today?

524
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,640
And...

525
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,080
why did he adopt Shangguan He as his son?

526
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,750
Nan Heng.

527
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,510
Why did...

528
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:01,880
Can we please

529
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:04,140
keep work talk out of private time?

530
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,160
Come on,

531
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,310
don't worry.

532
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,550
Lord Qianyu

533
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,310
is gradually fitting into this world.

534
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,160
Otherwise, how could he have outdone Madam

535
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,820
and helped Shangguan He and Yiting
get engaged?

536
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,130
But he wanted to take you away
this morning.

537
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,640
While we women
are busy handling things outside,

538
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,790
can you men

539
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,500
stop overthinking

540
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,960
at home?

541
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,680
Okay?

542
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,980
Trust me this once.

543
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,310
Okay.

544
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,160
Nan Heng.

545
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,990
Take off your boots.

546
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,590
And your belt too.

547
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,160
Here.

548
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,850
Your outer robe,

549
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,310
take that off too.

550
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,610
You're acting a bit strange today.

551
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,280
Here.

552
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,550
What are you doing?

553
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,110
Nan Heng.

554
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,200
What?

555
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,790
Nan Heng,

556
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,030
I like you.

557
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,880
How much do you like me?

558
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
I like you so much that

559
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,430
if you and an ATM
both fell into the river,

560
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,240
I wouldn't hesitate to save you first.

561
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,740
An ATM?

562
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,020
I don't know who that is,

563
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,760
but...

564
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,320
it surely can't beat Xuanjia Army, right?

565
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,150
You fool.

566
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,960
Anyway,

567
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,590
that's a romantic line.

568
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,700
And from now on,

569
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,970
I'll say sweet things to you often.

570
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,430
Before,

571
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,630
you took so many steps toward me.

572
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,240
From now on,

573
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,960
I'll be the one walking toward you.

574
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,950
Love isn't just about words.

575
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,310
You need to show it with actions.

576
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,760
Really?

577
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,980
Yes.

578
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,210
I'm not talking about this.

579
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,550
Didn't you tell me to take action?

580
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,160
So I'm showing you my actions.

581
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,960
Well...

582
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,830
Wait.

583
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,830
You haven't taken off your hairpin yet.

584
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,590
In costume dramas,
no one really minds that.

585
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,720
What if it pricks me?

586
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,790
You must have OCD.

587
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,140
If it pricks you, we'll deal with it then.

588
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,180
Dongting red oranges!

589
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,510
Dongting red oranges!

590
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,910
Juicy and delicious Dongting red oranges!

591
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,290
Take a look.

592
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,660
Dongting red oranges.

593
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,900
Last time we bought some Dongting
red oranges, and then things went wrong.

594
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,650
This time…

595
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,720
You're worrying too much.

596
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,230
Last time, it was because we bought them
to honor my mother.

597
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,350
This time we're buying them
to give to Father.

598
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,270
That's not the same.

599
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,200
It's different.

600
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,440
Here.

601
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,160
Take it.

602
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,260
Your Highness.

603
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,270
Rong Hua? What brings you here?

604
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,610
May I have a word with you
in private, Your Highness?

605
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,350
It's just a engagement,

606
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,250
yet such a grand event.

607
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,470
You really hold my Song family

608
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,680
in high regard.

609
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,310
Song, you're too polite.

610
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,200
In the capital, only our two families

611
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,160
are noble families in the whole drama.

612
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,360
It should be this way.

613
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,540
But Your Highness,

614
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,480
you actually made time to attend

615
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,480
your sister-in-law's engagement.

616
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,240
Some things can't reach a conclusion

617
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,110
without seeing them with your own eyes.

618
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,000
Besides,

619
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,400
your recent actions

620
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,790
have all involved people close to me,

621
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,540
which naturally

622
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,180
made me a little suspicious.

623
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,350
I'm getting old.

624
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,750
What schemes could I have?

625
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,590
I just want to see the younger generation

626
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,550
settle down peacefully.

627
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,210
Guihong wasn't lucky enough
to marry a Song girl,

628
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,590
but He

629
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,490
honored the old friendship
between me and Song.

630
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,720
Indeed.

631
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,550
However...

632
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,640
I consulted
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

633
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,110
and it seems there's no
suitable wedding date

634
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,000
within the next six months.

635
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,350
So perhaps this matter should...

636
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,550
I think you're trying

637
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,440
to call off the engagement because

638
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,640
Miss Song Yiting refuses to get married.

639
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,510
Chu Guihong,

640
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,500
why are you everywhere?

641
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,280
You even know about
the Song family's affairs.

642
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,770
Yesterday, Guihong was on patrol

643
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,550
and happened to run into Mrs. Song,

644
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,750
so they chatted a bit.

645
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,090
Happened to?

646
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,340
Mrs. Song went to Waning River Crescent,

647
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,940
and you just happened
to take in an adopted son.

648
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,350
Chu Guihong also "happened"

649
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,070
to hear about the Song family's affairs.

650
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,800
What a coincidence.

651
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,440
That's what they say:

652
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,370
"No coincidences, no good story."

653
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,960
Song,

654
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,510
I suddenly need to use the restroom.

655
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,510
Could you wait a moment?

656
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,110
Of course.

657
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,110
This way, please.

658
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,940
[Graceful and Composed]

659
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,400
Shangguan He,

660
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,070
we've already rolled out
the red carpet for you.

661
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,330
Is it really that hard to say
"I like you?"

662
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,350
What exactly are you hesitating about?

663
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,210
Your Highness,

664
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,480
Mrs. Li,

665
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,160
please stay out of this matter, okay?

666
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,400
I'm begging you.

667
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Stop right there.

668
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,310
Come back.

669
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,220
Between Nan Heng and me,

670
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,400
you and Yiting have meddled quite a bit.

671
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,160
So it's only fair

672
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,640
that I return the favor.

673
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,480
Didn't you once tell me

674
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,240
that people like us

675
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,350
have to risk everything

676
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,350
for someone in our lifetime?

677
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,520
You and I

678
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,050
are both lazy souls

679
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,660
with no grand ambitions.

680
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,010
Don't we just want a peaceful, comfortable
life?

681
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,270
But if, in your whole life,

682
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,590
you never meet even one or two people

683
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,320
worth risking everything for,

684
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,970
and you just merely exist,

685
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,920
can you say you've truly lived?

686
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,830
I believed you

687
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,110
and acted on it.

688
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,610
But what about you?

689
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,490
You clearly care
about Yiting more than anyone.

690
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,400
So why do you only say sweet things

691
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
behind her back

692
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,700
but stay silent when you're with her?

693
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,240
Chief told me

694
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,380
I don't exist in the storybook.

695
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,960
How could a nonexistent person

696
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,640
give her a happy ending?

697
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,290
The storybook?

698
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,220
So you know everything?

699
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,640
So,

700
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,960
you don't want me to suddenly disappear

701
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,890
and leave your sister
all alone in this world, right?

702
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,280
How could you suddenly disappear?

703
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,640
Things aren't as bad as you think.

704
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,240
Trust me. Really.

705
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,100
Second Master.

706
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,130
Second Master.

707
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,350
bad news.

708
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,510
Something happened.

709
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,640
The enemy showed up at our place.
Go check it out quickly!

710
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,810
Eighteenth Prince,

711
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,440
Why did you specifically invite me

712
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,190
to Waning River Crescent?

713
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,400
This way, please.

714
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,670
Yiting.

715
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,080
You gave him 73 portraits.

716
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,620
I have one more than him.

717
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,880
As long as you agree,

718
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,510
Father's imperial edict for our marriage

719
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:50,370
will surely come before
the Chu family's proposal.

720
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,700
Eighteenth Prince,

721
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,480
didn't you already ask His Majesty
to cancel the imperial marriage grant?

722
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,740
What are you doing now?

723
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,270
Well,

724
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,110
just consider it a moment of impulse.

725
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,530
Please don't blame me.

726
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,280
Isn't this Shangguan He?

727
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,160
Yiting,

728
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,830
I can accept you don't like me,

729
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,790
but I can't just watch you

730
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,000
marry someone who doesn't care about you.

731
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,810
Yiting,

732
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,880
I like you.

733
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,030
I can write love letters
and poems for you,

734
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,590
confess my feelings in front of

735
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:23,480
all the noble ladies of the capital,

736
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,660
and ask Father for your hand.

737
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,000
I can do anything you want.

738
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,480
But what about Chu He?

739
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,830
What can he do for you?

740
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,970
So, Eighteenth Prince,

741
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,460
are you here to steal the bride today?

742
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,750
Yes.

743
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,590
I cherish Yiting

744
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,720
and love her deeply.

745
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,960
That's why, before everyone here,

746
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,800
I'm here to steal the bride!

747
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,200
I support the Eighteenth Prince!

748
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,440
Me too!

749
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,650
I support the Eighteenth Prince!

750
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,640
You really scared me.

751
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,590
Your Highness,

752
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,800
you have such a villainous aura!

753
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,770
Those with clear consciences

754
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,320
have nothing to fear.

755
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,699
In broad daylight,

756
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,800
why are you so nervous?

757
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
Could there be

758
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,820
other reasons behind

759
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,750
Shangguan He's engagement?

760
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:32,380
You've started suspecting me already?

761
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,600
Song Yimeng told me

762
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,230
you worked

763
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,150
tirelessly

764
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,230
for this script.

765
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,710
But now, seeing it changed like this,

766
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,000
I'd want to turn the tide

767
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,030
and set the story back on track

768
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,670
if I were you.

769
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,150
Why would I do that?

770
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,070
Of course you would.

771
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,030
I don't believe

772
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,090
you actually want to stay here.

773
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,640
Well, you actually guessed right.

774
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,550
Nan Heng,

775
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,150
after the wedding,

776
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,710
have you

777
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,150
felt unwell?

778
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,710
Is it getting worse
as the Song and Chu families

779
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,180
are getting engaged?

780
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,070
Marry him!

781
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,920
Marry him!

782
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,710
Marry him!

783
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,490
Marry him!

784
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,370
Marry him!

785
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,270
Marry him!

786
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,040
Marry him!

787
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,960
Marry him!

788
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,810
Marry him!

789
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:29,730
Marry him!

790
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,520
Marry him!

791
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,390
Marry him!

792
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,020
Marry him!

793
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,170
At a time like this,

794
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,330
why are you still staying silent?

795
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,230
Do you really want Yiting to marry him?

796
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:36,760
I...

797
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,400
Marry him!

798
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,200
Marry him!

799
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,030
Marry him!

800
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,850
Marry him!

801
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,610
Marry him!

802
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,990
I'll count to three.

803
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,230
If no one objects,

804
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,640
I'll take your silence as consent.

805
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,710
Let me tell you, Shangguan He,

806
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,240
you better not regret this.

807
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,110
Three!

808
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,600
Two!

809
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:02,800
One...

810
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,730
No need to count.

811
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,750
I accept.

812
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:09,700
What?

813
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,980
You agreed so quickly?

814
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,090
Don't you want to think it over?

815
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,550
I chased you so many times before

816
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,150
and you never accepted.

817
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,070
Why suddenly today...

818
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:15,550
I didn't want to marry you before,

819
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:17,210
but now I do. Is that a problem?

820
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,550
Well...

821
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,140
It's not a problem at all.

822
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:20,840
Yiting,

823
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,590
I'm actually quite happy
to hear you say that.

824
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,710
But you know,

825
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,710
a relationship like ours

826
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,190
sometimes needs to...

827
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,000
Enough.

828
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,230
You men

829
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,470
are all so indecisive.

830
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,000
I'll go to the palace myself
and ask for the decree.

831
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,480
Yiting.

832
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,400
Wait!

833
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,930
Song Yiting, let me ask you,

834
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,850
what kind of love do you truly want?

835
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,810
Love that asks nothing

836
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,390
of the past or future,

837
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,880
understanding each other
and staying together,

838
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,150
and sharing life's journey
to the ends of the earth.

839
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,680
Asks nothing of the future?

840
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,460
What if I suddenly disappear?

841
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,230
Whether you stay or go,

842
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,480
it's your choice.

843
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,490
When have I ever forced you?

844
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,070
What if I leave this world before you do?

845
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,420
Then I'll keep you forever in my heart

846
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,360
and go find the next love,

847
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,860
and the one after that.

848
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,820
There are plenty of men in this world.

849
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,050
I, Song Yiting,

850
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
would never waste my youth

851
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,400
mourning over a coffin.

852
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,400
What a heartless Song Yiting.

853
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,070
I don't understand what they're saying,

854
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,800
but I can see what's happening.

855
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,670
Those two

856
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
are together now.

857
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,670
Shangguan He,

858
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,090

it's...

901
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,320
Actually,

902
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,440
my uncle sent me to help.

903
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,730

this is intentional,

complete the iconic scenes

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,600
I can go back.

916
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,150
And the last one is—

917
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,360
changing iconic scenes

918
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,970
