[Episode 9]

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,230
[Qianyu Mansion]

4
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,760
Guihong.

5
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,479
What are you thinking about here

6
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,320
all alone?

7
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,590
Rong Hua and the others are all okay.

8
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,079
They just suffered some
superficial injuries.

9
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,870
Don't worry.

10
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,810
Father will certainly not stand by
and do nothing

11
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,079
about what happened today.

12
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,820
When Aunt passed away,

13
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,900
I thought it was the last time.

14
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,180
When my father died in Pingrong City,

15
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,900
I also thought it was the last time.

16
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
I never expected that only after
returning to the capital

17
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,420
would I truly understand how treacherous
people's hearts can be.

18
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,460
Your Highness,

19
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,760
may I entrust you with something?

20
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,560
Look at you.

21
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,560
There's no need for such formalities
between us, okay?

22
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,190
Go ahead.

23
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,000
I want to go to the Ministry of Rites
and look through

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,460
the records of previous Lantern Festivals.

25
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,310
Nan Heng doesn't want me
to stay in the capital?

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,310
Fine.

27
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,060
Let's see

28
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,440
who'll have the last laugh.

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,080
Good.

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,030
Guihong.

31
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,240
Now that you've said that, I
feel relieved.

32
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,360
As long as we two cousins are united,

33
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,870
we can overcome any obstacle.

34
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,680
Even if there were 10, or even
100 Nan Hengs,

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,579
they still wouldn't be a match for us.

36
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,380
Right?

37
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,030
Here.

38
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,060
Why does this wine taste like that?

39
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,320
It can't hold a candle to the wine of
Waning River Crescent.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,910
General.

41
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,770
Your Highness.

42
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,240
Why are you here

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,700
instead of resting and
healing your injury?

44
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,840
Look over there.

45
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,310
What's this?

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,420
These are fireworks specially made by
foreign merchants.

47
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,300
I guarantee you've never seen anything
like this before.

48
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,110
General.

49
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,810
We've decided.

50
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,400
For this year's Lantern Festival
blessings,

51
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,490
the Qianyu Army will present the people

52
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,470
with an unprecedented fireworks display.

53
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,630
To let them know

54
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,930
that our Qianyu Army is like a dragon
on the battlefield,

55
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,150
and while stationed in the capital,

56
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,680
we are still fierce tigers.

57
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,510
Go ahead.

58
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,000
What wise opinions do you have, gentlemen?

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,970
Your Highness.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,430
I've said it before,

61
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,310
this Song Yimeng

62
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,600
is full of evil intentions

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
and cannot be trusted at all.

64
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,240
As for Mr. Shangguan,

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,680
he's stubborn and self-opinionated.

66
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,070
Due to his own dark and
despicable thoughts,

67
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,240
he came up with those useless suggestions,

68
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,010
leading to this situation.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,630
I suggest

70
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,920
punishing Mr. Shangguan

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,270
and keeping him away from Your Highness.

72
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,070
Fugui.

73
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,720
We've been colleagues for three years
after all.

74
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,630
That's not an appropriate thing
to say, is it?

75
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,159
At least I can help Chief Master
solve his troubles.

76
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,820
What can you do for His Highness?

77
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,560
As his personal informant

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,510
and most trusted attendant,

79
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,310
you even failed to find out
that Chancellor Gao

80
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,720
had secretly buried explosives.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,000
What use are you to His Highness?

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,860
Can you two say something useful?

83
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,620
What good are you two to me?

84
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,120
But this Chancellor Gao actually dared

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,750
to make decisions behind my back
without permission.

86
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,630
If it weren't for Mother,

87
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,760
I would have taken care of him long ago.

88
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,430
If you ask me, Your Highness,

89
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,610
you need not worry about this matter.

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,750
The fact that Song Yimeng acts this way

91
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,600
precisely indicates

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,000
that she has no suspicion

93
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,050
about Your Highness's identity.

94
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,950
I actually think

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,310
we could write her a letter in
Li Shiliu's name,

96
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,910
asking her to come see you
with a detailed plan.

97
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,320
That would work.

98
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Doesn't Song Yimeng want to kill me?

99
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,650
Well, I'd like to see

100
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,040
if she has what it takes.

101
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,340
[Three days later]

102
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,630
My Lady.

103
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,600
My Lady.

104
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,540
At least have some breakfast.

105
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't have time for that.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,390
Today is a big day for me,

107
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,860
the day I conquer my fate.

108
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,159
If I succeed, I no longer have to
struggle anymore.

109
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,240
If I fail, I might have to
lie low underground.

110
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,040
Yimeng.

111
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,480
General Chu.

112
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,390
Where are you going, Yimeng?

113
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,630
Why are you in such a hurry?

114
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,030
I'm on my way to see Mr. Li.

115
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,210
You're going to see Li Shiliu?

116
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,650
How come you got here before me?

117
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,830
Can anyone explain to me

118
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,080
what's going on here?

119
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,750
Why don't you explain to us, General Chu,

120
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,040
why you're dressed

121
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,760
so flamboyantly today?

122
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,570
You're not looking too shabby yourself.

123
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,300
You keep changing your clothes

124
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,440
and even have gold threads sewn in,

125
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,340
but what's the point?

126
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,430
My Waning River Crescent deals in
a wide variety of businesses.

127
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,680
As the owner of the
Waning River Crescent's Hall,

128
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,040
changing outfits frequently

129
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,240
is not strange at all.

130
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,310
Alright, alright.

131
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,430
Can you two stop

132
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,310
being at each other's throats
every time you meet?

133
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,510
You're both men.

134
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,170
Be a little more open-minded,

135
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,390
okay?

136
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,750
Okay?

137
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,070
Yimeng likes humble people.

138
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,360
This has nothing to do with what I like...

139
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
So surely she wouldn't like

140
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,750
someone who shows up uninvited.

141
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,510
Mr. Li...

142
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,800
My fiancée is meeting with a stranger
of unknown origin.

143
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,730
If I didn't come,

144
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,720
how could I be at ease?

145
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
If there's no basic trust

146
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,270
between two people,

147
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,360
even if they get married,

148
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,270
they'll be a resentful couple.

149
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,390
You're overstepping your bounds,
don't you think?

150
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,310
You're my defeated foe,

151
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,830
yet you still dare to speak so boldly?

152
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,630
Stop!

153
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,430
Have you two

154
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,630
forgotten why we're here today?

155
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,010
For the assassination of Nan Heng.

156
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,039
If anything goes wrong,

157
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,549
not to mention the three of us,

158
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,480
even the Song family,

159
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,409
the Qianyu Army,

160
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,690
and the Nightwalkers

161
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,870
will all have to die.

162
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,630
It's one thing that you two

163
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,790
dress up so flashily every day,

164
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,870
but can you focus a bit
on the task at hand?

165
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,670
Can you?

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,790
Alright,

167
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,550
let's get down to business.

168
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,360
Next,

169
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,930
let's have a proper discussion about

170
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,450
[Grace & Elegance]

171
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,810
the plan to assassinate Heng.

172
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,830
Nan Heng.

173
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,870
I know this guy far too well.

174
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,360
This person

175
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,870
is meticulous,

176
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,720
but also quite distrustful.

177
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,920
Therefore,

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
if we want to kill him in one strike,

179
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,110
we absolutely cannot let any information
leak out.

180
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,730
The first step

181
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,590
is to lure him away from the protection
of the Xuanjia Army

182
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,450
and take him to the place we've
prepared in advance.

183
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,850
Well, as for the location,

184
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,320
I suggest the Jade River.

185
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,970
The Jade River

186
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,480

As for luring Nan Heng away,

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,000
Nan Heng's entourage during outings

373
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,530
will definitely be sparse.

374
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,030
And then, Miss Song,

375
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,680
just find any excuse

376
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,030
to lure Nan Heng

377
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,310
onto a leisure boat in the river.

378
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,560
Bravo! Bravo!

379
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,590
One more!

380
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,070
Bravo! Bravo!

381
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,500
Your Highness,

382
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,360
you really can hold your liquor.

383
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,240
Bravo!

384
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,000
Bravo!

385
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,080
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

386
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,770
Who are you?

387
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,380
The one who's sending you on
your final journey.

388
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,720
♪ I offer up my vow, wishing to tread
through waves of good and evil ♪

389
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,050
♪ With one heart, side by side,
facing the ups and downs ♪

390

00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,700

♪ I offer up my vow, wishing to embrace
countless hardships upon my soul ♪

393
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,270
♪ With my own body, I vow not

♪ When I suddenly look back,
calling out, all is well ♪

396
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,740
I don't know how this happened.

397
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,160
The Seventh Prince was such a nice person.

398
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,640
Who on earth would bear a grudge
against him?

399
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,550
I feel so terrible.

400
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,550
Miss Song.

401
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,710
My condolences.

402
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,410
No one wants

403
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
this kind of thing to happen.

404
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,680
Disperse. Disperse.

405
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,080
I feel so bad.

406
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,960
Disperse.

407
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,920
Brilliant.

408
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,500
It's truly brilliant.

409
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,850
This plan is excellent.

410
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,960
From execution to aftermath,

411
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,180
everything has been thought out for us.

412
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,310
As expected, working with Mr. Li

413
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,970
brings much peace of mind.

414
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,680
Your knowledge of Nan Heng

415
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,070
and the defenses of the city and even
the palace is quite impressive.

416
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,200
It truly makes me see you in a new light.

417
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,880
If I didn't know better,

418
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,440
I'd think you had held a position
in the court.

419
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,850
If I didn't know much,

420
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,970
how could I manage the
Waning River Crescent?

421
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,210
Anyway,

422
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,830
with Mr. Li's help,

423
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,490
our chances of success have
greatly increased.

424
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,550
As long as Nan Heng dies,

425
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,410
all our troubles

426
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,680
will finally be resolved.

427
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,570
Come on.

428
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,240
The plan to assassinate Heng

429
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,990
officially begins.

430
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,030
Bye-bye, Mr. Li.

431
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,160
Bye-bye.

432
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,110
To have our Chief Master

433
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,370
put on an act for an entire day,

434
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,290
it has to be Miss Song.

435
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,280
What's wrong?

436
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,830
Why aren't you saying anything?

437
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,440
Silence means consent.

438
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,440
Consent

439
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,160
means accepting this love.

440
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,100
Talk business.

441
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,200
The metallurgy room is ready,

442
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,860
waiting for your inspection.

443
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,860
Don't stand too close to me

444
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,250
when you talk to me from now on.

445
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,820
You shouldn't hit so hard from
now on, either.

446
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,700
Will it work, melting half of the
Qianyu Moon-Cleaving Blade?

447
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,430
We'll know once we try.

448
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,670
Why is it so brittle?

449
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,170
Our blades are still not up to par.

450
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,900
After years of studying
the method of weapon forging,

451
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,430
there's still no progress.

452
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,400
How about we invite

453
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,730
some metallurgists from Jiangnan again?

454
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,180
Haven't we brought in plenty of masters
these past few years?

455
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,970
Without the proper method,

456
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,160
it seems

457
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,540
we still can't succeed.

458
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,290
What about sending someone to infiltrate
the military camp again?

459
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,600
No need.

460
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,640
The only person who knows
the method of weapon forging now

461
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,720
is Chu Guihong.

462
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,370
Let's discuss this matter further later.

463
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,370
By the way,

464
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,760
about the assassination,

465
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,490
is it still going according to
the original plan?

466
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,750
Everything will proceed according to
the original plan,

467
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,160
but not entirely.

468
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,210
You might as well have said nothing.

469
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:58,870
What's that supposed to mean?

470
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,550
You just asked me

471
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,100
not to stand so close when talking to you.

472
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,160
Cut the crap.

473
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,490
Are you kidding me?

474
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,480
How can this possibly work?

475
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,550
Don't worry.

476
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:28,950
It's almost certain.

477
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,960
But I...

478
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,120
Now Chu Guihong is extremely
cautious of me.

479
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,050
If we don't take drastic measures,

480
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,880
I'm afraid it's difficult to
completely dispel

481
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,680
his suspicions about Li Shiliu.

482
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,590
What's wrong?

483
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,490
Why do you look so troubled?

484
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,480
Yimeng.

485
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,330
Actually, what I said in the hall today

486
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,340
wasn't sincere.

487
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,630
I've had doubts about Li Shiliu

488
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,280
since our first encounter.

489
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,870
Today, when we discussed the
plan to assassinate Heng together,

490
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,440
he actually knew every detail

491
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,040
about Nan Heng's situation.

492
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,360
Don't you find all this

493
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
very fishy?

494
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,590
So you've been putting on

495
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,160
an act all day long?

496
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,520
Come on.

497
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,550
People from the Great Jing shouldn't
lie to each other,

498
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,610
okay, bro?

499
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,310
You...

500
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,960
Fine.

501
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,160
Even if all of these are mere
coincidences,

502
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,740
assassinating the
current prince—

503
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,000
the lightest sentence is imprisonment,

504
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,110
and the worst is execution

505
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,110
and implication of the entire family.

506
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,640
Why would he agree to join
the assassination

507
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,790
after just a few brief encounters?

508
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,400
Wrong.

509
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,790
Not only did he not immediately
agree to my proposal,

510
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,880
but he also repeatedly

511
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,200
turned it down.

512
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,960
So what?

513
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,440
Perhaps it's all just a ploy to
gain your trust.

514
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,490
Or maybe

515
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:52,850
he's planning something bigger
in alliance with Nan Heng.

516
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,270
These are all your speculations,

517
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:58,730
aren't they, General Chu?

518
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,660
But Mr. Li once saved my life.

519
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,700
It felt like

520
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,720
you were walking in a long,

521
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,790
pitch-dark tunnel,

522
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,310
and suddenly someone shone a light on you,

523
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,030
telling you there's still hope
for everything,

524
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,920
reassuring you not to lose heart.

525
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,950
So,

526
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,070
why can't we trust him?

527
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,400
I know

528
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,550
you're worried that I might get tricked.

529
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,240
But

530
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,550
even if there's only a
one-in-a-million chance now,

531
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,000
I still have to try.

532
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,400
Because all the plot

533
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,360
revolves around Nan Heng.

534
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,750
If we don't break it,

535
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,480
both of us will lose our lives.

536
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,760
Do you understand?

537
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,310
Both of us losing our lives?

538
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,370
You mean on the day of the
Lantern Festival?

539
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,310
Yimeng.

540
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,400
Don't worry.

541
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,320
No matter what happens next,

542
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,830
I will protect you.

543
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,510
No, no.

544
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,960
On that day, you should just

545
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,310
patrol as usual.

546
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,310
If the assassination succeeds,

547
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,550
you and the Eighteenth Prince

548
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,180
can reap the benefits.

549
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,680
If it fails, it's okay too.

550
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,030
You can just find any excuse

551
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,000
and slack off a bit.

552
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,880
Yimeng.

553
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,600
What I'm worried about now isn't myself
at all,

554
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,680
but you.

555
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:17,430
I understand.

556
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,130
I understand.

557
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,070
You're the second male lead, after all.

558
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,800
You'll always stand by my side.

559
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,090
But please trust me.

560
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,600
I have an ace up my sleeve.

561
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,080
Nan Heng can't touch me.

562
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,450
Alright, alright.

563
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,920
Loosen up a bit.

564
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,020
As the second male lead, you should
act like one.

565
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,620
Handsome, sweet,

566
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,500
and having trust in the female lead.

567
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,720
Alright, I'm going home now.

568
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,000
Yimeng...

569
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,640
Bye-bye.

570
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,830
I feel so awful.

571
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,910
My Lady.

572
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,960
Mother.

573
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,440
Mother.

574
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,770
What's wrong with you?

575
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,230
I might

576
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:14,600
not have much time left this time.

577
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,880
Yiting.

578
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,350
Can I

579
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,410
see you get married

580
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,920
before I

581
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,480
close my eyes forever?

582
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,240
That's the only wish I have left.

583
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,790
Mother.

584
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,310
Father

585
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,410
has been fooled by this trick of yours

586
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,020
for over 20 years, hasn't he?

587
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,830
So clumsy

588
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,230
as to be a laughingstock!

589
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,010
Don't you dare take a step!

590
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,200
Oh, why is my life

591
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,000
so miserable?

592
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,400
The daughter I carried for 10 months

593
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,960
is even colder than ice.

594
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,110
Let me die!

595
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,350
Let me just die!

596
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,880
-Madam, please don't!
-Please don't, Madam!

597
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,270
Let me die!

598
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,440
Madam, please don't!

599
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,480
Don't stop me!

600
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,680
If you really do this,

601
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,380
Her Ladyship will lose her mother.

602
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,400
Madam, she's turned around.

603
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,030
She's turned around.

604
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
She's turned around.

605
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,300
I knew you cared about me.

606
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,030
I've found it out for you.

607
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,310
On the Lantern Festival,

608
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,200
the Eighteenth Prince will
represent His Majesty

609
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,720
to watch the lanterns from
the Imperial Tower.

610
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,350
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

611
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,600
The Lantern Festival

612
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,200
is to pray for blessings for
the Great Jing.

613
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,660
It's not for matchmaking.

614
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,310
I

615
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,040
don't care at all about the fate
of the Great Jing.

616
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,400
As long as you can get married,

617
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,640
that would be my blessing.

618
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,350
Mother, there's no need to
waste your efforts.

619
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,480
In the noble families of this world,

620
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,590
there are plenty of men with numerous
wives and concubines,

621
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,000
while women helplessly comply

622
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,720
and engage in the sordid business of
vying for beauty and favor.

623
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,580
But I don't want to live like that.

624
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,140
If I can meet

625
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,410
a kindred spirit in this life,

626
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,160
we might enjoy the
beautiful sceneries together

627
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,420
and live a poetic life.

628
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,590
But if there's no kindred spirit
to accompany me,

629
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,400
I can enjoy life on my own.

630
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,880
Why would I need a man?

631
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,920
The Lantern Festival

632
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,360
starts now!

633
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,790
Are you alright?

634
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,440
I'm okay. Thank you, sir.

635
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,790
Everyone, stay alert.

636
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,830
Don't be careless.

637
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,240
Tonight, the Eighteenth Prince is here to
watch the lanterns on behalf of His Majesty.

638
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,640
No mistake is allowed.

639
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,590
Yes, Sir!

640
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,160
Gentlemen.

641
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,640
-Your Highness.
-Long time no see.

642
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,640
I'd like to offer a toast to you both.

643
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,340
Cheers.

644
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,960
What time is it?

645
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,830
It's now exactly 8 PM.

646
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:17,469
We agreed to take action at 7 PM,

647
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,360
yet there's still no sign of them.

648
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,900
With how these two are dawdling,

649
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,420
they think they can assassinate me?

650
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,500
What a joke.

651
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,710
You've asked this several times tonight.

652
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,310
Why are you in such a hurry to
get assassinated?

653
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,980
Impressive!

654
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,110
Your Highness,

655
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,880
they're here.

656
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,909
The walking bouquet has arrived.

657
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,170
What walking bouquet?

658
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,440
Excuse me, coming through.

659
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,280
Excuse me.

660
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,710
The evening rush hour in ancient times

661
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,020
is also quite a nightmare too.

662
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,280
Please, please make way.

663
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,190
Make way.

664
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,230
Coming through, excuse me.

665
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,050
Hurry, hurry.

666
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,460
Sorry, sorry.

667
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,460
I apologize, I apologize.

668
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,540
It's you.

669
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,320
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

670
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,070
Dressed up like a walking bouquet,

671
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,770
are you rushing to get married?

672
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:21,880
Do you know how expensive this fabric is?

673
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,360
You've even dirtied my clothes.

674
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,230
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

675
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,070
I lost my balance

676
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,880
and fell into you.

677
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,230
I can't chat now. I'm in a hurry to
find someone.

678
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,840
Stop right there.

679
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,510
You think a simple "sorry" will suffice?

680
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,670
Compensate me for my dress.

681
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,190
You...

682
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,050
Ruru.

683
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,440
There are many people here.
Don't make a scene.

684
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,640
I'm trying to help you.

685
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,190
She's all dolled up.

686
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,650
Who knows what she's up to?

687
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,890
What do you want from me?

688
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,070
I'll take this as compensation.

689
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:49,760
Not this one.

690
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,000
Can I give you something else instead?

691
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,630
It has to be this one.

692
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,070
This really won't do, sis.

693
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,360
Give it back to me. This really won't do.

694
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,490
It has to be this one.

695
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,670
There's an assassin!

696
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,150
Jixiang!

697
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,610
Quick, quick, protect me!

698
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm done for.

699
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:21,930
Your Highness.

700
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:23,230
The plan has changed.

701
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,600
What should we do now?

702
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,440
Don't. Don't.

703
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,300
Your Highness.

704
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,160
The assassin.

705
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,060
Your Highness.

706
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,230
You... Listen to me.

707
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,360
I'm not an assassin.

708
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,710
This is just an

709
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,890
ordinary hairpin.

710
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,590
Really, trust me.

711
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,470
This is just a misunderstanding.

712
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,750
Misunderstanding?

713
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,230
You're so...

714
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,030
What's with all this commotion?

715
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,070
This is a royal ceremony.

716
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,710
So many eyes are watching.

717
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,190
Making such a fuss over a small matter,

718
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,320
how inappropriate.

719
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,710
Aren't you ashamed?

720
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,500
Heng, don't throw accusations around.

721
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,480
What did I say?

722
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,670
I just wanted to ask Miss Song...

723
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,840
What's there to ask?

724
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,030
Was all your studying for nothing?

725
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,760
You only know to ask questions when
faced with a situation.

726
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,960
I'm not criticizing you,

727
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,710
but even rats have skin.

728
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,920
Be more cautious in the future.

729
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:23,330
I...

730
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,840
You,

731
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,930
come with me.

732
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,960
I'm the chosen one!

733
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,590
I'm the son of auspiciousness!

734
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,190
I... What's wrong with me asking?

735
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,920
I can't even ask questions now?

736
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,080
What did that flowery sentence mean?

737
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,710
The "mice"

738
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,770
or "rats," he said?

739
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,610
He was insulting me, wasn't he?

740
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,280
I'm the victim!

741
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,110
How should I get him to the riverside?

742
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,090
If I just say it directly,

743
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,770
wouldn't that be too abrupt?

744
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,710
There's already been an unexpected
plot twist.

745
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,590
And this guy

746
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,030
is both cunning and slyly wicked.

747
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,140
It would be bad if he sees through it.

748
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,450
I've already stepped in to defend
her just now.

749
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,860
This action was indeed too obvious.

750
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,510
Next,

751
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,540
I must not show any sign of
prior knowledge.

752
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,920
I must find a way

753
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,470
to make her lead me to the Jade River
on her own.

754
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,800
Lanterns for sale!

755
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,470
Lanterns, beautiful lanterns!

756
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,040
How should I bring it up?

757
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,510
Sugar figurines!

758
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,110
Blown sugar figurines!

759
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:42,880
Come and take a look!

760
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,070
If we keep walking,

761
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,520
we'll be out of the city.

762
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,810
You've been quiet for a while.

763
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,790
What are you thinking about?

764
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,110
I...

765
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,960
Of course I'm thinking about

766
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,920
Your Highness's heroic figure when you
saved me just now.

767
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,550
You were just like

768
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,870
a god descending from heaven,

769
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:02,930
incredibly brave,

770
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,840
rescuing me from dire peril.

771
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:06,880
Hey, Song Yimeng,

772
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,080
since when did you become so talkative?

773
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,430
If you have something to say,
just say it directly.

774
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,080
Since Your Highness is so eager to know,

775
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,360
I do have something to say.

776
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,070
Then you...

777
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,650
Then go ahead and say it.

778
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,820
Your Highness.

779
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,630
Your Highness,

780
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,380
you...

781
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,590
Your Highness, your hairline

782
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:39,000
seems to have receded a bit

783
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,730
compared to when I last saw you.

784
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,030
Hairline?

785
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,630
Hairline.

786
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,150
Young man,

787
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,070
why don't you accompany your lady to
release a river lantern at the Jade River?

788
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,820
Lanterns for sale!

789
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,750
A classic soap opera assist.

790
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,960
Two mandarin duck lanterns,

791
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,690
two taels of silver, no change.

792
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,320
What kind of lanterns are these?
So expensive.

793
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
Two taels?

794
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,960
They're mandarin duck lanterns,
with blessings for perfect couples.

795
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,510
Even the Aladdin's magic lamp wouldn't
be that expensive, right?

796
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,400
What's the matter?

797
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,460
Feeling the pinch?

798
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,960
Miss.

799
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,480
I've been married for 40 years.

800
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,960
If you're young

801
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:30,670
and willing to spend money,

802
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,430
good fortune will follow.

803
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,000
Look at you, the dignified daughter
of a minister,

804
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,930
being so stingy.

805
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:39,800
Take them.

806
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,810
I'll buy them for you.

807
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,090
You don't have money?

808
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,030
You, a man, can't even

809
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,910
afford to pay two taels of silver?

810
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,510
I've been selling lanterns for 60 years,

811
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,610
and I've never seen anyone
as stingy as you.

812
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,920
Hey, I...

813
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,050
Give them back to me.

814
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,840
[Big-eyed Fish Lantern]
[Small-eyed Fish Lantern]

815
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,960
This one

816
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,000
is for you.

817
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,740
Here.

818
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,620
Thank you, granny.

819
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,760
Miss,

820
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,940
when looking for a man,

821
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,210
you must keep your eyes wide open.

822
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,320
Don't worry.

823
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,140
Look at this lantern,

824
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,460
squinting its eyes.

825
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,900
Doesn't it look like your stingy face?

826
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,810
Hey, I...

827
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,530
I'll give this to you for free.

828
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,650
I wish you

829
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,710
to keep being stingy!

830
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,170
I'm off.

831
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,230
Who are you calling stingy?

832
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,710
Who are you calling small-eyed?

833
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,480
Your Highness.

834
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,710
She didn't mean you. Your eyes
aren't small.

835
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,550
Let's go, Your Highness.

836
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,630
If we don't release the lanterns soon,
it'll be too late.

837
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,320
Quick, let's go.

838
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,050
Let's go release the lanterns.

839
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,480
Come here.

840
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,290
Your eyes are small. Here, take this.

841
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,030
Thank you, sir.

842
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,360
It's so pretty.
