bringing me here today?

5
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,710
I brought you here

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,110
to make a vow under the matchmaker tree.

7
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,910

8
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,750

9
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,850
or frightens you in the future,

10
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,600
I will resolve them all for you.

11
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,310
And rest assured,

12
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,310
I will take good care of you and
the Song family,

13
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,840
and I will never let you down
in this lifetime.

Didn't you say

15
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,470
you never believed in deities?

16
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,210
Since you believe,

17
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,730
then I'll believe too.

18
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,560
What's the point of believing, anyway?

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,220
The fate written in the script

20

still can't be changed.

21
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,320
Can the script

22

really not be changed?

23
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,290
Think about it,

in that so-called script of yours,

00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,640
you've already changed.

35

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,240
Not only have I changed,

has passed the crown prince position
to me.

41
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,329
So you see,

42
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,770
if the people in the script can change,

43
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,329
why can't the ending of the story
change too?

The reason I brought you here today

45
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,680

Did Your Majesty asks this question

out of concern that

if Chu Guihong is transferred,

155
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,490

169
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,150
He also suggested

170
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,200
that I give Chu Guihong a new task

171
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,710

172

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,670
Rui has the same idea as you.

174
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,270
He's worried that if Chu Guihong
stays in the capital,

175
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,390
he'll be trapped by his demons,

176

Sir, please rest assured,

563
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,100
the reason I'm willing to treat
His Highness

564
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:10,630
is to atone for Junior General's sins.

565
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,390
I ask for your promise

566
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,660
that if I could heal His Highness,

567
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,820

568
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,230

569
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,160

His Highness is currently
between life and death,

of the situation.

what Chu Guihong did

576
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,290
was a treasonous crime against
the sovereignty.

577
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,200
He deserves to be executed by
a thousand cuts!

578

I agree.

were still alive,

a lighter punishment?

The law of the land must be upheld.

752
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,090
An attack on the crown prince

753
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,480
cannot be dismissed by Song Yimeng's

754
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,630
casual words of forgiveness.

755
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:56,770
Yes, yes, yes.

756
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,180
If Song Yimeng's word doesn't count,

757
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,240
what about Mother?

758
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,400
When Mother was alive,

759
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,780
she loved Guihong the most.

760
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,150
Father,

761
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,610
if you really execute him,

762
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,000
I fear Mother's spirit

763
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,800
will never rest in peace.

764
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,020
Rui, in that case,

765
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,130
send more Imperial Guards to look for him

766
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,530
and bring him back first.

767
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,510
As for the rest,

768
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,170
we'll discuss it later.

769
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,920
Yes,

770
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,320
I'll see to it right away.

771
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:30,970
[Clear Breeze and a Radiant Moon]

772
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,000
Is the Noble Consort's chamber

773
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,150
this way?

774
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,630
My Lady,

775
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,320
His Highness

776
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,590
is now out of danger

777
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,760
and Yimeng is taking care of him.

778
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,660
You need not worry too much.

779
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,690
You should take care of your health.

780
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,760
Heaven be praised.

781
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,040
Good child.

782
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,550
Thank you for thinking

783
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,430
to inform me.

784
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,810
Your name is

785
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,280
Song Yiting, right?

786
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,270
You're just as likable as your sister.

787
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,890
I find that

788
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,670
Song Yude's second daughter

789
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,070
is more sensible than Song Yimeng.

790
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,300
I, Song Yiting, pay my respects to
Your Majesty.

791
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,060
Careful.

792
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,960
Careful.

793
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,630
Your Majesty.

794
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,840
How old are you?

795
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,360
Your Majesty,

796
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,140
I've just turned 22.

797
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,230
Are you married?

798
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,820
I already have someone I fancy.

799
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,400
Though we haven't formally exchanged
our birth details,

800
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,000
I've already decided on him.

801
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,440
In my eyes,

802
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,830
there's no room for anyone else.

803
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,030
I only asked if you were married,

804
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,560
yet you've given me this
long-winded answer.

805
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,920
Your Majesty,

806
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,360
please don't be angry.

807
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,190
Miss Song Yiting,

808
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:05,050
like her sister,

809
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,080
is straightforward person.

810
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,840
She speaks

811
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,040
whatever comes to mind without filter.

812
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,190
She meant no disrespect to Your Majesty.

813
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,590
I didn't say anything,

814
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,670
why are you so frightened

815
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,330
that you use the Crown Prince's wife
as a shield?

816
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,960
Well...

817
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,110
I came today

818
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,550
just to see how you are doing.

819
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:29,400
The Crown Prince is currently recovering.

820
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,860
You need to ease your mind,

821
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:33,280
and take good care of yourself,

822
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,960
so he won't have to worry about you.

823
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,440
Yes.

824
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,110
