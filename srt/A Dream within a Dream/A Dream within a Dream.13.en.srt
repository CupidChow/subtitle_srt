00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,820
How can it be me?

191
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Song Yimeng.

192
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,900
Song Yimeng.

193
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
This Song Yimeng often has

194
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,720
strange and peculiar things to say,

195
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,550
and she firmly promised before

196
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,130
to help me find the
method of weapon forging.

197
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,990
Perhaps she really can decode it.

198
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,120
That makes sense.

199
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,730
Why didn't I think of that?

200
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,720
As expected of you, Chief Master,

201
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,250
thinking of her right away.

202
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,840
You'll also get to spend more time
with her

203
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,910
while decoding those symbols.

204
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,040
It's killing two birds with one stone.

205
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,790
Hey, I'm talking about serious
matters here.

206
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,080
I'm calling her here strictly for
official business,

207
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,210
with absolutely no personal motives.

208
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,790
Fine.

209
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,990
I won't call her here.

210
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,270
You decode it for me.

211
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,200
Come on, you decode it.

212
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,270
I can't do it.

213
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,530
Only Miss Song can handle this task.

214
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,370
She alone won't be enough.

215
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,270
Look.

216
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,320
When Song Yimeng is researching
the method of weapon forging,

217
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,980
someone needs to monitor her.

218
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,080
This way,

219
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,510
if those symbols truly are the
method of weapon forging,

220
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,840
we can record her entire process

221
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,750
to avoid missing any details.

222
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,270
I didn't expect the height to be
so perfect.

223
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,440
Well, there's no other way then.

224
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,760
This challenging task

225
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,250
has to be entrusted to you.

226
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,510
Me?

227
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,080
I...

228
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,510
I monitor her?

229
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,910
It's not appropriate for me to spy on

230
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,270
the woman you like, right?

231
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,510
I definitely can't do it.

232
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,720
I'm Li Shiliu now,

233
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,120
and I have to be a good guy.

234
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,080
So

235
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,650
this kind of dirty work

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,460
has to be entrusted to you.

237
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:40,840
I...

238
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,000
[Keep Calm]

239
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,440
Stop shaking me.

240
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:02,000
[As Always]

241
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,960
Whatever it is,

242
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,080
it can wait until after I wake up.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,750
Father, it's only noon.

244
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,360
Please don't sleep yet.

245
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Guihong has

246
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
already finished renovating the
southern part of the city.

247
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
When will you lift my house arrest?

248
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,960
There's no rush.

249
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,850
After this turmoil passes,

250
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,530
I will help you with it.

251
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,000
Alright.

252
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,480
So my matter is settled.

253
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,150
But what about

254
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,240
Heng's matter?

255
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,480
He went to the Song Residence
a few days ago.

256
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,140
He's secretly colluding with
court officials.

257
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,360
He's trying to steal my position
as crown prince!

258
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,000
Rui.

259
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,720
Let me ask you,

260
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,390
do you have any evidence

261
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,200
that he's conspiring with court officials
to seize your position?

262
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,000
I...

263
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Look, Father.

264
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,320
You know how cunning and devious Heng is.

265
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,080
How could I possibly have any evidence?

266
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,270
Besides, Father,

267
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,320
don't you trust me?

268
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,120
I trust you,

269
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,890
but do all the court officials trust you?

270
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,440
Rui,

271
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,680
you're not a child anymore.

272
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,000
You always act childishly
when problems arise,

273
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,660
forcing me to stand up for you.

274
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,510
What if one day I'm gone?

275
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,120
How will you secure your position,

276
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,440
command the officials,

277
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,120
and protect the empire?

278
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,080
Well, at that time I could, um...

279
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,270
I mean, I could...

280
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,270
I...

281
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,600
This is so frustrating!

282
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,870
Your Highness...

283
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,440
[As Always]

284
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,360
Let him go.

285
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,450
Since his mother passed away,

286
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,030
I've favored him in everything.

287
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,270
I never expected

288
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,360
that I would raise him

289
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,490
to be so impulsive and temperamental.

290
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,610
He's also narrow-minded and
lacks ambition.

291
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,670
Tell me,

292
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,200
was I wrong?

293
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,400
Your Majesty.

294
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,280
Your Majesty.

295
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,930
The Seventh Prince requests an audience.

296
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,270
Let him in.

297
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,820
[Pure of Heart]

298
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,150
I

299
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,060
pay my respects to Your Majesty.

300
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,410
The renovation in the southern
part of the city is complete.

301
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,540
All these memorials

302
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,150
were submitted by your people,

303
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,450
yet they were all praising
Chu Guihong's achievements.

304
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,550
Why is that?

305
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,540
I wouldn't dare to secretly collude with
officials to submit memorials.

306
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,740
For this renovation,

307
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,480
Chu Guihong deserves the most credit,

308
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,810
and should be rewarded.

309
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,490
The officials' memorials

310
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,520
reflect the general consensus.

311
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,240
There's no need for such pretense

312
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,630
in front of me.

313
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,840
You're someone who never acts
without gain.

314
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,630
What do you

315
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,150
want this time?

316
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,640
Your Majesty.

317
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,320
I visited Fanghua Hall yesterday.

318
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,030
Mother has been bedridden for days,

319
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,430
refusing food and drink.

320
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,530
I believe it's because

321
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,000
she misses Your Majesty.

322
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,480
I earnestly beseech Your Majesty to

323
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,510
visit Mother

324
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,700
after tomorrow's court session.

325
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,360
Your Majesty.

326
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,190
The Lantern Festival matter is settled.

327
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,630
At tomorrow's morning court session,

328
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,690
I'll personally propose the request

329
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,440
that you lift Rui's confinement,
Your Majesty.

330
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,569
When the time comes,

331
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,660
Rui

332
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,270
can join me

333
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,670
in attending the Qingtan Musical Banquet.

334
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,800
Are you negotiating terms with me?

335
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,369
Requesting merit for Chu Guihong

336
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,750
and asking to lift Rui's confinement,

337
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,290
all just to have me

338
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,040
visit

339
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,589
your mother?

340
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,350
Brothers should be friendly and respectful
to each other,

341
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,020
and spouses should live in harmony.

342
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,150
These were Your Majesty's teachings,

343
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,090
which I have engraved in my heart

344
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,890
and dare not forget for a moment.

345
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,850
Therefore,

346
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,590
I humbly request Your Majesty

347
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,010
to go and visit Mother.

348
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,150
You know about brotherly

349
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,900
and marital harmony,

350
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,350
yet you don't understand

351
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,240
the principle of filial piety!

352
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,250
Negotiating terms with me,

353
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,450
is this the attitude you should
have towards me?

354
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,420
Your Majesty is the sovereign.

355
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,080
I dare not overstep my bounds.

356
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,480
Since you dare not overstep,

357
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
very well,

358
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,350
kneel here

359
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,310
and copy the "Classic of Filial Piety"
10 times,

360
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,770
then I'll visit your mother at
Fanghua Hall.

361
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,070

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,830

This path doesn't lead to the palace!

380
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,270

385
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,010

389
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,440
Shut up!

390
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,280
Don't let me hear you call me
Father ever again!

391
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,200
The thing I regret most in my life

392
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,630
is giving birth to a beast like you!

Your Majesty.

394
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,450
As things stand,

395
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,680
he is still of royal blood.

396
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,310
Besides, he's still a little boy.

397
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,370

What is this place?

408
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,190
The weapon forging room.

409
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,350
Since the assassination attempt
on the boat failed,

410
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,920
Chief Master has been thinking about

411
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,240
how to free you from the Seventh Prince's
control, Miss Song.

412
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,030
Therefore, he wanted to invite you here

413
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,350
to work together on

414
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,080
this method of weapon forging.

415
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,240
Mr. Li

416
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,160
is also looking for the
method of weapon forging?

417
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,690
The world's sharpest blade

418
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,760
means the strongest military power.

419
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:06,290
Chief Master is doing this for
your own good.

420
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,970
That's weird.

421
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,200
I clearly remember it's written
in the script that

422
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,030
the method of weapon forging
is a royal secret.

423
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,000
So how did the Nightwalkers

424
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,310
find out about it so easily?

425
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,880
Miss.

426
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,720
You may not trust me,

427
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,690
but don't you trust Chief Master?

428
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,000
The Lantern Festival last time

429
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,030
and the South City incident this time,

430
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,490
wasn't he the one who resolved
every crisis?

431
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:27,610
That's true.

432
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,880
If Mr. Li were a villain,

433
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,550
there would be no good guys left
in the script.

434
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,400
Letting him get the
method of weapon forging

435
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,600
is better than Nan Heng getting it
and harming the people.

436
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,830
Here's the clue we went to great lengths

437
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,060
to gather.

438
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,180
Miss, you can give it a try.

439
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,550
When Chief Master comes back,

440
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,110
if there's good news,

441
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,840
I'm sure he'll be very happy.

442
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,650
Hold on.

443
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,110
Fe₂O₃?

444
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,930
Why is it a chemical equation?

445
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,380
You actually know it.

446
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Shangguan.

447
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,220
Shangguan!

448
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,150
Oh no.

449
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,970
I'm terrible at chemistry.

450
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,950
This is a historical drama.

451
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,540
Why is there a chemical equation?

452
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,190
Could this really be a clue left
by the screenwriter?

453
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,380
If it weren't because I couldn't
balance chemical equations,

454
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,850
how would I have ended up choosing
liberal arts?

455
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,480
If I hadn't chosen liberal arts,

456
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,840
how would I have become an actress?

457
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,960
If I hadn't become an actress,

458
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,640
how would I have traveled back here?

459
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,080
And yet here, I still have to deal
with chemistry.

460
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,970
What kind of fate is this?

461
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,100
What is she muttering about?

462
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
What's this?

463
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This should work.

464
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,900
I guess I can add a bit more.

465
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,670
Like this.

466
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,790
This should work now.

467
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,230
It should be fine, right?

468
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,570
Oh no.

469
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,150
This... This won't explode, will it?

470
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,150
Miss Song!

471
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,200
Miss Song!

472
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,280
Are you alright?

473
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,680
Miss Song!

474
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,460
Such strong toxic fumes!

475
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,960
Could it be an assassination attempt

476
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,200
by another gang?

477
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,710
Let's go!

478
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,260
You are...

479
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,140
Miss Song?

480
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,490
I've told you

481
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,730
that I'm not good at chemistry.

482
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,960
Why did you have to

483
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,820
make me do this?

484
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,290
What happened here?

485
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,560
How did the explosion happen?

486
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,130
Chief Master, it's like this.

487
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,330
We had someone do a fortune reading,

488
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,110
and they said Miss Song has fire energy
in her destiny,

489
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,370
so wherever she goes, things catch fire.

490
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,090
It's true.

491
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,200
But Chief Master, don't worry.

492
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,240
We started our business with
water transport,

493
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,270
and you have strong water energy
in your destiny,

494
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:55,920
which can keep it under control...

495
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,000
Enough. Shut up.

496
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,480
You tell me

497
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,740
what happened.

498
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,880
Miss Song is

499
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,070
a master.

500
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,240
She's capable of destroying
an entire city on her own.

501
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,160
Go away.

502
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,350
Alright, they're gone.

503
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,480
You can come out now.

504
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,160
How did Song Yimeng

505
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,750
cause such a commotion?

506
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,030
Chief Master.

507
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,260
For the sake of all the years I've
risked my life for you,

508
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,360
please spare Song Yimeng,

509
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,140
and spare me too!

510
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,350
Whenever you two try to do something, I'm
always the one who gets hurt.

511
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,510
Last assassination attempt nearly
got me killed,

512
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,720
and this time I almost lost my eyesight.

513
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,060
I'm not Shangguan the Useless.

514
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,330
I'm more like the Unlucky Useless!

515
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,200
Song Yimeng.

516
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,540
I'm not here!

517
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,830
Mr. Li.

518
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,530
It really is Mr. Li.

519
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,590
What's wrong?

520
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,590
You're not even afraid of setting fires,

521
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,850
yet you're scared of applying ointment?

522
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,750
I... Let me clarify again,

523
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,280
I wasn't setting a fire,

524
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,110
I just

525
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,370
added a tiny bit of special ingredients.

526
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,320
Alright.

527
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,020
Come on,

528
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:26,920
turn around.

529
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,870
Let me apply some ointment for you.

530
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,710
Mr. Li.

531
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,610
You can just leave the ointment here.

532
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,880
I'll do it myself.

533
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,030
Please leave.

534
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,030
I'm not Nan Heng.

535
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,270
Why should you be afraid?

536
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,930
If you were Nan Heng, I wouldn't
be afraid at all.

537
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,070
Come on, turn around. Be good.

538
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,340
I-I-I can't.

539
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,070
Mr. Li...

540
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,550
It's fine, come on.

541
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,680
Mr. Li, my face really isn't
presentable today.

542
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,200
It's okay.

543
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,590
Really, please step outside.

544
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,200
Be good.

545
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,470
I already told you, Mr. Li.

546
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,360

Your face is blushing.

567
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,680
How could this be?

568
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,110
I have such thick skin.

569
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,670
I never blush at all.

570
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,960
See for yourself.

571
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,150
It's just high-altitude flush.

572
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,260
It was my fault this time.

573
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,130
I'll accompany you next time.

574
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,190
There's going to be a next time?

575
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,310
The thing is,

576
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,820
as long as we don't obtain the
method of weapon forging,

577
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,020
we have no way to fight against Nan Heng.

578
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,030
That's true.

579
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,720
Do you think in this world,

580
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,240
there are truly fathers and sons
who hate each other?

581
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,380
The method of weapon forging

582
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,750
is the trump card His Majesty left for
the Eighteenth Prince to protect himself,

583
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,610
but Nan Heng has always wanted to get it.

584
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,570
Why is that?

585
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,120
Because he wants to rebel.

586
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,900
Rebellion

587
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,000
means that

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,640
many people will die.

589
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,350
So even if I obtained

590
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,460
this method of weapon forging,

591
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,860
I wouldn't give it to him.

592
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,560
How can you be so certain

593
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,390
that he wants it for rebellion?

594
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,330
Because it's written in the script.

595
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,140
The script again.

596
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,680
If he does plan to rebel,

597
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,020
what do you plan to do?

598
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,680
I don't know.

599
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,300
I haven't made up my mind yet.

600
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,280
Just stopping him is difficult enough
right now.

601
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:37,410
But I still want to find another way,

602
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,910
a way that can help Nan Heng

603
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,510
let go of his hatred.

604
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,440
Have you considered

605
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,400
what if I told others

606
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,930
about everything you've told me?

607
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,420
What would you do then?

608
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,670
That's impossible.

609
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,720
You're Mr. Li.

610
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,140
You're the person I trust

611
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,510
most in this world.

612
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,800
Miss Song.

613
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:23,280
You can never truly know what's
in someone's heart.

614
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,780
Being so quick to trust others

615
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,710
will only end up hurting yourself.

616
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,150
I am not a good person,

617
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,670
nor am I

618
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,730
the virtuous man you make me out to be.

619
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,620
Mr. Li.

620
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,230
I'm not someone who trusts others easily,

621
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,360
but you're different.

622
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,290
I'm no different from anyone else.

623
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,170
In a moment,

624
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,070
I'll have Shangguan He escort you back.

625
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:49,800
I have matters to attend to, so I'll
take my leave.

626
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,250
Mr. Li.

627
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,320
Mr. Li!

628
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,310
That's weird.

629
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,330
What's gotten into him?

630
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,080
Chief Master.

631
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,480
I've escorted her back.

632
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,420
Look at you.

633
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,030
You're the one who drew her in,

634
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,710
and you're the one pushing her away.

635
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,370
What are you really thinking?

636
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,540
Take a look at this.

637
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,400
Isn't this that strange symbol

638
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,880
from the method of weapon forging?

639
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,880
She completed it?

640
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,360
I didn't expect that either.

641
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,680
However, this symbol

642
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,780
differs from the one in the
Qianyu Military Manual,

643
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,400
so it might not be the
method of weapon forging.

644
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,110
Well then.

645
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,890
I want you

646
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,030
to go search for

647
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,550
scholars across the land in secret
immediately

648
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,150
to see if anyone recognizes
these characters.

649
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,400
Understood.

650
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,030
Hold on.

651
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,630
I'm planning

652
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,000
to hold the Qingtan Musical Banquet

653
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,460
at Waning River Crescent.

654
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:30,510
Why?

655
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,770
These days, our Nightwalkers

656
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,800
have been gathering information everywhere

657
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,630
and searching for clues about the
method of weapon forging,

658
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,630
which has consumed enormous funds.

659
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,630
I originally intended

660
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,590
to transfer funds from my mansion,

661
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,030
but unfortunately, every outgoing
transaction of the mansion

662
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,030
has to be monitored by the
Imperial Household Department,

663
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:48,320
and every movement of funds
requires documentation

664
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,190
and proof.

665
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,960
So you want to use

666
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,150
the opportunity of hosting the
Qingtan Musical Banquet

667
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,630
to transfer funds here?

668
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,880
Exactly.

669
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,800
Do you know how big that banquet will be

670
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,510
and how many people we'll have to invite?

671
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,440
It will take a lot of time to prepare.

672
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,710
And you know, those young masters

673
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,710
and noble ladies are difficult
to deal with.

674
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,110
Just thinking about it gives me
a headache.

675
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,910
You should find another venue.

676
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,680
Alright then.

677
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,250
We can hold it at your mansion instead.

678
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,000
Let's hold it at Waning River Crescent
after all.

679
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,440
February 6th. Windy.

680
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,480
The scent of plum blossoms carried
on the breeze.

681
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,960
No desire to enjoy the fragrance,
thinking only of Miss Song.

682
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
February 7th. Light rain.

683
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,760
Raindrops tap against my lonely heart,

684
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,150
yet nothing compares to Yiting's
gentle swaying steps.

685
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,550
I miss you, Miss Song.

686
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,710
Take these out and burn them,

687
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,090
far away so they don't dirty my courtyard.

688
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,150
Yes.

689
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,510
Don't burn them.

690
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,320
This time, I've inquired about it for you.

691
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,550
The Eighteenth Prince will also attend

692
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,320
the Qingtan Musical Banquet.

693
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,710
You're skilled in poetry and music.

694
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,320
Isn't this a heaven-sent

695
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,650
opportunity to showcase yourself
in front of His Highness?

696
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,230
What exactly do you take me for, Mother?

697
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:12,280
Playing music, writing poetry,
showing off talents—

698
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,310
am I just a plaything on stage
for others' amusement?

699
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,400
What's the meaning of all this?

700
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,110
Of course it has meaning!

701
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,180
Think about it.

702
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,230
If it weren't for these accomplishments,

703
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,440
how could you possibly

704
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,510
stand out among so many daughters

705
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,700
from wealthy families

706
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,310
and marry a noble husband?

707
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,890
So my existence in this world

708
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
is only for the sake of marriage?

709
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,880
If not for marriage, then what?

710
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,550
Don't tell me you want to take

711
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,920
the imperial exams and become an official.

712
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,000
Why not?

713
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,360
Even if that were possible,

714
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,110
you'd have to become the Empress first

715
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,710
and have the Emperor change
the system for you.

716
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,320
It will leave a scar.

717
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:55,890
It won't leave a scar.

718
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,400
Scar.

719
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,760
No scar.

720
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:01,400
Easy.

721
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,920
It hurts so much, Xia.

722
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,910
Better a moment of pain than
prolonged suffering, My Lady.

723
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,820
He hadn't even finished applying
the ointment for me yet.

724
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,970
Why did he suddenly leave?

725
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,930
You're talking about Li Shiliu,
aren't you, My Lady?

726
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,090
But what matters most right now

727
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,230
isn't really Mr. Li's attitude.

728
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,110
But My Lady, you'll have to marry
someone eventually.

729
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,920
Before,

730
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,550
we thought it would be
General Chu Guihong.

731
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,880
Who would have thought
Li Shiliu would come along,

732
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,540
as well as the Seventh Prince.

733
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,920
Those words, "Seventh Prince,"

734
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,440
how could they even come up here?

735
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,230
Bad luck.

736
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,440
"Exceptional Love" is already written
like that.

737
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,110
There's no need to play dumb
with us anymore, My Lady.

738
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,880
What love?

739
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,030
What love are you talking about?

740
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,190
"Exceptional Love."

741
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,390
"Exceptional Love?"

742
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,710
These past two days, the servants
in the mansion

743
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,190
have been secretly passing it around,

744
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:58,140
[Exceptional Love]

745
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,630
saying you and the Seventh Prince
are meant for each other,

746
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,670
a perfect match.

747
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,130
Stirring up gossip?

748
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,630
Marketing?

749
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,560
Like he did with "Illusory Dream."

750
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,230
I'm used to it by now.

751
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,880
Nothing surprises me anymore.

752
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,000
It's not the first time

753
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,150
he's pulled these cheap tricks.

754
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,010
How can you be so sure it's the
Seventh Prince's doing, My Lady?

755
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,150
You still don't know villains well.

756
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,840
What kind of person is Nan Heng?

757
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,070
A scheming snake,

758
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,430
full of dirty tricks.

759
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,400
I'm telling you right now,

760
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,070
if he's not behind this,

761
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,550
I'll eat my hat.

762
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,550
I knew these rumors couldn't be trusted.

763
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,550
I know you only have Li Shiliu
in your heart, My Lady.

764
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,840
Don't talk nonsense.

765
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,870
Nothing's even started between us yet.

766
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,840
Besides, his attitude towards me

767
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,000
is always so unpredictable,

768
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,110
I really can't read his mind.

769
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,550
Then why don't you

770
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,280
just ask him directly, My Lady?

771
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,760
If

772
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,280
I were to

773
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,510
take the initiative and ask him,

774
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,070
wouldn't it seem a bit...

775
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,670
What's there to ask?

776
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,000
Haven't I told you already?

777
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,260
It's just a partnership, a partnership.

778
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,920
That makes sense.

779
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,030
How could you possibly like Mr. Li,
My Lady?

780
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,550
You haven't even seen his face yet.

781
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,410
For all we know,

782
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,550
he could be covered in sores,

783
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,440
oozing pus everywhere,

784
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,570
bald and toothless.

785
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,360
And if you think about it,

786
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,800
he might be of poor character,

787
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,320
robbing and killing, pillaging and
looting.

788
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,710
He might even...

789
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,510
Stop, stop.

790
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

791
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,480
He's upright and kind,

792
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,670
loyal to his friends,

793
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,150
tall and wealthy,

794
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,570
and owns property.

795
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,050
Although his job isn't stable,

796
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,110
no matter what,

797
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,550
he could be considered

798
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,030
a small entrepreneur, right?

799
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,320
You say you don't like him,

800
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,280
but you can't stand hearing even
half a flaw about him.

801
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,110
My Lady.

802
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,320
You'll be turning 25 by spring.

803
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,550
When do you plan

804
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,510
to confess your feelings to Mr. Li?

805
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,480
The wedding dress definitely has to be
the latest style.

806
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,070
Should we choose the shop in the south

807
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,110
or the one in the north of town?

808
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,670
And the invitation cards, they must be...

809
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,320
Stop.

810
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,440
Can you two please not start talking

811
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,630
about my love life the moment you appear?

812
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,630
Don't you know that in Hong Kong dramas,

813
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,670
"just find a man and get married"

814
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,930
is actually an insult?

815
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,280
Talking about

816
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,480
marriage all the time.

817
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,320
Will it ever end? So annoying.

818
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,400
My Lady, Master wants to see you.

819
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,510
What for?

820
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,600
To talk about your marriage.

821
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,990
This writing is neither clerical nor
seal script,

822
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:38,760
but rather resembles the ancient ritual
bronze inscriptions.

823
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,470
What could its meaning be?

824
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:56,920
Father.

825
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,630
Why do you have this?

826
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,510
What happened to your face?

827
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,510
It's nothing, just a small scratch.

828
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,320
Where did you get this note?

829
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,110
You recognize this?

830
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,610
Word on the street says

831
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,080
this is

832
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,340
the formula for the
method of weapon forging.
