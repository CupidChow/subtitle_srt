[A Dream Within A Dream]

00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,930
[Episode 10]

3
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,640
Who are you calling stingy?

4
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,920
Who are you saying has small eyes?

5
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,760
Your Highness,

6
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,040
I didn't mean you. Your eyes aren't small.

7
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,920
Let's go, Your Highness.

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,950
We'll be late if we don't light
the lanterns now.

9
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:07,590
Hurry!

10
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,190
Let's go light the lanterns!

11
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,840
Here, come here.

12
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,360
Your eyes are small. Take this.

13
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,360
Thank you, Sir.

14
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,680
So pretty..

15
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,630
Gentlemen.

16
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,470
-Eighteenth Prince
-Long time no see.

17
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,329
I'd like to offer you both a toast.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,800
Gentlemen...

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
This one here,

20
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,400
hasn't even taken that position yet,

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
but already acts like this.

22
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,280
Are you satisfied with today's banquet?

23
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,480
Yes, very satisfied.

24
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,430
Mr. Wang.

25
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,720
Mr. Song.

26
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,560
I've been waiting for you all evening.

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,970
I finally get to offer you a toast.

28
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,280
The other day in court,

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,840
you spoke up for my cousin.

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
I have etched it into my heart.

31
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,000
There'll be more matters of state in the
future.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,860
I shall seek your advice again.

33
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,860
You're too kind, Your Highness.

34
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,510
Everything I've said in court

35
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,340
was all out of a sense of justice.

36
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,040
I don't deserve such praise from you,
Eighteenth Prince.

37
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,870
Well, I...

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,910
Mr. Song,

39
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,079
you're standing on ceremony now.

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,030
My cousin

41
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,880
will soon marry your eldest daughter.

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,680
Right?

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,360
As for me,

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,430
Miss Yiting and I will also be...

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,000
Mr. Song?

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,660
You...

47
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,840
You...

48
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,650
I'm having a stomach ache.

49
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,820
Please excuse me.

50
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,070
Mr. Song.

51
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Mr. Song!

52
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:48,860
You...

53
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,329
Is this for real?

54
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,079
Did he just decline

55
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,120
the divine wine I offered?

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,120
He's really disregarding my pride.

57
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,980
Your Highness,

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,840
should we go after him?

59
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,590
Why bother chasing?

60
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,800
What does he have to chase after?

61
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,380
He- He's even acting up now.

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,190
Yiting,

63
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,240
there.

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,590
The second son of the Vice Minister of
Rites.

65
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,800
Looks sneaky.

66
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,040
What about that one?

67
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,630
The head of the Hanlin Academy.

68
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,120
He was the third-ranked scholar at
just twenty,

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,170
he's definitely talented.

70
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,230
Hopelessly rigid.

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,640
Then what do you think

72
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,070
about this one here?

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,700
Your Highness,

74
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,659
I have some matters to attend to.

75
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,720
I'll take my leave now.

76
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,510
Yiting!

77
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,950
Yiting.

78
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,070
Yiting.

79
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,310
There will be fireworks soon.

80
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,510
Won't you watch them with me?

81
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,390
This is a good opportunity to get to know
me better.

82
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,190
Yiting!

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
This...

84
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,260
Could it be my appearance is too grand
today,

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,650
that it made her feel inferior?

86
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,840
Remember what I said.

87
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,430
If Li Shiliu fails in the assassination
or if the situation changes,

88
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,870
make sure to deploy more men near
the leisure boat.

89
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,680
Yes.

90
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,600
Great! Great!

91
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,750
It's me.

92
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,190
Come out.

93
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Yimeng has taken him to the riverside.

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,490
When do you plan to make your move, sir?

95
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,310
After one incense stick burns out.

96
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,040
Mr. Li, aren't you going to ask me about

97
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,840
the Qianyu Army's support plan?

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,500
Such overconfidence.

99
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,730
Be careful of losing your life here.

100
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,810
His kung fu is not weak.

101
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,130
If you fail,

102
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,170
I urge you to not implicate Yimeng.

103
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,210
Take care, Brother Li.

104
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,100
You take care too, Brother Chu.

105
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,440
Chu Guihong.

106
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,800
Why did you hurt me?

107
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,470
Who are you?

108
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,530
I've known Li Shiliu for so long,

109
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:44,460
he has never called me Brother Chu.

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,700
Didn't you just call me Brother Li?

111
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,500
Why can't I call you Brother Chu?

112
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,040
I've crossed swords with Li Shiliu before.

113
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,409
His kung fu is not weak.

114
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,760
If someone were to ambush him,

115
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,890
it wouldn't have succeeded so easily.

116
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,870
Speak.

117
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,830
Who are you really?

118
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,180
Well done!

119
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,750
Good!

120
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,730
One more.

121
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,390
Thank you.

122
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,400
Here, this is yours. Hold it well.

123
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,120
Next.

124
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,360
Very nice.

125
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,270
That's right.

126
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,220
Indeed.

127
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,300
Lanterns for sale!

128
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,790
Lanterns, lanterns!

129
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,370
Come and take a look!

130
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,150
What wish did you make?

131
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,510
Why don't you tell first, Your Highness.

132
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,770
What wish did you make?

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I've never believed in these things.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,159
Whatever I want,

135
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,180
I just earn it myself.

136
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,890
However,

137
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,130
as long as you serve me well,

138
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,830
I will make

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,530
all your wishes l come true.

140
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,310
Really?

141
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
Alright then.

142
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,780
You better listen carefully.

143
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,910
I want

144
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,310
a dog that looks like a cat,

145
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,600
a cat that looks like a dog,

146
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,190
and a flying Pegasus.

147
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,480
I also want a big house,

148
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,390
to admire cedar in summer and lotus
flowers in winter.

149
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,630
I want to not having to work all year
round.

150
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,630
No presentations, no mental control,

151
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,920
no encounters with overconfident
mediocre men.

152
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,270
and no keyboard warriors when I'm online.

153
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,150
As for the person I like,

154
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,270
he should be a gentle puppy during the day

155
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,320
and a fierce wolf at night.

156
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,789
When he's free, he should also help me
walk

157
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,390
the dog that looks like a cat.

158
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

159
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,150
See?

160
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,050
You can't do it, can you?

161
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,790
If you can't,

162
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,670
cut it out with that bossy CEO act.

163
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,550
I'll do it.

164
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,150
I said I'll do it.

165
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,080
As long as you help me find the method
of weapon forging,

166
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,150
your wishes,

167
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,090
I will fulfil them for you.

168
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,510
You...

169
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,810
What are you up to now?

170
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,510
If I tell you

171
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,920
that I can make them come true.

172
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,970
I'm only asking this once.

173
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,030
Will you trust me?

174
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,120
I...

175
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,320
I don't trust you one bit.

176
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,510
Look, look, look!

177
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,150
They're setting off fireworks!

178
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,320
It's so beautiful!

179
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,480
It's the fireworks prepared by the
Qianyu Army.

180
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,200
Your Highness,

181
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,860
let's get on the boat to watch.

182
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,200
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

183
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,320
I'm clumsy.

184
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,820
Please punish me, Miss.

185
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,590
It's alright.

186
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,200
Seventh Prince, I'm sorry.

187
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll go clean up over there first.

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,630
You...

189
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,550
Go ahead and eat and drink.

190
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,750
Please wait a moment.

191
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,730
Miss Song,

192
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,770
I thought this Seventh Prince would be so
hard to kill,

193
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,300
but he seems ordinary to me.

194
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,840
With those acting skills just now,

195
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,260
you still have the nerve to comment on
others?

196
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,550
Let's quickly leave this place.

197
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,350
Let's not delay Mr. Li's action.

198
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,300
Thought it would be a final boss fight,

199
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,350
turns out it's an immediate defeat.

200
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,510
Chu Guihong,

201
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,010
what is the meaning of this?

202
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,640
There are thieves causing trouble in the
city tonight.

203
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,040
I chased them to this place.

204
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,370
I didn't expect to disturb Your Highness.

205
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,730
Then it's your incompetence, Chu Guihong.

206
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,410
Alllowing the criminals

207
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,060
to escape to this place.

208
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,380
You may excuse now.

209
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,490
I will personally interrogate this person.

210
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,220
No way.

211
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,450
What does it have to do with you?

212
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,080
Seventh Prince,

213
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,890
maintaining the security of the capital

214
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,150
is the duty of all citizens of Great Jing.

215
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,650
In my opinion,

216
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,060
this person is already injured.

217
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,390
He seems quite pitiful.

218
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,000
And he hasn't really done anything bad.

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,450
Let's just release him.

220
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,590
That's not possible.

221
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,950
General Chu is right.

222
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,590
Before we confirm this person's identity,

223
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,790
we can't let them go easily.

224
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,430
The Seventh Prince is right.

225
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,270
Let the capital prefecture's office
interrogate them.

226
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,080
No way.

227
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,330
Miss Song,

228
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,750
Chu doesn't look like a good person at
all.

229
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,670
He's definitely putting on this act

230
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,000
to harm Chief Master.

231
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,950
What does this have to do with you?

232
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,790
Miss Song said

233
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,840
this is the duty of every citizen of
Great Jing.

234
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,710
Today is the Lantern Festival.

235
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,510
I suppose General Chu

236
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,750
must have many matters to attend to.

237
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,150
Why bother holding onto him?

238
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,150
Stay back, all of you.

239
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,200
Run! Someone's trying to assassinate in
public!

240
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,160
Nan Heng,

241
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,750
today I have come specifically to take
your life.

242
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,030
Cover me while I jump off the boat.

243
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,670
Let's go.

244
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,720
Wait.

245
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,610
[Peace & Prosperity]

246
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,630
Our people.

247
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,110
Our enemy.

248
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,510
That's right.

249
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,600
Why are you still acting?

250
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,360
Get him!

251
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,240
I... You...

252
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,770
Don't come any closer.

253
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,200
Seventh Prince!

254
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,810
Don't- don't hurt him.

255
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,940
Don't hurt him.

256
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,500
The Seventh Prince has been attacked.

257
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,060
The Xuanjia Army is here to investigate.

258
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,320
Everyone, make way!

259
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,630
Qianyu Army, listen up!

260
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,290
Quickly follow me to the dock.

261
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,690
-Get out of the way!
-Move!

262
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,190
Make way!

263
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,440
Make way, make way!

264
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,550
Make way!

265
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,590
Make way!

266
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,040
Make way!

267
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,150
Everyone stop right there!

268
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:41,270
Your Highness, Your Highness.

269
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,870
Don't be rash, don't be rash.

270
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,640
Don't be rash, Seventh Prince.

271
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,770
Chu Guihong,

272
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,380
I need you to give me an explanation.

273
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,790
What's your relationship with these
people?

274
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,600
Also,

275
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,790
in this assassination,

276
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,320
how much were you involved?

277
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,490
Seventh Prince,

278
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,750
this has nothing to do with him.

279
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,600
It was me.

280
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,080
I did it all by myself.

281
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,510
Song Yimeng.

282
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,240
Yimeng.

283
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,380
Do you know the gravity of the crime of
attempting to assassinate a prince?

284
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,110
Your whole family will be executed.
Can you bear the consequences?

285
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,880
I have to even if I can't.

286
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,860
Your Highness.

287
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,840
It's because I couldn't find what you
wanted.

288
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,020
That's why I resorted to this desperate
measure.

289
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,000
They are all innocent.

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
Enough. I didn't ask you.

291
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,360
Chu Guihong.

292
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,720
You're the capital prefect.

293
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,810
So tell me, which one of them
is telling the truth?

294
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,680
Or maybe…

295
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,090
the one who really wants me dead

296
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,100
is you.

297
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,550
As I said from the start,

298
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,700
I was chasing a fugitive who fled here.

299
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,050
As for these three people here,

300
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,760
neither Yimeng nor I know them.

301
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,790
Fine.

302
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,590
Then I'll

303
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,790
execute this criminal

304
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,990
right here, right now.

305
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,750
Nan Heng!

306
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,980
Don't you hurt him!

307
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,070
If you hurt him, I'll never let you go!

308
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,140
Yimeng.

309
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,340
Yimeng is a woman after all.

310
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,190
She said that out of pity.

311
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,220
Your Highness.

312
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,630
Go ahead.

313
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,630
Chu Guihong,

314
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,310
what the hell are you saying?

315
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,080
Yimeng, go back first.

316
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,320
I'll explain everything later.

317
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,080
You…

318
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,960
Your Highness!

319
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,670
General!

[Peace & Prosperity]

321
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,510
Apologies for the delay.

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,360
-Take him back!

from you.

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,550
Great!

Mr. Li should be far away by now.

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:14,930
Oh no.

343
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,720
Mr. Li failed his assassination attempt.

344
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,140
Nan Heng didn't die.

345
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,310
That means...

346
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,960
Everything will still unfold as written.

347
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,520

Yimeng.

354
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,110
Yimeng, that person wasn't Li Shiliu.

355
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,370
What happened tonight feels off too.

356
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,270
Trust me.

357
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,680
Chu Guihong.

358
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,530
You've been suspicious of him from the
beginning.

359
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,750
Now it's come to this, are you satisfied?

360
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,310
I...

361
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,370
Listen to me first.

362
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,770
Tonight's events are just the beginning.

363
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,510
Later in this market,

364
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,910
there will be a fire.

365
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,230
Many innocent people will be hurt.

366
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,520
If you believe me,

367
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,310
can you send the Qianyu Army

368
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,920
to follow me and prevent all this from
happening?

369
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,720
A fire?

370
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,010
Why would a fire suddenly break out in
the city?

371
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,020
-Yimeng.
-I…

372
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,160
Right now, Rong Hua and the others

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,050
are searching everywhere for Li Shiliu.

374
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,830
and Nan Heng's people are still watching
closely.

375
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,000
I can't leave here.

376
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,140
I knew it.

377
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,000
Yimeng.

378
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,320
Let me send you home first, okay?

379
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,750
So much has happened tonight.

380
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,570
Nan Heng surely won't let this go.

381
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,700
I'll only be at ease if you stay at home.

382
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,550
No need.

383
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,510
Yimeng, where are you going?

384
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,400
To find Mr. Li.

385
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,090
Together with him,

386
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,250
we'll change the world.

387
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,400
Although tonight's plan went awry,

388
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,750
at least the intended goals

389
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,880
have been achieved.

390
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,790
Everything's settled now.

391
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,790
Why did you change into this outfit?

392
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,550
Don't worry about it.

393
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,930
Aren't you injured? Go back first.

394
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,980
Are you worried about the chaos
Song Yimeng mentioned?

395
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,430
Put your mind at ease.

396
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,350
The Qianyu Army is now going all out

397
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,720
to search for Li Shiliu.

398
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,830
The entire capital is sealed tight like
an iron bucket.

399
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,880
Only you would dare

400
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,160
to cause trouble on a night like this.

401
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,540
This is the key point.

402
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,960
I've been thinking these past few days

403
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
about the chaos Song Yimeng mentioned.

404
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,340
What exactly is it? What's the purpose?

405
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,090
And who's behind it all?

406
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,350
If things go wrong at the Lantern Festival
and Chu Guihong takes the blame,

407
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,620
I should be the one who benefits the most.

408
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,310
I'm sure Your Majesty can figure that out
too.

409
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,140
But behind the scenes,

410
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,170
who would be the one

411
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,010
who reaps the benefits?

412
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,200
Wait for me! Wait for me!

413
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,390
[A Dream of Qingning,
Episode 10, Scene 21]

414
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,610
It's here.

415
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,070
It's this archway.

416
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,720
Please make way!

417
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,350
Sir, this fire is very dangerous.

418
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,510
Put it out quickly!

419
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,920
Stop, stop, stop!

420
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Danger!

421
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,140
Miss, this fire is too dangerous!

422
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,590
It's too dangerous!

423
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,650
What are you doing?

424
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,400
Demotion.

425
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,850
Not demoting others, only me.

426
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,640
Failing to live up to lofty ambitions,

427
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,040
with impressive talents.

428
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:14,280
A lifetime's aspirations never fulfilled.

429
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,430
Never fulfilled!

430
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,600
Watch out!

431
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,870
Fire! Fire! Fire!

432
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,660
Help! There's a fire!

433
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,620
Run!

434
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,850
Run!

435

Run! Run!

Little one!

437
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,220
Little one, get up quickly!

438
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,910
Quick, be careful!

439
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,060

Just a minor injury, nothing serious.

454
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,070
Move aside! Move aside! Move aside!

455
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,310
Make way! We're here to put out the fire!

456
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,860
Move aside! Make way!

457
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:27,060
Hurry up! Move aside!

458
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,030

00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,000

466
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,040
Go!

467
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,350
The chaotic Lantern Festival and the fire
in the city.

468
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,750
Everything you said has come true.

469
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,440
How did you know?

470
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,640
Mr. Li.

471
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,590
Do you believe in fate?

472
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,480
What do you mean?

473
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,510
In this world,

474
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,660
everyone's birth

475
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,440
was prewritten in a script,

476
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,510
with all the joys and sorrows
predetermined.

477
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,510
And in the end,

478
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,880
it leads to

479
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,080
an outcome you can never change.

480
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,270
This is the rule of this world.

481
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,420
I don't believe in those

482
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,770
heretical teachings.

483
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,360
Mountains weren't born with peaks,

484
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,070
and roads weren't born flat.

485
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,160
Whether it's humiliation or ups and downs,

486
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,440
joy or sorrow,

487
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,650
I have my own hands and feet.

488
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,510
I can trample through thorns and
aim my blade up at the sky.

489
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,350
Why should the outcome

490
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:05,410
of my life be in someone else's hands?

491
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,480
If there is really some rule‑maker

492
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,480
pulling strings behind the scenes,

493
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,390
then I should be the one holding the pen.

494
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,980
I knew it.

495
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,150
The Lantern Festival was meant to be a
disaster,

496
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,470
and between us two,

497
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,230
there was no fate for us to meet.

498
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,400
But ever since you, Mr. Li,

499
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,850
saved me at Waning River Crescent,

500
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,110
I've always felt that something

501
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
has been changed.

502
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,000
Mr. Li,

503
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,950
thank you.

504
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,070
I knew it.

505
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,720
Fate

506
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,570
could be changed.

507
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,930
The world

508
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,360
can also be changed.

509
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,820
Search every corner thoroughly.

510
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,960
Yes.

511
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,030
General,

512
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,960
everything here has been taken care of.

513
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,830
All potential risks have been identified
and addressed.

514
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,830
There shouldn't be any more issues.

515
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,720
Good.

516
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,710
What about Li Shiliu?

517
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,170
One of our men just reported

518
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,810
that they spotted him near Weishui Street.

519
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,580
I've sent two men to follow him.

520
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,810
Let's go there too.

521
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,370
General. General.

522
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,720
What is it?

523
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,090
Didn't you mention that you wanted to

524
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,250
set off fireworks for Miss Song during
the Lantern Festival?

525
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,910
Besides what we used today,

526
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,710
I've specially kept some aside.

527
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:17,490
Would you like to give Miss Song

528
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,020
a surprise?

529
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,910
Not now.

530
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,710
Let's go find Li Shiliu.

531
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,720
Mr. Li, let me help you apply it.

532
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,920
Come on, give it to me.

533
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,920
I know.

534
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,440
Burns are the most painful.

535
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,510
I'm not sure if this medicine

536
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,040
contains any antibiotics.

537
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,600
The medical conditions here must be poor.

538
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,520
Remember when you go back,

539
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,860
keep the wound dry.

540
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,310
And you can't eat any inflammatory foods.

541
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,270
Things like lamb, beef,

542
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,130
seafood and such.

543
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,240
None of these are allowed.

544
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,590
If you're not careful,

545
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,640
this arm of yours could be ruined.

546
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,620
How can a swordsman who can't hold
a sword,

547
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,220

00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,120
I've prepared some small gifts for you.

560
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,840
Thank you, Miss Song.

561
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,400
But Mr. Li saved my life.

562
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,240
♪ Is it self-inflicted or willful
obsession? ♪

563
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,310
At a time like this,

564
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,200
♪ Is it overestimating myself,
yet still without regret? ♪

565
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,170
how can you still not trust Mr. Li?

566
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,840
Nan Heng, don't touch him!

567
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,470
If you hurt him, I'll never let you go!

568
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,510
♪ To give you a love etched into the
bones ♪

569
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,270
Let's go

570
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,480
♪ Then it's not something to grieve ♪

571
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,340
♪ If tears are proof that I once loved ♪

572
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,970
♪ If loss is the trace of having existed ♪

573
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,770
♪ Then let the tears fall ♪

574
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,420
♪ Let me love you ♪

575
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,870
♪ And fade away with one last dream ♪

576
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,350
Did I hurt you?

577
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,580
No, not at all.

578
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,970
Do you...

579
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,620
do this often?

580
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,830
Of course not.

581
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,020
I'm not a doctor.

582
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,750
That's not what I meant.

583
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,730
Then what?

584
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,230
Mr. Li,

585
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,200
you're not feeling awkward, are you?

586
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,480
Because I touched you?

587
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,850
No, how could that be?

588
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,110
I've been roaming the world for years.

589
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,640
What have I not seen before?

590
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,160
This is nothing.

591
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,820
Yes, yes, yes.

592
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,620
You're right.

593
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,030
Everything must seem trivial

594
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,030
to a great hero like you, right?

595
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,750
Then, Mr. Li,

596
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,610
being defeated and held captive by
Nan Heng today,

597
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,070
to you,

598
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,940
is that also not a big deal?

599
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,600
Why are you speaking so sarcastically?

600
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,460
Let me ask you this.

601
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,220
Nan Heng already knows

602
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,830
you're involved in today's assassination
attempt.

603
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,760
How are you going to get out of this?

604
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,370
I don't know.

605
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,210
Whatever.

606
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,480
Fighting or killing,

607
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,960
that's all for tomorrow.

608
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,330
Tonight, let's just sit here

609
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,480
and enjoy the Lantern Festival.

610
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,350
Acting without thinking things through.

611
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,460
How can there be

612
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:12,520
someone like you in this world?

613
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,180
Why not?

614
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,000
It's because in this world,

615
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,380
there are always things

616
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,970
beyond your consideration and calculation.

617
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,620
If you have ever experienced

618
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,440
trying your hardest to reach the top,

619
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,970
but never being able to get there,

620
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,160
then you should understand

621
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,170
that enjoying the view from the bottom
can be quite nice too.

622
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,790
Don't think too much.

623
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,810
These are things for the protagonists
to worry about.

624
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,970
I've been wanting to ask you,

625
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,050
what is a protagonist?

626
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,880
And what is a male lead, which
you mentioned?

627
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,950
A male lead...

628
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,750
A male lead is usually

629
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,350
the most capable character in a script.

630
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,310
He must be handsome, capable, and tragic.

631
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,219
He must possess all the virtues.

632
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,350
He must

633
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,920
take others' sacrifices

634
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,400
for granted.

635
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,320
He must be ruthless.

636
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,219
He must-

637
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,130
In short,

638
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,489
he's not a good person.

639
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,360
And you said that

640
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:34,199
Nan Heng is the main character.

641
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,710
But what about me?

642
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,710
What am I?

643
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,880
You...

644
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,800
You're naturally a supporting character.

645
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,429
Supporting characters in scripts

646
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,590
are usually not very important

647
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,250
and don't have much presence.

648
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,760
If I'm not important,

649
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,890
why did you save me just now?

650
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,430
How can you say that, Mr. Li?

651
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,750
A supporting character's life is still
a life.

652
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,280
Besides, you've helped me before.

653
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
So to me, you are very important.

654
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,140
♪ If frost etched traces of weariness ♪

655
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,740
♪ If surging clouds hid the stars ♪

656
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,950
Such beautiful fireworks!

657
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:20,300
♪ The gaze you once cast upon me ♪

658
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,020
♪ Does it still remember love and hate? ♪

659
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,900
♪ If the rising wind scatters the dust ♪

660
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,460
♪ If every dream must be awakened ♪

661
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:36,090
♪ How much of the past can we recognize? ♪

662
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,850
♪ In a single thought lies tenderness ♪

663
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,980
The script never mentioned

664
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:49,490
♪ Look at the vast heavens,
letting rain fall, indifferent to all ♪

665
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,260
that the fireworks in this world would be
so beautiful.

666
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,690
And

667
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,670
it also didn't mention

668
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,460
♪ Watch how time quietly
waits for stories to take root ♪

669
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:05,090
♪ Look at the road ahead,
in the end, there will be guiding lights ♪

670
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,790
that a faceless supporting character

671
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,320
could be so cool.

672
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:19,260
♪ We lead remarkable lives
in this mundane world ♪

673
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,400
It's nothing.

674
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,870
Jixiang,

675
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,290
did you see how many times

676
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,420
Yiting smiled at me just now?

677
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,570
It must have been at least three times.

678
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,920
I knew it,

679
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,200
she's not completely indifferent to me.

680
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:01,870
In the capital, among all the officials,

681
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:05,880
can you find even half a person
who can match me?

682
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,340
Not half a person,

683
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,760
but whole ones,

684
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,570
quite a few.

685
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,400
Shut up!

686
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,460
Look at yourself,

687
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,760
and then look at Fugui.

688
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,360
I've been suppressed by Heng for
so many years,

689
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,330
at least half the responsibility

690
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,660
lies with you.

691
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,610
Are you alright?

692
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,070
I'm fine.

693
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,440
I'm perfectly sober.

694
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,510
Let's go.

695
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,670
Shouldn't we be going backwards?

696
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,350
Don't worry about it.

697
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,650
I'll go wherever I want.

698
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,300
Hurry up and finish moving everything.

699
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,260
[Dry weather; No candles or open flames]

700
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,000
Be careful, these wooden boxes are
full of fireworks.

701
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,550
Highly flammable and explosive.
There's no room for error.

702
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,190
Yes.

703
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,530
Eighteenth Prince!

704
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,260
Qianyu Army,

705
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,730
what are you doing here?

706
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,860
Where's my cousin?

707
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,740
Your Highness,

708
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,590
there were assassins and a fire tonight.

709
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,590
The general has taken men to patrol.

710
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,920
Assassins?

711
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,280
Where did the assassins come from?

712
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,150
If there are any assassins, I'll kick...

713
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,680
Your Highness, be careful!

714
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,960
These are all fireworks.

715
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,760
Fireworks?

716
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,420
Yes.

717
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,400
What a pity.

718
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,800
These took a lot of effort

719
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,340
to bring back from abroad.

720
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,510
Just a few days ago, the general said

721
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,820
he wanted to set them off for Miss Song.

722
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,480
But just now he said it's not necessary
anymore.

723
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,690
Fireworks from abroad...

724
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:56,550
Yiting must have never seen them before.

725
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,200
If my cousin doesn't want them,

726
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,500
I'll set them off for Yiting.

727
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,900
Come on, give them to me.

728
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
Run!

729
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,610
Help! Help!

730
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,070
Granny!

731
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,470
Are you alright, Granny?

732
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,840
Come on, get up quickly.

733
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,550
The oil mill! The children!

734
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,510
There are still children inside!

735
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,240
Don't worry, I'll go save them.

736
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,000
I'll go.

737
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,020
Where are you running to?

738
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,280
Get inside!

739
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,510
It's okay, go quickly! Hurry!

740
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,450
Alright, alright.
