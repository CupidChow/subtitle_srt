00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,640
Nan Heng.

556
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,350
All this is pointless.

557
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,550
I...

558
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,910
I really can't agree to marry you
right now.

559
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,440
Just because you can't now

560
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,350
doesn't mean you won't in the future.

561
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,920
I have all the time in the world,

562
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,250
and I'm willing to wait.

563
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,240
Playing the hopeless romantic?

564
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,210
That kind of act rarely works.

565
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,050
Well,

566
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,260
what kind of character do you like?

567
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,460
I can learn to be that.

568
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,800
No matter what character you adopt now,

569
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,000
it won't change what's going to happen.

570
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,810
I can't get through to you.

571
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,550
I was just about to have lunch.

572
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,700
Why don't you

573
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,610
stay and join me for a simple meal?

574
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,150
No need.

575
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,990
I don't have an appetite.

576
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,070
Please eat something.

577
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,160
I've got it all prepared.

578
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,890
Don't you love hot pot the most?

579
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,460
There's no dipping sauce.

580
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,600
It's not enjoyable.

581
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,520
And without bubble tea,

582
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:42,550
I can't really enjoy hot pot either.

583
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,350
How about now?

584
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,200
Is it enjoyable now?

585
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:00,350
It's been so long since I've had hot pot.

586
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,880
I'm absolutely craving it.

587
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,410
In just 10 days,

588
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,160
it will be our wedding day.

589
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,070
During this time, if there's anything
you want to eat,

590
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:13,750
anything you need,

591
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,070
or anything you want to drink,

592
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,160
just tell Fugui anytime.

593
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Stop right there.

594
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,830
After I finish this hot pot,

595
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:20,030
I'm going straight home.

596
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,880
My Lady!

597
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,030
We're here!

598
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:30,650
[Gentle Breeze]

599
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,160
Why are you two here?

600
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,400
We...

601
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,460
Your Highness.

602
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,440
Your Highness.

603
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,810
My Lady, you don't care about us at all,

604
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,260
moving into His Highness's residence

605
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,660
without even telling us.

606
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,400
When did I ever say I was moving in here?

607
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,680
Master told us everything, My Lady.

608
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,850
He said your wedding matters a lot,

609
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,160
and there are many things
you need to discuss,

610
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,640
so you've moved in here first.

611
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,450
[Gentle Breeze]

612
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,590
My Lady.

613
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,510
You'll be family soon anyway.

614
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,790
What's a few days' difference?

615
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,790
Your Highness.

616
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:48,520
Where is Her Ladyship staying?

617
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,400
Over there.

618
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,880
-Let's go.
-I just don't get it.

619
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,510
Who do you two serve anyway?

620
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,390
My Lady, look.

621
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,110
These hairpins are even more exquisite
than those in the palace.

622
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,080
My Lady, look.

623
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,310
This place looks just like Laiyi House.

624
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,700
I don't want to look.

625
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,880
What's so special about these things?

626
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,540
It's not like our Song family
can't afford them.

627
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,260
My Lady.

628
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:23,790
Don't you love a life of lounging around
and counting money?

629
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,920
If you marry the Seventh Prince

630
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
and become the Crown Princess,

631
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,890
you can live the life you want every day.

632
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,070
That's right, My Lady.

633
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:29,750
Just think about it.

634
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,850
You like the Seventh Prince,

635
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,060
and he likes you too.

636
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:34,280
You two make such a perfect match.

637
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,340
If a relationship is doomed

638
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,720
to end badly,

639
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,130
rather than both getting hurt,

640
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:47,510
maybe it's better not to start it at all.

641
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,880
Our men from Waning River Crescent
asked me to check with you

642
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,400
if there's anything they can do

643
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,920
to help with your wedding.

644
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,790
For example, we could prepare more

645
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,790
celestial cats and dogs and such...

646
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,510
No need.

647
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,090
There's no need to prepare anything.

648
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,790
Actually, I asked Song Yiting about it.

649
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,860
Song Yimeng isn't uninterested in you.

650
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:12,190
Besides, the imperial edict has set
the wedding date,

651
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,510
and she's already here with you.

652
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,969
Is there really any chance
this will change?

653
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,560
Marriage is a serious matter

654
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,810
that requires mutual affection.

655
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,949
I don't want to force her.

656
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,400
As long as she still has reservations,

657
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,550
I cannot marry her.

658
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm afraid your Yimeng

659
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,130
is just like her sister.

660
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,880
Once she's made up her mind,

661
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,139
she's so stubborn that not even
90 oxen could pull her back.

662
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,320
Therefore,

663
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,040
only by completely resolving her fears

664
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,760
can I dispel her concerns.

665
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,860
[Imperial Study]

666
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,710
Crown Prince.

667
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,180
What brings you here today

668
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,330
on purpose?

669
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,500
Your Majesty.

670
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,920
The position of Great Jing's Chancellor
has been vacant for a long time.

671
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,780
I would like to recommend someone

672
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,660
to fill this position.

673
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,640
I wonder

674
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,000
which worthy talent
you wish to recommend, Crown Prince?

675
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,660
The Minister of War, Mr. Song.

676
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,070
Song Yude has always adhered to
the Doctrine of the Mean.

677
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,280
Since entering court,

678
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,440
he has never formed factions
or shown favoritism,

679
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,440
making him the best candidate
for Chancellor indeed.

680
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,460
However,

681
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,680
you've just become Crown Prince

682
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,310
and now want to recommend
your father-in-law.

683
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,040
I'm afraid it'll be hard
to convince the crowd.

684
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,660
Your Majesty is right.

685
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,190
I dare not act out of personal interest.

686
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
However,

687
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,890
if this appointment

688
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,330
would cause discontent among officials,

689
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,530
I humbly request Your Majesty

690
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,870
to issue another imperial edict

691
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,880
to check my power.

692
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,490
How would this check work?

693
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,130
If in the future I

694
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,610
should act improperly,

695
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,630
Mr. Song may,
with the support of officials,

696
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,230
have me removed from office.

697
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,330
Nonsense.

698
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,860
If that were the case,

699
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,790
wouldn't our empire change hands?

700
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,320
Your Majesty.

701
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,790
The empire our ancestors established

702
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,850
should be entrusted to worthy hands.

703
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,540
Only then can it be preserved.

704
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,420
With this imperial edict,

705
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,510
Mr. Song can offer frank advice
in the future

706
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,770
without any concerns.

707
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,630
I

708
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,610
will also be diligent in state affairs

709
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,740
and dare not show the slightest slack.

710
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,680
You're doing this

711
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,010
because of Song Yimeng's influence,
aren't you?

712
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,840
I don't believe

713
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,590
that if someone else

714
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,350
were appointed as Chancellor,

715
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,910
you would act the same way.

716
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,970
Your Majesty is right.

717
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,690
I'm also doing this

718
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,970
for the sake of Song Yimeng.

719
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,580
I don't want

720
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,230
Mr. Song to try to please me

721
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,110
because of his daughter in the future,

722
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:22,030
nor do I want Song Yimeng

723
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,210
to compromise because of her father.

724
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,070
Therefore,

725
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,770
please consider this as a promise

726
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,290
I make to Song Yimeng.

727
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,690
No matter what she does in the future,

728
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,230
it will not affect the Song family.

729
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,510
You're being ridiculous!

730
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,080
You're the noble crown prince,

731
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,810
yet your mind is filled with nothing
but romance.

732
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,360
How dare you say you have
no selfish motives?

733
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,880
For the sake of a woman,

734
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,630
you've actually gone to such lengths,

735
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,630
even coming to request

736
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,320
an official position for her father.

737
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,120
Your Majesty.

738
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,880
Mr. Song

739
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,030
is truly a pillar of the state

740
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,480
and worthy of the position of Chancellor.

741
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,050
I earnestly request Your Majesty

742
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,200
to grant my request.

743
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,630
I've heard you.

744
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,720
Get lost.

745
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

746
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,130
[In Memory of Our Roots]

747
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,380
[In memory of the late Duchess of Anping,
Wang Nianmei]

748
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,170
Father.

749
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,870
I rushed back as soon as I heard the news.

750
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,560
Why are you hiding over here?

751
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,110
Is this

752
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,510
the imperial edict appointing you
as Chancellor?

753
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,930
[With deeds known at home and afar,
loyal and steadfast, pillar of the court]

754
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,930
[Left Vice Minister of the Imperial
Secretariat & Minister of War, Song Yude]

755
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,590
His Highness entered the palace today,

756
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,380
and besides recommending me as Chancellor,

757
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,580
he also persuaded His Majesty
to issue an edict,

758
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,240
granting the Song family

759
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,410
the Imperial Pardon Certificate.

760
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,150
The Imperial Pardon Certificate?

761
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:15,960
Is it

762
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,800
the Death-Exemption Plate?

763
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,880
That's right.

764
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,510
When the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

765
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,170
no matter how
the political situation changes,

766
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,190
and whether your relationship
with him

767
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,510
is good or bad,

768
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,200
everyone in the Song family

769
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,370
can be spared from execution.

770
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,960
This royal favor

771
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,510
has never been granted to any noble family

772
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,570
since the founding of the Great Jing.

773
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,630
Yimeng.

774
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,710
For the sake of what you call

775
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,710
a nonexistent future,

776
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,670
Nan Heng has gone to such lengths.

777
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,760
It clearly shows his feelings for you.

778
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,320
Regarding your marriage,

779
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,630
you've been reluctant to agree.

780
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,550
What exactly are you afraid of?

781
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,710
Perhaps

782
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,280
I'm afraid of

783
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,000
an unknown ending.

784
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,290
Fate is in our own hands.

785
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,400
Why fear something

786
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,130
that hasn't even happened yet?

787
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,970
Indeed.

788
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,410
I'm worried Nan Heng will hurt me,

789
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,490
but I'm also worried I'll let him down.

790
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,210
Because I don't belong in this world.

791
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,830
What if...

792
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,960
What if one day, I have
to leave this place?

793
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,560
What should Nan Heng do then?

794
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,210
I've

795
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,400
never been a brave man,

796
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,230
but falling in love with your mother
from humble origins,

797
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,190
marrying her, and having you

798
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,270
were the bravest things I've ever done.

799
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,670
Father.

800
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,710
I think this is the first time

801
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,660
you've ever talked to me about my mother.

802
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,320
Your mother passed away

803
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,320
just days after giving birth to you.

804
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,830
Not being able to grow old with her

805
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,550
is my greatest regret.

806
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,230
But the time I spent with your mother

807
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:45,670
was also the most beautiful time
of my life.

808
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,920
Yimeng.

809
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,000
Love in this world isn't always

810
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,360
about seeking perfection.

811
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,290
In matters of the heart,

812
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,840
regret hurts more than

813
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,670
not being able
to spend a lifetime together.

814
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,030
I'm sure Nan Heng

815
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,440
feels the same way.
