Yiting.

4
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,640
Please, let me explain.

5
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,280
I-I swear I didn't ask Father
to send those geese.

6
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
I had no idea he was planning
to arrange this marriage.

7
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,190
I'm telling the truth.

8
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:09,910
If I'm lying,

9
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,510
may I be struck by lightning!

10
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,070
If it wasn't Your Highness's instruction,

11
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,630
then it must have been His Majesty's will.

12
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,150
He...

13
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,870
Yiting.

14
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,800
Don't worry.

15
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
As long as it's something
you don't agree to,

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
I'll never force it upon you.

17
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,079
How about this?

18
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,810
Tomorrow...

19
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,150
No.

20
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,360
I'll go see Father right away,

21
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,150
clear things up,

22
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,190
and get him to drop this idea,

23
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:28,960
alright?

24
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,240
Okay.

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Then I'll leave it to Your Highness.

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,960
It's only proper.

27
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,780

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,590
Shangguan He weren't in the picture,

33
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,710
or if Shangguan He didn't treat you well,

34
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,520
would you...

35
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,240
Consider me?

I'm back.

39
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,560
Greetings, Father-in-law.

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,150
Greetings, Your Highness.

41
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,150
Your Highness,

42
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,520
please.

43
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,400
Father-in-law, after you.

44
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,910
How could I dare?

45
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,590
Please, Your Highness, after you.

46
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,310
No, no, no.

47
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:35,890
Please, Father-in-law, after you.

48
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,940
I insist Your Highness goes first.

49
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,960
Enough.

50
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,650
The doorway is so wide.

51

Today's the day of my return visit.

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
Why haven't I seen Yiting and Madam?

57
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,760
The two of them are having a spat.

59
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,770
Go tell that wretched girl:

60
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,519
if she really wants to drive me
to my grave,

61
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,360
she can keep wasting her time
with that vagabond.

62
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,430
Go tell Mother,

63
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,750
if she keeps forcing me to marry
the Eighteenth Prince,

64
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,120
I'll run off with Shangguan He

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,450
and have a child with him
just to spite her.

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
What did you say?

67
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,600

Y-You're really going to be
the death of me!

71
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,920
You've got all the sense of shame
in the world, Mother.

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,850
Why don't you marry
the Eighteenth Prince yourself?

73
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,040
You're really driving me crazy!

Please, no need for formalities.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,360
Come on.

77
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
Cheers.

78
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,240
That's right.

79
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,890
Only eating greens and no meat?

80
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,800
Careful, you might
have trouble conceiving.

81
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,640
I never intended to have children anyway.

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,510
Yiting.

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,830
You've lost quite some weight recently.

Here,

85
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,720
let me get you some shrimp.

86
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,270
Why should she eat shrimp?

87
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,830
She's not going to have children anyway.

88
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,690
Have some soup.

89
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,240
Soup?

90
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,390
I think what she should have is
the Five-Flavored Tea of Forgetfulness,

91
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,360
so that in her next life,

92
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,360
she can have an eye for some truly
good and worthy guys.

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,270
Those "good guys" you speak of

94
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,920
are nothing but vulgar creatures,

95
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,120
not worth looking at.

96
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,159
Right. Right.

97
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,390
Since you look down on everyone,

98
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,560
I figure the King of Hell
must be exceptional,

99
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,360
surely he meets your standards?

100
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
Well, Your Highness,

101
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,720
this braised pork trotter is a specialty
of our Song Residence.

102
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,920
You must give it a try.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,600
Thank you, Mr. So...

104
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,460
The dishes today are quite salty.

105
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,240
Have a quail egg.

106
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,870
Here.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Have some shrimp.

108
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,950
Yes.

109
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,870
The shrimp is delicious too.

110
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,510
Right. Right.

111
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,190
Thank you.

112
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,750
Well,

113
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,800
Mrs. Song,

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,480
Mr. Song.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,800
Today

116
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
is my first time dining with you,

117
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
and from now on, we are all family.

118
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,560
I'd like to toast to you.

119
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Alright. Thanks.

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,750
Your manners.

121
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,750
Didn't His Highness just say

122
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,240
this is a family gathering,

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,270
and there's no need for formalities?

124
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,950
Why talk about manners?

125
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
Don't go too far.

126
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Hey, Song Yude.

127
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,040
Can you stop pretending to be clueless?

128
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,120
Don't you know that

129
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,750
the guy Yiting fell for is

130
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,480
one of Your Highness's subordinates,
I suppose?

131
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,860
Mother.

132
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,830
Today is the homecoming banquet for
Yimeng and His Highness.

133
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,560
Do you have to make everyone
uncomfortable?

134
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,620
Am I making everyone uncomfortable?

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Have you forgotten

136
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,360
how badly they hurt you
in that shabby room

137
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,800
at Zijin Pavilion?

138
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,260
Have you forgotten it all?

139
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,920
Mrs. Song.

140
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,630
Well,

141
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,800
about what happened at Zijin Pavilion,

142
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
I was indeed in the wrong.

143
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,720
I'd like to take this opportunity

144
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,600
to apologize to the Song family

145
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,480
and to Miss Song Yiting.

146
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,680
If anyone in the Song Residence
has any needs in the future,

147
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
please don't hesitate to ask.

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,190
I'll certainly make amends.

149
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,040
You're too kind.

150
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,560
It's nothing.

151
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,000
It's only right.

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,310
How could we possibly deserve
such a grand gesture?

153
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,390
Your Highness, that subordinate of yours,
Shangguan He,

154
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,560
is still shamelessly hanging around our
Song family now.

155
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,310
If he hadn't been leading our Yiting on,

156
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,190
would her marriage prospects

157
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,750
be in such a state now?

158
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,480
Would we have offended His Majesty

159
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,010
and the Eighteenth Prince?

160
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,750
Mother, please stop making
baseless accusations.

161
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:51,070
Not marrying the Eighteenth Prince
was my decision.

162
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,560
It has nothing to do with His Highness

163
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,240
and Shangguan He!

164
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,360
Even so,

165
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,390
Your Highness still owes our Song family

166
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,680
an explanation.

167
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,920
If you truly feel sorry,

168
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,070
you should send your subordinate
Shangguan He

169
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,870
back to Jiangnan immediately,

170
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,000
so none of us ever have to see him again.

171
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,570
Your Highness.

172
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,390
Please have another drink.

173
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,070
You...

174
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,800
Have a sip.

175
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,760
Are you alright?

176
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,270
I'll handle the matter
with Shangguan He myself,

177
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,669
Mother, so stop making things difficult
for others.

178
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,480
I'm finished eating.

179
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,809
Please enjoy your meal.

180
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's go.

181
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,030
Mr. Song,

182
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,200
Mrs. Song.

183
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,030
I still have official matters
to attend to.

184
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,360
Please enjoy your meal.

185
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,200
Oh, okay.

186
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,240
Father, Madam.

187
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,580
Please take your time.

188
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,440
Eat up.

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,080
Besides,

375
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,480
I have neither the desire

376
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,410
nor the ability to be crown prince.

377
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,480
It was perfectly reasonable for Father

378
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,880
to name him crown prince.

379
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
Uncle.

380
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,270
The court has finally found peace.

381
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,870
And regarding Guihong's attempt
to assassinate Heng,

382
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,630
Heng has agreed
not to pursue this matter further.

383
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,360
Let's just

384
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,120
call it even, shall we?

385
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,180
After my brush with death,

386
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,829
I've come to terms with many things.

387
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,720
Guihong.

388
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,270
Today, before your Aunt's memorial,

389
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,720
don't you think you should

390
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
formally apologize to His Majesty?

391
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,440
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

392
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,810
I should have remained at my border post,

393
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,030
yet I abandoned my duty

394
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,850
and rashly attempted
to assassinate His Highness.

395
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,310
My crime is unforgivable.

396
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,440
I beg Your Majesty

397
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:37,680
to consider the Chu family's

398
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,270
years of loyal service guarding
the Great Jing's borders

399
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,680
and grant me another chance.

400
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,030
I will certainly redeem myself

401
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,440
and serve the Great Jing
through fire and water

402
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,640
without hesitation.

403
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,920
Chu Guihong.

404
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,190
You were once Yurong's most beloved child.

405
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,230
When it comes down to it,

406
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,070
the conflict between you and Heng

407
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,720
all stems from old grudges.

408
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,400
Now that Lord Qianyu has returned
to the capital,

409
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,550
I have no wish to keep you two apart.

410
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,080
You may remain in the capital

411
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,270
for the time being.

412
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,480
Thank you, Your Majesty.

413
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,110
However,

414
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,330
if you dare show disrespect to
my Crown Prince again,

415
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,170
you won't be so lucky

416
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,870
next time.

417
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,510
I wasn't wrong, was I?

418
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,720
His Majesty is totally lovestruck,

419
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,510
and Nan Rui

420
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,720
is just brainless.

421
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,270
As long as you show your loyalty,

422
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,310
all past transgressions

423
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,790
can surely be wiped clean.

424
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,530
Others are easy to manage,

425
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,880
but as for Nan Heng,

426
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,690
given how far things have deteriorated
between us,

427
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,170
truly clearing the grudges

428
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,370
and earning his trust

429
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,240
won't be so easy, I'm afraid.

430
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,640
Son,

431
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,790
why should you worry?

432
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm here, aren't I?

433
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,940
At tonight's banquet,

434
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,830
I'll make sure

435
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,010
to help you smooth things over
with Nan Heng.

436
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,720
Uncle.

437
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,110
You've had a hard time out there lately.

438
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,110
Have more meat to nourish yourself.

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,860
Your Highness.

440
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,920
I must apologize to you.

441
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,310
On Your Highness's joyous day,

442
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,640
I caused a disturbance.

443
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,510
Though Your Highness,
magnanimous as ever,

444
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,880
did not hold me accountable,

445
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
I still feel deeply ashamed.

446
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,550
I'll punish myself with this drink.

447
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,510
Thank you for your magnanimity,
Your Highness,

448
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,710
and for not holding the past against me.

449
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,200
You see, I told you before,

450
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,440
Heng is magnanimous

451
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,770
and not someone who holds grudges, right?

452
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,610
Lord Qianyu.

453
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,410
There's something

454
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,440
I've been puzzling over.

455
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,150
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

456
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,100
When Pingrong City fell,

457
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,090
not even a small bird could fly out.

458
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,270
How did you manage to escape?

459
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,460
I remember when the city fell,

460
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,960
I intended to protect our banner
and fight to the last moment.

461
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,220
However, several Deputy Generals
knocked me unconscious,

462
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,530
put on my armor to impersonate me,

463
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
and dressed me in Heyuan Army's armor,

464
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,530
hiding me among their dead.

465
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,440
I

466
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,450
only survived because of this.

467
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,870
After escaping from Pingrong,

468
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:02,830
why did you not come to rendezvous with me

469
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,590
and choose to run for your life instead?

470
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,510
I had deep misunderstanding
about Your Highness before,

471
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,620
even suspecting

472
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,280
you were behind the defeat
of Pingrong battle.

473
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,200
So of course, I was reluctant to seek out
the Xuanjia Army.

474
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,440
Then after the Xuanjia Army
returned to the capital,

475
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,640
why didn't you come back
to report to His Majesty?

476
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,920
Did you not trust

477
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,880
His Majesty either?

478
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,000
During those days,

479
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,000
I wandered through the countryside,

480
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,740
and whenever I thought of
the 20,000 soldiers who died,

481
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,110
I wanted to take my own life to atone.

482
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,590
But I still have my son, Guihong,

483
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,030
who lost his mother at a young age

484
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,510
and has no siblings.

485
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,790
How could I leave him with peace of mind?

486
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,880
For his sake,

487
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:48,000
I forced myself to carry on,

488
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
fleeing to the outskirts of the capital

489
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,100
to find an opportunity
to reunite with Guihong.

490
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,920
As parents,

491
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,440
this is all we care about.

492
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,520
Chu Li.

493
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,510
Here.

494
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,030
I understand you.

495
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

496
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,020
Your Highness.

497
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,310
I know

498
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,030
the Chu family and Your Highness
have been entangled for years,

499
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,640
with deep misunderstandings between us.

500
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,070
I have no intention of

501
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,200
threatening Your Highness upon my return.

502
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,240
I hope Your Highness can
put aside past grievances.

503
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,920
From now on,

504
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,440
I will serve with utmost loyalty

505
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:30,830
and work together with Your Highness

506
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,200
to defend our state.

507
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,260
Lord Qianyu, you jest.

508
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,790
Junior General and I
share the same banner.

509
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,590
We'll certainly put aside past grievances

510
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,790
and safeguard the Great Jing together.

511
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,320
Dear ministers.

512
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,640
This is the dish we've been waiting for.

513
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,140
This dish

514
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,510
is the famed Daze venison,

515
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,720
known far and wide and
not easily obtained.

516
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,180
Please, everyone, enjoy the dish promptly.

517
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,520
Tender, juicy, with a lingering taste.

518
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,500
This Daze venison truly lives up
to its reputation.

519
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,530
[Fanghua Hall]

520
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,350
It's already so late.

521
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,210
Why hasn't Nan Heng come back yet?

522
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,200
Could something have happened?

523
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,590
Don't scream!

524
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,270
Don't be afraid.

525
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,450
It's me.

526
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,110
Song Xiaoyu!

527
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,860
It's me.

528
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,040
You are...

529
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,720
I just called you Song Xiaoyu.

530
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,780
Who else could I be?

531
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,000
What Song Xiaoyu?

532
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,530
Someone who delivers fish?

533
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,070
I'm sorry,

534
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,030
but you've got the wrong person.

535
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,160
I'm not Song Xiaoyu.

536
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,850
Imperial Jade Liquor?

537
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:32,920
1...

538
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,000
180 yuan per glass?

539
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,310
Which school is the best
at excavator technology?

540
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,530
Shandong Lan Xiang Technician College.

541
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,790
Meng, Heng, Rui, Ting, and He.

542
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,920
Yin, Rong, Xu, De, and Yi.

543
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,750
We're truly like fellow villagers
meeting fellow villagers,

544
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,070
both with tears in our eyes.

545
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,680
You... You also time-traveled here
from the modern age?

546
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,240
And you've read the script?

547
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,590
But,

548
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,790
who are you?

549
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:17,700
This...

550
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,170
What's this?

551
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,090
Mr. Screenwriter.

552
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,910
You're Mr. Screenwriter?

553
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,960
I didn't get to talk to you properly
during the script reading that day.

554
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,680
Today,

555
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,400
let me properly introduce myself.

556
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,560
My name is Li Bixiong,

557
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,650
pen name Bixiong.

558
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,010
You can call me Bixiong.

559
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,270
Wait, you actually have the nerve
to come find me?

560
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,450
It's all because of you,

561
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,720
always making that keyboard sound,

562
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,830
that Nan Heng and I faced danger
so many times.

563
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,690
Do you have something against me?

564
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,350
You're one to talk.

565
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,510
You guys keep inexplicably

566
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,590
changing the script back and forth.

567
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,270
I can't even submit my drafts anymore.

568
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,550
The producer and director have been
bombarding me with complaints.

569
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,050
Who can I vent to?

570
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,140
We're both just working stiffs, right?

571
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:10,770
Let's be understanding
of each other, alright?

572
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,310
I understand, I understand.

573
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,640
But,

574
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,960
how did you

575
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,720
time-travel here?

576
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,790
Did you also get transported here

577
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,050
on a stormy, rainy day?

578
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:27,400
Also,

579
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,040
how did you know I would be

580
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,570
at Fanghua Hall right now?

581
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,310
That's a long story.

582
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,070
Rather than making a long story short,
it's better not to say anything at all.

583
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,020
I've come today

584
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,370
to ask for a favor.

585
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,070
What is it?

586
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,030
My current identity is Lord Qianyu, right?

587
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,440
But after just a few days together,

588
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,680
Chu Guihong has already
begun to suspect me.

589
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,640
I need to dispel his doubts
as soon as possible.

590
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,270
If he were to find out my identity,

591
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,880
this world would collapse!

592
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,410
Collapse?

593
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,940
So how do you want me to help you?

594
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,100
Let me stay at your residence

595
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,730
and stay away from Chu Guihong.

596
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,390
Less action, fewer mistakes.

597
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,390
Stay at my place?

598
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,150
I'm afraid

599
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,790
that's not appropriate.

600
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:17,790
I'm a married woman now,

601
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,550
and besides, that's
the Crown Prince's Residence.

602
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,550
If you go live there,

603
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,400
it could cause even bigger problems.

604
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,750
I almost forgot

605
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,610
you've already married Nan Heng.

606
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,080
My Lord.

607
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,420
You said you needed to use the privy,

608
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,790
but how did you end up
in the imperial harem?

609
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,720
Eunuch Liu.

610
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,480
Lord Qianyu has had too much to drink,

611
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,660
so I helped steady him.

612
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,940
Yeah, I'm drunk.

613
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,830
My Lord, come back with me quickly.

614
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,700
His Majesty is still waiting
to have a good drink and talk with you.

615
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,830
Coming.

616
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,710
Consider my proposal.

617
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,830
I'll come find you at
the Crown Prince's Residence later.

618
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:48,480
Go already.

619
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,510
I'm drunk.

620
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,130
Actually, I'm not drunk at all.

621
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,830
Be careful.

622
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,530
I'm fine.

623
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,040
I can keep... Keep...

624
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,140
Keep drinking.

[Qianyu Mansion]

626
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,110
The imperial palace is truly
something else.

627
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,690
This wine is excellent,

628
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,970
and the meat is deli...

629
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
You rascal.

630
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,510
Tell me,

631
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,880
who are you really?

632
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,800
Chu Guihong.

633
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,830
How dare you show such disrespect!

634
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,960
What have I taught you all these years?

635
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,520
The Heyuan people love venison,

636
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,070
and they often slaughter deer
in their camps

637
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,150
in brutal ways.

638
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,480
Father despised this practice,

639
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,070
so he ordered all Qianyu soldiers

640
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,400
not to eat venison,

641
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,340
with military punishment for
any who disobeyed.

642
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,790
Yet today at the banquet, you

643
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,350
ate venison without any hesitation,

644
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,640
completely disregarding
the Qianyu Army's rules.

645
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,070
You cannot be my father.

646
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,610
Tell me,

647
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,290
who exactly are you?

648
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,550
Come on,

649
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,410
attack me here!

650
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,440
What did I tell you when I taught you

651
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,770
how to handle the blade?

652
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,690
Listen up, you little brat.

653
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,120
This blade is for killing enemies.

654
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,020
It must never be pointed at family

655
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:19,960
or friends.

656
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,460
Do you understand?

657
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,440
What's wrong with eating venison?

658
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,680
If I had been so rigid

659
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,640
and picky about everything,

660
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,160
would I even be alive to see you now?

661
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,420
I think you're just asking for a beating,

662
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,680
daring to pull a weapon on me.

663
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,310
Go!

664
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,240

665
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,310
and receive 30 strokes of punishment.

666
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,970
Come see me when
you've thought things through.

667
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,310
Father, I...

668
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,060
Why is each one smarter than the last?

669
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,820
This is getting complicated.

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,760
She didn't make them for me?

675
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,560
Did you get what I said or not?

676
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,260
You said

677
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,270
the screenwriter is the person
who writes the storybook,

678
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,510
and he's the one inside
Lord Qianyu's body.

679
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,770
So you did get it.

680
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,300
Then why aren't you showing any reaction?

681
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,000
He knows the entire plot.

682
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,460
He's basically cheating.

683
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,640
If you ask me,

684
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,960
you should quickly prepare
some valuable gifts

685
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,440
and pay a visit to the Qianyu Mansion.

686
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,350
You should know,

00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,790
do you know why he came here?

691
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,320
Have you noticed anything unusual lately?

692
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,680
And have you heard

693
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,920

No.

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,830
Well, if nothing's unusual,

697
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,240
and the rules of this world

698
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,750
have already been broken by us,

699
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,550
then there's no need to fear him.

700
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,150
Even if he created everything
from outside,

the plot has already changed.

744
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,240
You and Lord Qianyu

745
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,000
are quite different, however.

746
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,830
Lord Qianyu didn't eat venison,

747
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,630
and his behavior was dignified,

748
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,160
unlike you, who are so frivolous and rude.

749
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,160
He knows everything?

750
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:32,150
You...

751
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,050
We're husband and wife.

752
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,350
What secrets could there be between us?

753
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,840
But none of that matters now.

754
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,920
Let's just get straight to the point.

755
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,210
Mr. Screenwriter,

756
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,740
how exactly did you time-travel here?

757
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,200
It was all thanks to you two.

758
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,160
I've been pulling my hair out every day

759
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,550
just to squeeze out a tiny bit
of final draft,

760
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,440
yet you two have been

761
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,910
changing it all inexplicably the next day.

762
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,030
At first, I didn't know

763
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,290
and didn't believe it,

764
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,510
so I kept writing,

765
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,590
and you kept changing it.

766
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,400
I write,

767
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,000
you change.

768
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,400
Write,

769
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,000
change.

770
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Now the drama's about to start shooting.

771
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,760
How am I supposed to explain this
to the client?

772
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,590
Am I supposed to tell them that

773
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,710
the male and female leads
aren't cooperating

774
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,370
and keep changing the script?

775
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,510
Or should I tell them

776
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,370
the female lead has time-traveled
into the script?

777
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,320
In the end, I ran out of options,

778
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,480
so I wrote a story

779
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,880
about the screenwriter
traveling into the script,

780
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,670
just to see what would happen.

781
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,070
Unexpectedly, I dozed off that night,

782
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,730
and when I woke up the next day,

783
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,199
I was actually here. Can you believe it?

784
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,110
So you wrote yourself into this world.

785
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,360
But I have to admit that
your time-traveling method

786
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,489
is a bit more sophisticated than mine.

787
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,300
So you came here

788
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,139
to restore the original plot?

789
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,760
I...

790
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,440
I believe Your Highness

791
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,070
wouldn't let that kind of thing
happen, right?

792
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,230
Well...

793
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,310
By the way, Xiaoyu,

794
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,370
enough about me.

795
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,370
Have you gotten used to being here?

796
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,070
I'm doing fine here.

797
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,920
There are carriages and houses here,

798
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,050
and there's no smog.

799
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,760
And I even managed

800
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
to snag a boyfriend while I was at it.

801
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,150
Really?

802
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,590
Is this more delicious than
the Starbucks afternoon tea?

803
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,400
Well,

804
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,840
each has its own merits.

805
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,920
Can that thing provide warmth
like modern underfloor heating?

806
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,320
I won't freeze to death here anyway.

807
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,110
It's fine.

808
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,940
There's no water heater for bathing here,

809
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,670
no automatic toilets in the bathroom,

810
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,710
and you can't even scroll through
your phone before bed.

811
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,920
What kind of life is this?

812
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,920
It's like living as an ascetic monk.

813
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,000
"Dream of Qingning" will start shooting
at the end of the month.

814
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,990
It's definitely a top-tier production.

815
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,080
I'm telling you,

816
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,590
if you were in the modern world,

817
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,450
you'd definitely be the next
hit-leading actress.

818
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,800
Lord Qianyu, are you implying something?

819
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,590
No, I'm not.

820
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,280
How to live

821
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,230
and where to settle down

822
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,400
are Song Yimeng's own choices.

823
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,620
If you have ulterior motives,

824
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,410
I'll be the first to object.

825
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,000
Which eye of yours saw

826
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,100
that I have ulterior motives?

827
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,730
Then let me ask you,

828
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,600
what brought you here today?

829
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,880
To visit a hometown folk.

830
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,800
Visit a hometown folk,

831
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,880
yet criticize their way of life like that?

832
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,800
Can't I, as a modern person,
make a few complaints?

833
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,550
I think you're just being sarcastic

834
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,150
with malicious intentions!

835
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,150
You're just over-interpreting

836
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,040
[Achieve Great Ambitions]

837
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,360
and reading into nothing!

838
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,920
You...

839
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:42,880
Alright, alright.

840
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,920
Stop arguing.

841
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,700
Nan Heng.

842
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,190
I understand

843
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,510
all your concerns.

844
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,940
Mr. Screenwriter,

845
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,400
I've figured out
what you're getting at too.

846
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,000
Come on.

847
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,170
Come out with me for a bit.

848
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,520
[Achieve Great Ambitions]

849
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,960
Let me have a sip of that herbal tea.

850
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,290
Last night, His Lordship
made me bow to him

851
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,630
for four hours,

852
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,710
and insisted I address him
with genuine feeling in every word.

853
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,760
This morning when I woke up,

854
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,190
my throat was on fire.

855
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,760
That's nothing compared to my situation.

856
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,400
Yesterday, His Lordship made me
hold a horse stance

857
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,860
for the entire afternoon,

858
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,920
saying something about experiencing
the strength of the Qianyu Army.

859
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,030
This morning when I got up,

860
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,160
my legs were shaking uncontrollably.

861
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,470
What are you doing?

862
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,730
What are you all doing?

863
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,900
Don't you have anything better to do?

864
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,960
Now that we're not at war,

865
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
you've even forgotten
how to train yourselves, huh?

866
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,360
Go run ten laps
around the training ground!

867
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,280
Let's go.

868
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:48,920
General.

869
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,700
I've failed in my duty.

870
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,920
Our men like to make

871
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,150
silly jokes during their free time.

872
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,210
Please don't take it to heart.

873
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,290
Do you know which of them

874
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,670
witnessed my father's death in battle

875
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,870
from the Pingrong City Tower back then?

876
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,160
Why would you ask
such a question, General?

877
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,220
There are some matters

878
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,060
I've always had doubts about.

879
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,230
Rong Hua,

880
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,680
I want you
to investigate something for me.

881
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,440
Let me ask you,

882
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,710
did you come to
the Crown Prince's Residence

883
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,320
to take me back with you?

884
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,360
That's right.

885
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,150
I wanted to talk to you alone,

886
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,960
but I didn't expect Nan Heng to be here,

887
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
so I couldn't speak plainly.

888
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,190
What do you mean?

889
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,940
Are you saying

890
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,710
you know how to get back?

891
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,480
Of course.

892
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,440
Who am I?

893
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,550
I'm the screenwriter.

894
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,230
I set all the rules here.

895
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,300
Let me tell you,

896
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,320
the script world has four...

897
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,880
Three rules.

898
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,630
Besides the hero always saving the heroine
when she's in danger,

899
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:04,320
and the iconic scenes must happen,

900
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,550
there's one more rule:

901
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,680
once we complete all the iconic scenes
until the finale,

902
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,930
we can get back.

903
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,070
I see.

904
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,400
You want me to help you complete

905
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,590
the city tower choice scene,

906
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,360
and also go through

907
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,760
the scenes where I become a human pig,

908
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,440
right?

909
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,680
Smart.

910
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,030
But if you're afraid of pain,

911
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,690
I can have Zhao prepare
some anesthetic for you.

912
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,420
The doctor who saved Nan Heng's life.

913
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,280
But if we follow the original plot,

914
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,590
the entire Song family will be executed.

915
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:38,520
Do you know that?

916
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,640
What Song family or Li family?

917
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,630
They're all just fictional characters.

918
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,440
You...

919
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,590
What?

920
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,590
Nothing.

921
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,550
So what if

922
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,000
we don't follow the original plot?

923
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What will happen?

924
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:04,760
Then we'll be trapped here forever.

925
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,510
I won't become a top-tier screenwriter,

926
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,960
and your dream of becoming an actress

927
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,020
will shatter like broken glass, too.

928
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,630
Alright, that's fine.

929
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,880
As long as this world doesn't collapse.

930
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,210
What do you mean "fine"?

931
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,230
Do you really want to stay here

932
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,360
and be the God of Death's beloved wife?

933
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,460
Listen carefully,

934
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,400
Nan Heng is not some God of Death,

935
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,510
and I'm not that

936
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,920
love-obsessed Song Yimeng
from your writing.

937
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,440
I'm very happy with this world,

938
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,630
and I won't go back with you.

939
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,710
You've gone crazy!

940
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,000
He's put a spell on you.

941
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,530
Don't forget he's going to kill you
in the end.

942
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,680
I know.

943
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,450
At first,

944
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,030
he did want to kill me,

945
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,150
but everything is different now.

946
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,710
The keyboard sounds have disappeared,

947
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,070
and he's already broken free from
his original character design.

948
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,960
How could he hurt me

949
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,290
or harm the Song family?

950
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,320
This is just a fictional world.

951
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,360
The sky is fake,

952
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,070
the ground is fake,

953
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,510
everything here is completely fake,

954
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,880
as well as our bodies.

955
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Wake up, will you?

956
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,000
Fine.

957
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,590
What are you doing?

958
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,840
Does it hurt, Mr. Screenwriter?

959
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,510
Of course it does!

960
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,710
Good, it should hurt.

961
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:18,590
Let me tell you,

962
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,920
from the moment you entered this world,

963
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,440
this entire world became real.

964
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,150
The sky is real,

965
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,840
the ground is real,

966
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
everything is real,

967
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,710
as well as our bodies.

968
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,440
Understand?

969
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:28,630
Why are you copying what I said?

970
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,400
Be quiet.

971
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,090
I haven't finished yet.

972
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,960
You're right.

973
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,440
Outside the script,

974
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,960
you are indeed the creator
who makes the rules

975
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,590
and commands the world.

976
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,280
But in this world,

977
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,840
you're just a rookie.

978
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,230
Instead of trying to convince me,

979
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:45,710
why not let me, your senior,

980
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,840
show you what this real world is like,

981
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,900
Mr. Screenwriter?

982
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,020
The real world?

983
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:02,230
[Achieve Great Ambitions]

984
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:01,530
Your Highness,

985
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,800
something terrible has happened!

986
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,710
Her Highness and Lord Qianyu

987
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,550
were whispering to each other
for quite a while,

988
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,840
and she even said she wants to take him
to Waning River Crescent for a visit.

989
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,300
To Waning River Crescent?

990
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,710
The Crown Princess said that?

991
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,440
Yes.

992
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,190
And she asked me to tell Your Highness

993
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,440
not to worry at all.

994
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,840
How can you not worry?

995
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:18,320
Back then, the engagement between
Her Highness and Chu Guihong

996
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,150
was arranged by Lord Qianyu himself.

997
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,110
What if he's now trying
to steal Her Highness away

998
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,960
to rekindle her relationship
with Chu Guihong?

999
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,220
What should we do then?

1000
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,860
Your Highness?

1001
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,960
Are you alright, Your Highness?

1002
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,710
Are you okay?

1003
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,810
Please sit.

1004
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,010
Your Highness,

1005
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,960
ever since you got married,

1006
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,230
your health has weakened.

1007
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,960
You should moderate yourself.

1008
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,760
Your Highness, why are you
coughing up blood?

1009
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,710
I'll go fetch the imperial physician!

1010
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,440
Wait!

1011
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,600
Keep this quiet.

1012
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,130
Don't blab about it.

1013
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,150
Yes, Your Highness.
