[Episode 37]

3
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait for me outside.

4
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,260
Yes, Your Highness.

5
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,880
Xiaoyu, you're here.

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,710
Come, come, come,

7
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,720
have a seat.

8
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,960
His Majesty was poisoned,

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,220
and Nan Rui was framed—

10
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,710
these were all your doing, weren't they?

11
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,770
You actually harmed innocent people

12
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,440
just to make the iconic scenes
happen sooner.

13
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,540
If a man wants to fill his belly,

14
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,470
he must plant crops in the fields.

15
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,600
As spring turns to autumn,

16
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,079
seeds grow into fruit

17
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,520
and are eventually harvested.

18
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,050
This is the way of the world.

19
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,120
Just like this sweet potato—

20
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,530
do you feel cruel

21
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,960
when you eat it?

22
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880
So, in your eyes, human lives

23
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,110
are no more than sweet potatoes?

24
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,690
You really are absurd.

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,590
They're just a bunch of

26
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,910
fictional characters I created myself.

27
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,630
How much more precious

28
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,079
can their lives be
than this sweet potato...

29
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,800
Even if they're just fictional characters,

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,650
you created them yourself.

31
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,190
Didn't you invest your emotions

32
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,560
and effort?

33
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,030
On a screen,

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,590
they're nothing more than

35
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,320
lines of code—easily edited
and deleted at will.

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,660
Today I kill one emperor,

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,520
and tomorrow I can write 100,

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,310
1,000,

39
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,240
or 10,000.

40
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,210
Song Xiaoyu,

41
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,190
you're the one who's
never been clear-headed.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,840
How are the people in this world

43
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,680
any different from the Barbie dolls

44
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,430
you grew tired of as a child?

45
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,710
They're all fake.

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,120
I really misjudged you.

47
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,530
In the real world,

48
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,240
you're a crap screenwriter who doesn't

49
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,750
cherish the characters you create.

50
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,820
And here,

51
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,910
you're just a lunatic who kills
innocent people!

52
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,750
So what?

53
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,680
I have the power to kill

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
and the power to save.

55
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,890
Do you want to know

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,000
how Nan Heng got sick?

57
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,360
Wasn't it...

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,280
you who poisoned him?

59
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,520
Me? Poison him?

60
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,360
I wouldn't bother

61
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,690
with such dirty tricks.

62
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,600
Do you really think

63
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,030
those three rules I told you

64
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,310
are the only ones in this scripted world?

65
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,960
Let me tell you,

66
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,010
in this scripted world,

67
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,010
there are four...

68
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,720
there are three rules.

69
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,399
There are other rules?

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,360
They're related to Nan Heng's illness?

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Didn't he tell you the truth?

72
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,630
Fine.

73
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,270
Then I'll tell you.

74
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,410
The fourth rule is

75
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,360
that those who change the iconic scenes

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,760
will suffer backlash.

77
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,070
Nan Heng...

78
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,680
What will happen to him?

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,390
If the plot continues to deviate
from its original course,

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,360
he'll only grow weaker and weaker

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,750
until he dies.

82
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,750
Song Xiaoyu,

83
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,510
don't you love him

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,280
and this scripted world?

85
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,420
So, tell me,

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,800
are you going to go against
the plots I wrote

87
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,070
and watch Nan Heng die,

88
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,310
or help me complete all the iconic scenes

89
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,000
and return to the real world together?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,530
That way, he can still live.

91
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,170
Offer incense?

92
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,800
Today's the first day of the month,

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,830
an auspicious day.

94
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,040
To pray for a happy marriage
for Miss Yiting,

95
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,360
Madam got up early and took her

96
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,560
to the Temple of the God of Matchmaking.

97
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,490
The Temple of the God of Matchmaking?

[Outskirts; Temple of
the God of Matchmaking]

100
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,159
Hurry up.

101
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,830
See?

102
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,490
There are so many people here.

103
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,560
So great.

104
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,850
Come on, come on.

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,830
Mom, I told you,

106
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,820
if you want to pray, do it yourself.

107
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,480
I don't believe in this stuff.

108
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,600
A happy marriage depends on

109
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
how you get along and work things out.

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,950
I can't even clearly say

111
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,390
what my future with him will be like,

112
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,390
so why put all our hope

113
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,780
in something so intangible?

114
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,620
Watch your words.

115
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,690
The God of Matchmaking is watching above.

116
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,810
Show some respect.

117
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:01,950
Seriously.

118
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,300
God of Matchmaking,

119
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,490
this devotee has only this daughter.

120
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,180
I vow three years of my life

121
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,720
in exchange for my daughter's
lifelong peace

122
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,000
and a happy marriage.

123
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,120
God of Matchmaking, please bless her.

124
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,250
God of Matchmaking, please bless her.

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,880
Hurry.

126
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,750
What are you doing?

127
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,560
Why are you standing there like a statue?

128
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,130
Hurry up and make a wish.

129
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,510
Quick, quick, quick.

130
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,420
Please bless my daughter,
God of Matchmaking.

131
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,530
God of Matchmaking, please bless
my daughter's marriage.

132

God of Matchmaking, please bless
my daughter

with a happy marriage.

134
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,050
Mom.

135
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,800
Please bless her.

136
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,360
Just a few days ago,

137
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,720
you were criticizing Shangguan He
like crazy.

138
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,540
You said his eyes were too flirtatious,

139
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,240
destined to take concubines in the future.

140
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
You also said

141
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,720
that his philtrum was a bit too short,

142
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,920
which meant he'd bring
misfortune to his wife.

143
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
You even said that I chose my own husband,

144
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,070
and that if I ever regretted it,

145
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,430
you'd let me cry myself to death
without caring.

146
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,240
What?

147
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,100
Why are you praying so hard today?

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,430
What nonsense are you talking about?

149
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,630
Come here, come here.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,460
Show some respect to
the God of Matchmaking.

151
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,390
God of Matchmaking,

152
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,120
please don't take offense.

153
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,810
Please don't mishear.

154
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
What I meant was

155
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,360
that my husband at home
has flirtatious eyes

156
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
and a short philtrum.

157
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,000
I really wasn't talking about
my daughter's husband.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Please don't get it wrong.

159
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Please, God of Matchmaking,

160
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,800
please.

161
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,400
I'll kowtow to you three times.

162
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
God of Matchmaking, please bless
my daughter.

163
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,460
Please bless my daughter
with a happy marriage.

164
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,560
Please bless and protect my Yiting
for her entire life.

165
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,690
Madam!

166
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,310
Please.

167
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,040
I've bought the Lovers' Knots.

168
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,360
Great.

169
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Hurry up,

170
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,650
tie them up in the branches.

171
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,510
Hang it higher.

172
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,540
The higher, the luckier.

173
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,120
Why are you so clumsy?

174
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,720
Come on, come on.

175
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,510
Give it to me.

176
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,510
I'll do it myself.

177
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,950
Seriously.

178
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,720
Hang it here.

179
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,659
Here.

180
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,630
This doesn't mean that I believe in
this sort of thing.

181
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,980
But since I'm getting married,

182
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,050
everything must be done properly,

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,750
and I have to experience everything.

184
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,600
Good girl.

185
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,120
And these,

186
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,720
tell me,

187
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,180
where should we hang them?

188
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,430
Fortunately, there aren't too many people
praying today.

189
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,560
Everything worked out just as I hoped.

190
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,549
In the future,

191
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,130
I hope that God blesses you

192
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,530
and lets you live happily.

193
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,600
Mr. Feng, wake up.

194
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,460
Time to go home.

195
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,550
Mr. Feng?

196
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,230
Mr. Feng?

197
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,500
Mr. Feng!

198
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,440
Mom,

199
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,640
something's wrong!

200
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,240
What's wrong?

201
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
What do you want?

202
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,440
I know it's very hard for you

203
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,210
to make this decision.

204
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,810
But if you continue to resist stubbornly,

205
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,830
I can only take action against
the Song family.

206
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,310
For example, your sister.

207
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,820
What do you want?

208
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,910
Your Grace!

209
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,790
Is this from Rong Hua?

210
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,440
Yes.

211
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,600
What did you do to Yiting?

212
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,750
Why don't you open it and see?

213
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,540
Now, it's just one of her fingers,

214
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,040
but whether Song Yiting lives or dies

215
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
in the future

216
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,670
is up to you.

217
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,470
If you dare to lay a finger on them again,

218
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,240
I'll kill you first.

219
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,230
The north wind is strong today.

220
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,020
The "Choice Between Two" scene
on the city tower

221
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,620
must be quite the spectacle.

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,630
Mother,

223
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,910
you've been taking care of
His Majesty all morning.

224
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,200
Let me handle things here.

225
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,320
Go back and rest.

226
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,520
The royal physician said

227
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,470
that your father

228
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,150
likely won't make it through this time.

229
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,720
I just want to

230
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,150
look at him properly once more.

231
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,510
That way,

232
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,080
if something really happens...

233
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,080
when I think of him

234
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,600
in the future,

235
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,620
it won't only be those years

236
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,190
when we glared at each other
with cold resentment

237
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,120
and endless disputes.

238
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,680
Your Majesty.

239
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Your Majesty!

240
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,030
I'll go find Physician Qin.

241
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,790
Okay.

242
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,440
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

243
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,790
I've already sent people to find
the antidote.

244
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,000
You will be fine.

245
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,770
I suspect

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,910
that all of this was orchestrated
by Chu Guihong.

247
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,120
I will keep my guard up

248
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,400
and find out the truth.

249
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,630
I also beg Your Majesty

250
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,890
to send the Xuanjia Army back
to the capital to deal with it.

251
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,850
Heng.

252
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,330
Get up first.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

254
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,450
Rui

255
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,240
has always sat by my side.

256
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,410
Come on.

257
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,550
Sit by my side.

258
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes.

259
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,280
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

260
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,240
I've arranged everything

261
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,550
to protect Rui.

262
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,320
I also promise you

263
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,030
that I'll protect him with all I have.

264
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,130
I won't let anything happen to him.

265
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,750
Heng.

266
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,110
Yes, Your Majesty?

267
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,950
Rui never addresses me

268
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,500
as "Your Majesty."

269
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,630
Don't let me hear you

270
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,230
call me "Father" ever again!

271
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,840
It was my fault.

272
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,870
Can you...

273
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,320
Can you...

274
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,850
Father.

What are you doing here?

Fa...

280

[Huanning Hall]

282
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,750
Your Majesty,

283
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,270
today is your birthday.

284
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,200
This snow tiger

285
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,750
must be a birthday gift from
the Seventh Prince.

286
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,670
Worthless and ignorant,

287
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:16,960
only knowing how to mess around.

288
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,910
Go back now.

289
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,750
Yes.

290
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,270
Forget it.

291
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,750
Since it's a gift from him,

292
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,750
take it inside.

293
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,570
Your Highness,

294
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,710
are you alright?

295
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,120
Didn't I tell you to protect Nan Rui?

296
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,310
Why are you here?

297
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,950
It's the Crown Princess.

298
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,600
She went to Lord Qianyu's manor.

299
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,840
I don't know what she said to Lord Qianyu,

300
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,390
and she didn't let the Xuanjia Army
follow her.

301
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,720
After that, she left

302
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,870
the manor alone with Lord Qianyu

303
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,260
and had the Xuanjia Army bring this back.

304
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,720
Nan Heng,

305
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,140
you lied to me again.

306
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,440
In the next life,

307
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,860
I will punish you

308
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,960
to kneel on many,

309
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,880
many, many washboards.

310
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,240
Go and gather 200 Xuanjia Army soldiers

311
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,120
to follow me to the city tower.

312
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,250
Yes, Your Highness.

313
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,000
Well,

314
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,410
don't blame me.

315
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,120
If I weren't in such a hurry to get back,

316
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,180
I wouldn't have treated you this way.

317
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,360
Remember what you promised me.

318
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,320
If Yiting and the Song family are
in the slightest danger,

319
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,960
even if I go back,

320
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,250
I won't let you off.

329
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,540
Let her go now!

330
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,270
We can't let her go
until this iconic scene is completed.

331
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,200
Yimeng,

332
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:17,079
Mother is still in their hands.

333
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,240
This has nothing to do with Madam.

334
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,089
Release her right here and right now,

335
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,089
otherwise

336
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:26,119
I won't cooperate with you.

337
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,839
Relax.

338
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,590
She's perfectly fine in the carriage.

339
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,680
She's just still unconscious

340
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,880
due to some medicine.

341
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,000
You know exactly what I want.

342
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
What's in it for me to kill people
at random?

343
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,780
Please cooperate with me

344
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,600
and play out these messy scenes.

345
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,380
I guarantee

346
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:49,310
I'll safely send them back
in a grand eight-carrier sedan.

whatever he promises,

349
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,250
don't believe a word of it.

350
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,480
Rather than be held hostage
by someone else,

351
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,270
I'd rather take control of my own fate

352
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,050

I'm sorry.

Don't worry.

357
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,190
I will save you.

everything

360
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,160

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,810
Tell me.

Don't worry, Yiting!

This matter concerns the safety
of Song Yiting and Song Yimeng.

376
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,200
Shangguan He will come.

377

378
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,510
does it have to be him?

379
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,400
Can't I do it?

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,200
You have another job.

381
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,070
Chief!

382
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,970
What's wrong?

383
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,110
By the time I arrived,

384
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,790
Song Yiting had already been taken
by the Qianyu Army.

385
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,750
We were even ambushed along the way.

386
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,240
Yunlong and Shanhu stayed behind
to cover my retreat

387
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,770
so that I could make it back.

388
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,750
Chief,

389
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,830
they've mobilized a large number
of the Qianyu Army.

390
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,690
Your Highness,

391
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,000
there are only 300 Xuanjia Army soldiers
in the capital in total,

392
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,530
and some were sent to the palace.

393
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,930
We may not stand a chance.

394
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,350
The border troops are on their way back,

395
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:40,720
but they'll need at least three days.

396
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,350
Until then,

397
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,280
we must hold out.

398
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,800
Let's do this.

399
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,310
Send someone to Waning River Crescent

400
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,750
to ask the Nightwalker to help
Yunlong and Shanhu.

401
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,590
Tell them to make sure they stall
the Qianyu Army

402
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,940
for at least one hour.

403
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,100
Yes, Your Highness.

404
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,510
You are already like this.

405
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,720
Why don't you go back first?

406
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,640
Leave the "Choice Between Two" to me.

407
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,480
Choose? Like hell.

408
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,030
You save your woman,

409
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,090
and I'll save mine.

410
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,270
Besides,

411
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,820
Chu Li's real target is me.

412
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,070
I have to go.

413
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,440
Fine.

414
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,880
Then tell me

415
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,920
how I can help.

416
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:28,070
[Yanxing Gate]

417
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,710
It's really snowing.

418
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,070
I told you.

419
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,440
Fate can't be changed.

420
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,550
Any resistance

421
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,080
is just asking for trouble.

422
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,840
In the end,

423
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,030
you'll all come back here

424
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,830
and meet the same fate.

425
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,800
Even if it's the same city tower
and heavy snow,

426
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,560
and even if I'll

427
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,470
go along with the storyline with you,

428
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,280
it doesn't mean that everyone else

429
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,240
will live the way you want them to.

430
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,500
Because everyone here

431
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,600
is no longer that group of...

432
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,240
fictional characters to be manipulated
at will.

433
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,640
General,

434
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:33,960
they're here.

435
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,680
Bring Song Yiting here.

436
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,350
Yes.

437
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,640
Bring her here!

441
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,440
I'm here.

442
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:55,570
Release her!

444

Nan Heng,

445
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,480
listen up.

446
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,440
The antidote for the Emperor
is in my hands.

447
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,750
The evidence proving that Nan Rui
poisoned him is also with me!

448
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,830
If you don't want to become
an eternal sinner

who has killed your father and brother,

450
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,080
shoot the arrows immediately!

451
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,920
You know the ending I want.

452
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,470
Today, at the city tower,

453
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
until this "Choice Between Two" scene
is complete,

454
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,040
everything

455
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,880
will never end.

Nan Heng!

457
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,490
In this world,

458
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,640
I've never done anything

459
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,960
to benefit everyone.

460
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,270
But today...

What have you done?

491
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,830
He was Lord Qianyu.

You actually killed him?

493
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,070
My loyalty lies not with Lord Qianyu

494
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,310
but solely with the Junior General.

495
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,440

heed my command!

Of course, I'm here to help His Majesty
defend the throne.

this will make for

565
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,130
how are you?

566
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,810
I wanted to be the hero and save you...

567
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,160
but I didn't expect to let you

568
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,620
see me at my most pathetic.

569
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,020
I made a mistake.

570
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,070
At a time like this,

571
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,780
you still have the mood to joke?

572
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,440
Let's go.

573
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,270
Let's go home.

574
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,350
Let's go!

575
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,290
Song Yiting, listen carefully.

576
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,570
In the future, whoever you choose,

577
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,020
he can't be worse than me.

578
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,960
Fugui!

579
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,920
Yiting!

580
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,990
Song Yiting,

581
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,660
there are things

582
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,630
that should be done by men.

583
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,580
Like being the first to ask

584
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,630
and the first to fall in love.

585
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,990
The more you do,

586
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,400
the less there is left

587
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,200
for me to do.

588
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,720
But luckily,

589
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,030
there's still one last thing I can do,

590
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,980
and that's to use my life

591
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,850
to protect you well.

592
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,100
Shangguan He.

593
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,580
Shangguan He!

594
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,310
Shangguan He!

595
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,750
Shangguan He!

596
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,440
Yiting.

597
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,550
Shangguan He!

598
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,160
Fugui!

599
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,850
Take her away!

600
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,240
Yes.

601
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,000
Let go of me!

602
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,620
Nan Heng!

603
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:58,010
Nan Heng!

604
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,260
Nan Heng!

605
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,200
See?

606
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,480
When the female lead is in danger...

607
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,040
the male lead comes to save her.

608
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,240
Nan Heng.

609
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,910
Nan Heng.

610
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,590
Nan Heng.

611
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,830
You're right.

612
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,800
You're the male lead.

613
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,340
So you'll be fine,

614
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,160
right?

615
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,520
Nan Heng.

616
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,720
You can't die.

617
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,800
Do you hear me?

618
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,790
Do you hear me?

619
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,440
You can't die!

620
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,870
Do you hear me?

621
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,510
Answer me!

622
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,770
Do you hear me?

623
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,590
I hear you.

624
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:44,970
I hear you.

625
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
Don't worry.

626
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,960
I'm your male lead.

627
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,660
I won't die.

628
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,370
Nan Heng.

629
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,450
Nan Heng.

630
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,390
Hang in there, okay?

631
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,400
Listen to me,

632
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,830
hang in there, okay?

633
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,290
You can't die, Nan Heng.

634
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,750
You're the only one I have in this world.

635
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,040
Do you know that?

636
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,590
I have no one else.

637
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,580
You really are... all I have left.

638
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,400
Please don't die.

639
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,000
I beg you.

640
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,610

Only...

only by dying...

648
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,050
can I prove

649
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:28,900
that I'm not a fictional character

650
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,160
