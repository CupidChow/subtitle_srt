00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,030
[Episode 27]

3
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,030
Why are you staring at me?

4
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,800
What are you scheming now?

5
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,530
I've been thinking.

6
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,340
Song Yimeng,

7
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,710
I like you.

8
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:30,970
What did you say?

9
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,190
I said I like you.

10
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,560
So,

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
I want your forgiveness,

12
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,190
and then marry you.

13
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,840
You...

14
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,260
You...

15
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,090
You must be out of your mind!

16
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,680
In your dreams.

17
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,510
Why don't you fly to the moon
while you're at it?

18
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Just let me finish what I have to say.

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,990
At first,

20
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,680
I was indeed wary of you.

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,120
I even...

22
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,760
I even thought about killing you.

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,620
But after spending time with you,

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,520
everything has changed.

25
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,990
What change are you talking about?

26
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,560
Let me remind you,

27
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,870
you didn't kill me

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,510
because you couldn't.

29
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,870
Yes,

30
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,329
I might not be able to kill you,

31
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,240
but...

32
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,910
But because of that time
at the Lantern Festival,

33
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,380
I fell for you.

34
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,200
Since then,

35
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,780
I never thought about killing you again.

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,840
I've been anxious and uneasy

37
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,230
while deceiving you these days.

38
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,410
But there are things

39
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,350
that confuse me.

40
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,130
Why is it that when I'm Nan Heng,

41
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,070
you avoid me,

42
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,240
you're cautious,

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,150
you ingratiate yourself,

44
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,210
and act insincere,

45
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,540
but when I put on Li Shiliu's mask,

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,470
you treat me with sincerity

47
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,310
and honesty?

48
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,400
No matter which version of me,

49
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,800
I'm sincere with you.

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
But why does the real Song Yimeng

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,710
only appear before Li Shiliu?

52
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,280
So?

53
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,890
Is this your excuse for deceiving me?

54
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,510
I did deceive you.

55
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,190
But that's because I was afraid.

56
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,080
I was afraid that once
the lie was exposed,

57
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
I would never see the real you again.

58
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:37,870
And...

59
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,950
And I was selfish,

60
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,360
because I cherished the feeling of
being trusted by you.

61
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,630
I didn't want to wake up from this dream.

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,510
But...

63
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
you eventually wake up from dreams.

64
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,870
Lies

65
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,280
will also

66
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,200
be exposed eventually.

67
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,240
That's right.

68
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,380
So now I want to honestly tell you

69
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,390
that the real Nan Heng

70
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,000
isn't the God of Death others speak of,

71
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,600
nor is he a carefree hero
of the martial arts world.

72
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,390
He's just

73
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,140
a cowardly,

74
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,720
selfish man.

75
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,780
Would you accept

76
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,520
this version of me as your husband?

77
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,920
His Highness,

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,450
where are you?

79
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,310
I hope you're not in any danger.

80
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,170
Please stay safe, Your Highness.

81
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,240
Mr. Fugui!

82
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,820
There's a body in there!

83
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:08,950
Sir.

84
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,750
It's in there.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,660
This...

86
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,380
Miss Song's cloak?

87
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,270
Mr. Fugui.

88
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,680
Mr. Fugui.

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,480
I found signs of struggle

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,090
at the edge of the cliff.

91
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,580
Let's go.

92
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,210
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,050
I can't accept your proposal.

94
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,240
What are you really worried about?

95
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,120
Nan Heng,

96
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,750
let me ask you something.

97
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,870
When you left the cold palace

98
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,750
and went to the border,

99
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,930
what was going through your mind?

100
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,010
I just didn't want to die
in the cold palace.

101
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,600
I wanted to fight for my survival.

102
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,960
That's right.

103
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
You succeeded.

104
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,400
You earned military merits

105
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,750
and gradually

106
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,870
built your own power base.

107
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,180
But when you returned to the capital,

108
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,770
you suddenly realized

109
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,130
that your years of fighting at the border

110
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:33,000
had become completely worthless.

111
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,050
No matter how many
achievements you earned,

112
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,030
the position of crown prince

113
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,720
would only belong to Nan Rui.

114
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,560
And your fate?

115
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,610
To return to the depths of the palace

116
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,450
and never be free again.

117
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,100
So at that moment,

118
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,490
what were you thinking?

119
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,990
If you had ever experienced
trying with all your might

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,390
to reach the peak

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,980
but never being able to get there,

122
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,150
then you should understand

123
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,880
that enjoying the view from the bottom

124
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,210
isn't so bad after all.

125
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,180
You're trying to say

126
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,670
that no matter how hard one tries,

127
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,330
some things can't be changed.

128
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,390
But I don't believe that.

129
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,590
Why should my fate be
in someone else's hands?

130
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,400
I will obtain

131
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,510
what I want through my own efforts.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,789
But the day you get what you want

133
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,560
will be the day

134
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,610
tragedy befalls the Song family.

135
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,430
When I was little,

136
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,630
there was a terrible fire.

137
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,000
My parents

138
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,170
left this world forever

139
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,270
because they saved me.

140
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,370
So

141
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,360
I will never allow such a tragedy

142
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,570
happen again.

143
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,480
What do you mean your parents left?

144
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,270
Isn't Mr. Song perfectly fine?

145
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,120
I don't understand what you're saying.

146
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,050
It's nothing.

147
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,210
You wouldn't understand.

148
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,120
Nan Heng,

149
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,990
there will

150
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,310
never be a happy ending for us.

151
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Since there can't be a happy ending,

152
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,870
it's better

153
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,070
if we never begin at all.

154
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,480
So

155
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:57,090
this is your reason for rejecting me?

156
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,870
But Song Yimeng,

157
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
have you even tried?

158
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,390
Nothing has even begun,

159
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,050
so why say it's doomed to fail?

160
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,720
If I'm the problem, I can change.

161
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,450
I can promise you

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,390
to show you my true self from now on,

163
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,200
and I'll look after the Song family too.

164
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
But why are you using

165
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,150
a made-up excuse

166
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,390
to reject me?

167
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
Your Highness doesn't need to understand.

168
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:29,990
This world

169
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,360
is just one giant storybook.

170
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,080
And I

171
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,420
am just an ordinary person.

172
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,320
I only want

173
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,620
to protect my family,

174
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,610
to keep them alive and well.

175
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,320
The only thing I can control

176
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,120
is my own heart.

177
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,100
So, Your Highness,

178
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
the Song Yimeng standing before you

179
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,520
will never

180
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,280
and cannot fall in love with you.

181
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,540
Then let me ask you.

182
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,680
If you're so afraid of death

183
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,790
and pain,

184
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,760
why did you risk everything
to save me last night?

185
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,560
Song Yimeng,

186
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,320
can you really

187
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,690
control your heart?

188
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,120
General.

189
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,330
[Song Residence]

190
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,870
You actually snuck out

191
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,810
without telling me last night?

192
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,550
They tried killing you
and you fell off a cliff.

193
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,510
All of this

194
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,130
happened in one short night.

195
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,870
Mr. Song.

196
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,510
I...

197
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,610
Miss Song Yiting,

198
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,740
last night the two of us

199
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,410
were pursued by nearly 100 assassins.

200
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,750
We had nowhere to retreat

201
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,140
and were forced to the edge of a cliff.

202
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,910
In the end, we barely managed to survive

203
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,770
by choosing to jump off the cliff.

204
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,730
Look,

205
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,610
I even suffered a knife wound.

206
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,080
You were still in the capital

207
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,910
and people dared to be so brazen.

208
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,430
Shut up.

209
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,440
They even dared to
hurt the Seventh Prince.

210
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,240
Thankfully the Seventh Prince
arrived in time,

211
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
otherwise Yimeng

212
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,070
might have already...

213
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,080
It wasn't that serious.

214
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,630
Father,

215
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,560
wasn't serious.

216
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,640
How can you say it wasn't serious
when all this happened?

217
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,200
Mr. Song is right.

218
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,240
Those assassins

219
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,480
were all highly skilled fighters

220
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,630
with ruthless techniques.

221
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,800
Even I,

222
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,150
a veteran of many battles, nearly died,

223
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,550
let alone her.

224
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,240
Nan Heng.

225
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,800
are you done?

226
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,830
Stop exaggerating everything.

227
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,960
What do you mean?

228
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,150
Father,

229
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,390
don't listen to him.

230
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,960
It wasn't nearly as bad as he claims.

231
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,200
If it were really that serious,

232
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,510
how would I still be alive to return?

233
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,120
Think about it.

234
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,790
Even so,

235
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,270
it must have been extremely dangerous.

236
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,150
Otherwise, with how skilled the
Seventh Prince is,

237
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,440
how could he get hurt?

238
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,000
Yiting makes a good point.

239
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,670
Well...

240
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,960
You are not allowed to go south anymore.

241
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,620
Stay put in the capital.

242
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,320
Father, don't believe everything you hear.

243
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,870
Mr. Song, your thinking is prudent,

244
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,870
but since these villains failed this time,

245
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,550
they will surely seek
another opportunity to strike.

246
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,670
I just wonder

247
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,130
what method they'll use.

248
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,410
Strangulation,

249
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,600
an ambush,

250
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,440
or perhaps poison?

251
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,150
Enough!

252
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,790
Yimeng.

253
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,910
To be safe,

254
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,270
from today on,

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,390
you must stay in the Song Residence

256
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,690
and not leave at all.

257
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,080
Father,

258
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,370
this is unnecessary.

259
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,370
Father is right.

260
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,120
We cannot take this lightly.

261
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
Just staying indoors isn't enough.

262
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,440
Think about it, Mr. Song.

263
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,830
If they could bribe your stable hand,

264
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,510
then it's possible

265
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,710
they have spies within your household.

266
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,000
Quick,

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,750
guards!

268
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,390
Add more guards to the residence

269
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,870
and watch Laiyi House around the clock.

270
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:05,670
Yes, sir.

271
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,080
Yimeng,

272
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,390
starting today,

273
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,990
you must stay in your room

274
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,950
and not take a single step outside.

275
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,630
Father,

276
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,200
how can I not leave my room?

277
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,320
It's really not that serious.

278
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
Don't listen to him.

279
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,910
This is truly unnecessary.

280
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,000
Your Highness,

281
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,320
please find the real culprit quickly

282
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,380
so our household can return to peace.

283
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,000
Of course.

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,310
I'll do my best.

285
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,510
However, Miss Song Yiting

286
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,470
and Mr. Song,

287
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,960
you both need to be

288
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,750
careful when going out from now on too.

289
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,200
Yes, of course.

290
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,240
Is this his house

291
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,320
or mine?

292
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,060
Why do you all believe him?

293
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,120
Be a good girl.

294
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,480
Making a big show,

295
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,510
blowing things out of proportion.

296
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,360
I know you're up to no good.

297
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,240
Song Yimeng.

298
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,310
Stop following me.

299
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,970
You're going the wrong way.

300
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,240
I...

301
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,840
Don't think I don't know

302
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,150
what you were trying to do

303
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,630
by saying those things to my family.

304
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,360
You may have trapped me for now,

305
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,140
but you can't trap me forever.

306
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,390
Isn't everything I've done
for your own good?

307
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,210
Your enemy hasn't revealed themselves yet.

308
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,360
We absolutely can't let our guard down.

309
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,200
Enemy?

310
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,390
What enemy are you talking about?

311
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,440
That was just an iconic scene

312
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,370
from the script that had to happen.

313
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,790
Besides,

314
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,750
apart from you, what enemies

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,580
can I possibly have?

316
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,930
Move.

317
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
Your Highness!

318
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,480
Song Yimeng.

319
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,200
Your Highness,

320
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,080
something terrible has happened!

321
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280
Something terrible!

322
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,720
What happened?

323
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,810
Where on earth has the General gone?

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,840
Indeed,

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,550
something this serious
has happened to the Chancellor,

326
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,000
yet the General isn't even
at his residence.

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,800
What do you...

328
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,440
General.

329
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:40,970
General.

330
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,670
General,

331
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,150
you're finally back.

332
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,440
General,

333
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,510
regarding the Chancellor's matter,

334
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,170
we need you to make a decision.

335
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,030
Yan Yi.

336
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,140
What is

337
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,200
the Ministry of Justice's judgment?

338
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,000
General,

339
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,120
Chancellor Gao's body was

340
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,750
immediately taken to the capital
prefecture's office by Mr. Chu last night.

341
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,630
Early this morning,

342
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,670
Mr. Chu went to the palace
to report to His Majesty.

343
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,440
During this time, the Ministry of Justice
had no chance

344
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,040
to intervene in this matter.

345
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,480
Yao Qian,

346
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,150
didn't I order you to keep constant watch

347
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,510
on the Qianyu Army's movements?

348
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,840
Why did you let Chu Guihong
get ahead of us?

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,860
Your Highness.

350
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,150
I mean,

351
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,510
General.

352
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,290
I followed your orders diligently,

353
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,550
working conscientiously

354
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,750
and with utmost care.

355
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,800
Get to the point.

356
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,550
However,

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,910
what was unexpected was that

358
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,870
last night, General Chu and Rong Hua

359
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,270
suddenly went to
bid farewell to Chancellor Gao.

360
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,620
As they were parting ways,

361
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,000
something unexpected happened,

362
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,700
and several people lost their lives.

363
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,150
He told you to get to the point.
Are you deaf?

364
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,200
By the time I heard the news,

365
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,790
we had already lost our advantage,

366
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,360
and the case had fallen
into the capital prefect's hands.

367
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,840
I made the quick decision

368
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,120
to return and report to you.

369
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:52,920
But Your High—

370
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,000
General's whereabouts were
unknown at that time.

371
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,630
As they say,

372
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,240
losing the commander
during battle is disastrous.

373
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,100
That's enough.

374
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,720
Go now

375
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,480
and find the Gao family.

376
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
Tell them to go to the
capital prefecture's office

377
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,440
as next of kin

378
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,480
to claim Chancellor Gao's body.

379
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,270
Yes, sir.

380
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,260
General,

381
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:22,349
Chu Guihong's behavior in this matter
is quite suspicious.

382
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:23,640
He bid farewell to the Chancellor,

383
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,349
then requested an audience
with His Majesty.

384
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,109
I fear he may be plotting something

385
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,310
that could harm you.

386
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,430
General,

387
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,430
why don't we

388
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,750
strike first

389
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,550
and use the Chancellor's death

390
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,960
to deal a heavy blow to Chu Guihong?

391
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes, General.

392
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,270
Since General Chu met with
the Chancellor last night,

393
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,640
we could use this opportunity

394
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,480
to accuse him of failing to save a life,

395
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,680
deliberately allowing those villains

396
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,000
to assassinate a high-level official

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,680
right under the Emperor's nose.

398
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,110
If we can use this to
charge the Qianyu Army

399
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,440
with negligence in their duties,

400
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,480
then the Chancellor's death

401
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,070
actually works in our favor.

402
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,240
That makes sense.

403
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,280
Exactly.

404
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,720
General,

405
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,640
Chancellor Gao's death is irreversible.

406
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,550
Please accept our condolences.

407
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,200
But right now, maintaining

408
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,070
the political balance that Chancellor Gao
worked so hard to establish

409
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,500
is of paramount importance.

410
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,640
No matter what,

411
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,170
you still have us.

412
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,790
Yes,

413
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,510
-Yes.
-Yes.

414
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,200
Enough.

415
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,440
I'll make my own judgment on this matter.

416
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,640
You may all leave now.

417
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,510
Yes.

418
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,550
-Yes.
-Yes.

419
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,930
How quickly loyalties change.

420
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,200
When Chancellor Gao was alive,

421
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,750
these people were falling over themselves

422
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,850
to follow his every command.

423
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,570
And now?

424
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,110
He's passed away less than 24 hours ago,

425
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,840
and they've completely changed their tune.

426
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,200
A matter of life and death

427
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,800
shouldn't be used as
a pawn in power struggles.

428
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,260
This is all too common.

429
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,050
In power struggles,

430
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,240
how much sincerity can you expect?

431
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,510
By the way,

432
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,960
what's the progress on investigating
those men in black?

433
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,590
And who set up those traps in the cave?

434
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,950
Any leads?

435
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,830
Well, we're still investigating about

436
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,890
those men in black,

437
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,720
but those weapons and
rope traps in the cave

438
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,580
were placed there on your orders.

439
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,510
I ordered it?

440
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,910
What do you mean I ordered it?

441
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,240
I just found out myself.

442
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,790
Two years ago,

443
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,310
when Waning River Crescent
was at risk of being exposed,

444
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:14,510
you used Li Shiliu's identity

445
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,680
to order Yunlong and Shanhu

446
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,990
to move the weapons hidden in the hall.

447
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,070
They didn't know your real identity then.

448
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,750
Yunlong

449
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,060
found that cave in Huyang Forest

450
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,480
and stored everything there.

451
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,110
And Shanhu

452
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,380
copied the Xuanjia Army's techniques

453
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,030
to set up those rope traps

454
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,420
to throw off suspicion.

455
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,290
They planned that
if it were ever discovered,

456
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,620
they would pin it on you.

457
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
Why pin it on me?

458
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,270
Well, you're known as
the God of Death.

459
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:38,920
I...

460
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,190
So just because I'm the God of Death,
I deserve this?

461
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,000
Enough.

462
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,810
Stop investigating the men in black too.

463
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,000
Right now,

464
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,510
go immediately to the
capital prefecture's office

465
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,910
and pressure Chu Guihong

466
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,300
to release Shangguan He and the others.

467
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:03,960
Yes.

468
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,680
Won't let me investigate the assassins.

469
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,720
All he cares about is
Shangguan the Useless.

470
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Such favoritism.

471
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,260
Are you saying

472
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,080
Heng killed Gao Changyin?

473
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes.

474
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,070
I suspect that

475
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,250
the Seventh Prince had a conflict

476
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,350
with Chancellor Gao over
the Jiangnan case

477
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,750
and feared that someday,

478
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,680
Chancellor Gao would
expose his misconduct

479
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,830
during the Pingrong Battle

480
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,920
to the world,

481
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,650
so he simply silenced him permanently.

482
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,240
I humbly request Your Majesty

483
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,440
to reinvestigate the Pingrong Battle.

484
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,550
This is a matter of great importance.

485
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,820
Gao Changyin's dying words alone

486
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,460
are not sufficient evidence.

487
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,400
To reopen and review
the entire Pingrong incident

488
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,970
requires concrete proof.

489
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:06,920
For now,

490
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,480
you should first investigate

491
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,110
who killed Gao Changyin.

492
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,790
If it was indeed Heng's doing,

493
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,070
I will make my own judgment.

494
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,510
I will thoroughly investigate

495
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,920
both cases to the end.

496
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,770
Once I find compelling evidence
about the Pingrong Battle,

497
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,400
I will vindicate my father

498
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,880
and the Qianyu Army.

499
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,150
At that time,

500
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,290
Your Majesty can take this opportunity

501
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,690
to completely eliminate

502
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,690
Nan Heng's influence in court.

503
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,750
Ten!

504
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,240
Fifteen!

505
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,590
Ten!

506
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,350
Fifteen!

507
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,160
Ten, ten!

508
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,720
Fifteen!

509
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,590
Twenty!

510
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,920
That doesn't count!

511
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Let's start over.

512
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,640
Again! Let's go!

513
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,400
Ten!

514
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,110
Twenty!

515
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:49,640
-Twenty!
-Nothing!

516
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,240
Nothing!

517
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,030
Open!

518
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,440
I won again!

519
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,000
I won again!

520
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,750
General.

521
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,550
Keep playing.

522
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
I'm tired. Come.

523
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,940
The prison release has been arranged.

524
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,200
[Capital Prefecture's Office received
an imperial edict today.]

525
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,440
Shangguan Baihe and the others

526
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,830
can be freed at any time.

527
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,520
Take them back to Waning River Crescent,

528
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,240
and use this opportunity

529
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,820
to investigate the organization

530
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,590
[Capital Prefecture's Office received
an imperial edict today.]

531
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,660
and check every Nightwalker's background.

532
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,280
What is the purpose

533
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,540
of this, General?

534
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,910
Nan Heng orchestrated
the Pingrong Battle conspiracy,

535
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,300
but all records in the Qianyu Army

536
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,950
of my request for reinforcements that day

537
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,580
were completely destroyed.

538
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,300
This must be

539
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,890
because his men who
infiltrated the Qianyu Army

540
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:35,310
tampered with the evidence,

541
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,930
and then pretended to have died in battle

542
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,220
to escape.

543
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,350
General, are you suggesting

544
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,930
that these fugitives

545
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,000
might be hiding
within the Waning River Crescent?

546
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,830
If they're not hiding among

547
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,880
these mysterious Nightwalkers,

548
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,800
where else would they be?

549
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,160
Someone's coming, brothers!

550
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,830
Isn't this Mr. Chu?

551
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,960
Why have you come to see us personally?

552
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,550
Nan Heng traded 60 lashes

553
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,460
to save the Waning River Crescent.

554
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,850
You're free to go now.

555
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,170
This way, please.

556
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,770
You should

557
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,070
take my advice to heart.

558
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,340
If you trust him,

559
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,880
you'll suffer.

560
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,610
The last death row meal

561
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,510
didn't quite satisfy you.

562
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,810
Whenever you're ready
to come over to our side,

563
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,960
I'll prepare the finest food and wine
to welcome you.

564
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,830
And then,

565
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,780
I'll invite you

566
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,400
to enjoy a few more pig trotters.

567
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,240
I'll pass on that death row meal.

568
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,500
I'm tired of pig trotters anyway.

00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,880
low—

00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,110
Alright, I get it.

Miss Song Yiting,

655
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,140
I'm happy you came to
pick me up from jail.

656
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,540
But since we're a man and a woman,

657
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,060
you don't need to be so enthusiastic.

658
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,880
For a man like Mr. Shangguan
with no sense of responsibility

659
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,400
who goes back on his word,

660
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,360
I need to keep a close eye on you.

661
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,400
Later,

662
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,170
come with me to meet my parents.

663
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,450
Meet your parents?

664
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,110
The incident at Zijin Pavilion
that ruined my reputation

665
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,200
was caused by you.

666
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,790
You and Nan Heng

667
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,520
need to give me an explanation.

668
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,720
Everyone in the Song family

669
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
wants to hear you explain in person.

670
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,520
After all this,

671
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
were you really

672
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,180
just toying with me,

673
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,680
or do you actually

674
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,270
intend to marry me?

675
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,590
Marry?

676
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,540
So you suspect Chancellor Gao is behind
the attempt to kill Song Yimeng?

677
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,870
But didn't Chancellor Gao die last night?

678
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,970
Could he still be alive?

679
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,510
You're just now figuring this out?

680
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Fair point.

681
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,260
In the entire capital,

682
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,790
the only person willing
to go to such lengths

683
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,070
to kill Song Yimeng

684
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,470
would be Chancellor Gao.

685
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,480
Now because of the Jiangnan case,

686
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,670
he was convinced that Song Yimeng
made you fall in love

687
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,830
and lose interest in
the crown prince title,

688
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,330
so he wanted to eliminate her quickly.

689
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,290
So,

690
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,000
if he simultaneously targeted
Song Yimeng last night

691
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,270
while staging his own death,

692
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,270
then everything

693
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,310
would make sense.

694
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,670
So Chancellor Gao's power

695
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,790
is far greater than we imagined.

696
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,630
He not only manages
a group of assassins,

697
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,290
but even within the Xuanjia Army,

698
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,790
he has planted people

699
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,400
to help him fake his death and escape.

700
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,590
We must investigate this.

701
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,680
At the very least, we need to find out

702
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,720
how many more hidden forces

703
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,310
Gao Changyin has at his disposal.

704
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,240
If we let this situation
develop unchecked,

705
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,480
I fear that one day,

706
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,590
it might be possible for him to

707
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,920
overthrow the emperor.

708
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
Regarding the Xuanjia Army,

709
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,140
I've already sent Fugui to investigate.

710
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:54,040
But to find Chancellor Gao,

711
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,730
we'll need to employ the Nightwalkers.

712
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,370
But with his people in the Xuanjia Army,

713
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,460
we might alert him to our actions.

714
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,310
How about this?

715
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,710
I'll have Yunlong and Shanhu investigate.

716
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,690
What about you?

717
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,000
Me?

718
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,400
Th-This task isn't really suitable for me.

719
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,310
You know my health isn't good.

720
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,030
I'd fall over in a light breeze.

721
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,110
I'd likely just hold you back

722
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,640
during the investigation.

723
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
If I cause any delay,

724
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,880
that would ruin your grand plan.

725
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,040
You have a point.

726
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,030
Indeed.

727
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,160
So,

728
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,310
I'm assigning you to do something else.

729
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,210
[Grace & Elegance]

730
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,310
You've only met the Seventh Prince

731
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,920
and now you want to
discuss our marriage at my home?

732
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,720
What,

733
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,920
is the Seventh Prince

734
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,380
your father or something?

735
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,240
We're all cultured people here.

736
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,900
Such talk is improper.

737
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,270
Marriage is a serious matter

738
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,200
that shouldn't be rushed.

739
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,270
Let's set that aside for now.

740
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,350
However, the Zijin Pavilion incident

741
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,080
was indeed my fault.

742
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,160
I should personally visit

743
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,760
and explain to your parents.

744
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,480
I see it's getting late.

745
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,240
Why don't we

746
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,300
go now?

747
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,750
Did His Highness

748
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,200
send you to my home

749
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,680
with some task?

750
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,080
Don't tell me

751
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,150

00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,330
Truly the capital's most talented lady.

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,590
Everyone says Miss Song Yiting
is brilliantly clever.

754
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,550
Nothing escapes

755
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,270
those beautiful eyes of yours.

756
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,200
So,

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,350
would you be willing to help me

758
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,830
with this small favor?

759
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,480
Tell me,

760
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,850
what did His Highness threaten you with?

761
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,790
Cleaning the huge

762
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,000
Waning River Crescent by myself,

763
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:34,840
or else I'd have to run errands.

764
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,110
Not many options.

765
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,720
Loves cleanliness,

766
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,750
is refined,

767
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,610
and is lazy too.

768
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,720
I never thought you were
this type of person.

769
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,020
You've misunderstood me.

770
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,830
Fine,

771
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:46,890
I can bring you to the Song family.

772
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,920
I'll add in a guest room
with windows on both sides.

773
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,620
That's too generous.

774
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,000
And two maids,

775
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,640
fashionable clothes, and seasonal dishes

776
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,610
whenever you'd like.

777
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,190
Really?

778
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,680
I'll double your salary

779
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,440
and every month,

780
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,720
you get three days off.

781
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,920
Wait.

782
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,880
With such generous compensation,

783
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,480
what do I have to do in return?

784
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,000
When I call for you,

785
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,590
be at my beck and call.

786
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,000
At your beck and call?

787
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,380
Would you consider taking on
my job as well?

788
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,510
I...

789
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,750
I think I'll pass.

790
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,250
What are you worried about?

791
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,640
The Seventh Prince is extremely powerful.

792
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,830
If he discovers I'm taking on
another side job,

793
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,270
then I'll...

794
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,390
As long as you don't tell him,

795
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,740
he'll never know.

796
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,680
That's true.

797
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,920
What else do I need to do?

798
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,720
You only need to sell your skills,

799
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,680
not your body.

800
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,300
Deal.

801

[Joy]

802
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,790
My Lady,

803
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,550
I've got the information.

804
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,350
What did you find out?

805
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,070
Last night,

806
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,510
besides the matter between you
and the Seventh Prince,

807
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,000
something major happened in the capital.

808
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Chancellor Gao died.

809
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,270
The Seventh Prince must've rushed out

810
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,630
because of this matter.

811
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,590
Chancellor Gao died?

812
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,330
How could Gao Changyin be dead?

813
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,790
In the original script,

814
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,590
he was supposed to survive to the end

815
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,350
as the main villain who
shared power with Nan Heng.

816
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,950
Now he's dead just like that?

817
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,270
Who told you this?

818
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,440
Is the information reliable?

819
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,510
It's absolutely true.

820
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,310
Hu Da, who works for Master, told me.

821
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,440
He said Master rushed to
the Ministry of Justice,

822
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,570
and his expression changed completely
when he came out.

823
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,020
[Good Virtues]

824
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:26,830
Father,

825
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,460
Father.

826
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,170
Did Chancellor Gao really die?

827
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,550
Yimeng,

828
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,030
if the Seventh Prince
comes looking for you these days,

829
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,550
you must not see him.

830
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,710
Why?

831
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Although the capital prefecture's office
and the Xuanjia Army

832
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,720
are suppressing the news,

833
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,440
there are many rumors

834
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,440
circulating in the capital,

835
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,440
saying the Seventh Prince
killed Chancellor Gao.

836
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,270
That's absurd.

837
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,000
Nan Heng was with me all last night.

838
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,260
How could he have had time to kill anyone?

839
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,130
The cause of Chancellor Gao's death

840
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,230
was petroleum and thunder bombs.

841
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,270
The prison cart
transporting Chancellor Gao

842
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,630
was coated with petroleum

843
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,590
and detonated by bombs on the way.

844
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,840
More than a dozen people

845
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,239
were instantly turned into
charred corpses.

846
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,400
Petroleum...

847
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,880
Why does that sound so familiar?

848
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,040
This is...

849
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,989
A battle report.

850
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,130
[Report from the Northern Garrison Command
to the Ministry of War]

851
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,590
During last year's border battle,

852
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,340
Heyuan once arranged to battle
His Highness outside Youcheng.

853
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,260
In that battle,

854
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,150
His Highness won a great victory,

855
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,230
and what he used to burn

856
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,850
the enemy's granary was
precisely petroleum.

857
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,409
That's impossible.

858
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,880
Nan Heng isn't that kind of person.

859
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,679
He absolutely couldn't have
killed Gao Changyin.

860
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,790
Yimeng.

861
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,290
Now that Chancellor Gao is dead,

862
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,280
the various factions at court

863
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,340
will certainly make a big issue of it.

864
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,230
If it's proven in the end

865
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,460
that the Seventh Prince
killed Chancellor Gao,

866
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,790
I'm afraid Great Jing will face upheaval.

867
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,440
Mrs. Li's strike was

868
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,270
precise and deadly,

869
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,530
killing with one blow.

870
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,180
Did you notice anything suspicious?

871
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,820
The bones show multiple fractures

872
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,020
that have been reset,

873
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,110
and the muscles are strong.

874
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:28,920
This person

875
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,590
must be a deliberately trained assassin.

876
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,270
What is it now?

877
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,970
I recognize this mark.

878
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,230
General,

879
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,070
here's all the information on
the Nightwalkers.

880
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,000
We haven't found anyone connected

881
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,060
to the Qianyu Army.

882
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,130
Their backgrounds might be fabricated.

883
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,360
Take some men

884
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,020
and investigate their hometowns again.

885
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,710
Yes, sir.

886
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,600
Guihong.

887
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,480
Look what I've brought you.

888
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:13,800
This belonged to my mother when...

889
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,660
Your Highness.

890
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,350
How did this happen?

891
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,230
Come here.

892
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,510
What a shame.

893
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,170
What are you looking at?

894
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,030
It's the same.

895
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,080
It's the same fabric.

896
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,860
So what?

897
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,510
Guihong,

898
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,230
it's just an ordinary piece of fabric.

899
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,030
Why are you so worked up about it?

900
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,610
This was the fabric of the Qianyu Army's

901
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,920
winter uniform when we were at the border.

902
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,800
Its owner

903
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,850
might be an old friend of the Qianyu Army.

904
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,440
Aren't you overthinking this?

905
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,950
In recent years,

906
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,280
there's been a lot of trade between
the capital and the border.

907
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,190
Similar clothing

908
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,190
can be purchased in the capital too.

909
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,210
This is fabric for military uniforms.

910
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,330
The border is cold

911
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,530
and during war,

912
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,070
clothes often get damaged.

913
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,530
Father specifically chose
a local coarse hemp

914
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,990
to make winter uniforms
for the Qianyu Army.

915
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,500
Are you saying

916
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,440
these clothes

917
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,970
can't be bought with money?

918
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,080
Your Highness,

919
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,370
where did you buy

920
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,130
that basket of red tangerines?

921
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,510
Trespassing the Kou Gang's territory,

922
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,300
you two must be tired of living.

923
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,460
Who exactly are you people?

924
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,550
Businessmen.

925
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,820
We have a big job right now.

926
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,600
Are you interested?

927
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,480
I've never been one to turn down money.

928
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,280
May I ask what kind

929
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,640
of business you gentlemen have in mind?

930
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,550
Murder.

931
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,050
We need to speak with your boss.

932
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,640
If you want to meet our boss,

933
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,490
this level of sincerity

934
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,760
isn't quite enough.

935
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,460
How about this much sincerity?

936
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,920
I believe you can all tell

937
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,710
that these are things
circulated among the nobility.

938
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,800
If you're smart,

939
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
stop wasting time

940
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:23,620
and make the introduction now.

941
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,960
Tonight at midnight,

942
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,890
I'll bring my boss

943
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,430
to meet you at Jiangsong Forest.

944
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,590
Take a look!

945
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,030
Come take a look!

946
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,000
Fresh vegetables!

947
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,340
Freshly picked!

948
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,620
Come, come!

949
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
Step right up!

950
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:47,670
They're very fresh.

951
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,320
They're just harvested.

952
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,070
See how fresh they are.

953
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,960
They're still moist with dew.

954
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,020
Why would you come to
such a place to buy red tangerines?

955
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,590
Well, every winter,

956
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,830
Mother loved these
Dongting red tangerines.

957
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,090
Since they're not common in the capital,

958
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:01,110
I had people search around for them.

959
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,230
But I don't see anyone
selling red tangerines.

960
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,800
Jixiang said he bought them
at the South City market.

961
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,930
I don't really know.

962
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,440
Guihong,

963
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,230
see?

964
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,110
How much are these red tangerines?

965
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,920
Try one.

966
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,130
[The 4th day of the Pingrong Battle]

967
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,280
Lu Yi.

968
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,700
[Lu Yi,
Scout of the Six Camps of Qianyu Army]

969
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,230
Four hundred li southeast of here

970
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:28,030
is Youcheng,
where the Xuanjia Army is stationed.

971
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,590
You must deliver this letter,

972
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,440
understand?

973
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,050
But Junior General,

974
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,900
if Seventh Prince were willing
to send troops,

975
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,860
he would have done so already.

976
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,920
Why would things be like this now?

977
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,120
Consider this letter

978
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,110
as my last attempt.

979
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,710
Where are you going, Guihong?

980
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,510
Wait for me!

981
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,340
You're clearly still alive.

982
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,840
Why haven't you come to see me?
