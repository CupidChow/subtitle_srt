189
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,240
holding all these people

190
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,550
under detention now.

191
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,390
When the Emperor is informed,
and the truth is out,

192
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,190
there will be a final judgement.

193
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
What do you think?

Please hear me out, Song Yimeng.

195

You shouldn't be explaining to me,

196
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,570
but to the Nightwalkers who trust you.

197

201
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,860

202

203

207
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,720

208
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
The truth of the theft three years ago

209
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,480
is perhaps unknown to

210
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,040
Chu Guihong and the Emperor.

211
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,100
But what about you?

212
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,930
Can you deny knowing the truth?

213
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,030
I do know it.

214
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,740
You'd rather endanger the Nightwalkers

215
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,270
than explore the option

216
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,360
of bringing Gao Changyin to justice

217
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,560
or presenting the truth to the Emperor.

218
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,730
Chu Guihong says
you have a wicked soul

219
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,440
and diabolical ambitions.

220
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,960
Is he really wrong?

221
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,540
You've asked many times for my trust.

222
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,200
But what should I trust about you?

223
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,820
Many of the Nightwalkers

224
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,900
are victims of Gao Changyin's crimes.

225
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,480
And you...

226
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,170

00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,270
I just want them to have a home.

233
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,200
I can even let them...

234
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,960
Stop it.

00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,600

Just be the high and mighty
Seventh Prince.

238
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,440
I can't speak for others,

239
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,370
but I just want to remember
the kind and righteous Mr. Li,

240
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,930
instead of you,

241
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,670

242
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,560

to rescue the criminal

243
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320

246
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,030
who ordered to hold us in detention.

247
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,790
We should be brought to his place.

248
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,030
Who are you to make decisions?

249
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,290

00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,120
It's unnecessary to create tension.

254

Otherwise...

255
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,870
You're on death row.

you can stop all of us?

259
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,240

It's time to set things right.

What Song Yimeng said is correct.

269

I shouldn't treat others' care
for me as nothing.

All the Nightwalkers'

00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,270
It's not like we're close.

374
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,530
Please leave me alone.

375
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,660
Mr. Wang!

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,030
But I am involved in this mess now.

377
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,069
Song!

378
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,010
Song!

379
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,250
Where is Heng?

380
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,330
Is this what he wants,
to let everyone wait for him?

381
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,170
An old case

382
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,940
in Jiangnan Province has unexpectedly

383
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,270
embroiled so many followers
and associates of the Gao family.

384
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,680
Heng is involved in it,

385
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,940
yet he hasn't shown up.

386
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,670
I'm afraid he has fled to escape

387
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,550
punishment, knowing that Father

388
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,080
will hold him accountable.

389
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,310
Father,

390
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,680
I advise you to immediately

391
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
order to search and seize

392
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,070
the residences of all the officials

393
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,460
connected to the Gao family,

394
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,960
and to let Guihong bring them to

395
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,480
the capital prefecture's
prison for interrogations.

396
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,240
Also,

397
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,680
the power to command Xuanjia Army

398
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,440
should be instantly taken from Nan Heng.

399
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,330
Song Yude,

400
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,410
what do you think of Rui's suggestion?

401
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,310
Your Majesty,

402
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,510
Xuanjia Army was established
by the Seventh Prince.

403
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,850
But it is my belief

404
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,940
that all the military power should
rest in Your Majesty's hands.

405
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,510
That said, a legitimate reason

406
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,760
is needed to take
the Seventh Prince's power away.

407
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,510
Mr. Song,

408
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,240
in just one day,

409
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,200
news about Chancellor Gao's
illegal acts in the theft case

410
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,460
has reached every corner in the capital.

411
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,010
Eighteenth Prince,

412
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,420
hearsay on the streets

413
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,410
is called rumor.

414
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,110
Witnesses

415
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,350
or physical evidence

416
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,690
properly examined by local institutes

417
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,290
and reports from
authorities of all levels,

418
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,800
plus a trial conducted
by three judicial offices,

419
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,660
are needed to determine the charges

420
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,920
and punishment for an alleged offender.

421
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,790
The reopening of an old case

422
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,880
means the start of an arduous process.

423
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,810
What if the Seventh Prince
takes action before we do?

424
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,110
Your Majesty,

425
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,640
yesterday's incident
on the execution ground

426
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,300
already unraveled the truth.

427
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,400
The Seventh Prince Nan Heng

428
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,160
is not only the leader of
Chancellor Gao's faction

429
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,270
and the commander of a strong army,

430
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,160
but also a powerful figure

431
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
in the martial arts world,
ruling the Nightwalkers.

432
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,510
We have to take action

433
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,440
before a mutiny happens in the capital.

434
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,070
Indeed.

435
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,400
Your Majesty,

436
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,400
I agree with General Chu.

437
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,270
I concur.

438
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,770
-I concur.
-I concur.

439
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,070
We all concur.

440
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,860
What a shock to know

441
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,550
that I'm dreaded

442
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,280
by all the officials.

443
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,890
Your Majesty.

444
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,630
How dare you come here?

445
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,440
Any Imperial Guards outside?

446
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,750
He formed cliques and covered

447
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,480
for Chancellor Gao. Take him down!

448
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,280
Your Majesty,

449
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,030
this scroll records

450
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,480
the witnesses and evidence
of the old case in Jiangnan Province.

451
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,750
I have properly dealt with

452
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,270
all the personnel involved.

453
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,270
If there are more,

454
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,370
they can be convicted and arrested

455
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,060
after Minister Yan's review.

456
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,200
Bring it here.

457
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,400
The evidence was destroyed long ago.

458
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,720
How did you get it?

459
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
I personally handled

460
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,550
this case three years ago.

461
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,150
I kept the scroll, of course.

462
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,070
I travelled

463
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,480
day and night to retrieve it

464
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,590
with the help of

465
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,720
three fine horses.

466
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,270
You?

467
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,240
You are a suspect.

468
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,570
Who knows if you've tampered with it?

469
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,310
If you have doubts,

470
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,430
then join Minister Yan in the review.

471
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,980
[The Grand Theft in Jiangnan Province]

472
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,800
Making baseless accusations

473
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,000
and badgering me

474
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,510
won't help with the matter.

475
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:09,960
You...

476
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,030
Heng,

477
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,440
in your opinion,

478
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,640
how should Gao Changyin
be punished for what he did

479
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,840
in this case?

480
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,920
Your Majesty,

481
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,680
Gao Changyin is proven to
have embezzled 2,000 taels of gold

482
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,240
from the disaster relief funds.

483
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Though the money was
recovered three years ago,

484
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,090
he should still be dismissed from

485
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,150
the position of chancellor and exiled

486
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,080
according to the law of Great Jing.

487
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,250
Exile?

488
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,200
The Seventh Prince will lose a strong aide

489
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,960
by exiling Chancellor Gao, won't he?

490
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,390
Yes.

491
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,350
How clever of Your Highness.

492
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,190
You're sacrificing Gao Changyin

493
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,650
just to silence everyone.

494
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,530
General Chu, you are wrong.

495
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,400
Your Majesty,

496
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,750
If it hadn't been for my indulgence,

497
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,610
Gao Changyin wouldn't
have committed such crimes.

498
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,030
Today, I'm not only here

499
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,790
to convict Gao Changyin,

500
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,670
but also to admit my guilt

501
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,350
in Your Majesty's presence.

502
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,000
Are you only guilty of covering

503
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,030
for Gao Changyin?

504
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,240
What about

505
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,880
harboring Shangguan He,

506
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,070
colluding with the Nightwalkers

507
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,240
and doing evil?

508
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,040
Your Majesty,

509
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,880
the Waning River Crescent

510
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,680
was indeed

511
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,310
founded by me.

512
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm also the chief of it,

513
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Li Shiliu.

514
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,210
The Seventh Prince is Li Shiliu?

515
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,720
For

516
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,050
failing my supervisory duties

517
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,480
and trusting the wrong person,

518
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,790
I deserve 20 lashes.

519
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,960
For sponsoring people
from the martial arts world

520
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,350
and withholding the truth,

521
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,750
I deserve 20 more lashes.

522
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,000
For indulging outlaws in

523
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,400
storming the execution ground,

524
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,860
I deserve extra 20 lashes.

525
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,270
Now,

526
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,060
I forfeit my royal title to make amends.

527
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,830
From now on,

528
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,700
I will no longer be
a prince of Great Jing.

529
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,350
I will enjoy no privilege

530
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,730
or honor.

531
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,610
I only wish to lead Xuanjia Army

532
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,480
to sustain the peace of Great Jing.

533
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,070
His Highness will

534
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,240
be no different than a commoner, right?

535
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:13,070
His Highness is withdrawing
from the succession struggle.

536
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,640
Chancellor Gao is in trouble.

537
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,480
The Seventh Prince is
asking for a demotion.

538
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,010
Is His Highness trying
to get himself killed?

539
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,870
Your Majesty,

540
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,680
the Seventh Prince is attempting

541
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,880
to take all the blame.

542
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,400
I implore...

543
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,200
Your Majesty!

544
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,720
Between

545
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,770
the law and the will of a person,

546
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,140
we should follow the former,

547
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,740
not the latter.

548
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,400
It was Gao Changyin

549
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,840
who made missteps in this old case,

550
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,650
not the Seventh Prince.

551
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,930
Moreover,

552
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,170
the prisoner who was supposed
to be executed yesterday

553
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,970
had been wrongfully convicted.

554
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,190
He was kept alive for three years

555
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,520
because of the Seventh Prince's mercy.

556
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,500
As for the Waning River Crescent,

557
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,990
although it is independent from the court,

558
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,900
it has done nothing but

559
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,220
benefit the people over these years.

560
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,210

00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,880

to blame for all the wrongs.

752
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,990

760
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,300
I'll say this one more time.

761
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,030
Song Yimeng

762
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,480
is my future wife,
who I fought very hard for.

763
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,550
Don't offend her,

00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,840
or you'll regret it.

765
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,050
About the script...

766
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,310
and that...

767
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,490

I'm right here,

773
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,000
and to believe

774
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,480

00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,200
Yes!

776
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,990
I don't believe you.

777
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,520

778
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,750

Alright.

799
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,320
It's all set.

800
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,620
Let's eat.

801
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,159
Whose birthday is it?

802
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,280
Gatherings are not only for birthdays.

803
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,230
Something just occurred to me.

804
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,050
Since I came here,

805
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,630
I haven't had a proper meal with you.

806
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,060
I used to consider Dad

807
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,010
a slick and sly bureaucrat

808
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,010
and Yiting

809
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,200
a naive

810
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,970
and holier-than-thou girl.

811
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,110
As for Madam...

812
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,310
I thought of you as

813
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,610
an evil stepmother.

814
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,110
Hey, Song Yimeng...

815
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,670
Mom!

816
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,530
You're getting out of the line...

817
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,840
You little brat.

818
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,280
But after spending time with you,

819
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,540
I've finally realized

820
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:33,920
what family truly means.

821
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:37,960
Dad is busy working,

822
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,070
but he always prepares

823
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,840
ginseng cakes for me in secret.

824
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,630
Yiting is blunt

825
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,560
and persistent.

826
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,090
She always defends me
in front of outsiders.

827
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,770
And Madam...

828
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,700
Though we're not very close,

829
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,360
I assume...

830
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,590
If my mother were still alive,

831
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,280
she'd probably take good care of me

832
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,510
like you do of Yiting.

833
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,880
Alright.

834
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,030
Stop being so mushy.

835
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:12,960
Save these words

836
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,590
for your wedding day.

837
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,550
Did you invite us here to eat

838
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,610
or to hear these fancy lines of yours?

839
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,720
Yiting is right.

840
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,510
Let's eat.

841
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,510
Enjoy the food.

842
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,930
-Let's eat.
-Let's eat.

843
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,000
Dad,

844
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,220
braised pork for you.

845
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,710
A big drumstick.

846
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,400
Yimeng,

847
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,400
this is for you.

848
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,060
Thank you, Madam.

849
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,630
Shall we have drinks?

850
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,110
Sure.

851
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,960
Let's drink.

852
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,710
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

853
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,800
Madam, let me get you some soup.

854
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,280
Come on.

855
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,960
Try the dishes.

856
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,000
I was attracted by the smell just now.

857
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,630
How lovely.

858
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,490
Come on, Dad.

859
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,230
Okay.

860
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,000
Thanks.

861
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,960
Here, Yiting.

862
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,930
You try it too.

863
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,940
Have some soup.

864
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,280
Now is not the right time.

865
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,250
Just keep waiting.

866
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,780
Okay, Father.

867
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,840
Actually,

868
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,040
I don't mind waiting.

869
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,550
After all, Heng

870
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,360
has lost Gao Changyin's aid now.

871
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,000
In terms of cultural administration,

872
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,320
martial prowess
and support from officials,

873
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,510
he is no match for me.

874
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,240
You're talking nonsense again.

875
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,630
It isn't time to feel complacent.

876
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,920
We're discussing a major issue.

877
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,720
It needs further deliberation.

878
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,760
Your Majesty,

879
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,280
there are 2,000 Xuanjia
soldiers at the borders.

880
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
Plus those formidable Nightwalkers,

881
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,800
Nan Heng's strength
can't be underestimated.

882
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,280
To prevent trouble, Your Majesty

883
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,340
must strip him of his military power.

884
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,840
The Gao family has an intricate web
of connections in the court.

885
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,230
Though

886
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,140
Gao Changyin has been ousted,

887
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,180
his remaining proteges
will still support Heng.

888
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,210
You saw what happened in the court.

889
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,960
Heng is still favored by

890
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,400
many civil and military officials.

891
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:02,670
If he is deprived of his military
power without a solid reason,

892
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,580
there will be chaos in the court.

893
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,280
I think...

894
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,980
That sly old man Song Yude
did have a point.

895
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,770
We need to come up

896
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,390
with a legitimate reason.

897
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,090
Yes.

898
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,410
You're right, Father.

899
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,840
But you see,

900
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,840
Heng is very cunning.

901
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,430
That embezzlement case
could've nailed him,

902
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,480
but he put on an act
and helped himself out.

903
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,810
What legitimate reason is left for us now?

904
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,590
If there isn't one,

905
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,300
then we can invent one.

906
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,560
I've heard about

907
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,980
the close kinship between
Chancellor Gao and the Noble Consort.

908
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,230
Nan Heng cares a lot
about his family, doesn't he?

909
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,000
We can bring him to heel

910
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,820
by attacking the Noble Consort.

911
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,000
Your Majesty,

912
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,230
the court is like a battlefield.

913
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,670
Every opportunity is precious.

914
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,800
Missing out on one will cost us dearly.

915
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,240
Your Majesty, please don't hesitate.

916
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,060
[Memorial]

917
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,690
What are you doing?

918
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,920
Chancellor Gao is asking

919
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,360
for a meeting with the Seventh Prince.

920
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,320
No way.

921
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,360
It's just a meeting.

922
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,520
How many times have I told you?

923
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,190
What are you doing?

924
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,110
What's wrong with you?

925
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,050
I already said no!

926
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,910
Get out of here!

927
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,190
Fugui.

928
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,290
Fugui!

929
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,280
Your Highness...

930
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:57,840
No.

931
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,480
General,

932
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,510
you only rested for a moment.

933
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,710
Why are you up so soon?

934
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,640
What's happening outside?

935
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,110
It's about Chancellor Gao.

936
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,280
He's asking in the imperial prison

937
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,560
for a meeting with you.

938
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,870
I'd rather not.

939
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,190
But he is my uncle after all.

940
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,710
Just ensure he'll suffer less

941
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,710
when he is exiled.

942
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,070
Make proper arrangements for him.

943
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:21,590
Got it.

944
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,480
Go get prepared.

945
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,300
I'm heading out.

946
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,230
Now?

947
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,070
But your injuries...

948
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,730
Do as I said.

949
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,670
Yes.
