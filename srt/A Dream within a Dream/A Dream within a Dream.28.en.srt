[Episode 28]

3
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,630
You're clearly still alive,

4
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,240
why didn't you come find me?

5
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,010
Say something.

6
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,750
Speak up!

7
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,329
Speak up.

8
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,400
Speak up!

9
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
Guihong! Guihong!

10
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,190
Stop!

11
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,800
Guihong!

12
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,870
Don't hit him!

13
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,360
Wait.

14
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,770
W-Who exactly is he?

15
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,380
The Scout of Qianyu Army Sixth Battalion.

16
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,370
Lu Yi.

17
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,079
No, no, stop!

18
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,310
Wait, wait, let me think.

19
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,670
Let me remember.

20
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:52,800
You're

21
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,680
the scout who delivered

22
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,010
that distress message.

23
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,360
You're alive?

24
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,200
Two armies crossed blades

25
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,840
and all your comrades died,

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,240
yet you alone survived.

27
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,620
Lu Yi,

28
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,590
you deserted.

29
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,760
You abandoned everyone

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,770
and ran away!

31
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,390
Junior General!

32
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,630
I didn't!

33
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,430
I didn't!

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,960
Twenty thousand lives,

35
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,180

General.

38
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,250
Junior General.

39
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,310
Any news from the Xuanjia Army?

40
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,800
It's been two days and nights,

41
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,310
and even Lu Yi

42
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,840
has disappeared without a trace.

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,770
The Xuanjia Army

44
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,890
probably won't come anymore.

45
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,160
You said the Xuanjia Army would come
to our rescue,

46
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,220
and told us to wait.

47
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,600
We've waited for two days,

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,730
and what have we got?

49
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,959
Say something!

50
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,240
Nan Heng is the one

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,250
who selfishly

52
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,240
refused to help us.

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Is this the Junior General's fault?

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,920
If he hadn’t pinned his hopes
on that
God of Death,

55
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,750
we could have tried other tactics
long ago!

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,310
We wouldn’t have been besieged like this!

57
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,040
Enough!

58
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,070
The battle is imminent,

59
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,470
yet you're speaking such defeatist words.

60
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,200
If reinforcements come,

61
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,270
we'll fight together against our enemy.

62
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,680
If reinforcements don't come,

63
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,950
what would stop us Qianyu Army

64
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,140
from fighting to the very last man?

65
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,270
Father,

66
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,770
I've made my decision.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,870
Tonight I'll lead men into the enemy's
camp

68
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,510
to assassinate Fang Shiming.

69
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,480
If we succeed,

70
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
the Heyuan forces will surely fall into
chaos.

71
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,900
The Qianyu Army

72
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,430
can then seize this opportunity

73
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,630
to turn the tide of battle in one stroke.

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,480
Good!

75
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,070
Kill them!

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,650
Twenty thousand Qianyu soldiers

77
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,600
died bearing the shame of defeat,

78
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,050
and their injustice has yet to be cleared
to this day.

79
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,190
All this happened

80
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,040
because Nan Heng didn't send troops to help

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,640
during the Pingrong Battle.

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,510
Lu Yi,

83
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,600
tell me,

84
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,280
that letter I passed to you,

85
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,870
did you deliver it or not?

86
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,970
Was it Nan Heng

87
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,690
who caused my father's death?

88
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
You're suddenly mute now?

89
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,310
Say something!

90
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,090
Junior General,

91
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,870
I've failed you

92
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,920
and the Old General.

93
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,510
All of this

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,480
was forced upon me by Nan Heng.

95
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,600
He received the letter.

96
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,100
He received the letter.

97
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,920
I knew it,

98
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,400
he should have sent troops.

99
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,970
Why didn't you speak up earlier?

100
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,970
Where were you when the Ministry of War
was investigating?

101
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,390
Where were you when the Qianyu Army

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,360
was facing disaster?

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,430
It's useless.

104
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,070
Nan Heng's power is overwhelming.

105
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,950
It's not that I didn't want to speak up,

106
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,390
I simply couldn't.

107
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,420
That day,

108
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,550
when I traveled a hundred li at night to
reach Youcheng,

109
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,550
he had already planned everything.

110
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,830
He deliberately wanted those 20,000 troops
dead.

111
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,159
Only this way

112
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
could he alone

113
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,820
claim all the battle honours.

114
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,280
What happened after that?

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,840
Since you made it to the capital,

116
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,370
you must've had countless chances to
find me.

117
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,680
Where did this courtyard come from?

118
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
And how did you get this business?

119
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,430
He bought you off,

120
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,490
didn't he?

121
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,880
Junior General,

122
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,830
I'm useless.

123
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,630
Nan Heng took away my wife and children.

124
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,510
I... I truly had no choice.

125
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,600
I deserve to die.

126
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,510
I'm not human.

127
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,630
Just kill me.

128
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,680
He...

129
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,160
Don't! Don't!

130
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,190
How could the Qianyu Army

131
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,480
have such a servile coward like you!

132
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,800
Guihong!

133
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,600
Let me kill him!

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:32,909
Calm down!

135
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,870
Let me kill him!

136
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,080
Listen to me, listen.

137
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,150
Spare his life.

138
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,270
If what he says is true,

139
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,440
you should keep him alive

140
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,039
to testify against Nan Heng.

141
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,930
If the Junior General could trust me
once more,

142
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,510
give me eight hours.

143
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,070
Let me make arrangements for my family,

144
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,440
and I'll testify against Nan Heng.

145
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,100
I'll be waiting for you, General,

146
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,050
at the Jiangsong Forest outside the city,

147
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,540

[Qianyu Mansion]

149
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,980
These are all the files

150
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,050
from the Qianyu Army regarding
the Pingrong Battle.

151
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,390
Now we have a witness too.

152
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,550
Once we get Lu Yi's testimony,

153
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,530
we can convict Nan Heng.

154
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Guihong,

155
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,910
although I'm a bit slow-witted,

156
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,000
I've been thinking about this.

157
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,240
Don't you find Lu Yi's appearance

158
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,510
rather sudden?

159
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,080
Should we investigate him further?

160
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
We should at least find out

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
where he's been staying

162
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,630
since returning from Pingrong,

163
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,000
right?

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,320
And who he's met with?

165
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,080
What if

166
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,790
he did not telling the truth today?

167
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,320
The Qianyu Army never lies.

168

Your Highness doesn't know what I went
through in that battle,

169
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,930
nor could you possibly understand what

170
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,580
my actions now truly mean.

171
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,550
Guihong,

172
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,630
I understand.

173
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,080
Clearing the Qianyu Army's name

174
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,120
means more to you than anything.

175
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,840
Your Highness need not involve yourself
in this matter.

176
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,300
Once I've cleared the name

177
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,320
of my father and the Qianyu heroes,

178
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,930
and eliminated Nan Heng and his faction,

Your Highness can look forward to
securing the throne.

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,200
Why is there no sign of anyone?

193
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,000
Wait.

194
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,750
Do you think

195
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,840
he changed his mind?

196
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,040
Wait.

197
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Wait, wait for me!

198
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,270
Who's that person?

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,720
Something's wrong.

200
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,360
Retreat.

201
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,640
What are you all doing here?

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,320
G-Guihong.

203
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,590
A dead body!

204
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
Be careful.

205
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,240
Why did you kill Lu Yi?

206
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,030
Boss,

207
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,480
I've told you many times,

208
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,150
we don't know any Lu Jia or Lu Yi,

209
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,510
we were just passing by.

210
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,870
He was already dead when we passed by.

211
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,240
Even if you're blind,

212
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,320
your ears are working, aren't they?

213
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,780
I'll ask you one last time.

214
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,390
Did Nan Heng order you two

215
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,670
to kill him to silence him?

216
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,030
Enough with this nonsense.

217
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,360
What do others have to do with this?

218
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,440
If you want to fight,

219
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,240
do it now,

220
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,600
Quit acting like a big shot.

221
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,630
Cut the crap.

222
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,390
General,

223
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,710
these two are close friends with Nan Heng,

224
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,940
yet they're still acting clueless.

225
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,280
I think, like Shangguan He,

226
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,720
they'll be unwilling to testify for us.

227
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
We might as well kill them.

228
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:47,960
No,

229
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,240
we need them alive as witnesses.

230
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,860
Behind the Pingrong Battle

231
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,750
are the lives of people from three cities

232
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,720
and 20,000 Qianyu Army soldiers.

233
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,150
This time,

234
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,640
I won't let Nan Heng off easily

235
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,240
like I did with the Jiangnan case.

236
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,220
I spit on you!

237
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,030
So you want us to give false testimony?

238
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,280
Keep dreaming.

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,870
Those 20,000 dead Qianyu soldiers

240
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,120
had the worst luck having a treacherous
person like you

241
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,010
as their general.

242
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,420
What are you doing?

243
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,070
People who disrespect the Qianyu Army,

244
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,110
die.

245
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,620
Let him go!

246
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,790
Use these on them

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,910
one by one, properly.

248
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,440
At the Three Bureaus' Joint Interrogation,

249
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,170
I will make them confess everything

250
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,130
in front of Nan Heng.

251
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,320
Guihong.

252
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,630
Guihong.

253
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
What if Yunlong and Shanhu aren't lying?

254
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
What if they really didn't kill him?

255
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,430
Who killed Lu Yi doesn't matter.

256
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,700
What matters is that I need witnesses

257
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,090
to convince Your Majesty

258
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,590
that Nan Heng killed the messenger that day,

259
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,550
planting the seed of doubt.

260
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,240
This way,

261
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,220
only will Your Majesty believe

262
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,550
that all the crimes of the Pingrong Battle

263
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,510
were planned by Nan Heng.

264
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,120
So...

265
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,270
The reason you tortured them

266
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,330
is to force them to incriminate Heng?

267
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,520
The Jiangnan case from three years ago

268
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,550
was reopened by Shangguan He.

269
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,120
Now I have Yunlong and Shanhu in my
custody.

270
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,380
Using the same method,

271
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,690
reopening the Pingrong case

272
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,230
is certainly possible.

273
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,540
Guihong,

274
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,360
you've changed.

275
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,910
You weren't like this before.

276
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,750
You would never torture people for
confessions.

277
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,750
Before, I wasn't betrayed by everyone,

278
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,840
nor did Nan Heng cause the death of my
father and brothers-in-arms.

279
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,750
No, but even so,

280
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,390
you can't become like Nan Heng.

281
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,140
Make them stop for a while.

282
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,840
Your Highness has always been someone

283
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,270
who only knows how to hide behind me,

284
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,130
who talks but doesn't dare to act.

285
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,400
What right do you have to lecture me?

286
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,300
I...

287
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,740
I've prepared all the documents
related to the Pingrong Battle

288
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,890
and I'll request a Three Bureaus' Joint
Interrogation tomorrow.

289
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,600
Guihong.

290
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:07,910
Guihong.

291
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,600
Now that Chancellor Gao is dead,

292
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,510
Lu Yi is dead,

293
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,550
the letter of appeal is also missing,

294
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,960
all witnesses and evidence are gone.

295
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,910
Besides, the Ministry of Justice is filled
with Nan Heng's people.

296
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,410
Even if you reopen the case,

297
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,500
what different outcome could you possibly
get?

298
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,830
That's where I need Your Highness's help.

299
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,360
What do you need me to do?

300
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,680
Your Highness only needs to truthfully

301
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,910
tell everything you heard and saw

302
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,730
during the meeting with Lu Yi.

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,240
His Majesty trusts Your Highness the most.

304
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,640
If you speak up,

305
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,930
it's as good as having Lu Yi's testimony.

306
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,980
Along with Yunlong and Shanhu

307
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,160
as witnesses to Nan Heng's murder,

308
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,380
it's enough to make him pay for
the tragedy at Pingrong.

309
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,160
What's wrong?

310
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,610
Your Highness is unwilling?

311
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,440
Everything the Qianyu Army and I did,

312
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,640
whether on the battlefield

313
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,720
or at the capital prefecture's office,

314
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,000
all of those efforts

315
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,310
were to pave the way for Your Highness.

316
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,599
I never expected that when the time
has come,

317
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,180
you would be so cowardly.

318
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,069
Guihong,

319
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,440
that's not quite right.

320
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,730
Your fighting on the battlefield

321
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,560
was for the stability of Great Jing.

322
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,690
Your service at the capital prefecture's
office

323
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,080
was for the safety of the people.

324
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,480
How can you say

325
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,640
it was all for me?

326
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,100
Your Highness is different from before
too.

327
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,960
You're starting to lecture me

328
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,350
with your righteous talks.

329
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,110
No.

330
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,440
Don't you hate Nan Heng the most?

331
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,720
Why is it that when it's time to fight
him,

332
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,850
you became a coward.

333
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,900
No, I just think,

334
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
if you use Nan Heng's methods against him,

335
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,260
can such a victory,

336
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,400
really be called winning?

337
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,560
When you sit on the throne in the future,

338
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,420
you'll understand that how you win
doesn't matter.

339
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,830
At the Three Bureaus' Joint Interrogation,

340
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,900
I'll take the lead against Nan Heng.

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,720
Your Highness may remain as you are,

342
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,370
hidden behind me,

343
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,860
a clean and pure little prince.

344
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,920
It's just that

345
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,580
you're the only witness who has met Lu Yi,

346
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,710
my only hope to overturn this case.

347
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,000
If you refuse to testify for me,

348
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,850
then from now on,

349
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,300
don't call me your cousin anymore.

350
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,680
I...

351
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,350
Gui...

352
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,680
Let's go.

353
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:55,920
Forgive me, Your Highness.

354
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,480
Forgive me, Your Highness.

355
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,270
This, this...

356
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,170
Quickly back off.

357
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,930
Yes.

358
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,840
My goodness.

359
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,240
Jixiang.

360
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,950
Don't you think Guihong has changed?

361
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,350
He's become

362
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,580
terrifying.

363
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,410
He wasn't like this before.

364
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,190
Since we were children,

365
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,360
he has never yelled at me so fiercely.

366
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,640
Most importantly,

367
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,440
he would never

368
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,040
punish someone without knowing
all the facts.

369
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,510
Why on earth

370
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,310
has he become like this?

371
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,960
Forget it,

372
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,430
you wouldn't understand anyway.

373
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,840
You're all the same,

374
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,840
thinking I'm just a fool who understands
nothing.

375
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,870
If even Guihong can't figure out this
case,

376
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,010
how could I possibly understand it?

377
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,890
Your Highness.

378
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,790
You are His Highness,

379
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
not a fool.

380
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,350
Do whatever you want to do.

381
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,750
Jixiang.

382
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,990
Thank you.

383
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,920
You're right.

384
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,750
Who am I?

385
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,350
I am heaven's chosen one.

386
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,810
I know what to do now.

387
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,780
He is my cousin,

388
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,760
and I simply cannot watch him jump into
the fire pit.

389
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,780
I must pull him back from the edge.

390
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,420
This is my duty

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,160
as heaven's chosen one.

392
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:41,680
Let's go.

393
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,980
What are you doing?

394
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:58,920
Hurry up,

395
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,260
it's your turn.

396
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,980
Miss Song Yiting,

397
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,900
I was too keen with my agreement earlier.

398
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,530
You're the remarkable woman who can

399
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,160
paint 73 drawings in just three days.

400
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm just a useless person.

401
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,110
Playing chess for 12 hours straight,

402
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,950
I really can't take it.

403
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,610
Since you're aware that you're useless,

404
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,540
you should stop talking nonsense.

405
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
With your natural talent,

406
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,720
at your grown age,

407
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,270
your chess skills remain so poor.

408
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:37,530
That simply comes down to your laziness.

409
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,020
Since you've entered the Song Residence,

410
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
you should be strict with yourself.

411
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,160
Hurry up.

412
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,350
Yiting,

413
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,510
there's something I want to say...

414
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,160
Speak.

415
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,350
Not everyone truly has

416
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,880
perseverance and determination like yours.

417
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,310
I don't care whether others have it,

418
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,200
but you must.

419
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,270
I'm just a useless wanderer

420
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,200
with no ambition for power or position.

421
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,640
Why am I working so hard

422
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,680
to practice chess with you?

423
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,830
What’s the point?

424
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,000
It may seem meaningless now,

425
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,070
but what about when you get married?

426
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,680
When husband and wife play chess together,

427
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,590
if they aren't evenly matched,

428
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,050
where's the fun in that?

429
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,160
Wait, why are you still thinking about
this?

430
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,680
I've always been alone,

431
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,740
marriage isn't...

432
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,680
Mr. Li,

433
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,410
don't speak so definitively.

434
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,750
Time reveals a person's true heart,

435
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,880
and feelings develop with companionship.

436
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
The moment you met me,

437
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,160
you've already lost.

438
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,950
Yinzhu,

439
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,330
bring my qin.

440
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:47,940
Yes.

441
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,200
There's even music?

442
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,040
[Wang Family Cheese]

443
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,400
It's quite fresh.

444
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,380
Yes,

445
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,110
take your time picking them.

446
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,630
Chancellor.

447
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,160
Come here.

448
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,370
Have some melon.

449
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,030
Reporting to Chancellor,

450
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,030
Lu Yi is dead.

451
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,480
Those two from Waning River Crescent

452
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,560
were also lured to the scene as planned.

453
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Chu Guihong

454
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,650
has now taken the bait

455
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,830
and will surely investigate thoroughly.

456
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,920
However, Chancellor,

457
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,050
there's one thing I don't understand.

458
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,790
If you just wanted to use Chu Guihong

459
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,080
to eliminate His Highness,

460
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,950
why didn't you let me kill him

461
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
on the night we killed the Lady Song?

462
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:27,560
Heng rarely spoke as a child.

463
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,560
Every year, at the turn of spring to
summer,

464
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,110
I would always find excuses

465
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,350
to bring him home from the palace

466
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,750
and serve him melons chilled in well
water.

467
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,760
Back then, he asked me a question.

468
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,510
He said,

469
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,520
"Humans have parents, do plants have
them too?

470
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,200
If they do, how can we eat them?"

471
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,620
They say a child's character is set by
age three.

472
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,510
If Heng could feel such compassion

473
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,510
for a mere melon,

474
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,370
how could he ever rule as emperor?

475
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,790
Sit.

476
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,260
Yes.

477
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,070
That's when I understood.

478
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,000
If he were to shoulder the responsibility
of ruling Great Jing

479
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,920
beyond scholarly and military skills,

480
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,720
the more important trait to have

481
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,650
is ruthlessness.

482
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,960
At the pinnacle of power,

483
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
one must be solitary.

484
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,550
Without everyone betraying and abandoning
him,

485
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,240
how could he truly stand alone

486
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,840
and be the ruler of the realm?

487
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,610
Everything I've orchestrated

488
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,340
is for Heng,

489
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,680
for the High family,

490
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,150
and ultimately for the empire.

491
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,750
Even though I saved your life,

492
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,980
[Dream Edition Beanbag Chair]
[Dream Edition Gua Sha Tool]

493
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,830
our relationship

494
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,920
is just casual friends at best.

495
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,030
Hiding from Yiting at my place,

496
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,490
don't you think that's a bit
inappropriate?

497
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,840
Your sister is too draining.

498
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,440
Have you ever seen a chess match that lasts
from dawn till dusk?

499
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,390
Have you seen hands blistered
from playing qin?

500
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,160
No matter how hard Yiting pushes you,

501
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,550
it's for your own good.

502
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,330
She's motivating you.

503
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,750
Besides,

504
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,970
she's paying you,

505
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,310
providing food, a place to stay,

506
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,230
and education.

507
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,760
Think about your Chief, Nan Heng.

508
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,720
Following him,

509
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,750
you have to live rough,

510
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,510
never knowing if you'd survive another
day.

511
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,700
Compare the two.

512
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,910
Just be grateful.

513
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,410
Grateful?

514
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:43,400
Your little sister tirelessly pursues art
day and night.

515
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,070
And your Chief orchestrate political
schemes

516
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,000
down to the second.

517
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,750
Your sister paints 80 masterpieces a day,

518
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,920
wearing her brush down to the nub.

519
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
Your chief reads 80 military manuals
a night,

520
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
nearly going blind from it.

521
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,550
How could my Chief compare to your sister?

522
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,920
She’s the most relentless person in
all of history.

523
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,510
How could my sister compare to your Chief?

524
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:59,170
He’s the most competitive person in
Great Jing.

525
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,900
They're pretty much the same.

526
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,750
A pair of geniuses indeed.

527
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,240
We just want an easy life,

528
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,680
to enjoy some comfort.

529
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,480
Why is that so difficult?

530
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,050
Tell me about it.

531
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,200
If I had known,

532
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,750
I would have given up martial arts for
academics

533
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:17,070
and become a top scholar,

534
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,550
rather than falling victim to your sister
today.

535
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,730
Then leave.

536
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,920
You keep saying you don't want this,

537
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,750
yet you're still staying at the
Song Residence.

538
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,000
Don't tell me

539
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,270
you're staying for my sister's salary.

540
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,760
Do you think that's possible?

541
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,160
Then what's the problem?

542
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,250
You follow Yiting around all day,

543
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,890
but refuse to admit you like her,

544
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,470
you're quite something.

545
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,310
My lady,

546
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,000
isn't this all for your sake?

547
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,790
What do you mean?

548
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,720
Look.

549
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,750
One assassination attempt has the entire
Waning River Crescent community

550
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,200
out hunting for assassins.

551
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,160
Fugui searched through so many records
that he's going bald.

552
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,400
The key is that

553
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,590
I,

554
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,790
a renowned hero of the jianghu,

555
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,750
unparalleled, charming and elegant,

556
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:02,550
have now been reduced

557
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,810
to a mere household guard because of you.

558
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,400
You mean,

559
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,010
Nan Heng sent you here?

560
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,510
What else?

561
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,100
Why is it that in your love story,

562
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,830
I'm always the one who suffers?

563
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,390
Look.

564
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,250
You and I,

565
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,880
we're both laid-back people,

566
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,440
with no grand ambitions.

567
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,890
Don't we just want a peaceful, comfortable
life?

568
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,170
But if, in your whole life,

569
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,440
you never meet even one or two people

570
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,170
worth risking everything for,

571
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,770
and you just merely exist,

572
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,930
can you say you’ve truly lived?

573
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,450
But what if taking risks

574
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,610
endangers your family's lives?

575
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,100
If I don't leave soon,

576
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,570
what comes next

577
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,540
is a wedding day disaster with the three
of us stabbing each other.

578
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,760
Let me ask you.

579
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,110
Can you truly

580
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:10,740
control what your heart wants?

581
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,550
Nonsense!

582
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,750
The records in the Ministry of War

583
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,480
were all recorded by the Director,
Vice Minister

584
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,270
and myself

585
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,480
through multiple levels of confirmation.

586
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
How can they be changed simply as you
wish?

587
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,030
What's recorded in those files

588
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,510
is merely Nan Heng's side of the story.

589
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,920
Now I want to correct it,

590
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,750
why can't I?

591
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,720
You mentioned a scout delivering a letter

592
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,550
to request help from the Xuanjia Army.

593
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,510
Apart from you and your confidants,

594
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,400
no one can testify to it.

595
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,880
Isn't that also one-sided?

596
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,040
As an official of Great Jing,

597
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,070
how can you use your position for personal
vendettas?

598
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,350
Does being a Great Jing official

599
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,270
mean submitting to Nan Heng's tyranny?

600
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,920
You!

601
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,750
Sir, you have no ties to the Chu family.

602
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,160
If you're unwilling to help clear the name
of my father

603
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,020
and the late Qianyu Army, so be it.

604
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,510
I only ask that

605
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,830
you hand over all the files to me.

606
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,030
I'll bear

607
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:00,970
all consequences myself.

608
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,330
Stop this madness!

609
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,750
Stop!

610
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,100
I said, stop!

611
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,880
You!

612
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,040
Stop!

613
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,160
[Good Virtues]

614
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,880
Chu Guihong,

615
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,730
my father told you to stop.

616
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,130
Didn't you hear him?

617
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,400
Yimeng!

618
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,000
Are you siding with Nan Heng again?

619
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,960
I'm not taking anyone's side.

620
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,760
I just don't want our Song family

621
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,720
be dragged into this mess between
you and Nan Heng.

622
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,240
You claim not to take sides,

623
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,570
yet time and again you stand with him

624
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,350
against me.

625
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,450
Why is that?

626
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,770
Three months ago,

627
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,490
it was you who encouraged me to
pull myself together.

628
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,180
It was Mr. Song who advised me to
investigate the Waning River Crescent.

629
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,440
Weren't you both supporting me then?

630
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,910
Why...

631
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,200
Why now, when I only want to

632
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,660
reveal the truth about the Pingrong
Battle,

633
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,920
to bring Nan Heng, who caused

634
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,790
the death of 20,000 men, to justice,

635
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,200
you wouldn't help me?

636
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,400
Why are you shouting?

637
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Chu Guihong!

638
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,400
20,000 Qianyu soldiers died for their
country.

639
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,990
What killed them might have been fate,

640
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,110
might have been war,

641
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,830
might even have been your own helplessness
as their commander,

642
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,740
but why must it only be Nan Heng?

643
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,520
You're pushing all the blame

644
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,110
onto him alone

645
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,920
just because you want to escape
responsibility,

646
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,250
not because of the truth you claim to
seek.

647
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,880
Yimeng!

648
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,590
How can you say that?

649
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,180
What have I done wrong?

650
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,200
What have I done wrong?

651
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,030
Enough!

652
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,170
Yimeng,

653
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,070
stop arguing with him.

654
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,520
No one can wake someone who's
pretending to sleep.

655
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,120
Even the gods can't help him.

656
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,160
General Chu!

657
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,670
The Song family has no intention of
getting involved in this dispute.

658
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,860
The affairs of the Ministry of War

659
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,120
are certainly not for you to meddle with.

660
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,590
Please leave.

661
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,920
What does this mean?

662
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,000
It's Baili Wine.

663
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,480
I'm gifting this to you.

664
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,820
I, uh, have

665
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,120
something to ask you.

666
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,400
Sit.

667
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,550
Well,

668
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,590
about

669
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,510
Chancellor Gao's death,

670
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,790
was it you who did it?

671
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,570
See, you're always like this.

672
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,640
It's simply a "yes" or a "no."

673
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,510
Is it so hard to give me an answer?

674
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,750
Petroleum

675
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,070
and thunder bombs

676
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,210
are all common military items.

677
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,920
Trying to frame me

678
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,650
with such despicable methods.

679
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,240
Whether you and Chu Guihong

680
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,590
are investigators

681
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,880
or the ones framing me,

682
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,739
I have no patience left to waste words
with you anymore.

683
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,260
What about Lu Yi?

684
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,239
Did you send someone to kill Lu Yi?

685
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,320
Who is Lu Yi?

686
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,070
The scout who Guihong sent

687
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,030
to deliver the request for reinforcements
to you,

688
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,880
Lu Yi.

689
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,580
I've told you so many times,

690
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,280
I never received any request for
reinforcements.

691
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,190
That was just an excuse Chu Guihong
made up

692
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,590
to cover his own failure.

693
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,590
How is that possible?

694
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,880
Chancellor Gao told this to Guihong

695
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,800
with his dying breath.

696
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,070
How could that be false?

697
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,130
Wait, aren't you two on the same side?

698
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,810
What did Chancellor Gao tell Chu Guihong?

699
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,929
I never thought this day would come.

700
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:49,120
You actually visited us voluntarily.

701
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,840
It must be timely fate.

702
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,940
Remember when we first met in the palace,

703
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,680
how glorious you were, Jixiang.

704
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,920
Relying on His Majesty's favor toward
the Eighteenth Prince,

705
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,980
you always had the upper hand over me.

706
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,900
What a pity,

707
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,760
no flower blooms forever.

708
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,230
You went to great lengths to deal with
our Seventh Prince,

709
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,150
but in the end,

710
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,280
Waning River Crescent is still ours.

711
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,220
Regret it now?

712
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,320
I told you long ago,

713
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,110
choosing the right master is most crucial.

714
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
For old times' sake,

715
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,510
if you beg me now,

716
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,360
I might arrange for you

717
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,920
to serve in our ministry.

718
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,320
Are you talking to me?

719
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:43,050
I didn't say anything.

720
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,510
Using the conflict between Chu Guihong
and I

721
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,550
to set up such a flawless,

722
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,670
scheme.

723
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,320
What a brilliant move.

724
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,400
You mean

725
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,440
someone is plotting against you?

726
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,700
You came to Waning River Crescent today
just to ask these questions?

727
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
And if I answer,

728
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,630
you'd believe me?

729
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,510
I would.

730
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,950
Actually, I came here today

731
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,950
because I also need a favor from you.

732
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:20,840
Speak.

733
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,150
Um...

734
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,360
Well...

735
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,510
Could you

736
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,840
take the blame

737
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,000
for the Pingrong Battle?

738
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,670
I...

739
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,960
No, no, don't be quick to scold me.

740
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,840
I know this request is very disrespectful.

741
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,320
But Guihong is now obsessed

742
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
with bringing you down.

743
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,480
He's being led by the nose and manipulated

744
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,440
by the person behind the scenes,

745
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,710
I'm afraid if this continues,

746
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,880
something terrible will happen.

747
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,000
Whether he's obsessed or not,

748
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,500
what does it have to do with me?

749
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,300
How can you say it's not related?

750
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,360
Heng, listen.

751
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,110
If you just admit to this crime,

752
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,150
so Guihong can let go of this matter,

753
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,870
I will now...

754
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,640
I will immediately...

755
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,080
I will instantly give up the throne
to you.

756
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,940
What do you say?

757
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,700
You really do care deeply for him.

758
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,600
Of course.

759
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,760
He's my only brother,

760
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,280
I have to protect him.

761
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,840
[Clear Waters, Graceful Woods]

762
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,070
Heng, Heng, listen.

763
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,590
I can make a written promise before
Father,

764
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,390
and I'll never go back on my word.

765
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,880
No, no, no.

766
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,190
Heng, listen to me, listen.

767
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,020
Here's the thing.

768
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,360
Once you're on the throne,

769
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,840
you'll have control over everything.

770
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,760
Even if you did harm someone in the
Pingrong Battle,

771
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,440
there won't be any consequences.

772
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,510
Do you even understand what you're saying?

773
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,710
I do, I do.

774
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,890
Look, Heng,

775
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,200
for the sake ur sharing the same father,

776
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,860
just this once.

777
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,710
Please?

778
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:52,110
I'm begging you, isn't that enough?

779
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,970
Didn't you say he's your only brother?

780
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,890
Nan Rui,

781
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,840
do you even understand the difference in

782
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,070
degrees of closeness between insiders
and outsiders?

783
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:04,880
I...

784
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,660
I know I'm foolish,

785
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,710
but at this point,

786
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,550
even a fool should understand.

787
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,720
The throne is secondary,

788
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,240
brotherhood is primary.

789
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,650
I know I can't compete with you.

790
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,210
But losing the throne doesn't matter.

791
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,110
If I lose Guihong,

792
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,320
then I truly have nothing left.

793
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,950
The luckiest thing happened to Chu Guihong

794
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:40,600
is having such a foolish brother like you.

795
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,590
I...

796
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,990
The matter of succession

797
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,210
isn't something you and I can decide.

798
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,120
Furthermore,

799
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,510
I will never admit

800
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,510
to something I didn't do.

801
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,150
-I...
-Fugui.

802
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,960
Escort the Eighteenth Prince.

803
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,760
Yes.

804
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,610
Eighteenth Prince,

805
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,690
this way please.

806
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Father,

807
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,770
Is the Three Bureaus' Joint Interrogation

808
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,030
really such a big deal?

809
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,070
The Seventh Prince holds royal status.

810
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,320
The Pingrong Battle

811
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,720
is a major case involving the deaths of
20,000 soldiers.

812
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,150
The trial must be jointly handled by the
Ministry of Justice,

813
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,880
the Court of Judicial Review, and
the Censorate,

814
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,880
to be official.

815
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,170
Isn't the Minister of Justice Yan Yi

816
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,320
one of Nan Heng's people?

817
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,040
Not only that,

818
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,190
both the Censorate and the Court of
Judicial Review

819
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,120
are dominated by civil officials,

820
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,280
and Chancellor Gao has long controlled

821
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,410
the civil official factions at court.

822
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,850
I remember now,

823
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,120
that Yao Qian from the Censorate

824
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,970
is also Nan Heng's people.

825
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,640
Now that Chancellor Gao is dead,

826
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,180
all these forces

827
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,560
have fallen into the Seventh Prince's hands.

828
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,560
That's why

829
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:19,840
Chu Guihong chose to delve into the
war records.

830
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,230
In that case,

831
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,710
Father,

832
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:28,710
if these three departments investigate
Nan Heng,

833
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,890
he...

834
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,440
Should be fine, right?

835
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,640
You're still thinking too simply.

836
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,350
All government offices face south,

837
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,110
and in their halls

838
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,800
hang signs of the sun and moon,

839
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,460
symbolizing justice for all.

840
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,180
But for justice to shine forth,

841
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,880
it depends on whether the sun and moon
above

842
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,360
provide any light at all.

843
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,330
What the Seventh Prince faces now

844
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:58,110
is precisely dark clouds blocking the sun

845
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,800
and the moon sinking below the horizon.
