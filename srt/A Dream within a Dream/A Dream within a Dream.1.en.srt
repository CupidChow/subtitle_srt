00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,830
[Nan Feng]

190
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,200
Well...

191
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
the title's not quite right.

192
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,720
Why is it called "A Dream of Qingning?"

193
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,640
[Agent] [Song Xiaoyu]

194
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,790
It has nothing to do

195
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,030
[A Dream of Qingning]

196
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,120
with our male lead, Nan Heng.

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,510
The font is wrong too.

198
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,500
[Nan Feng as Nan Heng]

199
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,720
Songti

200
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,790
kills the vibe instantly.

201
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,510
You should bold it and make it bigger.

202
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,390
Also…

203
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,790
When was the poster shot?

204
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,300
Why didn't they inform us?

205
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,350
Don't worry. We'll shoot later.

206
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,000
Shut up. Stop talking.

207
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,840
Just listen.

208
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,070
[Agent]

209
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,150
Fake death scenes
need to be handled carefully too.

210
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,360
In this business,

211
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,510
that kind of stuff messes

212
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,270
with your luck.

213
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,840
Next, let's talk about perks.

214
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,960
Nan Feng is a little special.

215
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,440
He needs 19 staff.

216
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,030
One driver. Two personal assistants.

217
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,870
Four work assistants. Six bodyguards.

218
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,360
Two agents. Two personal stylists.

219
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,200
And one…

220
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,840
And one

221
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,960
set photographer.

222
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,270
And also a chef
who can cook French cuisine.

223
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,910
Yes.

224
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,320
How did you know?

225
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,500
His reputation precedes him.

226
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,840
Actually,

227
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,360
Nan Feng doesn't care about any of that.

228
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,120
But as his agent,

229
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,670
I need to think things through.

230
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,000
You all know how powerful

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,390
Feng's fans,

232
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,320
Pumpkins, are.

233
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,270
When it comes to flooding feeds
and controlling the narrative,

234
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,720
[Acting all high and mighty]

235
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,240
he's never lost.

236
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,000
Since we've cleared
enough time in his schedule for this show,

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,720
we have to make sure
the quality is up to par.

238
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,510
Actors need good roles,

239
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,000
but roles need good actors just as much.

240
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,550
The fans want to see their idol

241
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,750
get the treatment he deserves.

242
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,720
I don't want to see

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,200
everyone here and the studio

244
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,240
getting flamed online later.

245
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,030
Fine.

246
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,520
We'll revise the script.

247
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,870
No wire work.

248
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,130
If there's a cliff-jumping scene,

249
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,550
you'll do it.

250
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,790
If there's a death scene, I'll do it.

251
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,160
This drama

252
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,570
has other cast members.

253
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,630
Why don't we hear what they think?

254
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,200
Need a hand?

255
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,870
You got it?

256
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,870
It's so kind of you.

257
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,230
Really appreciate it.

258
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm good with anything.

259
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,910
Well,

260
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,910
you guys know more
about scripts than I do.

261
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,270
I'll go with whatever you decide.

262
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,200
You're so nice.

263
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,670
What a good actor.

264
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,630
Thank you. Thank you.

265
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,630
How about Xiaoyu?

266
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,870
Director, guys,

267
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,190
this is

268
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,630
my first time
playing such an important role.

269
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,390
My acting is not that great,

270
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,750
and there are

271
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,320
a ton of lines.

272
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,870
How about this?

273
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,670
As soon as I step out of the palanquin,

274
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,870
I faint.

275
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,750
No lines.

276
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,310
I don't have to say a word.

277
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,910
She's just kidding.

278
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,550
I'm serious.

279
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,480
I actually think

280
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,360
that suits her character.

281
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,870
Hold on, hold on.

282
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,960
Ms. Na, Xiaoyu,

283
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,930
we can't do that.

284
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,080
This scene is supposed to show

285
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,560
the love triangle
among these three characters.

286
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,810
If you faint…

287
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,400
Right. The love triangle is important.

288
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,360
How about this?

289
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,550
I

290
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,950
step out of the palanquin

291
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,320
and faint right at Feng's feet.

292
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,200
Feng, you don't even have to look at me.

293
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,120
Just kick me straight over

294
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,960
to Liangchen.

295
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,390
How's that, Mr. Bei?

296
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,350
A love triangle.

297
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,360
Fine.

298
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,200
Let's kick it into a love triangle.

299
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,320
Alright?

300
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,270
It's decided.

301
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,240
Revise the script.

302
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,030
Okay?

303
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,510
It's getting late.

304
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,910
We'll stop here for today

305
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,720
and pick up again tomorrow.

306
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,390
Thank you, Director.

307
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:31,670
Thank you.

308
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,440
Thank you, Director.

309
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,930
Thank you.

310
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,670
Thank you, Director. Thank you, everyone.

311
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,160
[Nan Feng]

312
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,870
Thank you, Director.

313
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,440
Collect your things.

314
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,650
-Bye, Director.
-Bye.

315
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,400
Oh my god.

316
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,120
So high-maintenance.

317
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,320
Collect your things.

318
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,240
Goodbye, Director.

319
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,870
Feng, fly free!

320
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,140
Pumpkins will always be by your side!

321
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,030
Flawless skin, heart-shaped lips,

322
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,670
and legs for days!

323
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,960
"A Dream of Qingning" shines bright!

324
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,080
Not loving Feng just ain't right!

325
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,550
Flawless skin, heart-shaped lips,

326
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,000
and legs for days!

327
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,030
Feng, fly free!

328
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,300
Pumpkins will always be by your side!

329
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,510
Being famous is nice.

330
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,470
Fans are always waiting for him.

331
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,510
He doesn't even have to speak for himself.

332
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,480
His agent, Ms. Na,

333
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,720
is like a machine gun.

334
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,320
When she talks,
all I hear is rat-tat-tat-tat.

335
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,030
If you ask me,

336
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,670
the most exhausting thing he did today

337
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,870
was sit there all afternoon

338
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,670
fiddling with his prayer beads.

339
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,840
Are you jealous?

340
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,160
Do you want to be famous too?

341
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,340
Then try harder!

342
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,870
I told you to dress in something bright

343
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,440
to grab a bit of his spotlight.

344
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,600
Look at you.

345
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,440
Tell me,

346
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,300
who's gonna take pictures of you?

347
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,270
Didn't you see

348
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,360
the dress the company prepared for me?

349
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,440
Low-cut.

350
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,510
Super short.

351
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,550
How was I supposed to wear that?

352
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,200
If I did,

353
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,030
his Pumpkins would tear me apart.

354
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,790
Girl,

355
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,320
as a Z-list actress,

356
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,870
you have to ride someone else's wave.

357
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,440
Selling the ship?

358
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,960
You won't do it.

359
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,390
On-set photos?

360
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,960
You won't take any.

361
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,840
Last month,

362
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,150
I fought so hard
to land you a variety show.

363
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,000
And what did you do?

364
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,960
You didn't

365
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,870
steal the spotlight
or build a persona.

366
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,120
You literally fell asleep in the show!

367
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,550
Wasn't it a "slow-life" reality show?

368
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,210
Only you took that literally.

369
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,510
No one else did.

370
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,150
Miss Song, Song Xiaoyu,

371
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,670
if you don't wanna stay in this business,

372
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,600
then just quit.

373
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,720
Don't keep dragging down

374
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,390
my KPIs every month

375
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,920
and make me starve with you!

376
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:34,480

Nan Heng!

561
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,960
You once said

562
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,350
you owe me too much in this life.

563

Are you okay?

566
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,080
So it was all fake

from beginning to end.

568
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,590
What kind of plot is this?

569
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,880
Nan Heng is absolute scum!

570
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,900
The storyline makes no sense.

571
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,950
And the female lead is such an idiot.

572
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,530
How am I supposed to act?

576
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,370
and is turned into a living corpse?

578
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,430
can you please write
like a normal human being?

What's going on?

580
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,960
Why can't I move?

581
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,330
This...

582
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,680
What is this place?

Wait.

584
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,540
When did my home decoration

585
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,550
turn into neo-Chinese style?

586
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,970
Where's my manicure?

587
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,550
Oh my god.

588
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:09,080
A-Am I dreaming?

589
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,420
Or did I sleepwalk straight onto the set?

590
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,440
Wake up.

591
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,640
Wake up.

What's going on?

598

There's so much gold in this dream.

599
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,700
I need to sleep a little longer.

600
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,830
It's not that I don't want to wake up.

601
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,810
These gold ingots are just too tempting.

602
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,720
Imagine this:

603
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,440

surrounded by piles of gold and jewelry.

606
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm so happy.

607
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,390
This has to be a dream.

608
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,400
Definitely a dream.
