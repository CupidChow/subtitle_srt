[A Dream Within A Dream]

2
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,030
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,240
Then let's not talk about that.

4
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,120
Ten years ago,
in the full-scale war with Dongshuo,

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,510
5,000 soldiers from the Xuanjia Army

6
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,590
faced 40,000 elite soldiers from Dongshuo.

7
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,280
If Nan Heng hadn't charged into battle

8
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,430
and taken the enemy commander's head,

9
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,840
how else could we have turned the tide
after three months of losses

10
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,040
and won ten years of peace at the border?

11
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,800
What's wrong?

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,840
Mr. Li, listen to yourself.

13
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,560
What do you mean?

14
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,680
How reckless Nan Heng was!

15
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,079
5,000 against 40,000.

16
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,190
What was he thinking?

17
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,360
Instead of staying in the back
and commanding the troops,

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,800
he, the commander,
ran straight to the front lines

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
to steal the spotlight.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Let me tell you, Mr. Li.

21
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,870
Nan Heng…

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,310
He, he...

23
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,280
he might've had a few screws loose.

24
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,360
You're right.

25
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,360
He's definitely got a few screws loose.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,960
Otherwise, why would I
be telling you all this?

27
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,920
Mr. Li, what did you say?

28
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,840
Nothing.

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,530
I'm just saying,

30
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,079
everyone else is forgivable,

31
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,690
and Nan Heng is always the one to blame.

32
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,480
Miss Song, you really
see people for who they are.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
You're so…

34
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,970
So sharp and insightful.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I saw straight through Nan Heng,

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,680
didn't I?

37
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,010
I already know all that.

38
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,870
Let me put it this way, Mr. Li.

39
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,950
In this world,

40
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,070
no one knows Nan Heng

41
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,400
better than I do.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No.

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,360
There's one more person now.

44
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,430
Guess who it is.

45
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,310
I won't guess.

46
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,140
We've arrived at the Song Residence.

47
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,610
Goodbye forever.

48
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,840
Mr. Li.

49
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,150
Mr. Li, don't go.

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,300
Think about what I said.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,730
Come find me
when you've made up your mind!

52
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,150
Ambitious and ruthless.

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,860
Cruel and heartless.

54
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,540
Capable of any evil.

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,440
Framed loyal officials

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,360
and even harmed innocent women.

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,430
In that wicked woman's eyes,

58
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,620
I'm so despicable.

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,010
Ambitious, ruthless,

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,190
capable of any evil,
and framed loyal officials.

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,590
That's what everyone says.

62
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,850
I'm already used to it.

63
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,800
But Your Highness,

64
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,660
when have you ever harmed a woman?

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,190
Go to Waning River Crescent.

66
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,590
Bring Shangguan He to me!

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,750
Yes.

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,980
Did I say something wrong again?

69
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,480
In His Highness's eyes,

70
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,079
even that useless
Shangguan is better than me.

71
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,240
It hurts!

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,830
It hurts!

73
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,510
Are you trying to kill me?

74
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,310
Guihong.

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,560
Guihong.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,620
I came as soon as I got the news.

77
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,290
What happened?

78
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,920
Weren't you off fighting bandits?

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,450
How did you end up like this?

80
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,930
Your Highness.

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,000
Waning River Crescent's Hall

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,860
might not be as simple as it looks.

83
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,130
Li Shiliu?

84
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,210
Was he really that Li Shiliu?

85
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,070
My Lady, you're so lucky!

86
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,120
Why?

87
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,630
Is he that famous?

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,630
Of course.

89
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,360
He is

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,390
the number one dream husband,

91
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:58,390
voted by all
the eligible ladies in the capital.

92
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,070
Always neck and neck

93
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,530
with General Chu Guihong.

94
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,680
Rumor has it he's cold and aloof

95
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,240
and rarely shows his face in public.

96
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,040
But today, he actually appeared

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240
and saved you.

98
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,450
You must have been
a loving couple in a past life

99
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,310
and still deeply love each other.

100
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,430
Stop.

101
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,430
You're hopelessly romantic.

102
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,580
I rushed through the script,

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,510
focused only on the main plot,

104
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,250
and totally missed
such a popular character.

105
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,070
Wait, is it possible that

106
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,680
he isn't in the script

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,970
and is actually

108
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,250
a wild card who exists independently?

109
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,940
[Li Shiliu]

110
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,900
[Nan Heng] [Song Yimeng]

111
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,560
What else do you know

112
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,630
about his past?

113
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,000
Tell me everything.

114
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,870
What is this?

115
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,480
"Famous Men in the Martial World—
Li Shiliu Edition?"

116
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,870
He even has a biography?

117
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,640
There's stuff like this?

118
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,430
Miss Song sure has a sharp tongue

119
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,290
and a unique way of seeing things.

120
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,310
She made all of His Highness's
heroic deeds

121
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,250
sound utterly worthless.

122
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,310
Nonsense!

123
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,970
His Highness just had a few slip-ups.

124
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,830
Hardly even a handful of them.

125
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,270
He got tricked once by a schemer,

126
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,430
ambushed once by enemy scouts,

127
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,940
and had his supplies stolen once

128
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,340
and burned another time.

129
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,990
They all happened when he was young.

130
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,040
What's that supposed to mean?

131
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,180
Are you saying
His Highness isn't young anymore?

132
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,680
Quit stirring the pot!

133
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,920
His Highness is in his prime.

134
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,390
Sure, he's weathered a bit

135
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,920
and has a few lines on his face,

136
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,750
but he still does 80 push-ups a day!

137
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
Back to the point!

138
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,900
Your Highness.

139
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,950
Mr. Shangguan
knows nothing about politics,

140
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,950
so I must speak plainly.

141
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,159
You've spent years
building Waning River Crescent

142
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,510
to grow your power base in secret,

143
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,830
gather intel, and prepare for the future.

144
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,280
This identity of yours
must be kept secret.

145
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Even if you want to ally with Miss Song

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,360
as Li Shiliu,

147
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,480
there's no guarantee

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,430
she won't uncover
your secrets and plans someday.

149
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,000
If the Eighteenth Prince
and his men find out about this,

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,480
it'll be too late to fix.

151
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,360
Fugui.

152
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,850
There is no free meal in the world.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,630
No risk, no reward.

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,890
Still, His Highness
can't take the risk himself!

155
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,000
Let me ask you.

156
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,190
Do you have a way

157
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,450
to break the rule
Song Yimeng mentioned?

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,720
Since we can't break it, we use it.

159
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,310
Don't forget—

160
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,040
you attacked Chu Guihong tonight.

161
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,100
How are you planning to clean that up?

162
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,650
Why would a man from the martial world

163
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,310
show up just to test out your weapon?

164
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,900
Could it be that

165
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,440
he's after the method of weapon forging?

166
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,360
There's only one person

167
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,920
who cares about that.

168
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,060
So I suspect

169
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,080
Li Shiliu

170
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,270
is most likely working for Nan Heng.

171
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,950
No.

172
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,700
If that's true,

173
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,790
Heng has more cards

174
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,460
up his sleeve than we thought.

175
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,270
And not just that—

176
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,560
the bandit operation
was supposed to be top secret.

177
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,310
But Li Shiliu

178
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,310
acted as if he already knew about it.

179
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,020
Your Highness.

180
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,150
I fear

181
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,600
one of our own

182
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,560
might be Nan Heng's spy.

183
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,630
No way.

184
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,980
Don't scare me like that.

185
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,169
Your Highness, calm down.

186
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,690
It's all Nan Heng's fault.

187
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,520
He's made me so paranoid.

188
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,370
Your Highness.

189
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,440
If Li Shiliu really is Nan Heng's man,

190
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,400
we can't just let him be.

191
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,480
Yeah,

192
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,790
but the problem is, we don't even know

193
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,840
if he's really working for Heng.

194
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,870
I have a plan to find out.

195
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,320
But I'll need you to help me

196
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,390
carry it out.

197
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,120
No way! I object!

198
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,750
His Highness is far too noble

199
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,870
to keep lowering himself

200
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,440
before Song Yimeng.

201
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:19,960
But…

202
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,270
Even if you break the engagement

203
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,150
between Song Yimeng and Chu Guihong,

204
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,480
there's no guarantee
the Song family will side with us.

205
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,320
But if we let the two families get united,

206
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,390
I'm afraid before Chief
gets the method of weapon forging,

207
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,080
he'll have already
lost his shot at the throne.

208
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,510
Will you take responsibility?

209
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,320
I won't just sit back and do nothing.

210
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,150
Your Highness!

211
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,960
Shut up.

212
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,910
But Li Shiliu

213
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,810
is just a wandering swordsman,

214
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,340
while Song Yimeng
is a noble lady from a powerful family.

215
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,800
It's hard to win her heart.

216
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,600
That's why you should get close to her

217
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,960
as a trusted friend.

218
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,360
Chu Guihong is her fiancé.

219
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,160
He won't take that sitting down.

220
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,260
The moment tension starts between them,

221
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,120
a breakup is only a matter of time.

222
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,440
So His Highness has to swallow his pride

223
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,080
and sow discord to ruin their engagement?

224
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,840
Go on.

I think Mr. Li

228
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,200
isn't just a cold-blooded fighter.

229
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,120
He's actually quite kind.

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,270
he's taken in a lot of homeless people.

232

I saw them all tonight.

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,960
They were all very nice.

and the war four years ago—

236
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,240
those tragedies were caused

237
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,930
by Nan Heng's power struggle.

238
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,320
Song Yimeng,

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,590
you're saved.

You're really saved.

You're saved!

242
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,160
Miss, I don't understand what you mean.

243
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,910
How can you not?

244
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,730
Look,

245
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,720
Li Shiliu

246
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,750
founded Waning River Crescent

247
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,580
and took in all those people

248
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,600

249
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,040
because of Nan Heng's sins.

250
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Of course they hate Nan Heng's guts.

251
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,720
No wonder Mr. Li

252
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,310
kept asking me about Nan Heng tonight.

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
So

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,270

The best way to build trust
is through a handwritten letter

00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,810
Interesting.

372
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,740
He thinks he's clever

373
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,130
and even dragged Rui into it.

374
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,780
Are you going?

375
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,450
Yes.

376
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,980
Opportunities like this

377
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,119
don't come again.

378
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,510
After his release from prison,

379
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,160
His Majesty sent
his father's belongings

380
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,640
back to the Qianyu Mansion,

381
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,069
calling it returning them,

382
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,530
but it was actually meant
to intimidate you.

383
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,030
He thinks with that thing in hand,
he'll be unstoppable.

384
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,119
Then I'll make sure he falls
and never gets up.

385
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,200
Looks like Shanhu's thieving skills

386
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,960
will finally come in handy.

387
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,490
Maybe with that thing,

388
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,490
we can uncover
the method of weapon forging.

389
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,790
Wait, what are you talking about?

390
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,390
Can someone explain it to me?

391
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,600
The Qianyu Moon-Cleaving Blade.

392
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,160
What?

393
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,550
This way, please.

394
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,680
Excellent, excellent!

395
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,110
Truly eye-opening!

396
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,470
Come, please.

397
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,030
Excellent, excellent!

398
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,360
Don't be afraid.

399
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,550
Don't be afraid.

400
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,760
Sir.

401
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,400
Leave.

402
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,910
Are you deaf?

403
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,230
He asked you to leave.

404
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,860
Guys,

405
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
get ready.

406
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,900
Miss Song?

407
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,070
Miss Song?

408
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,350
Why is she here?

409
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,220
Guys,

410
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,270
once we go in,

411
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,610
mind your manners.

412
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,020
Keep your voices down.

413
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,680
Don't spook our general's future wife.

414
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,440
Our general's happiness

415
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,980
is in our hands now.

416
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,210
Got it?

417
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,400
-Got it!
-Got it!

418
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,270
Place your bets. Hurry.

419
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,400
Now's the time. Don't miss your chance!

420
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,640
Anyone can place the bets!

421
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,550
Anyone can bet.

422
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,830
I'm opening it.

423
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,070
Yunlong, Shanhu.

424
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,050
Shanhu.

425
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,880
Hey, you came.

426
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,720
What a nuisance.

427
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,220
Is your chief here?

428
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,810
Chief?

429
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,230
Didn't Chief say
he wouldn't be here today?

430
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:09,960
He…

431
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,850
Is he here or not?

432
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,530
Why exactly

433
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,740
did you invite me here?

434
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,080
Why?

435
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,280
Yeah, why did I invite you?

436
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,460
Well,

437
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,640
Waning River Crescent
is quite famous in the capital.

438
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,910
Have you been here before, Heng?

439
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,160
Have you been here?

440
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,960
I...

441
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,510
Wait.

442
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,790
I asked you first,

443
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,960
so you should answer first.

444
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,400
I'm your elder brother. You answer first.

445
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,080
That's not…

446
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,160
You...

447
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,400
You...

448
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,690
Why didn't you play by the rules?

449
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,010
I never play by the rules.

450
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,760
[Be brave]

451
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,960
W-What are you doing?

452
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,330
[Be brave]

453
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,500
What are you doing?

454
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,960
What is this?

455
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,280
Do you see me as some kind of monster?

456
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,670
You're actually so scared of me.

457
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,440
Don't tell me you invited me here

458
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,090
because someone told you to.

459
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,980
Nonsense!

460
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,720
I...

461
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,030
I was just practicing my calligraphy.

462
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,550
Besides, I'm Great Jing's mascot!

463
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,080
Why would I be afraid of you?

464
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,660
Good.

465
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,280
If something's on your mind, just tell me.

466
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,440
Don't let others

467
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,970
lead you around by the nose.

468
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,020
N-No one's leading me.

469
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,460
[Big Fortune]

470
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,530
Miss Song,

471
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,550
this is the first floor.

472
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,080
It's called Guan Crescent.

473
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,270
Watch your step.

474
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,960
Why's it called Guan Crescent?

475
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,090
Because it's the main business floor.

476
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,310
Gambling, trading,
singing, dancing, dining—

477
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,850
you name it.

478
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,240
[Auspicious Clouds and Stars]

479
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,640
It's also where Chief

480
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,320
and the leaders
of Nightwalkers hold meetings.

481
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,460
Go up these stairs,
and you'll reach the second floor.

482
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,050
[Auspicious Clouds and Stars]

483
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,340
The second floor's even more fun.

484
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,360
Come on, keep up!

485
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,400
Coming.

486
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,270
The second floor is called Wang Crescent.

487
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,350
[Unmatched Grace]

488
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,720
There are guest rooms, private booths,

489
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,200
and quiet suites.

490
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,270
Every time Chief
makes a million-tael deal,

491
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,460
it's right here.

492
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,110
Look over here!

493
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,070
Slow down.

494
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,400
This is the third floor,

495
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,880
called Cang Crescent.

496
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,850
It's where the Nightwalkers
discuss top secrets.

497
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,980
Normal people aren't allowed up here.

498
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,220
I'm a normal person.

499
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:12,310
-Guess I don't need to see it.
-No, no, wait.

500
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,350
You're not normal.

501
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,270
You're one of us.

502
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,960
Feel free to look around.

503
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:16,960
Look over there.

504
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,090
That's the intel room—

505
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,110
strictly off-limits.

506
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,790
I'm telling you,
outsiders absolutely must not…

507
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,030
Stop! Stop!

508
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,630
Shanhu.

509
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,140
You don't need to go into all that.

510
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,510
I-I'm not that interested anyway.

511
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,270
No.

512
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,440
You're gonna be
the lady of the house one day.

513
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,320
You need to know everything clearly.

514
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,140
The more I know, the sooner I die.

515
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,730
But Shanhu,

516
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,100
you've been
dragging me around for an hour.

517
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,240
When can I

518
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,000
see your chief?

519
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,440
It's the Second Master's order.

520
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,400
He said I must help you

521
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,750
understand the full
workings of the Nightwalkers

522
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,400
and make you feel at home.

523
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,530
Now, I'll take you to the fourth floor.

524
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,830
This is the fourth floor.

525
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,880
It's called Wan Crescent.

526
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,270
You can overlook the entire
Waning River Crescent from here.

527
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,070
Look!

528
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,030
This is the empire

529
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,200
Chief built for you!

530
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,130
So melodramatic.

531
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,720
Besides this,

532
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,240
there's one more place beneath the water.

533
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,700
It's called Yin Crescent.

534
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,110
But that's Chief's private domain.

535
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,030
We don't actually know

536
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,110
what goes on there.

537
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,000
But don't worry.

538
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,090
There are definitely no women there.

539
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,270
Yunlong.

540
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,110
Come with me.

541
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,650
We're done for. We're done for.

542
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,720
Miss Song insists on seeing Chief now.

543
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,000
The way she looked just now—

544
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
it was like she'd never leave

545
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,970
without seeing him today.

546
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,510
I finally got her
to rest in a suite just now.

547
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,040
What's Chief doing today?

548
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,440
Why can't he see her?

549
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,280
I don't know.

550
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,830
Wait, wait.

551
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,490
Can't you help me look for him?

552
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,830
Did you forget
what Second Master said earlier?

553
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,720
He told us Nan Heng
would be here at Waning River Crescent,

554
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,380
so we're to keep a low profile
and not act rashly.

555
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,080
Some guests are here.

556
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,420
Move, move!

557
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,510
What's going on?

558
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,310
What's happening?

559
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,510
What's going on?

560
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,440
Go, go.

561
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,740
The Qianyu Army is here to make an arrest!

562
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,130
No one leaves!

563
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,410
What's happening?

564
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,270
What's going on?

565
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,350
No idea.

566
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,870
No idea.

567
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,250
Yeah, what's going on?

568
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,380
[Big Fortune]

569
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,240
Get up there!

570
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,590
Hurry! Move!

571
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,030
Stand still.

572
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,790
All of you, stay right where you are!

573
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,040
Sir,

574
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,230
may I ask who you're here to arrest?

575
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,720
-Who's that?
-No idea.

576
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,280
I've never seen him before.

577
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,400
Nan Rui.

578
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,950
If you keep eating like this,

579
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,840
I won't be able to see you anymore.

580
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,160
Even if I stop, you still can't see me.

581
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,400
Who is it?

582
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,160
Come in!

583
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,750
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

584
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,150
Great to see you, Rong Hua!

585
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,280
What are you doing here?

586
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
Your Highness.

587
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,310
I'm here with the Qianyu Army
to make an arrest.

588
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,000
I ran into Jixiang

589
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,000
and heard you were both here,

590
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,790
so I came

591
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,640
to greet you.

592
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
Who are you here to arrest?

593
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,920
The chief of Waning River Crescent—

594
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,720
Li Shiliu.

595
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,810
Then what does this Li Shiliu look like?

596
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,720
What exactly did he do

597
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,880
to make you
bring so many people to arrest him?

598
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,030
Military equipment has been
going missing now and then.

599
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,450
We suspect the Nightwalkers are involved.

600
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,960
So we set a trap to lure him out.

601
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,750
Less than two hours ago,

602
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,240
someone took the bait.

603
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,400
That person was Li Shiliu.

604
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,550
There are so many of you,

605
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,270
yet you still haven't caught him?

606
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,920
That guy is extremely cunning.

607
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,680
Even surrounded by dozens,

608
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,160
he still managed
to slip away and flee here.

609
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,960
However,

610
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,640
he's badly injured and can't move easily.

611
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,680
We believe
he's hiding somewhere in this building.

612
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,310
We've already captured two of his men

613
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,110
and are interrogating them now.

614
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,070
If you do catch him,

615
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,270
you must come report it to me.

616
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,030
Yes.

617
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,160
I'll take my leave.

618
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,340
Li Shiliu's in this building.

619
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,170
Aren't you afraid?

620
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,350
No.

621
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,850
No way I'm not afraid.

622
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,200
A bloodthirsty killer

623
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,240
is hiding somewhere near me.

624
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,590
I'm terrified!

625
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,450
Then call Jixiang in.

626
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,350
Jixiang?

627
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,820
Well, he…

628
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,210
he's, um… a gambling addict.

629
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,590
He snuck off to gamble.

630
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,530
That's strange.

631
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,090
Jixiang is always glued to your side.

632
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,790
Why is it that today of all days,

633
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,750
he left you alone to meet with me?

634
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,110
He...

635
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,510
I...

636
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,680
You...

637
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,920
Have some sunflower seeds.

638
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,780
We have nothing else to do anyway.

639
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,820
By then, I'll barge into your room

640
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,110
disguised as Li Shiliu

641
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:30,670
[One day ago]

642
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,240
and pretend to be injured and pass out.

643
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,480
Very exciting!

644
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,640
And then?

645
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,400
Then you come to check on me

646
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,920
and try to remove my mask.

647
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,970
If Li Shiliu really
is connected to Nan Heng,

648
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,230
Nan Heng will definitely try to stop you.

649
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,110
Got it.

650
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,220
If Heng dares to stop me,

651
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,920
I'll inform Father immediately

652
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,070
and get an imperial order to look into him

653
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,730
and the Nightwalkers, right?

654
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
His Majesty knows you're pure of heart

655
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
and speak only the truth.

656
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,170
He'll definitely believe you.

657
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,350
But what if Heng

658
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,830
doesn't stop me?

659
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,440
I can't really pull off your mask

660
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,160
and let him see your face.

661
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,200
If Nan Heng doesn't stop you,

662
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,840
I'll pretend to wake up
and leave the room.

663
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,340
All you have to do is stall him.

664
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,270
I don't know if I can stall him.

665
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,800
Don't worry, Your Highness.

666
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Jixiang and Rong Hua
are standing by outside to back me up.

667
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,750
But what if Heng really

668
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,160
has nothing to do with Li Shiliu?

669
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,880
Then all our efforts in this investigation

670
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,030
would've been a wild goose chase.

671
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:34,680
That's…

672
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,680
If Li Shiliu isn't Nan Heng's pawn,

673
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,220
we can use this opportunity

674
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,430
to make him your pawn instead.

675
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,450
And…

676
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,610
how exactly do you plan to do that?

677
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,640
I'll bring a shipment of weapons

678
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,200
into Waning River Crescent.

679
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,200
After I leave,

680
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,550
Rong Hua will lead a search of the place

681
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,950
and discover them
hidden in a private room.

682
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,890
You're trying to frame him!

683
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,110
Calm down, Your Highness.

684
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,960
Hear me out.

685
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,000
Once Rong Hua finds the weapons,

686
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,800
the Qianyu Army
and the Nightwalkers will clash.

687
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
At that point, you can step in

688
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,750
and smooth things over.

689
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,230
By doing so,

690
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,270
Li Shiliu will feel indebted
and be willing to serve you.

691
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,790
You can then persuade both him

692
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,160
and the Nightwalkers
to choose the right path

693
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,490
and submit to the court.

694
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,330
General, Rong Hua has come down.

695
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,680
It's time you showed up.

696
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,470
Waiting for someone?

697
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,350
No.

698
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,160
Who could I possibly be waiting for?

699
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,880
I'm just waiting for you
to say something.

700
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,140
Then why do you keep glancing over there?

701
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,580
Who are you?

702
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,800
He looks like he fainted.

703
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,570
He seems to be the one from the poster!

704
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,750
Gosh, he's Li Shiliu!

705
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,610
Really?

706
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:51,160
Heng, don't be scared.

707
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm here.

708
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,920
Today, I'm taking off his mask

709
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,400
and seeing who he really is.

710
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,110
Wait.

711
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,400
Shouldn't you go out and call for help?

712
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,750
C-Call for help?

713
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,120
Rong Hua and the Qianyu Army
are waiting right outside.

714
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,920
Ask them to come in and catch him.

715
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,640
If you're too scared,

716
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,070
I'll do it myself.

717
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,200
Hold on, hold on.

718
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,350
Be patient.

719
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,580
Don't look down on me.

720
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,200
He's already passed out.
Why would I be afraid?

721
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,160
Today, I'm going to see

722
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,490
with my own eyes
what he really looks like.

723
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,750
Heng,

724
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,400
I'm going over now.

725
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,350
Don't stop me.

726
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,410
Go ahead. I won't stop you.

727
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,480
I'm already walking over.

728
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:58,700
I'll pull off his mask soon.

729
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,880
Wait.

730
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,150
What did you say?

731
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:06,280
I mean you're too slow.

732
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,110
Walk faster.

733
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,510
Alright.

734
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,780
I'm standing right next to him now.

735
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,500
I'm really gonna do it.

736
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,280
What do you want? What do you want?

737
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,070
You're trying to stop me.

738
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,440
You're definitely
trying to stop me, aren't you?

739
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
If you won't do it,

740
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,110
I will!

741
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,590
Get in!

742
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,790
[Excellence and Distinction]

743
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,670
Sir,

744
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,070
may I ask if that big guy called Fugui

745
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,150
is your attendant?

746
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,000
What's wrong?

747
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,880
He's so hot-tempered.

748
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,610
He crossed
a high-ranking official's daughter.

749
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,840
Please go check things out.

750
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,380
An official's daughter?

751
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,920
Didn't I tell you
to take care of everything?

752
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,450
Why is Song Yimeng here?

753
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,760
I only wrote those letters

754
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,090
to bring her here for you!

755
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,490
How was I supposed to know
she'd come today?

756
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,910
Let me help you.

757
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,690
You can't be serious.

758
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,890
I've got it!

759
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:35,900
It's stuck.

760
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,630
I love my hair.

761
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,550
Keep yapping

762
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,410
and I'll shave your head
and send you to a monastery.

763
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,810
[Fugui was here]

764
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,520
Why isn't the general back yet?

765
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,000
Why isn't he here yet?

766
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,710
It's not like
there are traffic jams in ancient times.

767
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,000
You...

768
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,960
Why is Yimeng here?

769
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,340
Mr. Li.

770
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,750
You're finally here.

771
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,420
You swordsmen are quite interesting.

772
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,000
The front door is right there,

773
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,960
but you just have to
climb in through a window.

774
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,640
Men will always be boys, huh?

775
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,540
How does she even know Li Shiliu?

776
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,030
Why are you hiding?

777
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,440
We're basically friends now.

778
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,840
Don't be so shy.

779
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,250
Mr. Li?

780
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,130
Is Yimeng having an affair with Li Shiliu?

781
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,260
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

782
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,630
Miss Song.

783
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,710
Mr. Li,

784
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,800
what's wrong with your voice?

785
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,930
Did you catch a cold?

786
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,400
I heard that

787
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,550
you're engaged to Young Master Chu.

788
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,190
So why are you acting like…

789
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
like we're close?

790
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,030
Sorry.

791
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,170
I forgot you're from ancient times.

792
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,100
Men and women should keep a distance.

793
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,500
Got it, got it.

794
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,840
Mr. Li, since you're here,

795
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,030
let's get down to business.

796
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,190
I'll get you some tea.

797
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,670
Have a seat.

798
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,510
Miss Song.

799
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,000
Chief is here to see you.

800
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,200
Miss Song.

801
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,750
You...

802
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,590
You teleported?

803
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,170
What?

804
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,290
And your voice is fine now.

805
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,480
You guys talk.

806
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,320
I've got something to do,
so I'll be going.

807
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,450
Where are you going?

808
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,420
That's strange.

809
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,510
So,

810
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,940
Miss Song,
what brings you here today?

811
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,610
I've been a little bored lately,

812
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,630
so

813
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:08,320
I prepared some gifts for you.

814
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,670
Much appreciated.

815
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,480
But I've got something urgent today.

816
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,710
Let's talk another time.

817
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,500
Mr. Li,

818
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,140
why are you suddenly

819
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,190
so cold toward me?

820
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,760
When was I ever warm toward you?

821
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,930
Didn't you write in your letter

822
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,200
that Chu Guihong was always busy,

823
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,150
and you were worried I'd be lonely,

824
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,320
so I should drop by

825
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,470
whenever I had free time?

826
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,970
I did say that.

827
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,810
So enjoy yourself here.

828
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,250
But I really do
have an urgent matter today.

829
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,350
We'll talk next time.

830
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,140
No.

831
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,410
I have something more important.

832
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,470
I want to talk to you in depth

833
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,150
about Nan Heng.

834
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,090
Nan Heng?

835
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:06,360
[The master and his servant
care for each other.]

836
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,280
The master and his servant
care for each other.

837
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,150
His Highness just told me to get lost.

838
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:22,880
I understand.

839
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,580
Nan Heng

840
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,190
is a prince after all.

841
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,370
People in your world are bound

842
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,840
to fear him.

843
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,930
But, Mr. Li,

844
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,810
have you ever thought about this?

845
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,160
If one day,

846
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,340
the feud between
the Seventh and Eighteenth Princes

847
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,190
throws the whole nation into chaos,

848
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,760
what should we do then?

849
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,590
Going up against a prince is not easy.

850
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,100
Miss Song, I need to know
what your trump card is.

851
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,480
Song Yude is my father.

852
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,840
Chu Guihong is my fiancé.

853
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,340
Isn't that enough?

854
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,880
Yimeng wants me to join forces
with Li Shiliu to go against Nan Heng?

855
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,120
I need to know your full plan.

856
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,480
If it's not airtight,

857
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,230
I won't risk

858
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,110
my men's lives.

859
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,710
Goodbye.

860
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,140
The Lantern Festival.

861
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,550
During the Lantern Festival,

862
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,850
there'll be a citywide
celebration in the capital.

863
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,000
Everyone will be there.

864
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,740
That day, Nan Heng

865
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,500
is bound to make his move.

866
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,860
He'll turn the whole city
into a sea of fire.

867
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,730
Countless civilians will die.

868
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,350
Mr. Li,

869
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,220
if you're willing to trust me,

870
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,700
help me stop Nan Heng.

871
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,400
What do you say?

872
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,240
The Lantern Festival

873
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,370
is celebrated every year.

874
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,150
People light lanterns
and pray for blessings.

875
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,710
It's all routine.

876
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:02,650
Why are you so sure Nan Heng will act?

877
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,180
Exactly because it's routine.

878
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,160
That's what makes it the perfect cover
for him to suppress rivals

879
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,850
and pull people to his side.

880
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,550
[Four hours earlier]

881
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,260
The palace guards were punished?

882
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:21,630
His Majesty punished them repeatedly.
That's no coincidence.

883
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,590
I suspect he's planning
to hand control of palace security

884
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,110
to Chu Guihong as well.

885
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,000
If that happens,
both the capital and the palace

886
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,030
will fall under the control

887
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,750
[Gentle Breeze and Auspicious Clouds]

888
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,990
of Chu Guihong and the Eighteenth Prince.

889
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:32,510
Chu Guihong has only held
his current post for less than ten days.

890
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,890
If he wants a promotion,

891
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,820
he'll need some kind of achievement.

892
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,470
The Lantern Festival?

893
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,620
If he's put in charge
of the Lantern Festival

894
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,830
and does a good job,

895
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,810
he'll naturally

896
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,230
get promoted.

897
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,080
Mr. Li,

898
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,970
I know you still have a lot of questions.

899
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:58,000
But this time is different.

900
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,230
If we don't stop Nan Heng,

901
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,630
it won't just be Chu Guihong—

902
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,150
many innocent lives

903
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,790
will be dragged down as well.

904
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,070
Mr. Li,

905
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,710
you have a heart
that cares for the people.

906
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,310
Are you really
going to stand by and do nothing?

907
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:14,520
I haven't even made a plan yet,

908
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,810
and Song Yimeng's already said all this.

909
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,760
Could it be she and Chu Guihong
are trying to stir up chaos

910
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,840
to frame me

911
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,560
and give Chu Guihong
a political advantage?

912
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:25,410
Mr. Li,

913
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,510
think carefully.

914
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:29,590
Hasn't Nan Heng committed

915
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,370
enough crimes over the years?

916
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,080
If you're hesitant

917
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,170
because he's a prince,

918
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,930
afraid to face him alone,

919
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,360
I'll have Chu Guihong join us.

920
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,840
The three of us together
can take Nan Heng down!
