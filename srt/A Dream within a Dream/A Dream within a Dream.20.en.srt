[Song Residence]

4
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,440
How come it's you?

5
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,630
Miss Song Yiting, you gave me
such generous gifts.

6
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,910
How could I not come?

7
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,630
I want to see Li Shiliu.

8
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,360
Chief is extremely busy,

9
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,380
so he assigned this matter to me.

10
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,630
Miss Yiting, feel free
to make any requests.

11
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,470
I'll certainly comply.

12
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,530
Don't call me that.

13
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,710
And also,

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,530
keep your distance.

15
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,760
Let me be honest with you.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,960
Today, only Li Shiliu

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,560
can take what I have in my possession.

18
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,360
That's a bit unreasonable, isn't it?

19
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,190
That belongs to Waning River Crescent.

20
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,910
Is that so?

21
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,180
It belongs to Waning River Crescent?

22
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,840
Either

23
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,030
you let me see Li Shiliu today,

24
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,870
or

25
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,310
Mr. Chu from the
capital prefecture's office

26
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,110
would be very interested to know

27
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,470
how his precious sword

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,240
ended up in your hands.

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
I bathed myself and put on perfume

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,310
only to encounter such filth.

31
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,560
What rotten luck.

[Evening]

36
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,050
I can't take this anymore.

37
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,150
An official's daughter

38
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,030
dares to double-cross the Nightwalkers.

39
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,360
I'm going to
take that sword back right now.

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,590
I'll take all the blame
if anything goes wrong.

41
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,000
Can you calm down?

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You think the Song Residence is some gang

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,840
you can just barge into?

44
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,870
Listen.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
When dealing with officials' families,

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,710
we need to follow proper protocol.

47
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,280
Then what do you suggest we do?

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,800
If we don't get that sword back,

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
we can't hide it from Chief anymore.

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,590
Bring me my battle robe.

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,400
At critical moments,

52
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,240
I'm still the one who has to step in.

53
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,840
Thank you,

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Miss Song Yiting.

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,870
Mr. Li, why so formal?

56
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,560
Just call me Yiting.

57
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,160
Miss Yiting, feel free...

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,220
Don't call me that.

59
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,730
Keep your distance.

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,830
My Lady, what exactly would it take

61
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,230
for you to return

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,890
what you've stolen from me?

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,630
How can you call it stealing?

64
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,830
That sounds so harsh.

65
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,630
I gifted you 73 paintings

66
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,560
and merely took

67
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,830
a small token in return.

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,750
If you're so attached to it,

69
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,630
perhaps we could arrange a trade?

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,800
Offering yourself in marriage is
certainly out of the question.

71
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,360
The Waning River Crescent doesn't engage
in such transactions.

72
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,630
You jest, Mr. Li.

73
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,159
It's not that serious.

74
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,000
I only ask for three days.

75
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,920
You need three days?

76
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,760
You misunderstand.

77
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,680
You were right before.

78
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,360
I have no experience
with the martial arts world,

79
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,240
and you don't understand
noble family customs.

80
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,360
Our backgrounds are worlds apart,

81
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,930
so this relationship may not be suitable.

82
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,560
But if we don't even give
each other a chance,

83
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,000
then there's definitely
no possibility of a future.

84
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,150
How do you propose we try?

85
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,240
Let's spend three days together

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,100
to get to know each other's lives.

87
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,070
If after three days,

88
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,000
you still feel nothing for me,

89
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,720
I'll return the sword.

90
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,750
But if you do fall for me,

91
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,550
then you must ask my parents for my hand.

92
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,580
For your hand?

93
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,310
Playing for such high stakes?

94
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,159
♪ Clap once, we ride together
in the bridal sedan ♪

95
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,560
You've experienced all sorts of things.

96
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,360
Surely this small request

97
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,510
♪ Clap twice,
the Song family's rocket shoots high ♪

98
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,610

♪ Riding in the bridal sedan ♪

100
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,740
♪ Riding in the bridal sedan ♪

101
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,730
♪ The bridal sedan is fabulous ♪

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,750
Rather than handing over Miss Song Yiting

103
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,600
to strengthen someone else's power,

104
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,190
why don't you marry both sisters?

105
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,950
Marry a virtuous wife

106
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,350
and have a pretty concubine.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,130
Firmly grasp the Song family's influence
in your hands.

108
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
My answer

109
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,270
is still the same.

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,240
Very well.

111
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,070
Nan Heng clearly has

112
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,950
the idea of us sisters marrying
one husband.

113
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,690
Is there no way to avoid

114
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,100
these iconic scenes from the script?

115
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,230
The palace is full of treachery.

116
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,140
One must be careful everywhere.

117
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,510
Even if you don't harm others,

118
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,830
you must guard against others harming you.

119
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,510
He may not want to kill me,

120
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,270
but I will certainly die because of him.

121
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,510
These are the rules.

122
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,390
It's destined.

123
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,950
Then, break the rules.

124
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,410
Destroy what's destined.

125
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,630
No.

126
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,160
At least I can survive until
the second-to-last episode.

127
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,830
But if Song Yiting is deceived by him,

128
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,600
that's a lifetime matter.

129
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,390
I must defy fate.

130
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,560
Nan Heng,

131
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,070
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,680
My Lady.

133
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,250
My Lady,

134
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,480
how could you do

135
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,240
such labor yourself?

136
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,370
Let me do it instead,

137
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,960
so you won't hurt yourself.

138
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,720
Yimeng,

139
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,920
I heard that after
the ladies left that day,

140
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,720
you had quite a talk with Heng.

141
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,800
Have you changed your mind?

142
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,190
My Lady,

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,680
I was foolish before.

144
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,360
The Seventh Prince is
such a wonderful person,

145
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,950
and I failed to cherish him.

146
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,360
Thanks to you

147
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,760
for never giving up on me,

148
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,660
I now have the chance to marry him.

149
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,510
It's just...

150
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,920
What's wrong?

151
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,120
Has Heng mistreated you?

152
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,700
No,

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
His Highness hasn't mistreated me.

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
My Lady,

155
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,049
after meeting those noble ladies,

156
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,110
he started ignoring me completely.

157
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,789
I followed your instructions

158
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,390
and gave him those pastries,

159
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,080
but after taking them,

160
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,480
he just turned and left,

161
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,430
without saying a single kind word to me.

162
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,720
I'm worried

163
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,910
that he might've taken a fancy to
one of those noble ladies

164
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,040
and is thinking of taking a concubine.

165
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,400
That's impossible.

166
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,840
Those ladies that day

167
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,620
were all terrified by Heng.

168
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,870
In this capital, the only woman
with such courage

169
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,790
is you, Yimeng.

170
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,110
Thank you, My Lady.

171
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,080
That's what I've been telling myself too.

172
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,870
But...

173
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,480
But as long as I'm not by his side,

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,840
I can neither eat nor sleep properly.

175
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,550
I'm afraid

176
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,540
that I might pass away

177
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,670
before our wedding day arrives.

178
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,600
Yimeng.

179
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,200
Yimeng.

180
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,380
Yimeng!

181
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,310
Yimeng!

182
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,720
Quick!

183
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,790
Quickly call the imperial physician!

184
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,120
Yes,

185
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,720
My Lady.

186
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,150
All illnesses can be cured,

187
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,550
but lovesickness has no remedy.

188
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,320
My Lady,

189
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,510
I beg you.

190
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,960
Please let me go to the Prince's residence

191
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,360
to be with the Seventh Prince,

192
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,120
would you?

193
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,350
Good child,

194
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,900
I promise you.

195
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,150
I'll grant you anything you wish.

196
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,720
Thank you, My Lady.

197
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,480
My Lady,

198
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,510
your acting was terrible.

199
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,200
Why don't you learn from me sometime?

200
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,670
You have the nerve to say that?

201
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,390
You put chili sauce in there.

202
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,240
I wonder if she noticed.

203
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,320
Whatever.

204
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,960
Both of you, listen carefully.

205
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,030
From now on,

206
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll keep a close eye

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,750
on Nan Heng.

208
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,510
You two

209
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,040
watch Song Yiting closely.

210
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,860
Yimeng is so desperate

211
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,700
to leave the palace and see Heng

212
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,120
that she'd go to such lengths.

213
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,030
Miss Song has gone to great trouble.

214
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,600
She must be deeply in love
with His Highness.

215
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,910
Love grows deeply,

216
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,840
blossoms, and bears fruits.

217
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,400
They'll have many children

218
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,960
and many generations!

219
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,600
So you

220
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,170
took the initiative to tell Mother

221
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,960
to come

222
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,030
and serve me?

223
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,440
Your Highness is busy.

224
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,910
Since I'm about to become your wife,

225
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
I need to learn

226
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,510
how to serve you well.

227
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,750
Then in the future,

228
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,980
I can pass down your genes,

229
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,550
blossom and bear fruit,

230
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,120
and have many children

231
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,480
and generations.

232
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:23,840
Got it.

233
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,670
Then...

234
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
You may leave.

235
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,900
Did I do something wrong?

236
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,510
Or Your Highness,

237
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,480
do you not want to see me at all?

238
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,120
Fine.

239
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,790
If you are well,

240
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,320
everything is great.

241
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,350
I'll leave now.

242
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,240
From now on,

243
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,240
I won't disturb your life anymore.

244
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,630
I'm really leaving.

245
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,090
You said you cared about me.

246
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,600
You said you wanted to
protect me forever.

247
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,210
People change easily,

248
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,840
but love is hard to break.

249
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,810
What a pity for my sincerity.

250
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,550
I loved the wrong person.

251
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,710
Come back.

252
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,860
What's wrong, Your Highness?

253
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,410
Your acting is not good.

254
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,960
Don't act next time.

255
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,260
However,

256
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,550
since you've already spoken
with Mother,

257
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,440
you should stay here in the residence.

258
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,300
It's not safe outside these days.

259
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,120
Don't go out

260
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,320
and cause me trouble,

261
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,750
understand?

262
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:02,990
I got it.

263
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,480
Your Highness is truly

264
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,080
the best fiancé in the world.

265
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,370
I'll go settle in now.

266
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,300
Your Highness,

267
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,930
what are you looking at?

268
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,630
What's so interesting about hands?

269
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,720
What is it?

270
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,720
Chancellor Gao has brought his advisors

271
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,790
to discuss state affairs with you.

272
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,650
They're waiting in the main hall.

273
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,390
Got it.

274
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,370
Your Highness,

275
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,030
Chu Guihong just came to steal something,

276
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,150
and now Miss Song comes to stay.

277
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,600
What's going on here?

278
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,950
She says she's here to
serve me personally,

279
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
but there's not a word of truth
in what she says.

280
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,120
Keep an eye on her.

281
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,100
If she needs anything,

282
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,200
make sure it's properly arranged.

283
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,030
But Your Highness,

284
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,230
your instructions are contradictory.

285
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,750
Should I be guarding against her

286
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,080
or taking care of her?

287
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,080
You've been with me for so long.

288
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't you know how to be flexible?

289
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:54,010
[Brilliant Heavenly Sun]

290
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,340
Your Highness.

291
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,390
I'm slow.

292
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,120
Please give me another chance.

293
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,980
Your Highness!

294
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,550
Miss Song.

295
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,280
Nan Heng definitely started
seducing Yiting

296
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,380
by exchanging love letters with her.

297
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,360
Not it.

298
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,610
His Highness had half a bowl
of porridge for breakfast.

299
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,390
[Peace and Serenity]

300
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,480
Miss Song,

301
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,550
this is a private study.

302
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,880
What are you doing here?

303
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,980
I'm

304
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
just looking around.

305
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
His Highness told me
to get familiar with my surroundings.

306
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,390
I'm going

307
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,960
to explore elsewhere now.

308
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,940
Your Highness,

309
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,080
Chancellor.

310
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,030
Getting married and receiving a fief

311
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,160
is a custom from the previous dynasty,

312
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,510
but there are also precedents
that can be followed.

313
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,400
If you wish to legitimately
bypass this rule,

314
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,080
the only way is...

315
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,020
By becoming the crown prince.

316
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,750
But currently among the six ministries,

317
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,200
only the Minister of Revenue is

318
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,720
willing to support me.

319
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,360
If I propose to be named crown prince now,

320
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,630
I fear Mr. Song

321
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,690
will think my intention to marry
Song Yimeng is impure.

322
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,240
Isn't this precisely why you are marrying

323
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,840
Minister Song's eldest daughter?

324
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,720
Indeed.

325
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,240
Otherwise, why would you marry Miss Song?

326
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,790
Yes.

327
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,840
That's right.

328
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,130
That's the reasoning.

329
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,600
Enough.

330
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,010
I'll make my own judgment on this matter.

331
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,010
You all may leave.

332
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,310
Yes.

333
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
Uncle,

334
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,600
is there something else?

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,310
You originally had two goals in forcing
the marriage with Song Yimeng.

336
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,550
First, to break up the alliance
between the Song and Chu families.

337
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,750
Second, to gain Song Yude's support.

338
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,000
Now that Song Yimeng

339
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,240
will definitely break off the engagement
with Chu Guihong,

340
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,640
the Song-Chu alliance exists in name only.

341
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,070
However, Song Yimeng
has always been willful,

342
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,880
and I fear there will be
too many variables.

343
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,030
I believe...

344
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,700
You should change course

345
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,680
and seek another bride.

346
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,950
Haven't I told you before?

347
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,310
Political struggles

348
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,200
are best fought in court.

349
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,110
Marriage is merely an external factor.

350
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,710
Uncle, you needn't worry
about these matters.

351
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,400
Could it be that you have
feelings for Song Yimeng?

352
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
Regarding the provincial assignment,

353
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,140
I'll find my own solution.

354
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,710
If this woman isn't removed,

355
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,090
she will surely become great trouble.

356
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Come here.

357
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,240
Consort.

358
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,640
To-be.

359
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,550
Consort-to-be.

360
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,480
Consort-to-be.

361
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,640
You must be tired after a long day.

362
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,270
Here,

363
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,610
have something to eat.

364
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,510
I prepared this specially for you two.

365
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,310
Thank you.

366
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Thank you.

367
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Where does His Highness
frequently visit these days?

368
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,480
Could you tell me a little about it?

369
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,590
Well...

370
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,930
Consort-to-be,

371
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,960
His Highness's whereabouts
are confidential.

372
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,480
If we were to reveal anything,

373
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,810
it could cost our lives.

374
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,440
Listen to yourself.

375
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,590
You make us sound like strangers.

376
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,000
He is the prince

377
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,270
and I am his consort.

378
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,270
Aren't you just the Consort-to-be?

379
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,210
Why are you being so stubborn?

380
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,400
Even with the "to-be," I'm still
a consort, aren't I?

381
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Telling outsiders

382
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,640
would be leaking information.

383
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,030
But telling family

384
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,940
is just everyday sharing.

385
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,620
Fine, fine,

386
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,660
I won't pressure you anymore.

387
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,790
You just have to tell me now

388
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,240
if the prince

389
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,000
has been frequently visiting
the Song family these days,

390
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,440
especially going to see—

391
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,170
Song Yimeng,

392
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,510
are you here to take care of me

393
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,910
or the horses?

394
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,870
What are you doing in the stables?

395
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,330
Your Highness.

396
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,780
Your Highness, how come you're here?

397
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,200
Be serious.

398
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,310
I just

399
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,680
want to know everything
about you, that's all.

400
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,270
So that's why

401
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,450
you went snooping in my study?

402
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,360
Well, I couldn't exactly

403
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,000
go snooping in your bedroom, could I?

404
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,350
Behave yourself.

405
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,880
Go wait for me in the room.

406
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,070
I'll deal with you later.

407
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,350
As you wish, Your Highness.

408
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,510
I'll take my leave.

409
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,410
Your Highness.

410
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,360
She's trying to seduce you.

411
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,550
Should I go test her intentions?

412
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,880
You test her?

413
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,640
What exactly would you test?

414
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,960
What could you possibly test?

415
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,750
Well...

416
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Since you have nothing better to do,

417
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,680
go feed the horses.

418
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,920
Yes, sir.

419
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,720
Test her?

420
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,310
What are you looking at?

421
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,370
Go feed the horses!

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,400
The horses have already been fed.

423
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,660
I'm more worried the man is still hungry.

424
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,290
I can't believe this.

425
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,830
Nan Heng is so cunning,

426
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,440
hiding things so well.

427
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,070
Good thing I'm quick-witted

428
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,150
and good at acting.

429
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,180
Oh my goodness,

430
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,480
I actually found it.

431
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,570
Wait, that's not right.

432
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,550
Both men and women have
long hair in ancient times,

433
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,150
so this doesn't count.

434
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,560
What are you looking for?

435
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,090
I just wanted to see

436
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,900
if you sleep on a soft or firm bed.

437
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,440
If it's too soft,

438
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,830
I thought I could replace it
with a firmer one

439
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,490
as it's not good for your back.

440
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,260
If you want something,

441
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,160
just tell me directly.

442
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,000
There's no need for this.

443
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,800
Besides, no one likes feeling distrusted,

444
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,270
especially me.

445
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,640
And especially by you.

446
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,980
I...

447
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,410
I didn't!

448
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:11,470
[Heaven-Heard]

449
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,380
Big, big, big!

450
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,200
Open!

451
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
Big, big, big!

452
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:58,680
Open!

453
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,590
Open it!

454
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,410
Open it!

455
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,990
I won!

456
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,400
I won!

457
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,500
Come on,

458
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,480
pay up!

459
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,820
Let's go again!

460
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,830
Mr. Li,

461
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,200
is this how

462
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,920
you usually live your life?

463
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,050
Yeah.

464
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,830
People of the martial arts world
seek freedom, pleasure,

465
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,000
wine, women, wealth, and excitement.

466
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,580
I'm quite accomplished in all of them.

467
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,480
What's wrong?

468
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,670
You don't like it, Miss Song?

469
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,680
If you don't like it, wait outside.

470
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,630
We agreed on three days for me
to make my choice,

471
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,650
but it hasn't even been one day

472
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,170
and you're already fed up?

473
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,040
Anyone else want to place a bet?

474
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,590
Hurry up if you're betting!

475
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,650
Mr. Li,

476
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,160
this is getting boring.

477
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,030
Let's make a bigger wager.

478
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,630
What do you have in mind?

479
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,110
This is my family heirloom sword,

480
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,370
the Mountain Cleaver.

481
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,030
It's worth a fortune.

482
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,550
On top of that,

483
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,230
one house,

484
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,730
five acres of land,

485
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,760
and my two hands.

486
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,000
Let's settle it in one round.

487
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,950
That's a fine sword,

488
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,200
but unfortunately,

489
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,440
I have nothing of value to wager,

490
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,590
so I can't join the game.

491
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,360
I have no interest in gold or treasures.

492
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,400
This woman, however, would do nicely.

493
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,960
I can see she's elegant,

494
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,440
refined,

495
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,810
and worth gambling for.

496
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,310
Sure.

497
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,720
He agreed!

498
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,350
You're using me as a wager?

499
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,240
Yeah.

500
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,640
You're the one who insisted
on following me.

501
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,790
Since you're mine,

502
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,270
what's wrong with using you as a wager?

503
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,400
If you don't like it,

504
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,080
you can still leave now.

505
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,590
Fine.

506
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,480
Since I'm at the table,

507
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,030
there's no reason to quit halfway.

508
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,680
Yes.

509
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,680
Wagering me

510
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,350
is fine,

511
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,000
but I'll hold the cards myself.

512
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,190
Double axes?

513
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,480
-Royal flush?
-Royal flush!

514
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,080
-Royal flush?
-Royal flush!

515
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,070
This...

516
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,590
Bring that sword over here.

517
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:55,880
Please have someone

518
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,070
from the store bring this sword

519
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,740
and these items to my residence.

520
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,560
These hands he wagered

521
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,710
will serve as labor payment.

522
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,160
Help yourself.

523
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,810
Miss Song Yiting,

524
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,160
I had no idea

525
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,630
you were such a skilled gambler.

526
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,510
It's just mathematics.

527
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,760
Anyone with hands can do it.

528
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,200
Also,

529
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,160
take off your hat.

530
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,950
If you want to set up a trap
to scare me off next time,

531
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,090
at least use some fresh faces.

532
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,000
I've seen this person many times before.

533
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,930
Don't you agree?

534
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,010
I...

535
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,440
Mr. Li,

536
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,550
I'd like to go shopping tomorrow,

537
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,280
and I request that you come alone
to accompany me.

538
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,750
Shangguan.

539
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,720
This Song Yiting

540
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,480
is hard to deal with.

541
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,590
We can't get the sword back.

542
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,110
My sword is gone too.

543
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,800
And my house,

544
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,740
my land,

545
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,850
and my...

546
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,520
Beard.

547
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,930
Judging by Nan Heng's reaction,

548
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,570
he was clearly panicking.

549
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,920
There must be something suspicious
in that bedside box.

550
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,590
Love letters?

551
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,400
A token?

552
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,260
It can't be

553
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,130
an aphrodisiac for Yiting, right?

554
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,240
Let go of me!

555
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
Let go!

556
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,750
Let go of me!

557
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,520
Since you're being cruel,

558
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,570
don't blame me for being disloyal.

559
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,480
Nan,

560
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,030
you forced me to do this.

561
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,030
Come.

562
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:40,790
Come.

563
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,510
Sir,

564
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,070
I've heard that this place

565
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,190
is the largest clinic in the capital.

566

00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,350
Take it easy.

757
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,860
Miss Song Yiting showed me
nothing but sincerity,

758
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,330
yet I threw her genuine feelings
on the ground

759
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,700
and trampled on them carelessly.

760
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,600
Even the wickedest person
in the martial world

761
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,400
couldn't be worse than me.

762
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,620
Shangguan,

763
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,440
don't think too much.

764
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,280
You were just doing your job.

765
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
You didn't want to do that,

766
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,000
right?

767
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,150
Tomorrow

768
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,800
is the last day.

769
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,840
Get

770
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,190
the sword back.

771
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,400
Never

772
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,710
see her again.

773
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,570
That's right, Shangguan.

774
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,550
You can't be blamed for being harsh.

775
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,710
You rejected her so clearly,

776
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,570
yet she still kept pestering you.

777
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,590
After all,

778
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:42,880
it's just feelings from a brief encounter.

779
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,110
How deep can it really be?

780
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,070
She'll most likely

781
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,550
forget all about it after a while.

782
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,230
-Yes.
-Yes.

783
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:47,670
-Yes.
-Yes.

784
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,280
She's not like me.

785
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,920
Shangguan,

786
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,960
tell me,

787
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,770
if you had met Miss Song Yiting

788
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,760
at a different time,

789
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,030
in a different place,

790
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,550
would you have fallen for

791
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,590
a girl like her?

792
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,590
She's in love with the fake Li Shiliu.

793
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,930
A person like me

794
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,070
will never get married.

795
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,430
Some relationships are not meant to be,

796
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,950
so some questions

797
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,000
should never be asked.

798
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,440
What a shame.

799
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,110
Guys,

800
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,710
do you think the Waning River Crescent

801
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,070
has bad feng shui?

802
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,040
Our Chief Master is single,

803
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,680
and so is our Second Master.

804
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,440
If you ask me,

805
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,030
we might as well become monks,

806
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,960
instead of looking for some sword.

807
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,510
So,

808
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,960
you lost the sword?
