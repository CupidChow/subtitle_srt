Why can't I untie it?

192
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,600
Time to roll!

193
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,180
My Lady.

194
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,630
My Lady!

195
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,610
I don't want to be in this world anymore.

196
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,000
It seems that the reincarnation

197
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,210
was triggered again this time

198
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,550
because I died.

199
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,860
You mean

200
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,240
as long as you die,

201
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,790
we can come back to this moment?

202
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,600
That's right.

203
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,720
Then,

204
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,910
how can the Chu family fight against us?

205
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,870
If the situation is going south,

206
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,520
you can just kill yourself.

207
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,640
You have a point.

208
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,670
If anything happens,

209
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,550
I'll die again.

210
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,200
What do you mean have a point?

211
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,860
What if something goes wrong?

212
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,670
Don't worry.

213
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,790
I've experienced it.

214
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,550
Nothing will go wrong.

215
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,460
That won't do.

216
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,080
What if the reincarnation fails?

217
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,270
Or if there’s a twist
in the cycle of reincarnation?

218
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,080
Listen.

219
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,030
I won't let you risk your life.

220
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,720
Nan Heng.

221
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,670
It's really different this time.

222
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,480
Only I can

223
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,030
give everyone a chance to start over.

224
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,030
Who else can take the risk if I don't?

225
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,750
You are the key to
the either-or selection at the city tower.

226
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,390
As long as you don't appear
on the city tower,

227
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,590
they won't be able to complete the plan.

228
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,910
But...

229
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
But I can't just watch you all...

230
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,360
Listen to me.

231
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,790
Listen to me.

232
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,550
You told us everything

233
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,610
and that's enough.

234
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,840
Leave the rest to us.

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,240
Later,

236
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,840
I’ll ask Fugui to protect you.

237
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,450
Before I could control the Chu family,

238
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,740
you can't go anywhere.

239
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,440
Nan Heng.

240
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,120
Be good.

241
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,670
If Lord Qianyu needs

242
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,790
the either-or selection
at the city tower to happen,

243
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,790
he will definitely target Song Yiting

244
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,600
I think

245
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,840
they will take action outside the city.

246
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,630
Sure.

247
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,870
I save my person.

248
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,080
You guard your person.

249
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,550
I'll leave the palace to you.

250
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,080
Remember to bring more men.

251
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,240
Don't forget,

252
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,240
she said you died before me.

253
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,390
This time,

254
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll die behind you.

257
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,500
I know I can't go with you.

258
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,080
It'll cause trouble if I do.

259
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,640
But you must promise me

260
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,790
to be careful

261
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,190
and to protect yourself.

262
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay?

263
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,550
Don't worry.

264
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,440
Okay.

[10:00]

266
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,270
Here you go.

267
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,870
Okay.

268

Here.

269
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,260
Let's go, Jixiang.

270
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,770
Let's enter the palace.

271
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,280

General.

274
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,810
I've completed

275
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,370
the tasks you ordered me to.

276
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,380
But

277
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,480
our men

278
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,480

that Nan Heng went to His Majesty's place

280
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,830
early this morning.

281
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,360
And the guards in the palace

282
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
have been increased.

283
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,680
Something must be wrong.

284
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,600
What about Song Yiting and her mother?

285
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,670
Our men

286

287
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,320

except you.

294
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,120
Remember,

when Lord Qianyu gives instructions,

296
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,470
follow through as much as you can.

I heard that Heng is sick.

309
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,200
You must be very sad.

310
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,150
Now that Father is upset
because of Heng's illness.

311
00:13:59,150 --> 00:13:59,790
I thought of buying Father
some red tangerines,

312
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,320
hoping that this will make you
feel better.

313
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,600

Let me peel a tangerine for you.

00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,360
You're a grown adult now

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,010
When Mother was still alive,

325
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,960
she used to peel them for me.

326
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,420
And I've also never

327
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,240

356
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,670
That's it.

357
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,510
Her Majesty's death anniversary
is around the corner.

358
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,370
Red tangerines from Dongting

359
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,120

when she was still alive.

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,510
Not many people in the palace
know about this.

But Chu Guihong is one of them.

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So,

366
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,210
I guess he must have bribed the vendors

367
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,840
and poisoned the tangerines

368
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,170
to poison Your Majesty.

369
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,600
Impossible.

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,240
No matter how bold Guihong is,

371
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,750
he wouldn't dare to kill His Majesty.

372
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,480
If he really wanted to kill someone,

373
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,910
he will kill you first.

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,670
You're right.

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Do you have proof?

382
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,670
Your Majesty,

383
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,030
you can ask someone
from the royal medical office to test

384
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,960
and you'll know if it's true.

385
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,270
No.

386
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,270
What's the need of doing that?

387
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,000
Heng.

388
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,480
If you don't believe me,

389
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
I'll have it myself now

390
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,340
and let you see if it's poisonous.

391
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,750
I trust you.

392
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,560
Liu Mingxi.

393
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,270
send someone from the royal medical office
to test for poison.

394
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,080
Yes.

395
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,120
Heng.

396
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,420
Send your men to South City

397
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,080
and send the vendor involved

398
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,630
to the prison of the Ministry of Justice

399
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,830
and hand him to Yan Yi.

400
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,580
Yes.

401
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,440
Your Majesty.

402
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,640
I have one more thing.

403
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,630
Go ahead.

404
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,340
I beg Your Majesty

405
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,870
to deploy the troops in the outskirts
back to the city

406
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,620
and send the Xuanjia Army
back to the capital as soon as possible

407
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,050
in case of emergency.

408
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,170
What...

409
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,349
What's happening today?

410
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,190
[Capital]

411
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,960
Junior General,

412
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,440
as you expected,

413
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,030
After Nan Heng entered
His Majesty's bed chamber,

414
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,070
His Majesty and the 18th Prince

415
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,310
didn't eat the poisoned food.

416
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,110
Not only that,

417
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,070
His Majesty also deployed the Xuanjia Army
to the capital.

418
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:36,360
[Capital]

419
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,510
Deploy troops to the capital?

420
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,730
Is the news true?

421
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,680
Yes.

422
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,430
The eunuch we planted in the bed chamber
said so.

423
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,350
What about the vendor selling red tangerines?

424
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,280
Did you send him out of the capital?

425
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,220
We were too late.

426
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:53,300
[Capital]

427
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,680
By the time you asked me to rush there,

428
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,010
he was just taken away
by the Xuanjia Army.

429
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,280
Junior General,

430
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,480
now,

431
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,740
what should we do next?

432
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,550
That vendor

433
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,880
won't be able to stand severe torture

434
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,980
and will give us away.

435
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,270
[Capital]

436
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
At that time,

437
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,030
if we were to be sentenced to death
for treason,

438
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,440
then...

439
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,370
So what about it?

440
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,260
Since he's pushing me to the dead end,

441
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,030
I won't go easy on him.

442
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,640
Tell Rong Hua

443
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,920
to act in advance.

444
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,680
Yes.

445
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,070
The wound is two inches deep,

446
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,290
caused by a Qianyu Sword.

447
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,890
I'm afraid Mrs. Shangguan
has been taken away by the Qianyu Army.

448
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,070
The footprints went that way.

449
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,200
Seems like they just left not long ago.

450
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,480
Go after them!

451
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,340
Second Master.

452
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,240
The situation have changed.

453
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,040
Should we report to Chief first?

454
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
Chief is still in the palace.

455
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,720
We definitely don't have enough time
to go back and forth.

456
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,920
Now that we are all here,

457
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,550
save the people first.

458
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's go.

459
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,510
Go.

460
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,160
Go.

461
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,740
Second Master.

462
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,940
Yiting's hairpin.

463
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,110
Second Master.

464
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,310
There’s one here too.

465
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,310
Second Master.

466
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,340
Second Master.

467
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,440
Do you think

468
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,110
Mrs. Shangguan left this here on purpose

469
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,370
so that we can find her?

470
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,420
It could also be a trap.

471
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:32,070
Shall we chase after them?

472
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,830
Let's go.

473
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,180
Let's go inside.

474
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,230
Mrs. Shangguan.

475
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,710
Mrs. Shangguan.

476
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,730
Yiting.

477
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,370
Mrs. Shangguan.

478
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,000
Yiting.

479
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,100
Mrs. Shangguan.

480
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,210
Mrs. Shangguan.

481
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,780
Mrs. Shangguan.

482
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,720
Run!

483
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,550
Run! Quick! Run!

484
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,590
Run! Hurry!

485
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:05,690
Shangguan He!

486
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,650
Chu Guihong, are you crazy?

487
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,810
What grudge does you have against him?

488
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,200
Why?

489
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,750
Is it painfu

490
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,370
watching the person you love die

491
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,420
in front of you

492
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,670
while you can't do anything?

493
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,130
Yiting.

494
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,090
You bastard!

495
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,640
Yiting.

496
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,810
I've already tasted this

497
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,030
in the Pingrong Battle.

498
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,070
My father was killed by Nan Heng.

499
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,330
Why can't I kill one of his subordinates?

500
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,430
Let go of me!

501
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,340
Guihong, listen to me.

502
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,830
The person you hate

503
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,220
should be Nan Heng, right?

504
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,050
It shouldn't be us.

505
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,350
Yiting and I

506
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,070
have never wronged you.

507
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,270
I beg you.

508
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,070
Let Yiting go.

509
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,750
No matter what's your plan
against Nan Heng,

510
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,920
I can help you.

511
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,550
Can’t I help you?

512
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,280
You don't have to do this.

513
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,250
We insignificant people

514
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,140
should be helping each other.

515
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,880
Mother!

516
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,200
Let go of me!

517
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,320
Let go of me!

518
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,030
Mother!

519
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,510
Yiting.

520
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,270
Overestimating yourself.

521
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,070
Yiting.

522
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,920
Tell me,

523
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,510
how do you feel

524
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,060
watching Shangguan He die?

525
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,640
Tell me.

526
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,870
I want to eat you and drink your blood

527
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,160
to vent my hatred.

528
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,380
Yiting.

529
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,240
That's right.

530
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,400
Only humans have love

531
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,340
and hatred.

532
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,270
Only humans have discontent

533
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,720
and the urge to change their fate.

534
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,340
No one is born to be a sidekick
for others.

535
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,190
Every pain I went through

536
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,550
has become Nan Heng's stepping stone
towards his ending.

537
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,850
I can't accept this.

538
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,000
Cut the crap.

539
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,100
Kill me if you want.

540
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,790
Don't let me survive.

541
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,400
I will make you pay for it.

542
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,320
I won't kill you,

543
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,380
I only want you to do me a favour.

544
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,160
Yimeng is not as excellent as you,

545
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,520
but she is treated better than you are.

546
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,880
All these years,

547
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:26,810
I don't believe you have no discontent.

548
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,960
As long as you help me ask her out,

549
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,200
I'll give you a good ending.

550
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,830
You want me to do evil for you?

551
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,350
Dream on!

552
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,240
Yiting.

553
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,350
Yiting!

554
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,680
Yiting.

555
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,680
Why don't you

556
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,070
give this to Yimeng for me?

557
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,950
Tell her I want to see her.

558
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,720
But she has to come alone.

559
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,670
[14:00]

560
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,050
[Qianyu Mansion]

561
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,020
Your Highness.

562
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,790
I just received the imperial edict

563
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,030
to come and capture Chu and his son.

564
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,400
Why did you arrive first?

565
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,750
Your Highness came late.

566
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,640
Lord Qianyu

567
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,750
is dead.

568
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,830
He was strangled to death.

569
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,260
Just as

570
