00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:04,460
[Gentle Breeze]

4
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,100
Your Highness,

5
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,310
y-you've been sitting here
this whole time?

6
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,590
She's already gone.

7
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,360
I've put a tail on her.

8
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,560
Nothing will happen.

9
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Your Highness,

10
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,240
would you like to go inside
and get changed?

11
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,140
Don't tell anyone

12
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,710
what happened today.

13
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,240
Yes.

14
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,270
But I really don't get it.

15
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,430
Why did you

16
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,430
do all that today?

17
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,800
I wanted to figure out the reason too.

18
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,340
To see what kind of connection

19
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,990
Song Yimeng has with me.

20
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,079
You couldn't
bring yourself to kill her today

21
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,600
and kept saving her
at the last moment.

22
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,540
That wasn't your true intention?

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,020
Was she using some kind of sorcery?

24
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,350
What I just did to her…

25
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,710
No, no.

26
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,630
I have to make a trip to Longhu Mountain

27
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,310
and hire a few exorcists.

28
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,000
Look at me now.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,130
Don't upset me more.

30
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,550
Yes.

31
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,330
Back in the royal garden that day,

32
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,770
I already thought something was off.

33
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,650
Today in the woods,

34
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,590
I planned to kill her in the chaos

35
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,030
and pin it on Chu Guihong.

36
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,440
But things turned out like this instead.

37
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,230
Judging from what happened,

38
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,690
it seems that no matter

39
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,710
what danger Song Yimeng is in

40
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,590
or where I am,

41
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,310
my body moves

42
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,190
on its own to save her.

43
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,150
If that's the case,

44
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,120
not only can we not hurt her,

45
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
but we also have to watch out

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,480
for others using her against us.

47
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,800
If the Eighteenth Prince

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,240
and Chu Guihong find out about this,

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,590
we'll…

50
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:53,590
That's why this matter

51
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,030
must be kept secret at all costs.

52
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,750
Yes.

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,910
Also,

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,050
we need to find a solution
as soon as possible.

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,310
But Song Yimeng

56
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,190
is still Chu Guihong's fiancée.

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,470
If the two of them talk about this,

58
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,280
then we...

59
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,840
Exactly.

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,960
As long as Chu Guihong
stays in the capital,

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,190
he's a threat.

62
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,950
Here's what we'll do:

63
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,630
go bring Censor Yao Qian

64
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,000
to me.

65
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,070
Yes.

66
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,120
Stop.

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:43,110
[Yan Gate]

68
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,270
Go on in.

69
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,880
Other people travel into novels

70
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,230
and live the dream.

71
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,550
When I do,

72
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,560
I suffer every possible hardship.

73
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,390
Why am I so unlucky?

74
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,190
We should carefully check every passerby.

75
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,360
Why did you stop me just now?

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,950
How many times have I told you?

77
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,110
Keep your eyes sharp

78
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,760
when guarding the city gate.

79
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,630
Didn't you see the person

80
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,110
behind that girl just now?

81
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,860
That was the captain of the Xuanjia Army,

82
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,660
one of the Seventh Prince's men.

83
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,680
Are you saying that was Song Yimeng

84
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,780
who just walked by?

85
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,070
It seems that
she came out of the prince's manor.

86
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,830
They were together

87
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,190
this late at night.

88
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,340
They must be pretty close.

89
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,680
Guihong,

90
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,600
when you get back tonight,

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,070
take a nice hot bath

92
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,940
and relax.

93
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,390
If you feel unwell,

94
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,000
just let me know, okay?

95
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:46,920
Well,

96
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,510
after I get home, I'll…

97
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,390
Yimeng!

98
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,870
Chu Guihong?

99
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:52,510
Yimeng.

100
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,390
What happened to you?

101
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,310
I'm fine.

102
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,190
I'm fine.

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,830
You...

104
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
You're out of prison?

105
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,490
I was officially released
by imperial decree.

106
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,580
All aboveboard.

107
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,170
Good.

108
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,940
As long as that scoundrel Nan Heng

109
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,470
didn't give you a hard time.

110
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,310
Don't worry.

111
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,510
But you—

112
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,430
he took you away

113
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,580
right after we met earlier.

114
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,880
I was so worried.

115
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,000
Let me take a look at you.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,460
He didn't hurt you, did he?

117
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,880
I'm fine.

118
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm fine.

119
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,560
General.

120
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,190
-You must…
-Yimeng.

121
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,090
When did we become so distant?

122
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,360
Well...

123
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,270
Well...

124
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:39,830
Hong.

125
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,510
Hong.

126
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,580
Nan Heng is ruthless and dangerous.

127
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,840
He's hard to deal with.

128
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,390
You've finally been released.

129
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,560
So don't go against him

130
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,650
in court anymore,

131
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,320
okay?

132
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,020
Yimeng,

133
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
be honest with me.

134
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,840
He bullied you today, didn't he?

135
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,190
Sure enough.

136
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,000
Second male leads are always
the ones the audience falls for.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,390
They're just better.

138
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,950
Isn't this…

139
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,330
This piece of jade was gifted to me

140
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,600
by my aunt,

141
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,310
the late empress, when I was born.

142
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,600
It's protected me on the battlefield,

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,730
bringing me home safe again and again.

144
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,720
Now that we're getting married,

145
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,850
I want you to have it.

146
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,330
May it protect the one

147
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,010
I love from today on.

148
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,360
Even Nan Heng

149
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,560
wouldn't dare act recklessly

150
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,490
in front of something from my aunt.

151
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,310
But

152
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,600
if you give it to me,

153
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,960
what about you?

154
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
I have the scented pouch you gave me.

155
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,940
During those dark days
in the imperial prison,

156
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,470
it was the only thing that kept me going.

157
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,790
But this jade is so valuable.

158
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,190
My scented pouch

159
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,190
isn't worth much.

160
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,600
Then just make me a few more.

161
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,800
I'll hang them here

162
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,680
and here.

163
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,680
Wherever I go,

164
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,510
the air will be filled with fragrance.

165
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,870
So everyone will know,

166
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,020
your man has arrived.

167
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,200
How does that sound?

168
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,960
You're finally smiling.

169
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,780
So beautiful.

170
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,000
Every time our general sees Miss Song,

171
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,020
he acts like

172
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,480
a peacock spreading his feathers.

173
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,669
Miss Song.

174
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,450
Greetings, Your Highness.

175
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,150
You and Guihong
have been engaged since childhood.

176
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,390
Strictly speaking, marriage

177
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,550
is a bond between two families.

178
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,210
It's meant to last till death.

179
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,170
But now Guihong's career

180
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,290
is in jeopardy,

181
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,750
and the rumors about you and Heng
are spreading like wildfire.

182
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,670
So tell me,

183
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,140
is the engagement still valid or not?

184
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,190
Your Highness,

185
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,010
that's between Yimeng and me.

186
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,080
I'm your cousin.

187
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,670
You're still an outsider.

188
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,480
Guihong.

189
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,700
Your Highness.

190
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,320
In this world,

191
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,720
the last person I'd ever get involved with

192
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,670

Who else but General Chu

381
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,590
is qualified to take on
such responsibility?

382
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,840
But didn't he just lose a battle?

383
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,260
Exactly.

384
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,940
How can we promote a defeated general?

385
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,110
Miss.

386
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,920
How did it go?

387
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,510
I handed the pouch you gave me

388
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,790
to that attendant next to General Chu,

389
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,880
Rong Hua,

390
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,030
the big guy

391
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,880
who's quite strong,

392
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,670
but his face kinda resembles…

393
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,110
No one asked about Rong Hua.

394
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,160
He's not the point.

395
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,240
I'm asking about Chu Guihong.

396
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,130
Did he read it?

397
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,920
He did.

398
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,920
And as it happens,

399
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,830
right after

400
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,310
he read your message,

401
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,790
someone from the palace showed up

402
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,790
and summoned him to see His Majesty.

403
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,400
Miss, what did you write

404
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,790
in your message?

405
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,070
General Chu's expression

406
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,070
was really strange after he read it.

407
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:30,190
He read it. That's all that matters.

408
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,830
Good thing I remembered
that part of the plot.

409
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,720
Otherwise...

410
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,810
Heng,

411
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,270
what do you mean?

412
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,400
Every position I proposed,

413
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,960
you shot it down with some excuse.

414
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,240
You couldn't kill my cousin,

415
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,700
and now you can't even
hide your intentions?

416
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,480
Heng,

417
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,680
since you think the posts Rui suggested

418
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,130
aren't suitable,

419
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,350
then tell me—

420
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,030
what post do you think

421
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,480
Chu Guihong deserves?

422
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,790
Your Majesty,

423
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,310
in my opinion,

424
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,110
when discussing matters of court,

425
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,910
the public good must come first.

426
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,470
If we give Chu Guihong a high position,

427
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,770
we'll be putting personal interests first.

428
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,940
If appointing the right person for the job

429
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,070
is putting personal interests first,

430
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,920
are you saying

431
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,030
only when the court
is full of the Gao family's people

432
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,630
[Calm, Respectful, and Sincere]

433
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,640
can we say we've put
the public good first?

434
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,360
You must be joking, Your Majesty.

435
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,400
The Duke of Zhou welcomed talent

436
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,830
and won hearts across the land.

437
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,160
Helping you unite the nation

438
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,070
and recruit men of virtue and talent

439
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,070
is what we've

440
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,610
always striven to do.

441
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,240
Your Majesty.

442
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,240
Chu Guihong may

443
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,400
have had a good reputation in the past,

444
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
but after the Pingrong Battle,

445
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,700
his command led to
the loss of tens of thousands of soldiers

446
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,790
and the slaughter of civilians

447
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,160
in three border cities.

448
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,070
As a result,

449
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,530
his reputation is already tarnished.

450
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,350
I worry that reinstating him

451
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,480
will only dishearten the people.

452
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,280
Your Majesty.

453
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,850
[Calm, Respectful, and Sincere]

454
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

455
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,310
Rise.

456
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,810
Thank you, Your Majesty.

457
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,350
Seventh Prince,

458
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,900
you said my reputation is tarnished now.

459
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,680
What evidence are you basing that on?

460
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,140
Naturally, it's backed by

461
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,760
a Censorate investigation.

462
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,880
Your Majesty,

463
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,000
I request that

464
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,540
the investigating censor

465
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,590
present the Censorate's impeachment
memorial against Chu Guihong

466
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,990
and explain the details.

467
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,240
Seriously?

468
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,970
You came prepared, didn't you?

469
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,270
Summon him.

470
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,120
[Memorial]

471
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,170
Seventh Prince,

472
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,840
may I ask how much longer

473
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,050
until the impeachment memorial arrives?

474
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,190
Yeah, Heng,

475
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,800
it's almost noon now.

476
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,720
Don't tell me you sent someone

477
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,300
to write it on the spot.

478
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,410
Your Highness,

479
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,300
there's something fishy about all this.

480
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,260
Maybe…

481
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,560
Wait a little longer.

482
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,020
Guess

483
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,550
I'm really hungry.

484
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,110
Well,

485
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,080
putting the right people
in charge matters,

486
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,280
but not more than

487
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,400
Father's health.

488
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,160
If we wait any longer,

489
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,590
we could skip lunch

490
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,440
and have dinner directly.

491
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,220
Enough.

492
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,610
Since no one has any objections

493
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,600
to reinstating Chu Guihong,

494
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,530
he shall be appointed
as the Prefect of the Capital

495
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,800
and Commander of the Army,

496
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,100
resuming leadership of the Qianyu Army

497
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,210
to guard the capital.

498
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,100
In an emergency,

499
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,430
he can act with full discretion.

500
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,700
He can also enter the palace armed

501
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,100
to report directly to me.

502
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,830
Congratulations, General Chu.

503
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,660
No,

504
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,730
now we should be calling you

505
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,160
Commander Chu

506
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,350
or Prefect of the Capital.

507
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,480
It's a great responsibility.

508
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,340
I'll do my best.

509
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,260
I hope all of you

510
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,000
can guide and support me…

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,270
Your Highness.

512
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,110
In the days to come.

513
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,310
Just now, Mr. Yao was blindfolded,

514
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,030
beaten,

515
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,240
and left in an abandoned mine
on the western outskirts.

516
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,350
By the time we got there,

517
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,550
the place had already been cleaned out.

518
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,790
No need to investigate.

519
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,180
It must've been Chu Guihong's doing.

520
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,870
But what I can't figure out is

521
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,840
how he knew where Yao Qian was.

522
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,050
Your Highness.

523
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,920
Last night,

524
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,160
we sent someone to tail Miss Song.

525
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,950
She ran into Chu Guihong on the road.

526
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,870
And this morning,

527
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,680
a maid from her house

528
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,550
secretly paid a visit to the Chu family.

529
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,090
Do you think they might…

530
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,060
Mr. Song.

531
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,480
Come, come.

532
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,590
Have a seat.

533
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,930
I remember when you visited us as a child,

534
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,270
your favorite treat

535
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,090
was always the crystal cake.

536
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,310
Go on, have a bite.

537
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,680
Yes.

538
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,610
Yimeng loves crystal cakes too.

539
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,040
When we were little,

540
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,570
she used to steal mine all the time.

541
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,260
That's a rude thing to say.

542
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,860
Please forgive me, Mr. Song.

543
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,160
It's fine.

544
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,230
Your father and I
have been close for years.

545
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,510
You and Yimeng have been engaged
since you were young.

546
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,790
In my eyes,

547
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,610
you're already family.

548
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,480
No need to stand on ceremony.

549
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That blade of yours…

550
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,790
My Lord.

551
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,310
It hasn't been sharpened.

552
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,240
Yeah, I'll take care of that today.

553
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,010
[Song Residence]

554
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,970
Your Highness,

555
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,840
Chu Guihong's here too.

556
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:54,210
[Room of Elegance]

557
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,030
Miss,

558
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,720
aren't you the most afraid
of the Seventh Prince?

559
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,030
He's literally barging in right now,

560
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,090
and you're not the least bit nervous?

561
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,880
When I sent word
to Chu Guihong this morning,

562
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,790
I already knew Nan Heng would come.

563
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,030
Relax.

564
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,590
He can't kill me now.

565
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,970
I'm not afraid of him.

566
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,770
Your Highness.

567
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,980
How could they serve such cheap tea

568
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,670
to the distinguished Seventh Prince?

569
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,680
Yingqiu,

570
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,600
go bring my premium ginseng tea.

571
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,070
Yes.

572
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:35,790
Zhixia,

573
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,790
where are the pastries?

574
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,480
Four sweet ones, four savory ones—
don't miss a single one.

575
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,070
Go, go.

576
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,510
Bring them to the Seventh Prince.

577
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:48,150
[Laiyi House]

578
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,340
Go.

579
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,640
Your Highness,

580
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,240
please wait a little longer.

581
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,310
The premium tea

582
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,800
will be served in no time.

583
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,880
My goodness!

584
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,830
Look at your ears—

585
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,160
they're bright red!

586
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,920
Fugui!

587
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,200
I'm not trying to scold you,

588
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,240
but you really need

589
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,590
to learn how to serve properly.

590
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,590
It's freezing today,

591
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,480
and you didn't even prepare
a fur coat for your master.

592
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,810
Totally unacceptable!

593
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:11,330
Here, Your Highness.

594
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,830
Warm your hands.

595
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,470
Warm your hands.

596
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,310
Fugui.

597
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,440
Get out.

598
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,390
Get out!

599
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,470
Get out!

600
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,440
Now tell me—

601
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,400
did you meet with Chu Guihong?

602
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,670
Sure did.

603
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,310
He and I

604
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,840
are engaged, after all.

605
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,070
Do I need your permission to see him?

606
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,880
What?

607
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,660
Working under you

608
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,760
means I'm not allowed to marry?

609
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,610
You've got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

610
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,410
You're not afraid of me anymore?

611
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,030
I am afraid.

612
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,780
Even terrified.

613
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,330
I'm shaking in my boots.

614
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,340
Your Highness.

615
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,330
There's a dagger right here.

616
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,270
Go ahead, kill me.

617
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,030
Oh wait, I forgot.

618
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,990
You can't kill me.

619
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,000
No matter how hard you try,

620
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,430
the only one who ends up hurt

621
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,790
is you.

622
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,710
By the way, Your Highness,

623
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,780
do those three dart wounds in your back

624
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,510
still hurt?

625
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Nightwalkers?

626
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,620
Sounds like
they're from the martial world.

627
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,830
That's right.

628
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,030
From what I've heard,

629
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,010
they were originally
skilled fighters from the martial world.

630
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,110
Three years ago,

631
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,980
a mysterious person gathered them up,

632
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,170
trained them,

633
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,640
and made them an elite force.

634
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,550
Their leader

635
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,570
seems to be quite capable.

636
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,750
This person secretly formed
the Nightwalkers within the country,

637
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,590
and outside the country,

638
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,350
he used a guild
called Waning River Crescent

639
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,130
to build connections in lodging, gambling,

640
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,590
restaurants, and so on.

641
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,550
Anything you can't do openly—

642
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,880
you can do it

643
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,350
at Waning River Crescent.

644
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,290
I heard a bit about it
while I was in prison.

645
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,270
Waning River Crescent
is located in a shady, chaotic area.

646
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,270
After dark, it's total mayhem.

647
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,500
There's always

648
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,310
something shady going on.

649
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,050
The so-called guild

650
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,240
sounds more like a cover
for the Nightwalkers' operations.

651
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,630
That's why

652
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,290
the court's troubled.

653
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,980
You mean...

654
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,590
Hong,

655
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,170
I need to know that

656
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,140
at court,

657
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,180
sometimes when the wind blows,

658
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,360
it really is wind,

659
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,720
and sometimes,

660
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,280
it's not.

661
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,850
Thank you for the guidance.

662
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,100
Well,

663
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,250
I didn't say anything.

664
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,000
Of course.

665
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
You said nothing at all.

666
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,160
It's just that I suddenly

667
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,590
came to a realization.

668
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,070
If I can

669
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,750
uncover the identity of this leader

670
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,490
and find out
what the Nightwalkers are really after,

671
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,240
that would be a major achievement.

672
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,310
It'd definitely help
the Eighteenth Prince's path

673
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,680
to the Eastern Palace

674
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,030
and my own career too.

675
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,990
So that's why
you're not afraid of me anymore.

676
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,710
You figured that part out.

677
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,560
But

678
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,520
the two maids just now

679
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,030
are Yingqiu

680
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,310
and Zhixia, right?

681
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,960
I heard the three of you grew up together

682
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,020
like real sisters.

683
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,720
I might not be able to kill you,

684
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,590
but killing them?

685
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,550
That'd be easy.

686
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,300
Bad guys really do stay bad, huh?

687
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,440
You love

688
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,640
using someone else's weakness as leverage.

689
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,520
Zhixia and Yingqiu
never did anything to offend you.

690
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,390
If you drag them into this,

691
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,570
won't it weigh on

692
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,580
your conscience at all?

693
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,300
What's this supposed to mean?

694
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,440
Can't you see?

695
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,160
Those arrows are poisoned.

696
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,420
They're aimed at her?

697
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,140
What do you want?

698
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,960
What do I want?

699
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,550
I want you

700
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,430
to take off your clothes,

701
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,200
kneel to me, and call me Queen.

702
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,480
You've got a death wish.

703
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,170
What queen?

704
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,070
You heard me!

705
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,990
A queen is a queen.

706
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,080
You idiot.

707
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,030
Are you going to do it or not?

708
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,130
You don't want to?

709
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,240
I'm a prince.

710
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,150
I only kneel to the emperor.

711
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,080
I won't kneel to anyone else.

712
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,520
Come up with something else.

713
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,220
Fine.

714
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,860
I'll make it simple for you.

715
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,990
Take off your clothes and call me Boss.

716
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,030
With this many arrows aimed at me,

717
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,630
even the noble Seventh Prince

718
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,850
wouldn't make it out alive, right?

719
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,640
Wait.

720
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,680
I'll do it.

721
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,970
Why is it taking you forever
just to undress?

722
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,550
Your belt.

723
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,510
Remove it too.

724
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,860
You princes

725
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,340
put on so many pieces
of clothing every day.

726
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,010
One layer after another.

727
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,240
Isn't it exhausting?

728
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,570
Don't look at me like that.

729
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:55,890
Listen, Nan,

730
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,900
I'm not taking advantage of you.

731
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,060
I'm teaching you how to be a decent man.

732
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,950
I'm kindly teaching you
how to respect others.

733
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,350
Don't think just because
you're the male lead

734
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,950
you can do whatever you want.

735
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,660
What did you just call me?

736
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,700
Nan?

737
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,700
W-What else?

738
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,190
You wanna take my last name
and become a Song?

739
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,150
I'm warning you,

740
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
stay away from me.

741
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,960
What happened to
all that arrogance just now?

742
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,680
Didn't you tell me to undress

743
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,060
and kneel to you?

744
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,880
Fine.

745
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,560
Then I'll undress too.

746
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,990
Now you're scared, huh?

747
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,980
Even if you take off your clothes now,

748
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,170
I still won't…

749
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,110
Song Yi…

750
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,800
You won't what, Your Highness?

751
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,010
Say it.

752
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,060
Say it, Your Highness.

753
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,320
Where did a girl like you

754
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,480
even get all this stuff?

755
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,989
To deal with a big villain like you,

756
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,989
of course I had to be well-prepared.

757
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,520
See this?

758
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,920
Real gunpowder.

759
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:31,600
One spark,

760
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,760
and you'll be blown to pieces.

761
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,400
You're not afraid of dying with me?

762
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
Cut the crap!

763
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,960
Promise me one thing,

764
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,120
or

765
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,710
I'll blow us both up right now.

766
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,800
What do you want?

767
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,969
Let me marry Chu Guihong.

768
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,570
Impossible!

769
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,699
[Room of Elegance]

770
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,700
Shut up.

771
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,780
I didn't even say anything yet.

772
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,400
Like you'd ever
say anything decent anyway.

773
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,590
Miss Song said

774
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,880
the Seventh Prince is no good.

775
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,590
You work for him,

776
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,120
so you must be terrible too.

777
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,480
Hold on, how could you

778
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,940
judge someone so arbitrarily?

779
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,150
Yingqiu, Zhixia,

780
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,280
is Yimeng inside?

781
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,920
Nan Heng is here too?

782
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,710
No.

783
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:21,810
No. Impossible.

784
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,580
Chu Guihong?

785
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,840
Well,

786
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,800
your fiancé is right outside.

787
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,320
If he sees us dressed like this,

788
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,800
what would he think?

789
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,230
What are you trying to do?

790
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,270
What do you think?

791
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,860
No, no.

792
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,840
Get up.

793
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,150
Don't move. Don't move.

794
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,630
I won't let you out.

795
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,030
Song Yimeng, get off me!

796
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,470
No, no!

797
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,990
Don't move! Don't move!

798
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,870
Song Yimeng.

799
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,080
Chu Gui…

800
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,110
I told you to be quiet!

801
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,490
Can't you understand?

802
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,360
Chu Gui…

803
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,140
Now you can't make a sound.

804
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,150
I swear I'll never complain
about romantic dramas again.

805
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,630
This really does work in key moments.

806
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,250
What are you doing?

807
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,250
Aren't the two of them

808
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,800
holding your arms too?

809
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,730
Let go!

810
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,470
Tell your master,

811
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,520
if it's about politics, come at me

812
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,980
and stay away from Yimeng.

813
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,210
Hong.

814
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Why are you here?

815
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,620
Yimeng.

816
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,740
Hong.

817

Let's go look at flowers in the garden.

818

Let's go.

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,630

00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,400
Let's go.

822
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,150
Yimeng.

823

Yimeng.

[A moment ago]

825
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,050
The third time.

826
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,520
What do you mean, the third time?

827
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,970
Your Highness,

828
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,260
don't tell me

829
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:46,020
you sit at home every day

830
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,080
secretly thinking about this stuff?

831
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,180
Well, yeah.

832
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,510
Once in the royal garden.

833
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,020
Once in the lake.

834
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,480
So this really is the third time.

835
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,800
It's fine.

836
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,780
You're a man after all.

837
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,970
Loosen up a bit.

838
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,440
A kiss is just a kiss.

839
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,760
At least I'm good-looking.

840
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,480
Shut up.

841
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,840
Your Highness,

842
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,190
what kind of "shut up"

843
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,670
do you mean exactly?

844
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,310
Stop pouting.

845
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,640
It's not like
I got anything out of it, okay?

846
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,670
Why so upset?

847
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,480
Enough!

848
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,770
Listen carefully.

849
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,520
Within three days,

850
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,510
give me what I want.

851
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,130
Then I'll let you marry right away.

852
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,400
Otherwise,

853
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,590
I can repeat what happened

854
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,360
in the kapok forest again and again.

855
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,210
I might not be able to hurt you,

856
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,750
but I have plenty of ways
to make Chu Guihong

857
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,260
wish he were dead.

858
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,760
But…

859
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,340
isn't three days a bit tight?

860
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,550
Can't we talk this out?

861
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,030
Five days maybe?

862
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,760
Two days.

863
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,480
You're just being unreasonable.

864
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,150
One day.

865
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,490
Two days.

866
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,510
Just two days.

867
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,840
But, Your Highness,

868
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,480
I have a small favor to ask.

869
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,190
When you leave later,

870
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,850
can you go out that way?

871
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,560
That way.

872
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,710
Your Highness,

873
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,150
aren't we here to deal with Song Yimeng?

874
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,260
[Song Residence]

875
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,930
If we leave like this,
won't it just boost her ego?

876
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,060
She even made you
climb out the window.

877
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,480
Your Highness.

878
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,070
You...

879
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:29,900
You...

880
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,740
Chu Guihong was invited here by Song Yude?

881
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,750
Yes.

882
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,750
They had a long talk in the study.

883
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,920
Looks like the Song family

884
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,950
is getting involved
in the fight for the throne.

885
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,500
If we don't kill Song Yimeng,

886
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,590
she'll become a threat down the line.

887
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,560
Your Highness,

888
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,020
Song Yimeng is cunning,

889
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,550
and now she's got the upper hand on you.

890
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,190
That's...

891
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,390
I may not be able to kill her,

892
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,940
but that doesn't mean

893
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,570
I'm at the end of my rope.

894
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,030
Send word to Waning River Crescent.

895
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,450
It's time they proved their worth.
