1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,080
(Previously)
I know.

2
00:00:01,105 --> 00:00:02,453
That you like Lin.

3
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:05,007
You already knew that Lin and Nut are dating?

4
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:07,254
Biu, calm down.

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,722
Win.

6
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:09,664
I'm great.

7
00:00:10,222 --> 00:00:11,747
But I'm going to take a rest first.

8
00:00:12,635 --> 00:00:14,483
Actually, you like Nut too, right?

9
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:16,876
Whether I like him or not,

10
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,904
it doesn't matter, Lin.

11
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:20,430
If this is the case,

12
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:21,991
I don't think it's convenient for you

13
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:23,906
to use the rehearsal room here anymore.

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,889
Hey.

15
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,234
Don't think I'm allowing you

16
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:29,842
to do that stupid band thing.

17
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:33,711
Stop it already, with that stupid music practice.

18
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,723
In this condition,

19
00:00:37,561 --> 00:00:39,014
save your energy for studying.

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,911

"Rearrange"
(Episode 8)

62
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:12,905
This should be okay...

63
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,501
It's still not right.

64
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:19,544
Oh, is practice over already, son?

65
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:22,981
We didn't practice, Dad.

66
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,048
Why not?

67
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:29,596
It's a long story.

68
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,150
Um...

69
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:36,555
How about this?

70
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,256
Let's play a game to relieve stress.

71
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:43,440
It'll help you relax.

72
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,559
What genre should we play?

73
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,335
You can choose for me.

74
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:51,074
How about something action?

75
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:52,680
What kind?

76
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:56,506
The game you like to play with Tim is fine.

77
00:04:56,826 --> 00:04:58,866
Okay, okay. Then let's play...

78
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:03,387
Let's play...

79
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:05,588
this game then.

80
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:06,545
You're not bored of it, right?

81
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:08,083
Let's try it.

82
00:05:11,046 --> 00:05:12,801
Okay. Don't forget this.

83
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:13,854
You have to follow me.

84
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:14,899
So the screen will scroll.

85
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:16,100
Otherwise, the screen won't scroll,

86
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:17,683
and we'll be stuck.

87
00:05:19,837 --> 00:05:21,056
We're on the same team.

88
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,656
Father and son helping each other.

89
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,617
It's fun.

90
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:25,551
Ready?

91
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,552
Starting now.

92
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,388
Go, go, go! Shoot, shoot, shoot!

93
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:30,527
Okay, follow me.

94
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:32,215
I'll... there, shoot!

95
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,215
Collect the items, okay.

96
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:36,395
Oh, why did you take 2?

97
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:37,689
You didn't share at all.

98
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:39,904
Let's go, let's go.

99
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:42,114
Keep shooting.

100
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,526
Don't stop shooting.

101
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:44,883
There are bullets coming.

102
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:46,371
Okay, go.

103
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,012
Okay, let's go, let's go.

104
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,026
Jump over the bridge.

105
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:50,732
Go.

106
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:52,207
I told you to follow me.

107
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,710
The screen isn't scrolling.

108
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:56,205
Why...

109
00:05:58,788 --> 00:05:59,888
What's wrong?

110
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,721
What did you encounter, son?

111
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,791
What happened? Tell me.

112
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,214
It's nothing, Dad.

113
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:17,961
Really.

114
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:23,456
I'm just happy that you're still here with me.

115
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,148
To solve this problem,

116
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,479
we must eliminate a variable

117
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,211
to leave only one variable.

118
00:07:02,476 --> 00:07:03,423
Biu.

119
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,306
Biu, I'm sorry.

120
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,091
I'm really sorry, Biu.

121
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:16,181
Can you please talk to me?

122
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:23,528
If you don't talk to me,

123
00:07:23,954 --> 00:07:25,441
I'm stealing your eraser.

124
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:33,277
Teacher.

125
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,715
Daranphop is talking to me

126
00:07:34,739 --> 00:07:36,167
and stole my eraser.

127
00:07:37,047 --> 00:07:39,601
Daranphop, go stand outside.

128
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:43,689
Yes.

129
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:58,673
Biu.

130
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,212
Stay away from me.

131
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,092
Can you talk to me first?

132
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,627
I don't want to talk to you, Win.

133
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:06,863
I'm sorry, Biu.

134
00:08:06,888 --> 00:08:08,168
You don't have to apologize.

135
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,826
You let me go and make a fool of myself

136
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,797
even though you already knew everything.

137
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,361
What kind of friend does that?

138
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,981
You once said that in the future,

139
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:20,007
you and I would be friends.

140
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:23,470
I think you can change the future now.

141
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,667
I don't want to be your friend anymore.

142
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,243
From this day on,

143
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,801
I'm not talking to you anymore.

144
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:30,721
For the rest of my life.

145
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,493
Biu.

146
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:49,441
What's up, Lin?

147
00:08:58,476 --> 00:08:59,924
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:04,292
What are you sorry for?

149
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:08,410
Well...

150
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,908
Actually,

151
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,388
Lin and Nut are not dating.

152
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:18,102
Nut.

153
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:20,778
I have something to tell you.

154
00:09:21,037 --> 00:09:21,977
What is it?

155
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,860
I think...

156
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:28,659
I like you, Nut.

157
00:09:35,404 --> 00:09:36,758
I'm sorry, Lin.

158
00:09:38,664 --> 00:09:40,604
I already like someone else.

159
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,649
I was shocked at that time.

160
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:56,608
I didn't know how to respond.

161
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,635
So I just lied like that.

162
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,413
I didn't want Win and you to misunderstand each other.

163
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:08,825
I'm really sorry.

164
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,778
So, Lin and Nut

165
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,012
are not dating?

166
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,846
Yes.

167
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,618
Shit.

168
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,807
What's wrong with you?

169
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:46,222
I thought you said you'd stop being my friend for life.

170
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:47,595
Well...

171
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:49,390
I misunderstood you.

172
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:51,229
I'm sorry.

173
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,802
What are you sorry for?

174
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:58,205
For thinking that you already knew

175
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,736
that Lin and Nut were dating and didn't tell me.

176
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,893
And for letting me do something stupid.

177
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,379
So Lin and Nut aren't dating?

178
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:08,607
Yup, Lin and Nut are not dating.

179
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,068

00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:41,766
Don't you understand?

188
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:43,689
This music thing

189
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:46,197
is not going to help your future.

190
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:49,127
I don't have a future anyway, Dad.

191
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:50,934
What do you mean?

192
00:11:51,454 --> 00:11:53,694
Please just let me do what I want to do.

193
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:56,492
Because soon,

194
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:58,005
I'll be dead anyway.

195
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:01,448
What are you talking about?

196
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,456
Are you threatening me?

197
00:12:12,931 --> 00:12:14,304
You don't have to care, Dad.

198
00:12:16,975 --> 00:12:18,210
Because in the past,

199
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:20,718
you've never cared about me anyway.

200
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:34,042
So...

201
00:12:34,468 --> 00:12:35,815
you already knew

202
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,513
and let me go and make a fool of myself,

203
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:40,468
or did you not know either?

204
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:45,380
Well...

205
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,138
I just misunderstood,

206
00:12:48,162 --> 00:12:50,069
I thought Nut and Lin were already dating.

207
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:51,657
And I couldn't stop you in time.

208
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,690
Hey.

209
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:53,710
So that means

210
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,581
I should go back to being mad at you, right?

211
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:57,698
It's too late for that.

212
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:00,741
Damn, I should have stayed mad

213
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,814
and let you treat me to meals for 3 months.

214
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:07,264
And why would I have to treat you to meals?

215
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,881
Didn't you break up with me?

216
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:13,911
You told me you were breaking up with me for life.

217
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,971
Why do you keep repeating that?

218
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:18,527
Yeah, my life is short.

219
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:19,918
Are you satisfied now?

220
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:23,735
Seriously though...

221
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:25,876
are you really from the future?

222
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,525
You don't know anything.

223
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:30,709
It wasn't like this back then.

224
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,513
Then...

225
00:13:34,538 --> 00:13:36,861
that means the future you came from

226
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:38,166
can be changed.

227
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,577
I'm not sure about that.

228
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,579
I mean, I've tried.

229
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,875
Even if the method changes,

230
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,315
the result is still the same.

231
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,923
So that means

232
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,831
in the future you came from,

233
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:58,967
Lin and Nut weren't dating.

234
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:08,605
And you,

235
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,225
are you sure

236
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:11,783
that Lin and Nut are not dating now?

237
00:14:11,863 --> 00:14:12,874
Yup.

238
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,031
If you don't believe, why don't you call and ask Nut?

239
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:18,251
Then what do you want me to do?

240
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,806
Call Nut's house number.

241
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,243
And when his dad answers, say,

242
00:14:23,267 --> 00:14:24,549
"Hello, Mr. Nut's dad.

243
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,196
This is Win. May I speak to Nut?"

244
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,035
And when he comes on, I should just ask him,

245
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,184
"Are you and Lin dating right now?"

246
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,298
Like that?

247
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,582
Yes, do it now.

248
00:14:35,084 --> 00:14:36,544
That's very weird.

249
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,591
Mmm...

250
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,474
If you don't dare, then I'll call.

251
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:42,744
I remember his house number.

252
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,890
No way, Biu.

253
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:45,263
Sit down. No.

254
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,693
- No, no.
- Why not?

255
00:14:46,718 --> 00:14:48,505
If you don't dare, I'll call myself, just a second.

256
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,133
It's weird. No.

257
00:14:50,706 --> 00:14:52,826
Oh, someone's calling.

258
00:14:54,295 --> 00:14:56,003
Then I'll get it.

259
00:15:06,786 --> 00:15:07,846
Hello.

260
00:15:08,326 --> 00:15:09,968
Why do you sound so tired?

261
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:12,973
Is that Nut?

262
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,022
Yeah, it's me.

263
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:18,686
Why are you calling so late? Is something wrong?

264
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,693
Well, I have something on my mind.

265
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,761
What's on your mind?

266
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:27,645
My dad.

267
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:30,276
The misunderstanding you have about me.

268
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,337
The band.

269
00:15:33,418 --> 00:15:34,933
It's a lot of things combined.

270
00:15:36,508 --> 00:15:37,468
I think...

271
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:40,036
I didn't misunderstand anything about you, Nut.

272
00:15:41,402 --> 00:15:43,388
And about you not dating Lin,

273
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:45,402
I already know.

274
00:15:48,525 --> 00:15:50,336
Then I'm relieved about one thing.

275
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:53,648
And what about the band?

276
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:56,365
Lin told me that

277
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:59,165
Ek's parents won't let us
practice at their house anymore.

278
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,165
Mmm-hmm.

279
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:02,689
Yes.

280
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:04,730
So now we're practicing separately.

281
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,468
So will it be okay?

282
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:09,563
The competition is in a few days.

283
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:13,349
We have to make it.

284
00:16:14,022 --> 00:16:16,994
About the band, I'll try to figure something out.

285
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:19,082
So,

286
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:21,735
you've got 2 things off your mind now.

287
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:26,572
The rest is probably about your dad.

288
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:31,630
About my dad, I don't know what to do.

289
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:34,371
He's like he's possessed again.

290
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:35,936
He won't let me go to practice.

291
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,756
About this, I can only give you my support.

292
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:45,923
Yeah.

293
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,956
That's all I need.

294
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,595
Win.

295
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:00,131
What is it?

296
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:06,655
After the competition,

297
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:09,008
I have something I want to tell you.

298
00:17:22,446 --> 00:17:23,480
Win.

299
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,616
Are you still listening?

300
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,783
Can't you just tell me now?

301
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:36,751
The competition is in a few days.

302
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:39,396
Can't you wait a little longer?

303
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:46,239
Hey, Win.

304
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:48,873
My dad is coming down.

305
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:50,995
I have to hang up now.

306
00:17:51,774 --> 00:17:52,948
Good night.

307
00:18:05,425 --> 00:18:06,666
Good night.

308
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,281
"Good night."

309
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:46,968
Happy birthday, Mom.

310
00:18:47,816 --> 00:18:50,010
Oh, is it my birthday today?

311
00:18:53,192 --> 00:18:54,379
Yeah.

312
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,080
Thanks.

313
00:18:59,408 --> 00:19:01,115
What is this?

314
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:13,753
Don't tell me.

315
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,637
Is this why you went back to play at the bar?

316
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:23,451
You didn't have to buy it.

317
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:24,976
It's a waste of money.

318
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:34,910
Consider it me returning it to you, Mom.

319
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,559
For...

320
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,259
you having to sell it because of me before.

321
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,822
Oh, thanks.

322
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:54,612
Don't get into any more trouble, understand?

323
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:57,321
I don't want to see you get hurt.

324
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,663
Here. Take this.

325
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,564
Here.

326
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,908
It's my birthday, after all.

327
00:20:27,006 --> 00:20:28,432
Have a drink with your mom.

328
00:22:03,876 --> 00:22:05,696
Dad, Mom.

329
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:07,551
I have something to talk to you about.

330
00:22:17,217 --> 00:22:18,207
Hey.

331
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,540
By the way...

332
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,517
How did you get your parents
to let us practice here again?

333
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:25,041
It was nothing, just asked nicely.

334
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,354
That's it?

335
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:29,888
What should we do, guys?

336
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:31,899
The competition is the day after tomorrow.

337
00:22:32,241 --> 00:22:34,327
We have a big rehearsal tomorrow.

338
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:36,953
And you're going to let Nut go up on the actual day

339
00:22:36,977 --> 00:22:38,647
when we've been practicing separately?

340
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:40,188
That's right.

341
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,633
I have a way.

342
00:22:45,535 --> 00:22:46,582
What way?

343
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,240
Ek.

344
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:53,002
We can practice late tomorrow, right?

345
00:22:54,235 --> 00:22:55,530
No problem.

346
00:22:55,978 --> 00:22:57,812
Then don't worry.

347
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,531
Let's just practice this much for today.

348
00:23:00,757 --> 00:23:01,831
Okay, okay.

349
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:02,713

Or do you know something from the future again?

366
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:18,780
I don't really know anything.

367
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,550
But like I told you, I have a way.

368
00:24:21,816 --> 00:24:22,922
Because of that,

369
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:24,847
I couldn't sleep since last night.

370
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:26,747
What way is that?

371
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:28,960
Do you know,

372
00:24:28,985 --> 00:24:31,279
besides being able to sing and play music,

373
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,317
what else I'm good at?

374
00:24:32,486 --> 00:24:34,606
What, cooking?

375
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:37,769
It's like this.

376
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:40,326
Back when I was in university,

377
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,272
in my past life,

378
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:43,911
I lived in the dorms, right?

379
00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:46,416
And the dorms had a lot of rules.

380
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,416
Especially if you came back late,

381
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,708
you'd get points deducted.

382
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,322
So what does that have to do with anything?

383
00:24:55,391 --> 00:24:58,352
It made me discover another one of my talents.

384
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:09,656
Being a thief?

385
00:25:10,436 --> 00:25:11,971
I mean climbing into the dorm.

386
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:14,533
And how is that different from being a thief?

387
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,066
Come on.

388
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:17,934
You be the lookout.

389
00:25:17,996 --> 00:25:19,116
Yeah, yeah.

390
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:47,348
Nut.

391
00:25:51,745 --> 00:25:52,958
How did you get here?

392
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,557
Don't ask questions.

393
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:56,048
Let's just go practice. Let's go.

394
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,028
Be careful.

395
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:14,274
Quick!

396
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:16,964
Go, go, go.

397
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,301
Careful, careful.

398
00:26:19,862 --> 00:26:21,708
Just put it there.

399
00:27:26,226 --> 00:27:27,272
Lift it.

400
00:27:28,031 --> 00:27:29,038
Be careful.

401
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:33,482
Gently.

402
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:35,914
A little more.

403
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:48,228
I'm going now.

404
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,211
Wait a second.

405
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,203
Hey.

406
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:19,333
Shit.

407
00:28:30,286 --> 00:28:31,675
Why did you come up?

408
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,330
Nut.

409
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,838
The thing you were going to tell me tomorrow,

410
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,477
can you just tell me now?

411
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:39,500
Can't you wait just one more night?

412
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:50,987
Shit.

413
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,047
Go now.

414
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:07,257
No one is helping me.

415
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,428
What now?

416
00:30:02,705 --> 00:30:03,892
Want to sleep in my room?

417
00:30:10,118 --> 00:30:11,512
I probably can't sleep here.

418
00:30:12,326 --> 00:30:14,312
Your dad will catch me in the morning.

419
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:17,882
I'll sneak out later tonight.

420
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:31,474
Win.

421
00:30:35,352 --> 00:30:36,901
Thank you so much.

422
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,992
For climbing and taking me to practice.

423
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:45,079
You don't have to thank me.

424
00:30:46,449 --> 00:30:47,610
It's just a small thing.

425
00:30:50,506 --> 00:30:53,377
And what about your illness?

426
00:30:54,225 --> 00:30:55,212
How is it?

427
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:57,831
Do you see anything wrong with me?

428
00:30:58,381 --> 00:31:01,050
I was just running with you.

429
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:03,211
This is nothing.

430
00:31:05,142 --> 00:31:06,488
I don't believe you.

431
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:09,874
Trust me.

432
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:15,007
Even if I really got sick,

433
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:16,267
what could you do?

434
00:31:18,871 --> 00:31:20,839
Would you force me not to compete tomorrow?

435
00:31:28,446 --> 00:31:29,459
I guess...

436
00:31:30,506 --> 00:31:32,070
I can't force you, right?

437
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:33,965
Exactly.

438
00:31:35,355 --> 00:31:37,552
And you don't have to overthink it either.

439
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:39,699
Or you won't be able to concentrate tomorrow.

440
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:46,130
If you really don't want me to lose focus,

441
00:31:49,212 --> 00:31:50,752
the thing you want to tell me,

442
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,089
can you tell me now?

443
00:31:59,989 --> 00:32:00,962
No.

444
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,393
Win.

445
00:32:49,792 --> 00:32:51,704
I have a song that I wrote a long time ago.

446
00:32:51,728 --> 00:32:52,642
I just finished it.

447
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,625

Are you worried about me?

465
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:23,786
Do you think...

466
00:34:25,934 --> 00:34:27,554

Where are you going?

478
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:18,456
Didn't you listen to what I said?

479
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:23,589
I already told you, Dad.

480
00:36:23,735 --> 00:36:25,216
This is the path I choose.

481
00:36:26,173 --> 00:36:27,819
A path with no future?

482
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,123
I won't let you choose it, understand?

483
00:36:32,797 --> 00:36:34,517
But you have no right to force me.

484
00:36:35,085 --> 00:36:37,593
I'm your father, why wouldn't I have the right?

485
00:36:47,426 --> 00:36:49,126
This will be the last time, Dad.

486
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:54,456
I promise that if I don't win,

487
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:58,583
I will quit playing music as you wish.

488
00:37:01,575 --> 00:37:02,801
If you don't let me go,

489
00:37:02,825 --> 00:37:04,432
I will never quit.

490
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:09,108
If you want me to quit,

491
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:13,718
you should let me go and lose.

492
00:37:23,703 --> 00:37:24,843
Nut!

493
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:49,673
Biu.

494
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:52,238
Where have you been, in the jungle? Huh?

495
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:55,201
None of your business.

496
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,628
So, where's Nut?

497
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:06,315
He'll probably be here soon.

498
00:38:08,337 --> 00:38:10,270
Then I'll go call Nut.

499
00:38:10,917 --> 00:38:12,114
Thanks, Lin.

500
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:18,634
I'm going to check the stage for a bit.

501
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,793
Do you think Nut will be able to make it?

502
00:39:00,232 --> 00:39:01,593
I'm not sure.

503
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:13,474
A brain tumor has been detected.

504
00:39:14,427 --> 00:39:16,038
Looking at the symptoms,

505
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,909
it seems the symptoms have only recently appeared.

506
00:39:19,004 --> 00:39:21,576
So how will he be treated?

507
00:39:22,586 --> 00:39:24,224
It depends on several factors.

508
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:26,993
But right now, our hospital

509
00:39:27,046 --> 00:39:28,478
probably doesn't have enough equipment

510
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:30,300
for surgical treatment.

511
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:33,745
If he is to be treated,
he will have to be transferred

512
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:36,263
to have surgery in Bangkok instead.

513
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:17,542
What were you thinking?

514
00:40:18,645 --> 00:40:19,984
Why didn't you tell me?

515
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:26,102
I was going to tell you both
after today's competition.

516
00:40:26,523 --> 00:40:28,036
That's enough.

517
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,508
Rest, son.

518
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:32,033
Stop thinking about the competition.

519
00:40:32,508 --> 00:40:34,488
I'm asking you, please, son.

520
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:39,839
Mom, but I...

521
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:41,233
You have to stay here.

522
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:43,452
I'll have the doctor prepare your surgery

523
00:40:43,476 --> 00:40:44,577
as soon as possible.

524
00:40:47,902 --> 00:40:49,901
Listen to him, son.

525
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:52,328
Get some rest.

526
00:40:52,896 --> 00:40:53,943
Okay?

527
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:55,613
Slowly.

528
00:44:36,352 --> 00:44:38,455
I called his house but no one answered.

529
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,390

When you knew Mom wasn't going to make it,

537
00:45:58,117 --> 00:45:59,265
what did you do?

538
00:46:03,617 --> 00:46:05,384
In your past life,

539
00:46:06,003 --> 00:46:07,584
Nut didn't survive, right?

540
00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:11,311
He probably already left you.

541
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:12,837
You just find someone new.

542
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:14,381
I already promised.

543
00:46:14,578 --> 00:46:15,820
That after the surgery,

544
00:46:15,845 --> 00:46:17,595
I would come back to you first.

545
00:46:18,587 --> 00:46:20,437
I think I tried my best.

546
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:22,783
But the result is still the same.
