(Previously)
So, Lin and Nut

2
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:04,312
are not dating?

3
00:00:04,784 --> 00:00:07,032
How did you get your parents
to let us practice here again?

4
00:00:07,344 --> 00:00:09,277
It was nothing, just asked nicely.

5
00:00:09,288 --> 00:00:10,207
How did you get here?

6
00:00:10,232 --> 00:00:11,327
Don't ask questions.

7
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:12,654
Let's just go practice.

8
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:15,588
The thing you want to tell me...

9
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:17,242
I like you too.

10
00:00:17,292 --> 00:00:18,299
Where are you going?

11
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:21,059
I promise that if I don't win,

12
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:23,812
I will quit playing music as you wish.

13
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:26,316
A brain tumor has been detected.

14
00:00:27,102 --> 00:00:28,522
Where's Nut?

15
00:00:28,955 --> 00:00:30,228
He'll probably be here soon.

"Rearrange"
(Episode 9)

34
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:08,284
Hey, bro!

35
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,554
Are you okay? Are you alright?

36
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,768
Careful.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,986
Are you okay?

38
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,212
Sir, please take me to the competition in Soi 12.

39
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,046
You'll have to show me the way.

40
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,801
Thank you very much.
Follow me.

41
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:25,954
Careful.

42
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:51,809
Hey, Nut.

43
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,176
What happened?

44
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:54,415
Don't ask yet.

45
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,766
Find me some clothes to change.

46
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:10,053
Do I look okay?

47
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:14,176
I think you should put on some makeup.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,555
It'll make you look fresher.

49
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:18,191
Biu.

50
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:20,383
Do you have any makeup I can borrow?

51
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:22,358
I don't have any.

52
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:24,853
What about you, Lin?

53
00:03:26,952 --> 00:03:28,505
I didn't bring any.

54
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,317
Hey guys, it's almost time.

55
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:39,727
Okay.

56
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:40,999
Wait a minute.

57
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,422
Yes?

58
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:45,885
Do you have any makeup I can borrow?

59
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,036
Honestly,

60
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:04,942
if you're not well,

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,912
I'd rather you be at the hospital.

62
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:11,802
How are you guys going to win without me?

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,910
I have to finish this competition.

64
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:28,531
Trust me.

65
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:30,038
I'm fine.

66
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:52,808
Shit.

67
00:04:53,188 --> 00:04:54,673
I went to check the stage.

68
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:56,252
Those guys played like gods.

69
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,790
You're usually so confident.

70
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:00,270
Are you getting scared now?

71
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:01,587
Just listen.

72
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,247
Here, here.

73
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,625
The drums are so tight.

74
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,044
The bass is so smooth.

75
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:13,075
I don't think we can make it.

76
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:15,529
Listen to me, guys.

77
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:18,082
The fact that our band has come this far

78
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,362
means that we're not inferior to anyone.

79
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,925
Trust me, we can do this.

80
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,800
I can do it, I can do it.

81
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,584
I can do it, I can do it, I can do it.

82
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:38,360
Let's do it.

83
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,641
Let's give it a shot.

84
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:41,146
Let's power up.

85
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,262
Come on.

86
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:49,390
3, 2, 1.

87
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,177
Yeah!

88
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,167
Hey guys, if you're ready,

89
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:57,805
please standby backstage.

90
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,587
Let's go.

91
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,414
I'll go wait and film in the front.

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,116
Good luck.

93
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:07,529
Let's go.

94
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:10,803
Hey.

95
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,043
Your face could make you a star.

96
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,291
Don't tease me, just go.

97
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,089
Here you go.

98
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,620
Thank you.

99
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:22,865
You're welcome.

100
00:06:25,957 --> 00:06:27,590
Please welcome the band "TIMELIED" to the stage.

101
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:47,489

Nut!

135
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:01,945
Nut!

00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:04,135
Nut!

137
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:05,590
Nut!

138
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:40,463
Did we win?

139
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:47,201
You never told us anything.

140
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,116
What the hell is wrong with you?

141
00:09:54,563 --> 00:09:56,571
I was going to tell you guys after the competition.

142
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,817
If I knew, I wouldn't have let you compete.

143
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:14,941
The doctor has scheduled the surgery.

144
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:24,132
You're going to be okay, Nut.

145
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,191
I promise.

146
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,403
Thanks.

147
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:05,928
Aek.

148
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,444
Is something wrong?

149
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,160
Are you worried about Nut?

150
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:20,423
Don't worry about him.

151
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,961
He'll be fine, trust me.

152
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:24,289
How about this?

153
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:25,595
Let's go get something to eat tomorrow.

154
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,774
I probably have tutoring at school.

155
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:34,982
If we don't have practice anymore,

156
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,244
will we still see each other?

157
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,027
I'll call you.

158
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:09,183
Can I walk with you?

159
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:10,417
Mmm.

160
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,618
Are you worried about Nut?

161
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,001
Mmm, I'm worried about him.

162
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,983
I know I can't be more than this.

163
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:23,870
But I'm still worried about him.

164
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:29,050
Nut is going to be fine, trust me.

165
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:30,678
Mmm.

166
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:02,472
Come on, son.

167
00:13:03,335 --> 00:13:05,802
If you don't win this time,
there's always a next time.

168
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,109
Win is the best.

169
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:13,172
You'll definitely win.

170
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,983
Yes.

171
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:17,340
And also,

172
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,985
the next time there's a singing competition,

173
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,572
I'll take you to sign up myself.

174
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:57,371
Where are your parents?

175
00:13:57,764 --> 00:13:59,037
My dad went to work.

176
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:00,917
My mom probably went to buy food.

177
00:14:10,385 --> 00:14:11,452
Are you okay?

178
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:14,257
I'm great.

179
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:17,392
You don't have to come see me every day.

180
00:14:19,156 --> 00:14:20,111
No.

181
00:14:20,957 --> 00:14:23,743
I miss you, can't I come see you?

182
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:26,074
Of course.

183
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,078
I miss you too.

184
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,012
It has to be like this.

185
00:14:35,404 --> 00:14:37,679
So when do you have to go to Bangkok?

186
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:40,967
Probably tomorrow morning.

187
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:43,136
My mom said that

188
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,561
the doctor scheduled for the evening.

189
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:53,518
And did the doctor say

190
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,289
if it will be completely cured after the surgery?

191
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:00,313
The doctor couldn't confirm.

192
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:03,605
It depends on many things.

193
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,166
Win.

194
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,384
I promise.

195
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,782
After the surgery is done,

196
00:15:17,305 --> 00:15:18,992
I'll come back to you first.

197
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,572
When did I buy this?

198
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:33,570
Wooow.

199
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:36,547
Ah, the sleeve is torn.

200
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:55,300
Oh, this song was so cool back then.

201
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:56,153
The rhythm is so good.

202
00:15:56,178 --> 00:15:57,935
It's like, "ting, ting, ting," and then the vocals.

203
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,006
"Ting, ting, ting," and then the vocals.

204
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,961
And then, "boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!"

205
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:04,696
Awesome, so cool.

206
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:08,821
Is something wrong?

207
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:14,000
When you knew Mom wasn't going to make it,

208
00:16:15,252 --> 00:16:16,278
what did you do?

209
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:29,170
I just told your mom

210
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:32,442
to be at ease.

211
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,320
Not to worry.

212
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,562
Because I'm good at being alone.

213
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:40,948
Even though, in reality...

214
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:43,394
I wasn't good at it at all.

215
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:52,070
Let's party.

216
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:53,881
Hello, Dad.

217
00:16:55,803 --> 00:16:58,239
Okay, it's my time now.

218
00:16:58,364 --> 00:16:59,738
Make yourselves at home.

219
00:17:10,772 --> 00:17:12,225
Are you okay?

220
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:18,596
How did you know I'm not okay?

221
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,791
Well,

222
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:21,257
Nut is having surgery tomorrow.

223
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:22,717
Lin told me.

224
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,899
We're all very worried about Nut.

225
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:33,810
But Nut probably wouldn't want to see us so down, right?

226
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,232
True.

227
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:37,509
That's why I invited everyone here.

228
00:17:39,986 --> 00:17:41,326
Not everyone is here.

229
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,903
Oh, Aek couldn't make it.

230
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:47,325
He said he has a lot of tutoring for his exams.

231
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,602
Come on.

232
00:17:55,627 --> 00:17:56,882
Let's have a toast.

233
00:17:57,098 --> 00:17:58,373
Come on, cheers.

234
00:17:58,588 --> 00:17:59,836
Let's do it.

235
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,965
Let's send our support to Nut. Let's go!

236
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:03,727
Yay~

237
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:05,410
You should say "yay" too.

238
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:06,768
Again, 1, 2, 3.

239
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,092
Yay~

240
00:18:11,969 --> 00:18:13,333
Refreshing.

241
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:15,427
Thank you all so much.

242
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,102
I feel much better.

243
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,865
But why didn't you buy me some red soda?

244
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,920
Hey, who bought these?

245
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,430
There are only 3?

246
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,285
I didn't buy them.

247
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:28,972
It's okay.

248
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:30,616
Hey.

249
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:33,978
No.

250
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:35,538
Give it to me.

251
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:37,838
Then the watermelon is mine.

252
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:38,718
Hey.

253
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:40,777
Hey, hey, hey.

254
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:42,257
Let me have a piece.

255
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:51,302
Daranphop.

256
00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:53,869
Daranphop!

257
00:18:55,242 --> 00:18:56,189
Yes, teacher.

258
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,675
What was I just talking about?

259
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:04,280
The history of Ayutthaya.

260
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:06,375
What?

261
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:08,450
The history of Ayutthaya.

262
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:12,373
The history of American, sir.

263
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:13,204
Huh?

264
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:14,857
America?

265
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,980
Sigh.

266
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,059
Even with a friend helping,

267
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,490
you still got it wrong.

268
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:24,234
If you two want to whisper so much,

269
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,009
go whisper outside the classroom.

270
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,535
Sir, but...

271
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,638
No buts.

272
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:31,430
Go stand on one leg outside the classroom now.

273
00:19:36,027 --> 00:19:37,062
Hurry up.

274
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,369
In your past life,

275
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:53,540
Nut didn't survive, right?

276
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:00,683
Mmm.

277
00:20:03,204 --> 00:20:06,927
And do you think in this life,

278
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,689
anything can be changed?

279
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:16,194
Honestly, I don't know.

280
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:21,585
But at least in this life,

281
00:20:23,043 --> 00:20:24,863
I got to do what I wanted to do.

282
00:20:26,563 --> 00:20:27,627
Do what?

283
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,347
Maybe you...

284
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,155
Yes.

285
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:38,869
I...

286
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,784
I confessed my love to him.

287
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:42,471
Shit.

288
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:45,514
Why didn't you tell me?

289
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:49,329
And what happened?

290
00:20:50,373 --> 00:20:51,946
I'm not telling you.

291
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:57,408
"I'm not telling you."

292
00:20:58,621 --> 00:20:59,956
If you don't tell me,

293
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,225
I'll find out anyway.

294
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,225
Hey.

295
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:07,014
What are you two talking about?

296
00:21:07,957 --> 00:21:09,483
Do you want to get in trouble again?

297
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:11,588
You're still talking even though

298
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:13,220
you're being punished.

299
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:02,595
Win.

300
00:22:03,595 --> 00:22:05,056
So this is where you are.

301
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,209
I was so worried.

302
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,898
I went to your house but you weren't there.

303
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:16,073
After the surgery, he won't be back right away.

304
00:22:16,097 --> 00:22:17,911
He'll have to stay in the hospital for a while.

305
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,981
If you're this impatient,

306
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,538
you should just follow him to Bangkok.

307
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:26,286
Even if I followed him to Bangkok,

308
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:28,670
I still wouldn't know which hospital he's at.

309
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:31,429
Oh, and in your past life...

310
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,905
In my past life...

311
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:38,873
Nut died while he was still here.

312
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:40,077
Hey.

313
00:22:40,102 --> 00:22:41,768
So that means we have hope.

314
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:43,352
Right?

315
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:48,406
But I don't dare to hope, Biu.

316
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:52,742
Come on.

317
00:22:52,767 --> 00:22:54,158
If you keep standing here,

318
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:56,020
the doctor won't operate any better.

319
00:22:57,812 --> 00:22:59,172
Let's go get some ice cream with me.

320
00:22:59,196 --> 00:22:59,872
Come on.

321
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:03,158
Come on.

322
00:23:03,183 --> 00:23:05,139
I'll give you 2 scoops.

323
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:07,542
Give me your backpack, I'll carry it.

324
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:56,697
Pass the chicken.

325
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,080
Sir, your water.

326
00:24:08,348 --> 00:24:09,293
Aek.

327
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:11,020
Is the food not good, son?

328
00:24:12,943 --> 00:24:14,898
No, I just don't have an appetite.

329
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:19,595
Aek.

330
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:21,494
You know, right?

331
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:23,842
That you

332
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:25,964
can talk to your mom and dad

333
00:24:25,988 --> 00:24:28,390
about any of your problems.

334
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,513
Okay, son?

335
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,176
Let's eat, son.

336
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,694
I'll serve you some chicken.

337
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:38,617
Here, eat a lot.

338
00:24:38,641 --> 00:24:39,670
It's all protein.

339
00:24:44,998 --> 00:24:47,480
I haven't been feeling like myself lately.

340
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:49,550
I just keep thinking about the same thing

341
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:51,130
over and over.

342
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:54,004
When I think about it,

343
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:55,601
I can't stop thinking about it.

344
00:24:58,034 --> 00:25:00,129
Is there anything I can do to help, son?

345
00:25:16,311 --> 00:25:18,161
He probably already left you.

346
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,886
You just find someone new.

347
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,629
Oh, Mom.

348
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,507
Aren't you going to cheer for us to make it?

349
00:25:24,103 --> 00:25:25,547
He's a rich man's son.

350
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:28,469
But he's a rich man's son.

351
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,842
And what do you have to compare to him,

352
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:32,310
huh?

353
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:44,087
Here.

354
00:25:44,365 --> 00:25:45,333
Cheers.

355
00:25:45,476 --> 00:25:46,956
With orange juice?

356
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:48,442
Anything goes.

357
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:50,805
Come on.

358
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,085
Okay, okay.

359
00:26:02,123 --> 00:26:03,723
You can toast with orange juice.

360
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:06,191
Why did you waste money buying alcohol?

361
00:26:09,452 --> 00:26:10,772
Don't fall.

362
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,458
Oh no, no, no.

363
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:18,849
Oh, got hit.

364
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:31,556
Hello, Nut.

365
00:26:32,432 --> 00:26:33,900
Can I speak to Pod, please?

366
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:35,894
There's no one named Pod here.

367
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:38,657
Sorry, wrong number.

368
00:26:45,552 --> 00:26:46,900
Start over, start over.

369
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:49,140
Win, You're waiting for a long time.

370
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,430
If something happened to Nut,

371
00:26:51,454 --> 00:26:53,100
someone would have called by now.

372
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:56,372
But if Nut wakes up,

373
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:58,158
someone would have to call too.

374
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,800
Maybe he hasn't woken up yet.

375
00:26:59,825 --> 00:27:00,854
Dad!

376
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,234
Well, it's possible.

377
00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:05,403
Game over.

378
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,254
I'm not dreaming, am I?

379
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,053
I have to thank you.

380
00:28:29,277 --> 00:28:30,350
For what?

381
00:28:42,272 --> 00:28:43,409
The doctor said that

382
00:28:46,035 --> 00:28:47,410
if I had fallen then

383
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,599
and hit my head on the ground,

384
00:28:53,295 --> 00:28:54,923
my condition would have been much worse.

385
00:28:58,235 --> 00:28:59,325
Oh.

386
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:01,716
And the doctor also said

387
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:04,856
that it was because before,

388
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:07,777
I had been exercising

389
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:10,968
and eating many good things.

390
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,006
After the surgery,

391
00:29:16,223 --> 00:29:17,763
I recovered very quickly.

392
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:27,860
Panting like this, are you okay?

393
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:32,525
I'm fine.

394
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:36,636
I'm so fit I could compete again.

395
00:29:41,076 --> 00:29:42,443
And why are you making this for me?

396
00:29:43,796 --> 00:29:45,624
So you can eat all your meals.

397
00:29:45,648 --> 00:29:46,904
So you won't faint again.

398
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:52,518
You saved my life.

399
00:29:54,343 --> 00:29:55,283
Do you know that?

400
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:41,946
Thank you.

401
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,285
Nut.

402
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,252
You're feeling better now, right?

403
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,291
Yes, Dad.

404
00:31:11,115 --> 00:31:13,042
Then you'll probably be able to

405
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:14,274
get on a plane soon.

406
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:20,818
Get on a plane?

407
00:31:21,758 --> 00:31:23,078
Where are we going, Dad?

408
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,600
Well,

409
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:28,323
to study a foundation course in England first.

410
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:31,050
And will you be going with him, Lin?

411
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:37,740
I already have a foundation,

412
00:31:38,262 --> 00:31:40,489
I'll probably fly out when school starts.

413
00:31:44,178 --> 00:31:46,062
It's still many months before school starts.

414
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,249
Isn't it too soon?

415
00:31:48,563 --> 00:31:49,545
Not at all.

416
00:31:49,569 --> 00:31:52,085
Nut's foundation isn't very good yet.

417
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:54,178
So he should go and prepare beforehand.

418
00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:58,720
I don't want him to waste time

419
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,232
on anything here anymore.

420
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,694
I'm sorry.

421
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:29,222
I didn't know

422
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:31,357
that my dad would suddenly say that.

423
00:32:34,674 --> 00:32:35,749
It's okay.

424
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:39,218
I think your dad is right.

425
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:41,695
If you're really going to study in England,

426
00:32:41,719 --> 00:32:43,120
you need to take a foundation course.

427
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:50,416
Honestly,

428
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:53,155
he's just looking for an excuse
to stop me playing music.

429
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:02,958
So,

430
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:05,927
you really have to go, right?

431
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:10,073
I can't argue with him.

432
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,743
I once made a deal with him that

433
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:17,154
if I didn't win the competition,

434
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:21,450
I would obey him in everything.

435
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,663
And we

436
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,496
didn't win.

437
00:33:52,752 --> 00:33:54,374
I can't explain it.

438
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,286
Lately, I haven't been able to sleep well.

439
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,970
I just keep thinking about one person.

440
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,211
When I think about him,

441
00:34:03,825 --> 00:34:04,865
I feel pain.

442
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:07,142
It's like my heart is breaking.

443
00:34:08,637 --> 00:34:10,900
The person you said you're thinking about,

444
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,977
is it Chai?

445
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:25,725
Aek.

446
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:27,480
I understand,

447
00:34:28,011 --> 00:34:29,566
what you're thinking.

448
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,021
And your mom and I are happy

449
00:34:32,794 --> 00:34:34,595
that you're willing to open up

450
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,445
and talk to us about this.

451
00:34:39,523 --> 00:34:43,189
Did you and Mom already know?

452
00:34:45,297 --> 00:34:49,224
Actually, we both had some idea, right?

453
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:53,394
But to be honest, at first,

454
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:57,512
I was very worried about your safety.

455
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:00,622
But now,

456
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:02,768
your mom and I have been thinking that

457
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,110
when you're not seeing Chai,

458
00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:06,823
I really feel that

459
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,811
it's hurting you a lot. I understand.

460
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:17,020
So about seeing Chai,

461
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,550
your mom and I won't stop you anymore.

462
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,837
And about the promise you made that

463
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:27,474
you would come back to use the rehearsal room

464
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:31,804
and then stop seeing Chai after the competition,

465
00:35:31,828 --> 00:35:35,270
I think we should just forget about that.

466
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:38,819
Yes, let's just forget about it, okay?

467
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:40,860
Aek.

468
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:43,071
I'm asking you,

469
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:47,155
don't put yourself in a dangerous situation again.

470
00:35:47,321 --> 00:35:48,401
Okay, son?

471
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:51,237
I promise, Dad, Mom.

472
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,597
Aek.

473
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:00,844
There's one more thing.

474
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,952
I'll give you my bodyguard's number.

475
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:06,092
Do you want it?

476
00:36:08,523 --> 00:36:09,746
You can eat now.

477
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,140
You're feeling better, right?

478
00:36:11,451 --> 00:36:13,217
Do you want my bodyguard's number?

479
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:16,530
I'm serious.

480
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:40,069
Hello, Chai.

481
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:41,744
Do you want to get moo krata tomorrow?

482
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:46,708
I'm not free tomorrow. I'm sorry.

483
00:36:54,881 --> 00:36:55,968
Come on.

484
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:00,156
1...

485
00:37:02,502 --> 00:37:05,282
1, 2, 3.

486
00:37:09,152 --> 00:37:10,567
Waste of film.

487
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,820
Can you make another face?

488
00:37:15,972 --> 00:37:17,580
I can't change the outcome, Biu.

489
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:21,997
I think I tried my best.

490
00:37:27,071 --> 00:37:28,517
But the result is still the same.

491
00:37:57,237 --> 00:37:59,252
Even if Nut doesn't die in the end,

492
00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:05,356
I won't get to be with him.

493
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,070
I don't know what to say.

494
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:17,973
Let's just say

495
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:20,875
I'm here with you.

496
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,554
Biu, is something wrong?

497
00:38:46,238 --> 00:38:49,900
When you have to be away from the one you love,

498
00:38:51,364 --> 00:38:53,867
just thinking about it hurts, doesn't it?

499
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:57,873
Mmm.

500
00:38:58,473 --> 00:38:59,679
It must hurt a lot.

501
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:04,638
Why did you invite me here?

502
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,941
Well, since the competition ended,

503
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:08,469
I've been very lonely.

504
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,009
I don't know what to do.

505
00:39:11,044 --> 00:39:13,319
And how's Nut?

506
00:39:14,323 --> 00:39:15,343
I heard that

507
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:19,058
he has to take a foundation course.

508
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:21,861
But he hasn't even finished school in Thailand.

509
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:24,167
Can he just go and study like that?

510
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:26,159
Yes.

511
00:39:26,371 --> 00:39:28,119
Because his dad let him take the equivalency exam.

512
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:30,532
So Nut has to study hard lately.

513
00:39:31,322 --> 00:39:32,309
Mmm...

514
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,124
Just listening to it makes me stressed for him.

515
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:39,136
But don't worry, Biu.

516
00:39:39,461 --> 00:39:41,342
I'll be here until I finish 12th grade for sure.

517
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,168
You won't be lonely.

518
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,238
What?

519
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:47,242
Me, lonely? No way.

520
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:50,345
Then should I just leave?

521
00:39:51,741 --> 00:39:52,790
No.

522
00:39:52,814 --> 00:39:54,034
I was just kidding.

523
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,795
But actually, I don't want you to go, Lin.

524
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:02,907
Can you not go?

525
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:06,365
Okay.

526
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:08,907
But you have to talk to my parents.

527
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:11,949
Hey, how can I do that?

528
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,167
Hello.

529
00:40:22,522 --> 00:40:23,589
What is it?

530
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:25,322
Nut is studying.

531
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:31,137
I just want to know, sir.

532
00:40:32,492 --> 00:40:34,374
Do you really want Nut to go to England,

533
00:40:35,027 --> 00:40:36,629
or do you just not want him to play music?

534
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,593
Why do you want to know?

535
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,761
Don't you think

536
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:44,938
that if Nut is far away,

537
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,905
he might secretly play music again?

538
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:49,768
No way.

539
00:40:50,945 --> 00:40:52,594
I'm sending Nut to live with relatives.

540
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,369
If he secretly plays again, I'll know anyway.

541
00:40:59,496 --> 00:41:00,869
Stop trying, Win.

542
00:41:02,624 --> 00:41:05,646
Letting him go to that useless music competition

543
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,951
was already enough.

544
00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:12,993
But you know, right?

545
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:16,703
How torturous it is to live a life we didn't choose.

546
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:17,927
It's just so painful.

547
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:21,637
Weren't you a musician once?

548
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:26,641
My life isn't torturous at all.

549
00:41:27,709 --> 00:41:29,146
And I still believe that

550
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,784
if I had chosen to be a musician back then,

551
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:33,687
my life might have been more torturous.

552
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:36,575
And I don't want Nut to be like that.

553
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:39,919
Stuck in a useless dream

554
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:42,014
that can't make a living.

555
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:46,996
Then

556
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:49,065
just let Nut stay in Thailand,

557
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:51,279
but without playing music. Can't you?

558
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:55,938
As long as you guys are around him,

559
00:41:56,572 --> 00:41:57,525
one day,

560
00:41:58,395 --> 00:42:00,377
you'll invite him to play again, right?

561
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:04,007
Just like when you climbed into the house

562
00:42:04,031 --> 00:42:05,507
and secretly took Nut out.

563
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,420
Let me teach you.

564
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:17,677
As a friend of Nut's,

565
00:42:19,651 --> 00:42:20,598
give it up.

566
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:22,968
The dream of being a musician.

567
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,800
Go find something useful to do.

568
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:32,459
Playing music is not a viable profession.

569
00:43:24,537 --> 00:43:26,010
Here, Tim, an omelet.

570
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:32,452
Here, this.

571
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:34,744
Dad.
What?

572
00:43:36,062 --> 00:43:38,088
Do you think I should go study in England?

573
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:40,319
Good.

574
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,200
But wait for me to make money first.

575
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:45,535
You're just joking.

576
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:47,590
Where are we going to get the money from?

577
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:52,386
If you want to go, I can find it.

578
00:43:54,624 --> 00:43:56,225
You're going to borrow from someone else.

579
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:57,883
Oh, you figured it out.

580
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:00,977
Who am I going to borrow from, an angel?

581
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:03,540
You have to earn it with your own sweat.

582
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:08,017
Hey, Win!

583
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:09,600
Hey, Win!

584
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,555
Win, Win, Win!

585
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,566
What's wrong with you?

586
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:13,727
Reading this.

587
00:44:17,814 --> 00:44:19,862
Our band is so cool.

588
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:23,089
Hey, where are you going?

589
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,410
This house is full of surprises.

590
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:31,476
They come and go as they please.

591
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,734
There's always something exciting.

592
00:44:44,045 --> 00:44:45,051
Nut!

593
00:44:46,012 --> 00:44:47,006
Nut!

594
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:50,256
Nut!

595
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:54,242
Nut!

596
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:11,259
Win.

597
00:45:21,202 --> 00:45:22,050
You're going to England

598
00:45:22,074 --> 00:45:23,322
and not even going to say goodbye?

599
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,559
England? What are you talking about?

600
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:28,041
I still have a lot to prepare.

601
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,740
Oh.

602
00:45:31,513 --> 00:45:32,335
Well,

603
00:45:33,562 --> 00:45:36,269
I saw you putting your suitcase in the car.

604
00:45:37,259 --> 00:45:38,180
The suitcase wheel is broken,

605
00:45:38,204 --> 00:45:39,260
so I'm taking it to get fixed.

606
00:45:40,773 --> 00:45:41,866
So what's up?

607
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,192
Damn!

608
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:04,923
We're going to release a tape!

609
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:07,581
Shit, we're releasing a tape.

610
00:46:12,628 --> 00:46:13,654
Really?

611
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,540
The label contacted us.

612
00:46:55,241 --> 00:46:57,293
(Next Episode)
Have you guys heard from the producer yet?

613
00:46:57,324 --> 00:46:59,232
We're going to have a concert.

614
00:46:59,534 --> 00:47:01,724
I never thought a small band could come this far.

615
00:47:01,748 --> 00:47:03,477
I'm so happy.

616
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,404
You're not free to celebrate with friends,

617
00:47:05,643 --> 00:47:07,530
but you're here, just the two of us like this.

618
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,505
I can't think of anything good.

619
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,653
Chai, I...

620
00:47:14,677 --> 00:47:15,805
Hey, I'm going home now.

621
00:47:17,169 --> 00:47:18,848
Hurry up and clear it up.

622
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,070
I told you not to buy it.

623
00:47:22,149 --> 00:47:25,158
Don't compare my work with what you do.
