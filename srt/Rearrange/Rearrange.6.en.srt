00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,677
(Previously)
How did you come from the future?

2
00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:03,642
Or were you turned into a robot

3
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:04,797
and sent on a Time Machine

4
00:00:04,821 --> 00:00:06,141
to come back and do some mission?

5
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:07,369
Everyone.

6
00:00:07,394 --> 00:00:08,758
Phop is gone.

7
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:11,138
This time, I couldn't help you again.

8
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,745
And don't worry.

9
00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:15,032
Phop's shop will stay the same.

10
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:17,328
Practice hard, kids.

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,377
Mom and I will be cheering for you.

12
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:20,555
I'm taking you to apply

13
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:21,865
for a scholarship to study abroad.

14
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:22,889
No.

15
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,837
I really want to show my dad.

16
00:00:24,976 --> 00:00:26,509
There's only one way, isn't there?

17
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:27,990

"Rearrange" (Episode 6)

50
00:02:46,098 --> 00:02:48,624
"Get to the final round"

51
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:05,344
I like you.

52
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,814
Travel safely.

53
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:37,894
Yes, goodbye Dad. Goodbye Mom.

54
00:03:39,356 --> 00:03:41,267
Aek, you took the
mosquito repellent, right?

55
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,139
Yes, Mom.
Flashlight?

56
00:03:43,112 --> 00:03:44,112
I took it.

57
00:03:44,994 --> 00:03:46,244
What about clean water?

58
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,811
Did you have Ton prepare it yet?

59
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:49,213
I'm afraid that up there,

60
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:51,511
you won't have clean
water to wash your face.

61
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:53,015
Mom.

62
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,320
You don't have to worry at all.

63
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:57,008
Mmm, okay.

64
00:03:57,374 --> 00:04:00,158
If you want anything, Aek, just tell Ton.

65
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:00,791
Okay.

66
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:02,271
I'm so worried.

67
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:04,538
Hey, Aek.

68
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,898
It's not just Mom who's worried.

69
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:08,177
Dad is worried too, you know.

70
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:08,802
Okay.

71
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:10,716
Go, you'll be late.

72
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,741
I'm going now, Mom.

73
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,174
Chai.

74
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:36,518
You forgot your hat.

75
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,543
Hey.

76
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,079
Thank you.

77
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:41,312
How did you find it?

78
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:43,084
Thank you.

79
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:48,553
I'm going now.

80
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:50,352
Okay.

81
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:26,888
Lin.

82
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,103
I think Nut

83
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,649
seems like a good kid.

84
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,157
I think he's nice.

85
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:35,215
And what do you think, Lin?

86
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:40,644
Yes, Dad.

87
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:43,169
Nut is a very good person.

88
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:48,336
And how do you feel about Nut?

89
00:05:51,774 --> 00:05:53,503
What do you mean, Dad?

90
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:57,158
He doesn't mean anything by it.

91
00:05:57,183 --> 00:05:59,086
He just wants to ask you

92
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,162
after you finish 12th grade,

93
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,106
since you're going to
study in England together,

94
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:05,442
should you two get engaged?

95
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:08,416
So you won't be the subject of town gossip.

96
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,337
What do you think?

97
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,911
I...

98
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:19,946
I'm late.

99
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,006
Let's talk about this when I get back.

100
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:24,521
Goodbye. Goodbye.

101
00:06:31,012 --> 00:06:32,867
Hey, why the sudden camping trip?

102
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:35,872
Dad, you're asking now?

103
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:38,572
Isn't asking at any time the same?

104
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:40,471
Well, yes.

105
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:42,814
But if you change your mind now,

106
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:44,032
it's too late, Dad.

107
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:46,298
True.

108
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:49,424
I'm going to look for
inspiration to write a song.

109
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:51,184
Because in the final round,

110
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,608
we have to use a new original song.

111
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:55,994
How about this?

112
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,193
If you want help, just let me know, okay?

113
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,301
Thank you very much.

114
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,468
Why can't my dad understand me like this?

115
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:15,016
Why don't you understand me?

116
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,368
Win, listen to me first, understand?

117
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:18,831
I don't want to listen anymore, Dad.

118
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,952
I already told you I
don't want to play music.

119
00:07:20,976 --> 00:07:22,271
Why do you keep pestering me?

120
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,424
You used to like playing.

121
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,904
So why the sudden change?

122
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:26,002
Is it because of Nut?

123
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,711
It has nothing to do with Nut.

124
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,467
Even if Nut hadn't died,

125
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:30,971
I would have quit music anyway.

126
00:07:31,345 --> 00:07:32,733
Wait, wait, wait.

127
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:36,021
Shouldn't you think
about it carefully first?

128
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,436
I've thought it through, Dad.

129
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:41,982
If playing music means
having a life like yours,

130
00:07:42,364 --> 00:07:43,676
I'd rather do something else.

131
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:57,655
Dad.

132
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:01,229
That song you're writing,

133
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:03,298
how's it going?

134
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,516
I'll sing it for you when
we get there, okay?

135
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:20,056
Dad.

136
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:22,443
If we had a motorcycle,
we could have driven right here.

137
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,761
We walked so far.

138
00:08:23,801 --> 00:08:24,699
Okay, I get it.

139
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:26,123
But we're past that point now, son.

140
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:28,163
At least we're here now.

141
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,468
- Most importantly...
- Win, Nut.

142
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:31,637
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello.

143
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:32,970
How's the atmosphere?

144
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:33,994
Is it amazing?

145
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,018
Amazing, the atmosphere is great.

146
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,441
The cool weather is just right.

147
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:39,108
Dad.

148
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:41,532
Should we find a spot to set up
the tent before it gets dark?

149
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,300
I'll leave this with you, Dad.

150
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:47,029
Tim, go help me over there.

151
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:48,746
See you.

152
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,797
I'll help too.

153
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,143
Get it done properly, Tim.

154
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:56,240
Hey, have you guys been here long?

155
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,666
A little while.

156
00:08:58,106 --> 00:08:59,843
So what were you thinking,

157
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,798
coming all this way to celebrate a victory?

158
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:04,519
We can't call it a victory celebration yet.

159
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:07,252
We've only made it to the finals.

160
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:08,911
Yeah, that's it.

161
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:11,257
So tired.

162
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:23,617
Tired.

163
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:26,259
But it's worth it, right?

164
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,149
Of course.

165
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:33,882
It's more than worth it for you.

166
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:35,069
Staring like that.

167
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,535
Let's go, help me set up the tent first.

168
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:39,989
Before I help you,

169
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,583
I'll go help Lin first.

170
00:09:45,435 --> 00:09:46,575
Need any help?

171
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,513
I'll poke it.

172
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:31,318
Hey.

173
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:33,357
Were you ever a boy scout?

174
00:10:34,812 --> 00:10:35,984
Never.

175
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,859
Oh.

176
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:41,353
You're an international school kid.

177
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:43,291
Give it to me.

178
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,513
I'll teach you.

179
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:02,613
Just this.

180
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:04,861
Okay.

181
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:06,489
There, the fire is lit.

182
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,695
Sorry, man.

183
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,937
You want to play like this, right?

184
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,832
I have a lot of charcoal.

185
00:11:27,315 --> 00:11:28,757
Hey, man.

186
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,181
I didn't mean to.

187
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,341
Look.

188
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:33,827
You got more than me.

189
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:34,854
Here, the other side.

190
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:36,641
Come here.

191
00:11:37,382 --> 00:11:38,382
Come here.

192
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:43,121
Come here now.

193
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,177
Okay, all set.

194
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:52,471
Hey, Dad.

195
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:54,524
We only have one tent?

196
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:55,549
Yes.

197
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,424
Then how are we going to sleep?

198
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:58,482
All 3 of us?

199
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:00,529
Yes, we have to sleep together.

200
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,118
When Tim was little,
we slept together like this.

201
00:12:03,142 --> 00:12:04,581
It's not a big deal, don't overthink it.

202
00:12:04,605 --> 00:12:06,658
Hey, but Tim is bigger now.

203
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:12,642
Um...

204
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,553
Actually, my tent...

205
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:17,101
I'm staying alone.

206
00:12:19,707 --> 00:12:21,121
Win, you can sleep with me.

207
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:26,819
Um...

208
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:31,848
Okay.

209
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:35,209
Dad.

210
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:36,267
Then...

211
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,002
I'll sleep with Nut.

212
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:41,561
Okay.

213
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,051
Are you satisfied now?

214
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,501
Bring the stuff in.

215
00:12:53,126 --> 00:12:54,141
Ouch.

216
00:12:56,387 --> 00:12:58,054
Here, I'll help.

217
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,579
Is something wrong, Lin?

218
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:09,816
What are you thinking about?

219
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,018
Nothing.

220
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:13,543
I was just lost in thought.

221
00:13:21,655 --> 00:13:22,721
Biu.

222
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,287
I've finished starting the fire.

223
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,325
Where's the pork?

224
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:27,764
Pork?

225
00:13:27,788 --> 00:13:29,043
Was I supposed to buy it?

226
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:33,290
You forgot again, didn't you?

227
00:13:36,932 --> 00:13:37,932
Go.

228
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,081
Buy the pork.

229
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,175
Have you been waiting long?

230
00:13:55,975 --> 00:13:57,125
Why are you looking at me?

231
00:13:57,627 --> 00:13:58,667
No reason.

232
00:13:59,342 --> 00:14:00,342
Here.

233
00:14:01,148 --> 00:14:02,948
This is your hat.

234
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:06,880
What hat?

235
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:10,793
Hey.

236
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,273
The one I told you about.

237
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:14,039
It's yours.

238
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:15,759
Thank you.

239
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:18,143
Put this on, and then

240
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:20,404
go buy pork with me.

241
00:14:22,932 --> 00:14:23,932
Let's go.

242
00:14:25,218 --> 00:14:26,752
Let's go buy pork.

243
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,159
Biu always forgets.

244
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,105
You know?

245
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:52,170
I used to think that I
wanted to have a band,

246
00:14:54,154 --> 00:14:55,754
and invite everyone to go camping,

247
00:14:56,394 --> 00:14:58,394
to sit and eat mookrata
like this for a long time.

248
00:14:59,624 --> 00:15:00,921
You...

249
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:02,728
seem to know my heart.

250
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:06,698
Honestly?

251
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:08,622
I...

252
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:10,446
know everything about your heart.

253
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:16,164
Then, from 1 to 1,000,000,

254
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,440
what number am I thinking of right now?

255
00:15:21,361 --> 00:15:22,962
1 to 1,000,000?

256
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,679
Who could possibly know that?

257
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,039
Hey, just try to guess.

258
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,639
Win.

259
00:15:32,157 --> 00:15:34,034
Go get some more firewood.

260
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,699
The charcoal is almost gone.

261
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,070
Sure.

262
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,291
26.

263
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,983
I'm guessing 26.

264
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:04,995
Correct!

265
00:16:05,801 --> 00:16:06,716
26?

266
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,914
Yeah, correct.

267
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:08,822
Really?
Really.

268
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:11,515
I don't believe you.
How could you be right?

269
00:16:11,908 --> 00:16:13,245
You like to lie to me.

270
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:14,383
Seriously, am I right?

271
00:16:15,634 --> 00:16:17,758
Whatever number you guessed,
I'd say it was correct.

272
00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:19,453
See?

273
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,503
See?

274
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,041
You like to lie to me.

275
00:16:30,762 --> 00:16:32,202
Win, I need to rest for a moment.

276
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:40,680
Are you okay?

277
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:44,763
Okay.

278
00:16:48,144 --> 00:16:50,144
Do you have something
you're not telling me about?

279
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:52,933
No.

280
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,266
You like to lie to me, Nut.

281
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,260
Lying to you once today is enough.

282
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:05,304
The sun is just strong.

283
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:06,383
So I just want to rest.

284
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:16,588
You know?

285
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:20,513
Why I wanted to come here?

286
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,778
Why?

287
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,716
When I was a kid, I came here with my dad.

288
00:17:34,313 --> 00:17:35,313
Back then,

289
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:37,611
the river was much more beautiful than now.

290
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,400
Have you ever had a moment like this

291
00:17:45,424 --> 00:17:46,592
with your dad?

292
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:57,938
My dad wasn't like this back then.

293
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,390
You know?

294
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,987
My dad once said that

295
00:18:05,204 --> 00:18:06,993
if we shout our wishes by this river,

296
00:18:07,764 --> 00:18:08,964
the wishes will come true.

297
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:13,495
And what did you wish for back then?

298
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:17,772
To be the number 1 guitarist.

299
00:18:20,704 --> 00:18:22,648
And your dad didn't scold you badly then?

300
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:25,964
My dad didn't say anything. Confusing?

301
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:30,765
Honestly,

302
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:34,107
I kind of get it.

303
00:18:36,202 --> 00:18:39,092
When grow up, as time passes,

304
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:42,526
your thoughts and everything change.

305
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:47,589
Why do you talk like an old man?

306
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,259
Well, actually,

307
00:18:51,932 --> 00:18:53,099
I am old.

308
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,637
I'm 40 years old.

309
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,015
Should I believe you?

310
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:13,548
I'll be right back.

311
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:22,336
I wish for our band to win.

312
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,023
I wish for Nut to be healthy.

313
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:38,244
I wish for Win to stop overthinking.

314
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,258
I wish to be the number 1 guitarist.

315
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,290
Can I leave this with you, sir?

316
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:45,603
Just put it down.

317
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:49,717
I wish I could finally dare
to follow my own heart.

318
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:54,591
I wish I had more courage.

319
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,837
You still don't have enough courage?

320
00:19:57,936 --> 00:19:58,651
Yeah.

321
00:19:58,676 --> 00:19:59,810
I still don't dare to run shirtless

322
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:01,217
in front of the house like you.

323
00:20:02,496 --> 00:20:03,822
You've done something like that?

324
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:07,746
I wish for free booze.

325
00:20:08,463 --> 00:20:10,556
I wish I could play the drums forever.

326
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,334
Forever?

327
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:13,899
Yes.

328
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:18,362
Dad.

329
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,194
What is it?

330
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,646
What are they doing?

331
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,235
They are in the process of

332
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,801
unlocking.

333
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,170
Unlocking themselves.

334
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:33,742
What is unlocking, Dad?

335
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,564
You'll find out soon enough.

336
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,683
How's it going?

337
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,506
Now that you're here,

338
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,051
have you gotten more
inspiration to write songs?

339
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:31,391
I have no idea what to write about.

340
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,890
What do you usually do?

341
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,973
I...

342
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:41,843
write from my feelings.

343
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,616
Feelings.

344
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,411
What kind of feelings?

345
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,395
Like how you feel.

346
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,702
Then...

347
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:00,708
Then it must be a love song.

348
00:22:04,174 --> 00:22:05,591
A love song is good.

349
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:12,694
Hey, guys.

350
00:22:13,307 --> 00:22:15,060
Actually, I have a song of my own.

351
00:22:16,297 --> 00:22:17,445
Want to hear it?

352
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:19,923
Sure, bring it on.

353
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:32,269

00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:39,185

357

Aren't you going to stop me?

358
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:54,271
How's my song?

359
00:22:54,524 --> 00:22:55,748
How about that?

360
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,339
Beautiful, very beautiful.

361
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,166
Thank you, sir.

362
00:23:00,191 --> 00:23:00,995
See?

363
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,500
But don't sing it anywhere else.

364
00:23:02,525 --> 00:23:03,987
Or the police might come and arrest you.

365
00:23:04,011 --> 00:23:05,712
Hey, sir.

366
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,537
Since you said that, let me hear a song.

367
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:11,495
Win, play for me.

368
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,058
What chords, Dad?

369
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,694
Let's go with...

370
00:23:17,718 --> 00:23:19,346
C sharp and F sharp.

371
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:32,246
Okay?

372
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:34,180

00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,008

You'll be okay, right?

385
00:24:16,646 --> 00:24:17,793
I'll be okay.

386
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:21,873
I'm very good at being alone.

387
00:24:47,471 --> 00:24:49,225
Hey, Win.

388
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:50,662
Win.

389
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:53,143
Is the song that sad?

390
00:24:55,277 --> 00:24:56,417
Well...

391
00:24:58,605 --> 00:24:59,986
The lyrics are sad.

392
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:02,645
It's not a sad song.

393
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:04,356
It's a love song.

394
00:25:05,231 --> 00:25:07,071
No matter how I listen, it's a sad song.

395
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,234
How can it be sad?

396
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:11,053
I wrote it for my wife.

397
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:15,220
So, do you like it?

398
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:16,928
I like it a lot.

399
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,033
Then here, I'll give it to you.

400
00:25:19,057 --> 00:25:20,153
Go ahead and finish it.

401
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,720
I've only written up to this point.

402
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,921
Are you serious?

403
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,609
It's late, kids. Go to bed.

404
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:34,633
You go first.

405
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,776
Okay.

406
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,660
Want some mosquito repellent?

407
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:04,423
I'll put it on for you.

408
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:09,530
Give me your arm.

409
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:12,471
Give it here.

410
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:25,714
We...

411
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,380
should go to bed.

412
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:30,442
Are you scared of ghosts?

413
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:31,903
Don't say that.

414
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:33,766
I'm trying not to think about it.

415
00:26:36,884 --> 00:26:38,030
And you're not scared?

416
00:26:39,199 --> 00:26:40,245
I am scared.

417
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,211
But I've never seen one.

418
00:26:42,457 --> 00:26:44,775
If I saw one, I'd probably be more scared.

419
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:47,629
Have you ever seen one, Lin?

420
00:26:48,296 --> 00:26:49,916
Come on, let's not talk about this.

421
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:54,679
But I don't think ghosts are real.

422
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:56,938
Because if ghosts were real,

423
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:01,026
my grandparents would have visited by now.

424
00:27:02,306 --> 00:27:04,576
Maybe they just don't want to scare you.

425
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,581
Like, thinking it's better not to appear.

426
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:09,940
Letting you live a peaceful life.

427
00:27:14,036 --> 00:27:15,090
No way.

428
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,643
My grandma definitely
knows I want to see her.

429
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,112
Hey, guys.

430
00:27:29,955 --> 00:27:30,955
Can I ask you something?

431
00:27:35,307 --> 00:27:37,215
If one day I died,

432
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:41,805
would you want me to visit you?

433
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:43,423
Death again.

434
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:44,983
What's wrong with you today?

435
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:46,342
Talking about death so often.

436
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:47,967
We're talking about ghosts,

437
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:49,591
so it has to be related to death, right?

438
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
Oh, right.

439
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:53,657
No way.

440
00:27:53,944 --> 00:27:55,039
Don't come visit me.

441
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,788
But for me, you can visit.

442
00:27:57,812 --> 00:27:59,503
But please be in good condition.

443
00:27:59,527 --> 00:28:00,620
Not with a messed up face.

444
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,235
And give me the lottery
numbers for a small prize.

445
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:05,635
No, I want the grand prize.

446
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:21,792
You wouldn't visit me.

447
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:30,392
I mean,

448
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:32,346
someone like you,

449
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,090
you probably like watching concerts, right?

450
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:35,967
You'd probably go haunt

451
00:28:35,991 --> 00:28:37,749
the places where there are concerts.

452
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:38,917
So you can watch for free.

453
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,934
Yeah.

454
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:43,559
Being a ghost is pretty good too.

455
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:45,691
Right?

456
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:48,298
I can get free booze, right?

457
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:49,963
But someone has to light incense for you.

458
00:28:50,777 --> 00:28:51,777
Do you think

459
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,838
a ghost can get drunk from drinking?

460
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:55,062
That's enough.

461
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:56,497
I'm going to bed.

462
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:59,545
I'll go with you, Lin.

463
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,080
Where are you going? Hey.

464
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:05,880
Where was my joke not funny?

465
00:29:07,302 --> 00:29:08,489
Not funny at all.

466
00:29:33,239 --> 00:29:35,830
That conversation just now was so scary.

467
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,980
Why are you afraid of ghosts?

468
00:29:39,483 --> 00:29:40,684
Have you seen one?

469
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:44,605
Not exactly seeing one.

470
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,104
But at that time,

471
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:48,890
I was camping with my family.

472
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,732
And suddenly I heard someone
walking outside the tent.

473
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:54,353
But when I opened it, no one was there.

474
00:29:55,768 --> 00:29:58,710
Since then, whenever I
go camping in the forest,

475
00:29:58,895 --> 00:30:00,456
I've always been scared.

476
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,718
See?

477
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:11,190
It was just like this back then.

478
00:30:14,858 --> 00:30:15,932
Biu.

479
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,120
Wait a minute, Lin.

480
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:35,492
Ouch.

481
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:37,926
Damn it.

482
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:39,412
What are you playing at?

483
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,103
I'm a person, not a ghost.

484
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:45,659
My eye.

485
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,482
I'm not playing anymore.

486
00:30:49,606 --> 00:30:50,980
You won't have anything to cover.

487
00:30:53,356 --> 00:30:54,889
Go back to sleep.

488
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:12,524
So small, but punches so damn hard.

489
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:31,402
Chai.

490
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,483
Why are you here?

491
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:37,639
Actually, I have a secret to tell you.

492
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,036
- I'm scared of ghosts.
- Wait, wait, wait.

493
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:47,374
What happened to your face?

494
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,073
Ouch.

495
00:31:52,153 --> 00:31:53,326
It hurts.

496
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:57,918
Then wait a minute.

497
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,618
How was it?

498
00:32:03,871 --> 00:32:04,871
Did you see anything?

499
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:07,253
I did.

500
00:32:07,878 --> 00:32:09,084
What did you do?

501
00:32:10,052 --> 00:32:11,392
I already punched it.

502
00:32:13,585 --> 00:32:14,965
Let's sleep, Lin.

503
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:16,144
It's nothing.

504
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:52,404
You brought a first-aid kit?

505
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:55,175
My mom prepared everything.

506
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:04,976
Gently.

507
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,486
All done.

508
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,380
Chai.

509
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:16,886
Even up here on the mountain,

510
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:19,267
you still manage to get into trouble.

511
00:33:21,277 --> 00:33:22,837
Or do you want to have trouble with me?

512
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:24,528
Want some?

513
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,749
No.

514
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:28,514
I don't want to bully a kid.

515
00:33:31,797 --> 00:33:32,865
Let's sleep.

516
00:34:18,754 --> 00:34:20,234
Are you cold?

517
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:34,508
You guessed wrong earlier.

518
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:37,976
Guessed what?

519
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:41,588
That if I died,

520
00:34:42,315 --> 00:34:43,821
I would still come back to you.

521
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:51,676
You wouldn't come back to me.

522
00:34:52,163 --> 00:34:53,163
Trust me.

523
00:34:57,144 --> 00:34:58,464
Come on, let me apply it for you.

524
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,455
So your dark circles can finally disappear.

525
00:35:20,983 --> 00:35:22,583
Let's hurry up and sleep, I'm very cold.

526
00:35:23,613 --> 00:35:24,613
Okay.

527
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,375
Tomorrow, if you wake up first,

528
00:35:32,621 --> 00:35:33,762
don't wake me up.

529
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:07,441
But you once said that

530
00:36:09,362 --> 00:36:10,962
if there's no surgery, it's okay, right?

531
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:12,867
That's right.

532
00:36:12,891 --> 00:36:15,610
Only in cases where the
tumor doesn't have any effect.

533
00:36:16,444 --> 00:36:18,941
But now, abnormal symptoms
are starting to appear.

534
00:36:19,465 --> 00:36:21,312
I recommend surgery.

535
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:27,700
So if I have surgery,

536
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,573
will I still be able to play
the guitar like before?

537
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,617
I can't answer that yet.

538
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:44,875
Doctor.

539
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,084
I'm asking for just 3 months.

540
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,181
After the competition is over,

541
00:36:52,987 --> 00:36:54,290
I will tell my father

542
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:56,315
and then I will have surgery.

543
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,393
But in the meantime,

544
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:04,908
can you please keep this a secret?

545
00:37:46,255 --> 00:37:47,595
Are you cold?

546
00:37:56,779 --> 00:37:58,066
Your hands are so cold.

547
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:04,545
I guess the blanket I
brought is a bit too thin.

548
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:06,718
I didn't think it would be cold.

549
00:38:11,896 --> 00:38:13,076
Then...

550
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:15,378
do you want to use my blanket?

551
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:17,695
It's probably thicker.

552
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:20,285
Hey.

553
00:38:20,505 --> 00:38:22,165
Why would I take it from you?

554
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:29,794
My blanket

555
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:32,312
is huge. You're not taking it.

556
00:38:46,141 --> 00:38:47,155
Is that better?

557
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,957
A little better.

558
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:08,978
I have warm hands.

559
00:39:11,287 --> 00:39:12,901
You can hold my hand like this.

560
00:39:14,196 --> 00:39:15,209
So you won't be cold.

561
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,808
Good night.

562
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:03,241
1, 2, 3.

563
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,732
Let me get a vertical one too.

564
00:40:07,336 --> 00:40:10,396
1, 2, 3.

565
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:20,103
1, 2, 3.

566
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:22,597
Taking this many pictures,

567
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:23,861
the film roll must be finished.

568
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,552
It's okay if it's finished.

569
00:40:25,709 --> 00:40:27,150
I've taken pictures of everyone.

570
00:40:28,107 --> 00:40:29,400
Have you counted yourself?

571
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,450
Oh, I forgot to count.

572
00:40:32,475 --> 00:40:33,917
Come on, I'll take one for you.

573
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,427
Why?

574
00:40:36,886 --> 00:40:38,846
Didn't you like the one
I took for you last time?

575
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:40,388
I liked it.

576
00:40:42,092 --> 00:40:43,252
Then let's take one together.

577
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:44,783
Sure.

578
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:53,187
1, 2, 3.

579
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:55,944
One more picture.

580
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:00,516
1, 2, 3.

581
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:03,645
Oh.

582
00:41:04,033 --> 00:41:05,140
Nut.

583
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,049
What are you doing?

584
00:41:12,552 --> 00:41:14,372
Continuing the song from yesterday.

585
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:15,905
Want to help?

586
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:17,679
I've written up to here.

587
00:41:31,891 --> 00:41:33,140
Boo!

588
00:41:33,523 --> 00:41:34,992
You scared me.

589
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:37,160
What would you do if I
died of a heart attack?

590
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,653
You won't die that easily.

591
00:41:40,677 --> 00:41:42,726
You'll live until you're 40.

592
00:41:44,291 --> 00:41:46,694
Next time, make some noise
when you show up, old man.

593
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,086
Who's an old man?

594
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,748
You are, Uncle Win.

595
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,694
You got me, I can't even argue.

596
00:42:00,821 --> 00:42:02,772
Hey, can I ask you something?

597
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:15,580
In the next 20 years,

598
00:42:15,604 --> 00:42:16,959
Lin and Nut...

599
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:18,459
I already told you.

600
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,588
That you'll find out when the time comes.

601
00:42:22,725 --> 00:42:24,815
Damn, if it were me,

602
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:26,159
I would have told you everything.

603
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,848
Why are you holding back?

604
00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:38,276
Win, Win.

605
00:42:58,263 --> 00:43:00,016
Haven't you guys packed up yet?

606
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:02,404
I have to play at the
bar later this evening.

607
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:04,392
If you're slow, I'm not waiting.

608
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,384
Yeah, I'll pack up quickly.

609
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:08,677
Listen to this song first.

610
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:10,096
Lin helped me write it just now.

611
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:11,546

Thank you.

638
00:44:41,759 --> 00:44:42,891
I've been writing for so long

639
00:44:42,915 --> 00:44:44,184
and it's not even this good.

640
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:48,731
Well, you wrote it well from the beginning.

641
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:50,664
Sweet talker.

642
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:53,383
See? I told you it's not a sad song.

643
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:54,358
It's a love song.

644
00:44:54,382 --> 00:44:55,650
Do you understand now?

645
00:44:56,065 --> 00:44:56,878
I understand now.

646
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:57,903
Awesome.

647
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,373
Very good.

648
00:44:59,398 --> 00:45:00,532
What does everyone think?

649
00:45:01,005 --> 00:45:03,085
If it's okay, I'll continue
writing the second half.

650
00:45:04,758 --> 00:45:05,772
I think...

651
00:45:08,055 --> 00:45:09,248
it's so beautiful.

652
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,131
Let's use this song for the final round.

653
00:45:16,877 --> 00:45:19,429
I think we'll definitely be the champions.

654
00:45:19,669 --> 00:45:20,669
Don't you think so?

655
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:23,984
It's very beautiful.

656
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:44,950
Win.

657
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:46,482
What is it, Lin?

658
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,770
Well,

659
00:45:49,526 --> 00:45:51,246
I have something to consult with you about.

660
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,317
Sure.

661
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,450
I think...

662
00:45:58,473 --> 00:45:59,693
I like Nut.

663
00:46:02,184 --> 00:46:03,804
I want to confess my love.

664
00:46:05,277 --> 00:46:07,170
Can you help me find the right moment?

665
00:46:13,598 --> 00:46:15,887
Can you just play continuously?

666
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:16,816
Yes.

667
00:46:16,841 --> 00:46:18,694
One song, and let it run continuously.

668
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,083
Of course, Lin.

669
00:47:04,325 --> 00:47:06,005
(Next Episode)
Are you not free these days?

670
00:47:06,302 --> 00:47:08,622
I haven't eaten your stir-fried
vegetables in a long time.

671
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:10,750
Nut, I have something to tell you.

672
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,532
Are you okay?

673
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:14,064
You seem distracted.

674
00:47:14,315 --> 00:47:16,381
Today, I feel like Win is
too stressed, don't you?

675
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,690
Do you know what's wrong with Win?

676
00:47:26,685 --> 00:47:28,738
How could you let me be a fool like this?

677
00:47:30,162 --> 00:47:30,950
Hello, ma'am.

678
00:47:30,975 --> 00:47:32,183
I don't think it's convenient for you

679
00:47:32,207 --> 00:47:34,074
