00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:01,688
(Previously)
If you messed up the old history...

2
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:03,466
you just have to create a new one.

3
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:04,393
Or...

4
00:00:04,418 --> 00:00:06,251
find a way to fix the old history.

5
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,961
I'll swing by the Alankarn concert before going home.

6
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,353
We should start a band?

7
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,613
I want to invite you to be the band manager.

8
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:18,358
So who's in the band right now?

9
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,840
I can't be in a band with you anymore.

10
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:20,789
If it's about studying,

11
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,161
your dad would never say no.

12
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:23,541
How many instruments should our band have?

13
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,639
I think four is enough.

14
00:00:24,664 --> 00:00:26,401
If I have to be in a band with her, I'm out.

15
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:27,695
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,920

"Rearrange"
(Episode 3)

35
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:50,997
Ek.

36
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,597
You can play the drums, right?

37
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:54,997
My band's drummer...

38
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:57,731
went to a concert and got his hand stepped on.

39
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:04,519
He can't play at all right now.

40
00:02:05,565 --> 00:02:06,621
And today,

41
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,614
is a very important gig for me.

42
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,041
Can you play for me?

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,099
Please?

44
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,071
Why did he stop playing?

45
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:44,139
What's wrong with the drummer?

46
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,174
What is he doing?

47
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,202
Why did he stop playing?

48
00:02:46,227 --> 00:02:48,103
- How can he be a musician like this?
- He just stopped mid-song like that?

49
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,913
- So unprofessional.
- The drummer seems strange.

50
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:05,097
What is he doing?

51
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:07,370
He just stop playing.

52
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,590
He just stopped mid-song like that?

53
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:23,672
So where's the drummer you mentioned, Win?

54
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,201
Hey, wait a minute.

55
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,022
Hey, there he is. Ek, Ek.

56
00:03:29,354 --> 00:03:30,086
Yes?

57
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,172
Is there something?

58
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:36,173
Well, we wanted to invite you to a competition...

59
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:38,647
If it's about a competition, I don't think I'm ready.

60
00:03:39,059 --> 00:03:40,214
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,220
Damn it, Biu!

62
00:03:55,244 --> 00:03:56,632
What have you done?

63
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,599
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:02,467
So what now?

65
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:19,993
I'm going to the market. Who wants something?

66
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,559
- Red soda for me, Dad.
- Okay.

67
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,420
- Same for me.
- Okay.

68
00:04:24,293 --> 00:04:26,421
Win, what do you want?

69
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,534
Red soda?

70
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:30,694
Dad.

71
00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:32,478
I would like a bottle of liquor.

72
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:45,487
Are you that stressed out?

73
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:56,083
Son, something this good...

74
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,378
I can't accept this.

75
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:00,455
It's alright, ma'am.

76
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:01,715
Just consider it

77
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:03,436
as us asking for permission.

78
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:05,573
Asking for permission?

79
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:06,993
Permission for what?

80
00:05:09,232 --> 00:05:11,337
Well, we would like...

81
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,681
to invite Chai to be the bassist for our band.

82
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:16,228
But we don't know if you'd allow it.

83
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:18,673
Oh, is that all?

84
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:20,315
Chai usually goes out

85
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,662
to play all the time anyway.

86
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:24,676
Wait a moment, I'll call him for you.

87
00:05:24,809 --> 00:05:25,431
Okay.

88
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:28,109
Chai, come downstairs!

89
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:29,704
Yes!

90
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:33,598
Why are you yelling?

91
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,066
You guys again?

92
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:02,840
Go play music with them.

93
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:05,496
But, Mom...

94
00:06:05,521 --> 00:06:07,241
Stop "but"-ing.

95
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:09,052
You have good friends like this,

96
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,344
you should keep them.

97
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:13,108
It's better than hanging out with those thugs.

98
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:16,269
Saying this because he bought you liquor?

99
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:20,598
You think your mother

100
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:22,147
can be bought that easily?

101
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:24,582
Hey.

102
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:25,930
If you talk like that,

103
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:29,432
don't you dare sneak any of my drinks later.

104
00:06:35,217 --> 00:06:37,192
Why are you looking at your friends like that?

105
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,574
Go play music with your friends.

106
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:42,695
Understand?

107
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:45,789
Ugh, fine.

108
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:48,912
Are you saying "ugh" to your mother, huh?

109
00:06:52,109 --> 00:06:53,342
Yes.

110
00:06:53,482 --> 00:06:54,568
Fine, I'll go.

111
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:57,685
That's more like it.

112
00:06:58,298 --> 00:07:00,191
Good boy.

113
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:09,537
Make yourselves at home, boys.

114
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:24,508
How did you guys know where I live?

115
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:32,797
Well, I used to live around here.

116
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:34,981
So I kind of knew you were here.

117
00:07:41,648 --> 00:07:42,967
So...

118
00:07:43,662 --> 00:07:47,255
what do you say? About joining my band?

119
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:02,666
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:07,378
Actually, it's possible.

121
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,241
But let me see how good you guys are first.

122
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,995
Deal. Let's go to the rehearsal room.

123
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,543
I wasn't talking about a rehearsal room.

124
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:31,757
Are you really going to make us play here?

125
00:08:32,344 --> 00:08:33,231
Of course.

126
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,557
What about your band?

127
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:38,411
They're recovering.

128
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:42,763
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:44,425 --> 00:08:45,254
Chai.

130
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,629

00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:48,501

200
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,794
Alright, fine. I'll agree to play with you guys.

201
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,135
As for the money,

202
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,412
you guys take 200 each.

203
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:25,632
I'll take the other 100 as a finder's fee, okay?

204
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:28,976
What about me?

205
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,734
And what did you do?

206
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,543
I was standing here clapping

207
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:33,622
and encouraging you.

208
00:13:34,342 --> 00:13:36,711
Oh, clapping and encouraging.

209
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:38,744
Wait.

210
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,406
Here.

211
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,983
You can take your encouragement...

212
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:54,116
back.

213
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,454
Damn it, Chai. You're such a smartass.

214
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:00,986
I want some too.

215
00:14:02,327 --> 00:14:03,627
Here, take this.

216
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:08,424
Your encouragement.

217
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:20,360
"Inviting Ek to the band"

218
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:43,980
We've invited him so many times.

219
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,661
I think we should find someone else.

220
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,855
Ek.

221
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:53,529
Ek, wait. Ek.

222
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:54,940
About the band, Ek.

223
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:55,813
Win.

224
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,592
How long have you been like this?

225
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:04,454
It’s just a moment ago.

226
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,639
Are you sure?

227
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,118
I'm serious.

228
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,435
Yeah, I'm not kidding either.

229
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:14,737
I probably just didn't eat enough.

230
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,946
I think you should see a doctor.

231
00:15:20,288 --> 00:15:21,281
Huh?

232
00:15:21,428 --> 00:15:22,601
See a doctor?

233
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,336
I just felt dizzy.

234
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,675
Come on, let's go. I'll take you.

235
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:29,919
You're overreacting. I'm fine.

236
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:32,298
I'm perfectly fine.

237
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,725
Ek, don't you want to eat your steak, son?

238
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:56,945
I can have the chef change it to another dish for you.

239
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:59,199
It's okay, Mom.

240
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:01,492
Son.

241
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:04,553
Is something bothering you at school?

242
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,821
You can tell us, you know.

243
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,800
Dad, Mom.

244
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,941
Do you think I can start a band?

245
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,778
Um, let me think about it.

246
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:22,911
What do you think, dear?

247
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:24,230
Of course he can.

248
00:16:24,255 --> 00:16:25,207
Yes.

249
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:27,428
Why wouldn't you be able to, son?

250
00:16:27,588 --> 00:16:28,715
That time,

251
00:16:28,894 --> 00:16:30,634
I saw you practicing the drums.

252
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,358
Like, boom, bap, boom boom.

253
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:34,213
You were amazing.

254
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:37,105
- Isn't that right, dear?
- That's right.

255
00:16:37,438 --> 00:16:39,010
Our son is so talented.

256
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:42,972
But if I have a band,

257
00:16:42,996 --> 00:16:44,437
and I practice with my friends,

258
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,761
I might come home late.

259
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:48,298
Would Mom and Dad mind?

260
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:49,888
It's okay, son.

261
00:16:49,912 --> 00:16:51,774
If it makes Ek happy,

262
00:16:51,798 --> 00:16:54,107
go for it. I'm fine with whatever.

263
00:16:54,327 --> 00:16:55,620
Besides,

264
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:57,857
we have a driver.

265
00:16:57,881 --> 00:16:59,849
Ek can come home at any time.

266
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:01,301
It's not a problem at all.

267
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:02,483
That's right.

268
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:03,975
Oh, hey.

269
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:05,455
I has an idea.

270
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:07,574
I'll hire a contractor...

271
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:09,721
to build you a new music rehearsal room.

272
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,239
Even bigger than the old one.

273
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,605
- Good idea, dear?
- Yes.

274
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,620
How about it, son?

275
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,240
Let's wait, Dad.

276
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,826
I don't even know yet...

277
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,389
if I can really have a band.

278
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:26,629
If you want to do it, I believe you can, son.

279
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,273
Hey, Dad, Tim.

280
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:54,421
I just finished cooking. Help yourselves.

281
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:01,011
Hey Tim, and this...

282
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,259
I made you a lunch box. Don't forget it.

283
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,022
Wait.

284
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:09,464
Don't we eat together first?

285
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,969
I've already eaten.

286
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:12,588
What time did you wake up, Win?

287
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:15,926
Don't ask. Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.

288
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:29,055
Tim.

289
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,901
Use a fork and spoon, son.

290
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:34,063
But it's okay. Never mind.

291
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,164
Get some rice for me.

292
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,638
Win.

293
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:03,957
Here, I made this for you.

294
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,125
Why did you make it for me?

295
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:11,277
So you'll eat every meal.

296
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:12,727
So you won't get dizzy again.

297
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,455
Are you worried about me?

298
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,399
I'm just afraid you won't be able to play the guitar.

299
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,319
Here. I have to go now.

300
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:28,724
See you later.

301
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,841
What's with your mood?

302
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,368
Biu.

303
00:19:58,454 --> 00:19:59,947
Are you free this evening?

304
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:02,787
I'm not doing anything.

305
00:20:03,696 --> 00:20:05,631
Then let's go for a run.

306
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,785
A run?

307
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:20,882
Hurry up, you.

308
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,063
Your legs are so damn short.

309
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,433
Why do we have to run?

310
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:28,799
You don't know?

311
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:30,023
Do you know?

312
00:20:30,048 --> 00:20:32,837
Of course. To have a band and play a concert,

313
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,602
we have to be strong, both physically...

314
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:36,395
and mentally.

315
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:39,711
But I'm the band manager.

316
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,223
Oh, right.

317
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,217
Why does she have to run with us?

318
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:46,695
Shit.

319
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:49,609
Come on.

320
00:20:50,158 --> 00:20:51,231
I can't anymore.

321
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:57,701
My back hurts.

322
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:00,922
Nut.

323
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:03,028
Nut, Nut.

324
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,076
Are you okay?
Nut.

325
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:13,601
Are you okay?

326
00:21:20,841 --> 00:21:21,909
Perfectly fine.

327
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,505
Fine, my ass.

328
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,145
You don't have to run.

329
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:32,913
You can just walk.

330
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:34,526
Let's go.

331
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:38,442
Slowly.

332
00:21:51,986 --> 00:21:53,059
Nut.

333
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:55,113
It took a lot to get you here.

334
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,480
Because I'm fine.

335
00:21:57,786 --> 00:21:59,547
You just made me run too much.

336
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:02,583
Before you say you're fine,

337
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,296
you should get a check-up to be sure.

338
00:22:09,733 --> 00:22:11,743
A check-up will wipe out my savings.

339
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,747
Just use your health card.

340
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:16,473
Health card?

341
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:18,371
What health card?

342
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:27,013
I meant your ATM card.

343
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:28,604
Just use your ATM card.

344
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,250
I'll go withdraw after the check-up.

345
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:39,763
Nattanan, please.

346
00:22:46,287 --> 00:22:47,516
Why are you following me?

347
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:53,546
I'm not. I'm just going to wait here.

348
00:22:58,641 --> 00:22:59,921
Nattanan.

349
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:00,961
Last name?

350
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:01,919
Tiwanit.

351
00:23:01,944 --> 00:23:02,946
This way, please.

352
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:06,000
Hello, doctor.

353
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:34,022
How did it go?

354
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:36,788
The doctor said it's nothing.

355
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,423
Just need to get enough rest, that's all.

356
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,279
Are you sure?

357
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,542
Why would I lie to you?

358
00:23:50,911 --> 00:23:53,514
Okay, I'm going to the ATM.

359
00:24:53,334 --> 00:24:54,394
Come here.

360
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,673
Who are you going to call?

361
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,835
Call them.

362
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,658
Come on, it's very easy.

363
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:02,164
There's a button to press, right?

364
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:04,071
Press it, wait for someone,

365
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:06,026
and then talk. Very easy.

366
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:11,483
Okay, you can do it.

367
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:32,536
Hello.

368
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,602
Hello.

369
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:38,783
May I speak to Nut, please?

370
00:25:39,396 --> 00:25:40,383
Who's calling?

371
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,973
My name is Win. I'm a friend of Nut's.

372
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:49,313
Nut, Win calling you.

373
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,144
What's up?

374
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:06,173
Hey, are you going to bed yet?

375
00:26:06,492 --> 00:26:07,699
Almost.

376
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:09,975
You need to sleep early, you know?

377
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:11,580
Just as the doctor ordered.

378
00:26:12,086 --> 00:26:13,100
Yeah.

379
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:16,052
Then...

380
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,365
That's all.

381
00:26:19,633 --> 00:26:21,126
You called just for that?

382
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:25,279
Or is there something else you want to talk?

383
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,279
Oh, your lunch box is with me.

384
00:26:30,973 --> 00:26:32,779
I'll wash it and give it back to you.

385
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:35,902
And also...

386
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:38,519
You don't have to make it anymore.

387
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:40,503
I can find my own food.

388
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:44,444
Oh, was it not delicious?

389
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,491
No.

390
00:26:47,202 --> 00:26:48,322
It's just that...

391
00:26:48,682 --> 00:26:50,188
I feel bad for troubling you.

392
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:54,103
You don't have to feel bad.

393
00:26:54,536 --> 00:26:55,586
Because...

394
00:26:55,611 --> 00:26:58,012
you like to eat all sorts of weird things.

395
00:26:58,036 --> 00:26:59,466
You might faint again.

396
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:01,418
It's better if I make it for you.

397
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:05,413
You're so stubborn.

398
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,114
Well,

399
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:10,089
It's enough that I'm the only stubborn one.

400
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:11,736
You're not allowed to be stubborn.

401
00:27:13,191 --> 00:27:14,667
See you tomorrow.

402
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:18,033
Good night.

403
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:21,055
Good night.

404
00:27:48,662 --> 00:27:49,895
Let's trade.

405
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:52,227
Let me make for you.

406
00:27:59,368 --> 00:28:00,501
Let's trade.

407
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:03,449
How many lunch boxes do you have at home?

408
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:08,058
So,

409
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:10,293
what did you make for me?

410
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:14,681
I'm not telling. It's a surprise.

411
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:29,619
Look at you.

412
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:31,777
Morning, you don't come to school together.

413
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:35,555
At lunch, you bring a lunch box to eat alone.

414
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,203
I feel so left out.

415
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:42,911
What are you feeling left out about?

416
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:46,778
Wow, look at that. So much food.

417
00:28:48,611 --> 00:28:50,683
Then I'll eat it.

418
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,857
Mm.

419
00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:57,771
What's wrong?

420
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,589
Did you make this yourself?

421
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:02,622
No.

422
00:29:06,251 --> 00:29:07,611
Which shop did you buy this from?

423
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:10,408
You should report them to the police. It's so salty.

424
00:29:21,414 --> 00:29:23,414
You eat it all by yourself. I'm done.

425
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,281
Hey.

426
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:45,028
My dad and mom gave me permission.

427
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:47,135
I'll join the band with you.

428
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,163
Really?

429
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:53,348
The competition we're entering is Star of Band.

430
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,943
Simple rule: all songs must be original compositions.

431
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:57,594
The first round is a video submission.

432
00:29:57,618 --> 00:29:59,280
Anyway, I'm counting on you to film it, Biu.

433
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:00,133
Got it.

434
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,228
So what song are we using for the competition?

435
00:30:02,253 --> 00:30:04,172
Right now, we have a song that Nut wrote.

436
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:05,684
We just need to practice until we're in sync.

437
00:30:15,134 --> 00:30:17,522
Ek, I think it's...

438
00:30:17,604 --> 00:30:19,328
it doesn't really fit the song.

439
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:21,541
I'm sorry.

440
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,827
Hey, it's his first day.

441
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,509
It's okay.

442
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:28,994
There's still time.

443
00:30:29,234 --> 00:30:30,642
There's no time left.

444
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:33,362
They're closing applications in a few days.

445
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:38,651
Let's try it one more time.

446
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,623
I think...

447
00:30:57,062 --> 00:30:58,416
you should slow it down a bit.

448
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,350
Just follow my lead.

449
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,172
I think you can do it.

450
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:05,378
Come on.

451
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,099
One more time.

452
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:11,747
Go.

453
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:19,654
♪ From now on, I will love you ♪

454
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:23,409
♪ Like it's the last time I'll ever see you. ♪

455
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:27,165

456
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,775

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,739

00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:45,510
♪ I will love you forever. ♪

460
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:51,961
That's better.

461
00:31:56,418 --> 00:31:57,878
The recording great, right?

462
00:32:08,633 --> 00:32:10,300
I'm so tired today.

463
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:15,867
Thank you.

464
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:18,118
No problem.

465
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:20,181
Actually, you can play well.

466
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:21,638
Just be more confident.

467
00:32:22,011 --> 00:32:23,105
Okay.

468
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:24,506
How are you getting home?

469
00:32:24,972 --> 00:32:26,161
Want me to give you a ride?

470
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:28,068
It's okay.

471
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:30,281
My driver is already here.

472
00:32:33,433 --> 00:32:34,424
Hi.

473
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,033
Let's go.

474
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:37,450
See you tomorrow.

475
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:41,726
This way, master.

476
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:51,184
Mom.

477
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,463
Mom.

478
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,013
Mom.

479
00:33:59,318 --> 00:34:01,425
Mom, can you hear me?

480
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:06,719
Mom, Mom.

481
00:34:58,168 --> 00:34:59,421
Are you okay?

482
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:04,913
This is...

483
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,723
the reason why...

484
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,506
I don't want anyone buying liquor for her.

485
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:16,023
I'm sorry.

486
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,982
It's good that you guys came.

487
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:29,374
Can you watch my mom for a bit?

488
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:32,926
I'm going to get something to eat.

489
00:36:33,536 --> 00:36:34,709
Chai.

490
00:36:37,143 --> 00:36:38,377
You scared me.

491
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:40,112
How did you get here?

492
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:47,602
My parents brought me for health check-up.

493
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,588
Win told me your mom wasn't feeling well.

494
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:52,168
Is she okay?

495
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:55,369
She's fine now.

496
00:36:55,996 --> 00:36:58,099
She'll likely be discharged after one more night.

497
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:00,606
That's great.

498
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:05,669
I'm hungry.

499
00:37:06,837 --> 00:37:08,143
I'm going to get something to eat.

500
00:38:36,603 --> 00:38:37,737
Excuse me.

501
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:39,372
Hello.

502
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,440
This medical bill...

503
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:44,311
can I pay it in installments?

504
00:38:47,346 --> 00:38:48,541
For this amount,

505
00:38:48,565 --> 00:38:50,674
it looks like it was just paid a moment ago.

506
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,127
It's been paid?

507
00:38:53,152 --> 00:38:54,049
Yes.

508
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,188
Who paid it?

509
00:38:56,213 --> 00:38:57,871
It was a man and a woman.

510
00:38:57,895 --> 00:38:59,763
They just walked that way a moment ago.

511
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:05,999
Thank you.

512
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:13,732
Sir, Ma'am.

513
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:16,914
Are you the ones who...

514
00:39:17,246 --> 00:39:19,239
paid for my mother's medical bill?

515
00:39:21,851 --> 00:39:22,912
Yes, we are.

516
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,586
Thank you so much.

517
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,628
Somehow,

518
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,126
I will find a way to pay you back soon.

519
00:39:34,263 --> 00:39:35,811
It's really no problem.

520
00:39:35,835 --> 00:39:38,051
Don't rush to pay us back.

521
00:39:38,344 --> 00:39:40,407
Ek told me that...

522
00:39:40,432 --> 00:39:43,053
Chai takes very good care of him.

523
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,561
So, consider this a payment for you taking care of Ek.

524
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:48,635
Okay?

525
00:39:50,525 --> 00:39:51,865
I can't do that, ma'am.

526
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:54,586
Taking care of him is one thing.

527
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,192
But I'll still find a way to pay you back.

528
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:01,820
In that case, you and your band...

529
00:40:01,845 --> 00:40:04,096
can help me with an event instead, how about that?

530
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:06,196
That's a good idea. I agree.

531
00:40:07,529 --> 00:40:08,617
Yes, of course.

532
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,736
Any kind of event is fine.

533
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:20,598
I think this event has a good crowd.

534
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:22,333
So when we go out to play,

535
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:24,264
You can find a good angle around there.

536
00:40:24,384 --> 00:40:25,968
And use this one, okay?

537
00:40:25,993 --> 00:40:27,108
- Okay.
- Is the camera ready?

538
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:28,169
It's fully charged.

539
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:36,166
How is it? Are you ready?

540
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:38,794
Does this really suit me?

541
00:40:39,848 --> 00:40:41,194
You look very handsome, Chai.

542
00:40:41,659 --> 00:40:43,115
If you don't believe me, ask Ek.

543
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:45,428
Is it true, Ek?

544
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:52,090
It's almost good.

545
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:54,610
See? "Almost good"...

546
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,623
doesn't mean it's good.

547
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,290
Now it's good.

548
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:25,337
Anyway,

549
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:27,702
thanks a lot for coming to help.

550
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,089
It'd be strange if I didn't come.

551
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,481
I was the one who caused it.

552
00:41:32,372 --> 00:41:34,811
I think you should thank Nut instead.

553
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,442
He has nothing to do with it.

554
00:41:38,403 --> 00:41:39,517
Consider it...

555
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:42,315
a repayment for the your breakfast.

556
00:41:46,757 --> 00:41:47,842
