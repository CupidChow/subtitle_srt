00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:01,395
(Previously)
I'm jealous of your dreams, man.

2
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:02,776
You gotta come cheer for us on the day.

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,562
3...
2...

4
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,189
1

5
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:06,553
Yay!

6
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,644
I promise you.

7
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,258
That I'll become a super famous singer.

8
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:14,187
If Nut hadn't died...

9
00:00:14,212 --> 00:00:16,002
would Nut and I have gotten married?

10
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:23,928
Biu, I'm not dreaming, am I?

11
00:00:25,094 --> 00:00:26,074
Have you ever felt like...

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:28,429
you wanted to meet someone so badly

13
00:00:28,453 --> 00:00:29,896
but didn't have the courage to go?

14
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:04,512
I like you.

15
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:07,571
Who would've thought...

16
00:01:08,154 --> 00:01:10,514
that deciding to confess...

17
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:13,168
would cause this much trouble?

18
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:26,750
I like you.

19
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:32,122
What?

20
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:38,886
I mean...

21
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,855
I like that you play.

22
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:45,202
Talk to me like that...

23
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:47,735
Do we know each other?

24
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:51,617
Um...

25
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:52,904
I...

26
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,390
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,210

"Rearrange" (Episode 2)

46
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,586
Shit.

47
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,057
What the hell did I just do?

48
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,509
What did you do? How would I know?

49
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,875
And where did you
disappear to this evening?

50
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:43,231
Damn it, Biu.

51
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,848
So, I don't know what
I'm supposed to do next.

52
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:48,365
Dad, I think Win is on drugs.

53
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,433
What!

54
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:51,905
It's been like this since yesterday.

55
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,132
He's been rambling about time travel.

56
00:03:54,156 --> 00:03:56,519
And he's been acting weird.

57
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,318
Win, where did I go wrong?

58
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,043
Tell me, where did I go wrong?

59
00:04:01,067 --> 00:04:02,650
Do I not love you enough?

60
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,791
Did I not give you a good education?

61
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:05,471
I've tried to do everything for you.

62
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,597
Dad! Dad! Dad!

63
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,986
I'm not on drugs.

64
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:11,477
Then what's wrong with you?

65
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:18,395
Well...

66
00:04:19,012 --> 00:04:20,152
I...

67
00:04:20,445 --> 00:04:23,110
I'm working on an assignment.

68
00:04:23,134 --> 00:04:25,581
And there's this one
question I can't answer.

69
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,052
So I'm stressed out.

70
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,677
Is it really that hard?

71
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:31,715
So, what's the question

72
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
What?

73
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,080
Your assignment.

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
The question?

75
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,660
So...

76
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:48,238
The question is...

77
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:50,247
Its...

78
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:53,690
If we had the power
to travel back in time...

79
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,305
and we accidentally messed up history...

80
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,424
what should we do next?

81
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,796
I don't think it's that hard.

82
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:12,671
If you messed up the old history...

83
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,275
you just have to create a new one.

84
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,348
Or...

85
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:18,539
find a way to fix the old history.

86
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:20,884
Like in the movie Back to the Future.

87
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:24,885
What the hell kind of class is this?

88
00:05:25,578 --> 00:05:27,482
Yeah, what the hell class is it, Win?

89
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:28,584
Tim, Tim.

90
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,910
Calm down.

91
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:30,860
Sorry.

92
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:32,138
And you two, watch your language

93
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,520
in front of your brother.

94
00:05:33,545 --> 00:05:35,332
Otherwise, everything I've taught him...

95
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:38,980
will be fuc...

96
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,054
ruined.

97
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:42,993
Understand?

98
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:40,992
Hey, Win.

99
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,137
Why not bag the trash
and take it out at once?

100
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:47,099
So...

101
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:48,734
We're out of bin bags.

102
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:50,757
Huh?

103
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,351
What do you mean, out?

104
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:54,724
I just bought a new pack.
Did you search properly?

105
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,897
I searched properly. All gone.

106
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:05,271
Fine.

107
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:07,064
Go put my guitar away for me.

108
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:16,863
Didn't I just buy some?

109
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,450
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

110
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,621
Where are you taking my guitar?

111
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,123
You told me to throw it away, didn't you?

112
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,477
I didn't tell you to throw it away.

113
00:09:30,677 --> 00:09:31,783
I told you to put it away.

114
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:35,221
Oh.

115
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,365
A guitar worth thousands, almost tossed.

116
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,457
Hey, bro.

117
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:48,486
Can I leave this with you for a bit?

118
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,593
I'm in a hurry.

119
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:51,633
Huh?

120
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,619
Hey, wait. Where are you rushing off to?

121
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Hey!

122
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,970
Shit.

123
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:02,063
What did I say to him in my past life?

124
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,818
Hey, you.

125
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:28,281
You from that day.

126
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,796
Yeah, it's me.

127
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:32,115
Hey, you.

128
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,904
Interested in coming inside with me?

129
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:42,002
Come inside and we can do something fun.

130
00:10:46,574 --> 00:10:47,574
Uh...

131
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,017
This is a music rehearsal room.

132
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:51,963
And the owner of this room...

133
00:10:51,987 --> 00:10:53,450
he just bought a new Gibson.

134
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:54,798
If you want to try.

135
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Oh.

136
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,137
Uh, no thanks.

137
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:04,507
You.

138
00:11:06,473 --> 00:11:07,473
Shit.

139
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,284
Nut!

140
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:12,421
Nut, wait for me!

141
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:13,939
What do you want from me?

142
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,054
I don't want anything from you.

143
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,322
I just wanted to invite you...

144
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:21,373
Oh shit.

145
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:25,411
Hey!

146
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,477
How do you ride like that?

147
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:36,041
Did a trash can jump in front of you?

148
00:11:37,453 --> 00:11:38,487
Yeah, Dad.

149
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,356
These days, trash cans
don't watch for bikes.

150
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,197
You're right. Trash cans
are so badly behaved.

151
00:11:45,816 --> 00:11:47,322
Good thing it wasn't a truck.

152
00:11:51,106 --> 00:11:52,494
When you go out riding...

153
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,200
watch where you're going, okay?

154
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:56,911
I will.

155
00:11:57,652 --> 00:11:58,770
Alright, come here.

156
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,045
Final step.

157
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,072
This one.

158
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,550
This is going to sting a little.

159
00:12:10,513 --> 00:12:11,720
And the last thing is...

160
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:21,994
All done.

161
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,939
You've been acting a little strange lately.

162
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:37,192
Is something on your mind?

163
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:41,766
I'm not acting strange at all.

164
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,839
Maybe you're the one overthinking it.

165
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:51,543
If you have any problems at all...

166
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:53,390
you can talk to me.

167
00:12:53,742 --> 00:12:54,742
You know?

168
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,466
Yes.

169
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,374
I'm going to do the dishes.

170
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,465
It's okay, Dad.

171
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,199
I'll do them today.

172
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,488
You're going to do the dishes for me?

173
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:14,863
Pigs must be flying.

174
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:17,531
You're exaggerating, Dad.

175
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,625
- You go rest. I'll take care of it.
- Okay, okay.

176
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:23,405
Be careful walking.

177
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,177
What's up, bro?

178
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,493
Heartbroken?

179
00:14:58,955 --> 00:15:01,274
Nah, man. Not heartbroken.

180
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:06,084
Don't lie to me, bro.

181
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,070
You think I can't tell
when you look like this?

182
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:13,451
Your condition looks
more worrying than mine.

183
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:15,216
You should get some sleep, man.

184
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:18,236
Hey, little bro.

185
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:20,173
The life of a rock star.

186
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:21,850
Who sleeps when you're a rock star?

187
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:25,245
Whatever makes you happy.

188
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,301
Talking back now.

189
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:31,280
"Whatever makes you happy."

190
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,230
Is this your friend's?

191
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:42,417
I found it on the ground
yesterday when leaving.

192
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:09,525
One glass of pennywort juice.

193
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:11,064
Heartbroken kid over here.

194
00:16:12,115 --> 00:16:13,115
Bro.

195
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,518
Okay, just handle it like that then.

196
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:22,055
Okay.

197
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:27,142
Anything else?

198
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,033
Nut.

199
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:41,506
I'll talk to you later.

200
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:48,669
What time did you say you'd be back?

201
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,152
I chose a different route home today.

202
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:56,892
Why?

203
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,566
Did you get mugged by some thugs?

204
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:02,347
No, sir.

205
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:04,948
I...

206
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:06,543
Next time, be home on time.

207
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,293
Don't waste your time
on nonsense like that.

208
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:11,867
Understand?

209
00:17:20,264 --> 00:17:21,304
Yes, Dad.

Did I mishear that?

218
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,298
I've heard the saying...

219
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,131
that time will prove all things.

220
00:19:37,513 --> 00:19:38,920
But I don't think that's true.

221
00:19:39,692 --> 00:19:42,767
There are some things
that time cannot prove.

222
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:45,833
One of them is memory.

223
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,421
The more time passes...

224
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:50,922
the more the images of the past fade.

225
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:54,432
Until sometimes, we're not even sure...

226
00:19:55,525 --> 00:19:56,947
if what we remember...

227
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:00,547
is real or just an illusion.

228
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:06,225
Another thing time can't answer…

229
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,090
is the meaning of life.

230
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,554
I've spent 17 years looking for it.

231
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:15,581
But I still haven't found the answer.

232
00:20:16,454 --> 00:20:18,225
What was I really born for?

233
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:21,411
What kind of answer is it supposed to be?

234
00:20:23,977 --> 00:20:25,104
If I were to say...

235
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:28,045
that I was born just to play music...

236
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,622

243
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,090
Win, have you heard Alankarn's new song?

244
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,068
The song...

245
00:21:21,394 --> 00:21:22,547
Is it "Stop It Now"?

246
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,406
I can even sing that one.

247
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:26,476
What song is that?

248
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:27,968
Are you just making that up?

249
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:30,304
It's called "Please Don't Whine."

250
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,079
Oh.

251
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,372
Yeah, right.

252
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:37,094
I guess I remembered it wrong.

253
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,109
Alankarn is having a concert tonight.

254
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:41,309
Wanna go?

255
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,912
Tonight?

256
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,922
I can't make it tonight, Biu.

257
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,100
I already have plans.

258
00:21:48,286 --> 00:21:50,095
What plans?

259
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,543
Do you actually want
to be in a band or not?

260
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:54,451
If you want to be in a band...

261
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,877
you have to go listen to the pros play.

262
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,158
I want to go, too.

263
00:22:00,182 --> 00:22:02,476
But I already have plans.

264
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:04,515
How about...

265
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:08,494
next time, I promise I won't ditch you.

266
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:11,904
Ditch?

267
00:22:12,917 --> 00:22:15,748
I mean, I won't bail on you.

268
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,331
What the hell is "Bail"?

269
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:24,704
I definitely won't miss it.

270
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:26,632
Next time, I won't miss it for sure,

271
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:27,656
okay?

272
00:22:28,374 --> 00:22:30,127
You've been acting weird lately.

273
00:22:30,426 --> 00:22:32,014
Get some rest, dude.

274
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:34,124
Wanna listen?

275
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,516
♪ Please don't whine. ♪

276
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,439
Nut.

277
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:56,484
You dropped your wallet.

278
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Thanks.

279
00:23:26,764 --> 00:23:27,797
Hey.

280
00:23:31,145 --> 00:23:32,151
Want some meatballs?

281
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:48,916
You're not scared of me now?

282
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,378
I still am.

283
00:23:55,052 --> 00:23:56,612
I'm just returning the favor.

284
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,500
I'm sorry for scaring you.

285
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:20,310
Do you...

286
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,592
really like the music I play?

287
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,158
I think...

288
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:44,085
I'll swing by the Alankarn
concert before going home.

289
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,732
Are you...

290
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,438
interested in going together?

291
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
Let's go.

292
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:04,970
I want a red soda. You want some?

293
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:05,995
Sure.

294
00:25:06,476 --> 00:25:07,780
Hey, wait a minute.

295
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:09,653
I think...

296
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:12,652
we should check out this shop first.

297
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,430
Oh, Win.

298
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,305
I thought you said you weren't coming.

299
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,102
And who's this?

300
00:25:27,052 --> 00:25:29,059
This is Nut, my friend.

301
00:25:31,653 --> 00:25:32,808
Aha!

302
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:34,152
So when you said you had plans...

303
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,386
could it be...

304
00:25:36,323 --> 00:25:37,811
I'll go to the front of the stage first.

305
00:25:37,835 --> 00:25:39,302
Nut seemed to be in a hurry.

306
00:25:39,536 --> 00:25:40,799
You were buying drinks, right?

307
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,450
Can you buy me two red sodas?

308
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:43,953
Let's go.

309
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,948
Two red soda, please.

310
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:49,886
And a green one, too.

311
00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:12,429
You think...

312
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:16,162
we should start a band?

313
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,790
Wait, wait.

314
00:26:53,702 --> 00:26:54,822
Sit down first.

315
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:00,779
How are you, man?

316
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,040
Are you hurt anywhere?

317
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:04,667
I'm fine.

318
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,146
But are you okay?

319
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:12,057
A scratch like this is nothing.

320
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,443
Don't worry about me.

321
00:27:14,237 --> 00:27:15,717
But you, did you get hit from behind?

322
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:16,951
You're okay...

323
00:27:17,378 --> 00:27:19,022
but will your dad be okay with this?

324
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:22,939
My dad is kind. It's not a big deal.

325
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,736
Let me treat your wound first.

326
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,927
Hey, don't touch.

327
00:27:56,316 --> 00:27:57,416
Are you sure...

328
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,246
that it's going to be okay?

329
00:28:00,744 --> 00:28:01,881
No problem.

330
00:28:01,906 --> 00:28:03,443
My dad will understand.

331
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,474
Give it to me.

332
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:08,890
Let go!

333
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,024
I told you to give it to me! Let go!

334
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,402
Is it because of this thing?

335
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:15,811
That you've become such a delinquent?

336
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:17,456
Getting into fights with others.

337
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,579
Dad, don't...

338
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:20,570
- Don't say that to our son.
- Shut up!

339
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:23,852
You know what's coming for you?

340
00:28:31,527 --> 00:28:33,827
You want to play it so badly, huh?

341
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,301
Want to play it so badly, huh?

342
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:42,770
Why are you doing this?

343
00:28:45,603 --> 00:28:47,650
Why are you doing this?

344
00:30:01,742 --> 00:30:02,795
Hey, Win.

345
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:04,753
Are you alright?

346
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,439
Sit down, sit down.

347
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,613
Where did you disappear to yesterday?

348
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:11,811
I looked all over for you.

349
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,187
I was looking for you too.

350
00:30:14,217 --> 00:30:16,478
I thought you pissed
someone off and got killed.

351
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,901
What happened to your leg?

352
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,440
It's from yesterday.

353
00:30:24,464 --> 00:30:26,518
I was running too fast
and twisted my ankle.

354
00:30:32,271 --> 00:30:33,416
What's with you?

355
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:36,140
You look like you've done something wrong.

356
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:39,803
No, it's nothing.

357
00:30:40,688 --> 00:30:42,381
No one has done anything wrong.

358
00:30:48,111 --> 00:30:49,111
Biu.

359
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:51,629
Can you do something for me?

360
00:30:53,037 --> 00:30:54,278
Of course, my friend.

361
00:30:54,302 --> 00:30:55,537
What do you need help with?

362
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:58,062
I'm ready to help you with anything.

363
00:30:58,496 --> 00:30:59,475
Are you sure?

364
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,814
Of course.

365
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:03,317
Why? Is it about the band?

366
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:05,168
Yeah.

367
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,331
I think...

368
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,793
I'm pretty good at shaking an angklung.

369
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:12,584
Well...

370
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:17,014
I want to invite you to
be the band manager.

371
00:31:18,163 --> 00:31:19,163
Sure!

372
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,980
So who's in the band right now?

373
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,474
There's you, me...

374
00:31:25,197 --> 00:31:26,300
and...

375
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:33,411
I think...

376
00:31:36,034 --> 00:31:37,554
I can't be in a band with you anymore.

377
00:31:43,994 --> 00:31:45,060
Sorry, man.

378
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,047
Wait, Nut.

379
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,110
Nut!

380
00:31:55,432 --> 00:31:56,456
So now...

381
00:31:57,093 --> 00:31:58,566
it's just you and me.

382
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:01,435
What's next?

383
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,724
You sing, and I'll play the angklung, okay?

384
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
Dad.

385
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:35,061
What?

386
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:52,709
It's nothing.

387
00:33:52,816 --> 00:33:54,004
Hey, Win.

388
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,450
Are you alright?

389
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,823
There's nothing wrong with me.

390
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:57,917
I'm perfectly fine.

391
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:02,773
- Don't tell me you've been using...
- And I haven't been using anything.

392
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,742
And I'm not heartbroken either.

393
00:34:05,868 --> 00:34:06,868
Hey.

394
00:34:07,894 --> 00:34:09,955
How does this kid know what I'm thinking?

395
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,215
Can you read my mind?

396
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:15,236
It's because I'm from the future.

397
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:17,689
From the future?

398
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:22,932
Don't tell me you're
looking for John Connor.

399
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:24,936
If you find him, don't
shoot him with a shotgun.

400
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,298
He's here to save the world.

401
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:30,485
I'll be back.

402
00:34:42,495 --> 00:34:44,015
- Phop asked me to return this.
- Okay.

403
00:34:56,172 --> 00:34:59,265
This is the stage I wanted
to invite you to compete on.

404
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,110
So...

405
00:35:02,782 --> 00:35:03,783
what do you say?

406
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:11,176
I really can't compete with you.

407
00:35:14,467 --> 00:35:15,704
Is it because of the guitar?

408
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:18,488
How did you know?

409
00:35:22,436 --> 00:35:23,798
Your dad confiscated it, right?

410
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,243
I saw you didn't bring your guitar.

411
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:30,634
Smashed.

412
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,390
Smashed?

413
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,484
But if it's an acoustic guitar...

414
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,776
I have one you can borrow.

415
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:44,314
Where would I find the time to practice?

416
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,007
Just tell your dad you're
going to a study group.

417
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:48,238
If it's about studying,

418
00:35:48,262 --> 00:35:49,729
your dad would never say no.

419
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,236
Why do you talk like you know my dad?

420
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:57,363
Well...

421
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:00,869
I'm from the future.

422
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:05,388
Have you found John Connor yet?

423
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,296
Well...

424
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,435
I'd love to joke with you, but...

425
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,811
someone just used that joke.

426
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:15,367
Oh, really?

427
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:24,202
You still haven't changed this bandage?

428
00:36:25,629 --> 00:36:27,829
Don't touch it. I'll change it for you.

429
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:38,947
This will sting a little.

430
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:56,797
Is it almost healed?

431
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:57,998
Don't touch it.

432
00:37:33,327 --> 00:37:36,397
So, about the competition...

433
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,160
what do you say?

434
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:53,251
So you think...

435
00:37:54,702 --> 00:37:56,382
how many instruments should our band have?

436
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:59,683
I think four is enough.

437
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,326
I'll play guitar.

438
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,259
You sing and play keyboard.

439
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,100
We're still missing a
bass and drums, though.

440
00:38:09,696 --> 00:38:10,696
Don't you worry.

441
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,206
I already talked to Phop.

442
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:15,305
He said he knows a great
drummer and a bassist.

443
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:19,875
The girl at the bar was super hot.

444
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,665
But a pretty face doesn't mean anything.

445
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,500
Hey, hey, hey!

446
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:25,904
Hey!

447
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:41,628
Are you sure we're in the right place?

448
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:43,546
Yeah.

449
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:45,123
Trust me, this is it.

450
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,099
That's him. Our bassist.

451
00:38:59,843 --> 00:39:00,843
Should I go now?

452
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:08,279
Chai.

453
00:39:19,949 --> 00:39:21,131
Who are you?

454
00:39:22,113 --> 00:39:23,677
Um...

455
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:25,875
my name is Win.

456
00:39:26,476 --> 00:39:28,002
And the three of us want...

457
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:29,033
Wait.

458
00:39:32,849 --> 00:39:33,849
You.

459
00:39:39,355 --> 00:39:40,573
Thanks.

460
00:39:49,612 --> 00:39:51,450
No one's helping me carry this.

461
00:39:52,798 --> 00:39:54,253
So careless.

462
00:39:57,752 --> 00:39:59,370
Watch where you're going!

463
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,512
Sorry.

464
00:40:01,821 --> 00:40:02,821
I didn't see you.

465
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:07,945
Is that it?

466
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:12,216
What do you want me to do?

467
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:17,025
Go get in line and buy me a new one.

468
00:40:19,845 --> 00:40:20,900
The line is long.

469
00:40:33,836 --> 00:40:36,141
Take this and go buy a new one.

470
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:37,633
And we're done.

471
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:38,658
Okay?

472
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:42,938
No.

473
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,389
Are you looking for trouble?

474
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:50,883
Are you going to punch a girl?

475
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,400
If a girl is being annoying...

476
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:57,600
I'd dare to punch her.

477
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,930
You want some?

478
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:02,724
Fine.

479
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:06,930
- Hey, guys!
- What's up, kid?

480
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,590
This guy said you're a loser.

481
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:11,344
Hey, you looking for a problem?

482
00:41:11,807 --> 00:41:12,534
You shorty!

483
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:14,312
Hey, what's the hell?

484
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:41,716
Sorry, man.

485
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:44,823
If I have to be in a band with her...

486
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:47,375
I'm out.

487
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:51,595
Go.

488
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:03,792
What did you do?

489
00:42:07,537 --> 00:42:09,387
Damn it, Biu!

490
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:10,823
What have you done?

491
00:42:11,933 --> 00:42:13,460
I'm sorry.

492
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:17,430
So what now?

493
00:42:32,822 --> 00:42:35,022
I'm going to the market.
Who wants something?

494
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:36,588
- Red soda for me, Dad.
- Okay.

495
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,449
- Same for me.
- Okay.

496
00:42:39,322 --> 00:42:41,450
Win, what do you want?

497
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:42,575
Red soda?

498
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,062
Dad.

499
00:42:46,378 --> 00:42:47,658
I would like a bottle of liquor.

500
00:43:14,172 --> 00:43:16,566
(Next Episode)
Go play music with your friends.

501
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,505
Understood?

502
00:43:19,629 --> 00:43:20,974
Dad, Mom, do you think...

503
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:22,223
Ek, wait.

504
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,090
I can actually start a band?

505
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:30,786
Nut.

506
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:32,700
I'm fine.

507
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:34,450
I just ran a lot, that's all.

508
00:43:35,661 --> 00:43:37,734
Before you say you're fine...

509
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:39,518
you should go get it
checked out to be sure.

510
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:42,308
Ready?
