1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,280
🎵 Do you remember when we first met? 🎵

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,480
🎵 When did we become more than just friends? 🎵

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,280
🎵 Honestly, I can't remember. 🎵

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,800
🎵 All I know is, I have only you. 🎵

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,800
🎵 Wherever I go, I need you by my side.🎵

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,280
🎵 I'm begging you.🎵

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,320
🎵 Please, don't leave me. 🎵

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,480
🎵 We survived all the storms, side by side 🎵

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,400
🎵 You stand in the rain with me 🎵

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840
🎵 On the days when I had no one left🎵

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,080
🎵 After all these years, it's still you 🎵

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,600
🎵 The longer times goes, it's still you. 🎵

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
🎵 If it's not you🎵

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,680
🎵 Then I wouldn't want to go through all the pain 🎵

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,720
🎵 I'll never forget you🎵

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,120
🎵 No matter how tonight ends 🎵

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,320
🎵 After the all we've been through, it was worth it🎵

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,800
"Rearrange"
(Episode 1)

19
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,440
I thought you couldn't make it.

20
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
Damn.

21
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,400
Thank you so much, Dad.

22
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,120
I'm so jealous of you, Win.
Why can't I have a father like yours?

23
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,120
What do you think, Dad?
Want to adopt Nut as your son too?

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
Are you joking? I can't.

25
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,480
Why?

26
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,160
Nut has parents.

27
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,840
You want me to kidnap him?

28
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,840
I will have trouble with his parents.

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,960
Worst case, I get arrested.

30
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
What if I go to jail? What are you going to do?

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,520
See? Can't even answer it ha ha ha.

32
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Don't worry, Nut

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,040
I'll be your Dad for 24 hours. Okay?

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,200
One day is way too good.

35
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,080
🎵 Slowly…🎵

36
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,040
🎵 Don't, don't, don't act like you know 🎵

37
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
🎵 Who's the real one 🎵

38
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,200
🎵 Don't, don't, don't tryna be a boss 🎵

39
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,200
🎵 No matter how powerful you think you are🎵

40
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,120
🎵 Better back off if all I'll get is pain 🎵

41
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,160
🎵 Say it more again… 🎵

42
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,640
🎵 and you will see🎵

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,040
Thanks a lot.

44
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,000
Without you, I wouldn't have had the chance
to attend this kind of event.

45
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,440
I also have to thank you.

46
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,000
For coming with me.

47
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
You and me…

48
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,400
How did we even meet?

49
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,200
Want to rent a practice room?

50
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,360
It costs 100 baht per hour.

51
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
For the whole day, 500 baht.

52
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,520
If you really want to practice, I can ask for a discount.

53
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,000
Interested?

54
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,080
Oh…Um.

55
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,560
No, thanks.

56
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,040
Have you got enough sleep?

57
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,720
Shit, Win.

58
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
Hey! Are you interested in hiring someone for a night shift?

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,720
Are you crazy?

60
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Hiring you for a single shift has already put me in the red.

61
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,200
Here.

62
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,440
What the heck.

63
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,680
Shit.

64
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,960
Is it time for me to pay you off again?

65
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,800
Goddamn it.

66
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,240
Economics these days is fucking crazy.

67
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,600
Don't complain about it.

68
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,520
Hey, Win.

69
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,160
Don't be late tomorrow.

70
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,320
If not, I'll deduct 100 baht per minute from your salary.

71
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,360
What if I come early? Will you give me 100 baht per minute?

72
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,400
That's bullshit.

73
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,680
You can go now.

74
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,080
Hey, we met again.

75
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,240
You're heading this way too?

76
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,440
Wanna go back together?

77
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,760
No, it's okay.

78
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,960
Wait. For real, that's all you're gonna say?

79
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,720
Come on, I'll give you a ride, don't worry about it.

80
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,360
It's fine.

81
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,480
I say don't worry about it.

82
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
I can give you a ride.

83
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Ouch.

84
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,200
Give me your leg.

85
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,240
Next time, watch where you're riding.

86
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,360
Thanks.

87
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
I really gotta go.

88
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Or my dad's gonna get mad.

89
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,160
My name is Win.

90
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,840
I'm Nut.

91
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,440
Still want me to drop you off?

92
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,320
That's okay.

93
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,640
Nut.

94
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,920
Nut, are you going home early today?

95
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,040
Uh-huh.

96
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,920
Well, want to practice?

97
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,960
I'll pass.

98
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,040
But! No one's using it today.

99
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,800
I can ask it for free.

100
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,120
You like playing guitar, right?

101
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
There's a Gibson guitar at the practice room right now.

102
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,600
Wanna try?

103
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,760
What model?

104
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,360
I don't have a single customer,
and still have to let you play for free.

105
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,880
Bro, come on.

106
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Listen, I came five minutes early today.

107
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,440
Honestly, I should get 500 baht. But I won't take any.

108
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,160
Let's count it as a rent payment.

109
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,320
What.

110
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,280
When did I tell you I'd give you 100 baht per minute?

111
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,000
Fine, I'll let you play for free. Only one hour.

112
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
When you're done, don't forget to clean up everything.

113
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,320
Yes Sir!

114
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,640
Let's go.

115
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,240
Here.

116
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,280
Am I allowed to play it for free? For real?

117
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,360
Of course!

118
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,240
If we are not using it, then no one else will.

119
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,280
Here, try it out.

120
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,400
Damn, sounds so nice.

121
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,800
What style do you usually play?

122
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh… can I speak to you casually?

123
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,200
Sure.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So, what style do you usually play?

125
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,000
I mean…

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,240
I'm not really sure about that.

127
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,240
Let's start with um…
Can you play a song that you like?

128
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,040
🎵 I don't even know how much I love you. 🎵

129
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,600
🎵 Don't know why I love you🎵

130
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,680
🎵 All I know is I'll be barely alive. 🎵

131
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,160
🎵 If you're not here 🎵

132
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,560
🎵 Only know that 🎵

133
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,280
🎵 I would rather die 🎵

134
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,280
🎵 If you're gone 🎵

135
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,600
You wrote this song by yourself?

136
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,920
Uh-huh

137
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,040
keep playing, please?

138
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:10,080
🎵 From now on, I'll say I love you as if it's our last. 🎵

139
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,920
🎵 Is it real, staying right by your side? To make you feel loved 🎵

140
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:26,240
🎵 There'll be me, there'll be us. Every day will be like this. 🎵

141
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,840
🎵 I'll always love you. 🎵

142
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,040
Have you ever...

143
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,880
thought of making a music band?

144
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,840
How many instruments should we have.

145
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,280
I think four are enough.

146
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,160
Four instruments… Keyboard plus singer. I'm on guitar.

147
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,920
Still missing a bassist and a drummer, though.

148
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,120
I've spoken to P'Phop.

149
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,840
He said he knows a really good bassist and drummer to recommend.

150
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,880
Let's see it

151
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,720
🎵 I used to have hope 🎵

152
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,920
🎵 that if I fall in love, it won't make me cry.🎵

153
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,680
🎵 Hope I won't be alone 🎵

154
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,920
🎵 Hope not to fall for the wrong one.🎵

155
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,560
🎵 But in the end, I'm still hurting. 🎵

156
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,760
🎵 Because none of them ever loves me back🎵

157
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,720
🎵 Maybe I'm not good enough. 🎵

158
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,800
🎵 Or what I'm asking for is too much?🎵

159
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:09,120
🎵 Cause every time I fall in love,
it always ends up with tears. 🎵

160
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,400
🎵 ‘Cause I think that I'm not that bad. 🎵

161
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,080
🎵 I think that I'm not a bad guy🎵

162
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,800
🎵 Why is nobody loving me? 🎵

163
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,040
🎵 Why does nobody care? 🎵

164
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,040
🎵 Why, why, why 🎵

165
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,240
🎵 Please let me meet that person. Just once 🎵

166
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,480
🎵 If I met them, I will love them with all of my heart. 🎵

167
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,720
🎵 Won't ever break their heart🎵

168
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,040
🎵 Won't make them cry 🎵

169
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,360
🎵 That's it, am I asking for too much? 🎵

170
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,360
- Good?
- Yeah.

171
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,520
Food has arrived!

172
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,320
Ever since Lin joined, things have gotten easier.

173
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,240
Thanks.

174
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,480
No, I have to thank you for inviting me.

175
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,120
If not, I'll just be bored at home.

176
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Here! Your favorite drink.

177
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,160
Let's do it one more time.

178
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,120
Sure.

179
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,800
Super tired.

180
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Nut, there is a new ice cream shop nearby. Wanna go eat?

181
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,480
Ek, there is a new ice cream shop nearby. Wanna go eat?

182
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
Try not to be a jerk for one day, can you?

183
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm in, I want to eat.

184
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,760
But I don't!

185
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,160
I'm just teasing Lin.

186
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,080
Don't you get it?

187
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,720
Oh okay.

188
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,800
Can't.

189
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,640
Nut and I have planned to talk about the music after this.

190
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,440
Oh really, that's a shame.

191
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,880
Maybe next time.

192
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,280
Let's eat first.

193
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,080
Do we have any meetings after this?

194
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,720
Um…we did. Just a few minutes ago.

195
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,640
Could I have one scoop of lime flavor,

196
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,560
and another scoop of Chocolate Sundae
with lots of chocolate sprinkles, please?

197
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,160
Okay, please wait a moment.

198
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,280
Sure.

199
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,600
You remember?

200
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
Why wouldn't I.

201
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,680
You always order this.

202
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,480
By the way,

203
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,080
What about the song you wanna discuss?

204
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,640
Oh.

205
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Your new song! How is it going now?

206
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,440
Almost done.

207
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,680
I think it'll be done by next week.

208
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,880
What's going on?

209
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
I just wanted to know.

210
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,560
That's it, for a song?

211
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,600
Yep.

212
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,800
If you weren't my friend,

213
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
I would've thought you were jealous of me with Lin.

214
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,800
Hell no.

215
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Why would I be jealous of you with Lin?

216
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,280
What do you think about me?

217
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,680
I'm just going to the toilet.

218
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
Nut.

219
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,560
You good?

220
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,760
Are you okay?

221
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,760
Okay Okay.

222
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,800
I think I've just stood up too fast.

223
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm totally fine.

224
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,160
Let's say,

225
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,160
I'm not letting anything happen to me.
Not until we win the competition.

226
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Meaning that if you're done with the competition,
you're cool with dying?

227
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,160
Here's your order.

228
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,480
Lime ice cream and chocolate sundae

229
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,680
ooh, it's here.

230
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,400
So refreshing.

231
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,680
Nut.

232
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,880
Hmm?

233
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,920
Nothing serious.

234
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,040
I'll tell you after the competition's over.

235
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,600
Why are you dragging it?

236
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,920
Just say it.

237
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,120
Huh?

238
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,200
Well.

239
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,560
I will tell you after we're done with the competition.

240
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,280
Up to you then.

241
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,520
Want to eat? There is whipped cream too.

242
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,760
No.

243
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,600
It's sweet. I don't like it.

244
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,280
Sweet? Yours is also sweet.

245
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,480
Nah, yours is way sweeter. I'm not into it.

246
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,400
Pfft,

247
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,640
chhh chhh chhh.

248
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,520
Nut.

249
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,600
Here's napkins.

250
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,520
Let's eat.

251
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,280
I got cooked by Auntie Paew again.

252
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,800
I ordered shrimp basil, but I got chicken.

253
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,840
What's yours?

254
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,040
Hey guys.

255
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,640
Sorry, I'm late. I didn't get to take any pic for you guys.

256
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
But I'm bringing snacks for you all.

257
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,400
Oh.

258
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,400
Let's see.

259
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,280
Where did you go?

260
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,080
Took my film roll for a wash.

261
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,320
So how was the practice so far?

262
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,880
The same as always.

263
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,840
Win still got the same part wrong.

264
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,760
Speak for yourself.

265
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,640
I've been wondering for so long.

266
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,240
What's your biggest dream when it comes to playing music?

267
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,160
A dream?

268
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,680
I don't have any dreams for now.

269
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,480
I just want to win this competition.

270
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,960
What if you win?

271
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,520
I'll think about it then.

272
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,120
Right now, I think.

273
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,280
I just want to keep playing music with you guys.

274
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,640
And win the first place.

275
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,080
That's all.

276
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
What about others?

277
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,920
What if I said my dream...

278
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,560
to make your dreams come true,

279
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,280
would that be too much?

280
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,320
What a liar.

281
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,640
You're acting like a main character right now, Proper answer.

282
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,960
Alright alright.

283
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,480
My dream's probably like most people's.

284
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,320
Being a famous singer.

285
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Standing on big stages.

286
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,920
And see my dad,

287
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,120
standing in the crowd, singing along.

288
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,320
What about you, Ek?

289
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,680
If I become famous, I am not going to be a doctor.

290
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,040
Hey.

291
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,960
For real? Being a doctor is rich though.

292
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,840
Money's not the key,

293
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,960
I just want to live life my own way.

294
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,160
I want a god of drums like John Bonham.

295
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,520
So, you want to die at a young age haha, right?

296
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,920
Bro, I think you'll go before me.

297
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,720
Hey, kiddo.

298
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,160
All of your dreams are too basic.

299
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,640
If I win, I'm going to be famous

300
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,080
and then play at a bunch of clubs.

301
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,120
Then get free drinks from all the place, lol.

302
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,040
See? That's smartass.

303
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,880
Your dream is always about alcohol.

304
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,560
We call it an ARTIST.

305
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,080
I'm jealous of your dreams.

306
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,520
Let's win this together, shall we?

307
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
3 2 1 Yeah!

308
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,680
🎵 Every time I fall in love, it always ends up in tears. 🎵

309
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,200
🎵 I always thought I wasn't that bad. 🎵

310
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,040
🎵 Believed that I'm not a bad guy.🎵

311
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,560
🎵 Why does nobody love me? 🎵

312
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,840
🎵 Why does nobody care? 🎵

313
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,840
🎵 Why, why, why. 🎵

314
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,200
🎵 Let me meet that person. Just once.🎵

315
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,040
🎵 If I do, I will love them with all of my heart.🎵

316
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,440
🎵 Won't break your heart.🎵

317
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,880
🎵 Won't make you cry.🎵

318
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,160
🎵 That's all I ask... is that too much?🎵

319
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,640
Hey Nut, Nut!

320
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
Hey Nut!

321
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,320
Hey, guys.

322
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,240
Why didn't you tell us about your illness?

323
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,200
Did we win?

324
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,600
I'm being serious, Nut.

325
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,760
Take it seriously.

326
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,520
Thanks for worrying about me.

327
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,840
And sorry that

328
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,000
I couldn't make our band to become champions.

329
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,280
Why are you bringing this up now.

330
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
I really wanted to win with you guys.

331
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,200
Stop talking like that.

332
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,080
You'll get better.

333
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,520
Right?

334
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,080
And we'll continue playing together like always.

335
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,840
What a shame.

336
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,080
I don't think...

337
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I will have a chance to play with you guys anymore.

338
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,640
I'm so sorry.

339
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,400
You have to fight.

340
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,120
July 7, 1998.

341
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I've been feeling dizzy lately.

342
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,840
So today, I decided to see a doctor.

343
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,440
And guess what… Jackpot.

344
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,440
Luckily, I went alone.

345
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,240
Dad and Mom still don't know about this.

346
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,040
Sigh… how should I tell them about this?

347
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,240
Or should I just keep it a secret?

348
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,000
At least, I just want to win the band competition.

349
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,280
Wish I had more time to play music with everyone.

350
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,920
Want to go to Win's wedding.

351
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,800
Want to attend Win's concert.

352
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,080
Camping and having some BBQ with everyone would be fun.

353
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,240
But with the shirtless.

354
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,080
Too bad,

355
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,080
I should've spent more time with Lin.

356
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,440
I want to fall in love just once.

357
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,560
If I'd had more time,

358
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,600
I would've told Lin I love her.

359
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,800
Didn't you say you had no dreams?

360
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,800
I remember now.

361
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,440
You and I met because you crashed your bike into the garbage.

362
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Ah yeah, I was so embarrassed.

363
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,520
But, I'm glad you did.

364
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Satisfied that I crashed into the garbage?

365
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
That's why I met you.

366
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,600
You don't need to worry.

367
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,920
You're stuck with me for a long decade.

368
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,320
Then don't leave me so soon, okay?

369
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,640
Who's really leaving who, Nut?

370
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,640
Nut, I've read your diary.

371
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,560
At first I wanted to make all of your dreams come true.

372
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,040
But from what I saw, I can accomplish a few.

373
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,280
There's one dream though.

374
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,640
The one that you wanted to watch my concert.

375
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I think I can make that happen.

376
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,680
If I get to have a big concert,

377
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,320
I'll save one seat just for you.

378
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,240
And you have to be there.

379
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,160
I promise you.

380
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,600
I'll become a super famous singer.

381
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,560
Just wait and see, Nut.

382
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,160
(27 years later)

383
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
Sigh.

384
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:11,920
🎵 If I begged you not to go,
would you soften your heart a bit? 🎵

385
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:23,760
🎵 Cause I don't know what it's like to be left alone,
It must hurt like hell, right? 🎵

386
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:33,840
🎵 Just a few months or a year.
But I still miss you every second. 🎵

387
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,680
Why did it come out as square boxes?

388
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,840
P'Win, your document.

389
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,560
🎵 This love will take time to heal, right?🎵

390
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:56,280
🎵 I knew it'd hurt,
but never thought it'd hurt so bad. 🎵

391
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:07,760
🎵 I knew you'd leave someday,
but never thought it'd be this soon. 🎵

392
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,760
🎵 I'm not ready for this. 🎵

393
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,320
Hey Win, boss is looking for you.

394
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,620
Okay.

395
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,580
What?

396
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,260
🎵 That you're leaving. 🎵

397
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,540
I think.

398
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,100
You should take a break for a while.

399
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,140
(call from P'Da (the room's owner))

400
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,860
If you don't pay the rent, I'll have to ask you to leave.

401
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,180
Tim, are you free to talk?

402
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
If you ask for money, I don't have it.

403
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,740
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?
Calling your brother to borrow money again.

404
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,580
Hanging up now, I'm busy now.

405
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,340
Hello.

406
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,620
Biu.

407
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,340
Do you think you could lend me another 5,000 baht?

408
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,500
I want to help you, but you haven't returned the last one.

409
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,260
It's okay.

410
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,700
I actually have some. I'm just asking.

411
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,860
Thanks a lot.

412
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,500
‘It's been 7 years since you have gone, dad.'

413
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,860
‘R.I.P. Vitul Thanasombud. Rest in peace, Papa'

414
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,960
Nut…

415
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,160
If I had gotten to you a bit sooner,

416
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,120
would you be mad at me?

417
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,840
(Notification reminder)
Tomorrow is Nut's death anniversary.

418
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,400
I'm so sorry, I haven't been here in years.

419
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I guess no one else's been visiting either, right?

420
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,880
Doctor Ek is super busy.

421
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,040
You and Chai

422
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,240
must've already reunited up in heaven by now.

423
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,000
Remind him to pay me back, will you?

424
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,960
Give me some winning lottery numbers for four to five draws in a row.

425
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,800
You know what, Nut? I'm jealous of you sometimes.

426
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,040
How have you been?

427
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:34,200
Same-sex marriage law has approved now.

428
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,080
If I hadn't hesitated and just told you.

429
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,440
And, by any chance, you actually like me too.

430
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,240
And if you hadn't died.

431
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,800
Do you think that we...

432
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,880
Do you think we would've ended up getting married?

433
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,520
Win.

434
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Lin.

435
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,120
Same thought.

436
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,640
You haven't been here in many years. Busy with work?

437
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,440
Do you come every year?

438
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,840
Since I got back from the UK, I've come almost every year.

439
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,120
But I think you should come here more often.

440
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,960
Nut definitely wants to see you more than me.

441
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,080
Why?

442
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,840
Back then, when he was still alive, he was always thinking of you.

443
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,120
Made me jealous.

444
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,840
I think I'm the one who should've been jealous of you.

445
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,920
Jealous of me?

446
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,440
I barely hangout with Nut.

447
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,520
Do you think,

448
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,000
if Nut was still here,

449
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,080
he and I would've gotten married?

450
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,560
I don't know either.

451
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,560
🎵 Being tired for so long, I endured and held on.🎵

452
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,640
🎵 No matter how much I loved, it all turned dark.🎵

453
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,360
🎵 Nowhere to go, no chance to meet again. 🎵

454
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:43,440
🎵 I'll let my heart rest, and leave you.🎵

455
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,960
🎵 I'll cut all strings, no attachment left.🎵

456
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,960
🎵 I'll love you without having to force it anymore.🎵

457
00:47:43,816 --> 00:47:46,816
Shit, shit.

458
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,360
Shit.

459
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,760
FUCK.

460
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,600
What's going on son! What happened?! A robbery???

461
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,240
Who? Who hurt you? Who hurt…

462
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,120
Dad Dad!
Yeah what?

463
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,840
Daddddd.

464
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,600
P'Win!

465
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,200
Tim! You're dead too?

466
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,080
Who's dead?

467
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,000
Shit.

468
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,400
What the heck. What is going on?

469
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,320
Win, what the fuck are you doing?

470
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,960
Shit! Biu!

471
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,720
Hey Stop there!

472
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,480
Go get dressed first.

473
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,560
Shit, I can see yellow from far away.

474
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,280
Wait for me, right there! Just a sec!

475
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,480
Hold on! Win!

476
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,880
What the fuck is wrong with you?

477
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,040
I'm not dreaming right, Biu?

478
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,600
Ouch! What the heck!

479
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,000
If you're hurting, it is not a dream.

480
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,480
Biu, do you believe in time travel?

481
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,280
Yes, I believe.

482
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,680
Cause I think I just came back in time…

483
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,760
What did you take to get this high? Spill it.

484
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,600
I promise not to tell your dad.

485
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,560
I'm so done with you.

486
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,720
What? Wait for me!

487
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,560
Win.

488
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,480
Damn it, Win!

489
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,360
Nut!

490
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:28,920
Who's Nut?

491
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,160
Kwanchira, what are you guys talking about?

492
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,360
What did I just say about Boyle's Law, answer it.

493
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,040
B Boyle…?

494
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,760
Do you mean Boyd Kosiyabong, a singer?

495
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,000
Look now, Your Boyd Kosiyapong.

496
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,560
Hey, I was just helping you out.

497
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,800
Helping me to stand right here?

498
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,120
Do you even know which Boy the teacher talked about?

499
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,280
No idea.

500
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:29,720
The only boys I know are Boy
from room 2 and Boyd Kosiyapong.

501
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,360
But, what were you daydreaming about?
I called you and you didn't even look.

502
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:49,720
Have you ever wanted to meet someone,
like really wanted to.

503
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,840
But you're afraid to go see them.

504
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,080
No, never.

505
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:04,360
If I want to see someone or talk to someone,
I just go for it. No wasting time.

506
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,320
You're being show-off.

507
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,920
For real!

508
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,280
And why are you asking?

509
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,480
Who do you want to see?

510
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,680
Huh, or you're secretly crushing on someone?

511
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,360
None of your business.

512
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,160
Ooooh, secret crush!

513
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:21,160
🎵 Don't know how much I love you. 🎵

514
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:29,040
🎵 Don't know why I love you🎵

515
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,320
🎵 All I know is I can't live without you. 🎵

516
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,360
🎵 If you're not🎵

517
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,040
Nut.

518
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,640
I like you.

519
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,120
(Next Episode)
FUUUUCK.

520
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,480
What the actual fuck have I done?

521
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,280
Dad, I think Win's on drug.

522
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,000
Huh?

523
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,400
Hey!

524
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,760
You... from that day.

525
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,080
Do you wanna go inside with me?

526
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,800
Let's go inside and do something fun together.

527
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,920
Uh, no thanks.

528
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,760
Is this your friend's?

529
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,400
Alangkarn will have concert this evening.

530
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:36,040
Wanna go?
I already have planned.

531
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,640
Nut, Nut!

532
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,000
I think I'm gonna go for Alangkarn concert
before get home.

533
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,040
Wanna go with me?

534
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,200
Do you think...

535
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,800
we should make a band together?
