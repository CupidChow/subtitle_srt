00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:07,146
(Previously)
I used to think that I wanted to have a band,

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,870
and invite everyone to go camping,

3
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:11,205
to sit and eat mookrata like this for a long time.

4
00:00:11,407 --> 00:00:12,704
You...

5
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:14,478
seem to know my heart.

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:21,502
I'll give it to you.

8
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:22,623
Go ahead and finish it.

9
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,658
You can hold my hand like this.

10
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:25,688
So you won't be cold.

11
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:27,431
In the next 20 years,

12
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:28,811
Lin and Nut...

13
00:00:29,055 --> 00:00:30,328
I think...

14
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:31,496
I like Nut.

15
00:00:31,524 --> 00:00:33,243
Can you help me find the right moment?

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,617
Of course, Lin.

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,463

"Rearrange"
(Episode 7)

35
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:59,121
You haven't been here in years?

36
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:00,343
Busy with work?

37
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:02,802
Lin...

38
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:04,775
Do you come here every year?

39
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,892
Well...

40
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,559
since I came back from England,

41
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,401
I've come almost every year.

42
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:14,338
But I think

43
00:02:14,362 --> 00:02:16,212
you should come more often.

44
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:18,725
Nut probably wants to see you more than me.

45
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:20,852
Why?

46
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:23,347
Well, look at him when he was alive.

47
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,776
It was always about Win.

48
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:26,327
It made me

49
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:28,040
jealous.

50
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,558
I think I'm the one

51
00:02:32,676 --> 00:02:33,881
who should be jealous of you.

52
00:02:35,728 --> 00:02:37,087
What's there to be jealous of?

53
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,107
I...

54
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,640
barely got to go anywhere with Nut.

55
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:07,915
Do you think...

56
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:11,938
if Nut hadn't died,

57
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,381
would Nut and I have gotten married?

58
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,718
If you hadn't stolen my time with Nut,

59
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:30,560
do you think Nut and I would have fallen in love?

60
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,803
Answer me, Win.

61
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:36,957
Answer!

62
00:03:38,006 --> 00:03:39,021
What a shame.

63
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:43,120
I never even got to tell Lin I loved her.

64
00:03:50,044 --> 00:03:51,353
It's all because of you, Win.

65
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:47,889
Well, well.

66
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:50,395
"the best view," huh?

67
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:51,737
What?

68
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:53,761
There are pictures of everyone in our band.

69
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:55,831
Where?

70
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,146
1, 2, 3...

71
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,494
3 pictures out of 10?

72
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:01,956
Look at your face.

73
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,320
That's all I could use.

74
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:04,902
Hey, hey.

75
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:06,633
I'm here to help you, Biu.

76
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,086
Thank you.

77
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,613
I know.

78
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:22,330
That you like Lin.

79
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,038
You're talking nonsense.

80
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:27,595
Hey.

81
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:28,983
I

82
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:31,136
have known you since you were this tall.

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,271
Damn it.

84
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:33,843
Is that a person or a sewer rat?

85
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:46,544
See?

86
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:48,278
You haven't grown at all.

87
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:52,617
Okay.

88
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:54,108
I admit it.

89
00:05:55,034 --> 00:05:57,573
Admit that you haven't grown up?

90
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,015
No.

91
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:00,228
Well...

92
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:02,087
Yeah, that.

93
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:15,787
Do you think...

94
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,009
I should tell Lin?

95
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,824
You're taking too long.

96
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:28,096
I've made up my mind.

97
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:29,815
I think I'm going to tell her.

98
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:34,867
Pick up the trash.

99
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,742
Hey Lin, are you going anywhere after this?

100
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:45,792
I was going to get ice cream with Nut.

101
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:47,133
Hey, great!

102
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,293
I was just craving ice cream.

103
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:49,417
Can I come along?

104
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:51,424
Hey, Biu.

105
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:55,407
You have a plan with me, right?

106
00:06:58,491 --> 00:06:59,651
What plan?

107
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:01,945
Well...

108
00:07:02,612 --> 00:07:04,373
the dinner plan you made with me.

109
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:05,531
Grilled chicken.

110
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,398
And also,

111
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:14,179
enjoy your meal, Lin.

112
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,228
You too, Nut.

113
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,700
I'm going now.

114
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,866
I have a gig at the bar.

115
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,991
I'll have a vanilla with jelly.

116
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,934
And a chocolate sundae.

117
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,359
With lots of chocolate sprinkles.

118
00:07:46,384 --> 00:07:48,039
Okay, just a moment.

119
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:52,721
Are you ordering for me?

120
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:53,956
Mmm.

121
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,449
Only Nut eats that.

122
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:56,773
It's so sweet.

123
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:58,799
And how did you know I like this flavor?

124
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:01,847
Oh.

125
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:02,958
I remember.

126
00:08:07,982 --> 00:08:10,277
Vanilla with jelly.

127
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:12,906
Chocolate sundae.

128
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,144
- With lots of sprinkles.
- Thank you.

129
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,969
Nut.

130
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:35,114
I have something to tell you.

131
00:08:35,857 --> 00:08:36,924
What is it?

132
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,830
I think...

133
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,604
I like you, Nut.

134
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:17,957
I think...

135
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:20,232
I like Nut.

136
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:23,985
I want to confess my love.

137
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:26,454
Can you find the right moment for me?

138
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:33,629
Can you just let it run?

139
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:35,063
- Okay.
- Just one song.

140
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:41,647
Of course, Lin.

141
00:09:46,584 --> 00:09:48,560
If you want to confess your love to Nut,

142
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:51,200
it must be at the ice cream shop.

143
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,556
Nut really loves ice cream.

144
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:57,051
And before you confess your love to him,

145
00:09:57,478 --> 00:09:59,330
you have to order a chocolate sundae

146
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:00,890
with lots of chocolate sprinkles.

147
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:02,597
It's his favorite.

148
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:06,986
But don't let him eat more than 2 bowls.

149
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,713
He'll get a stomachache.

150
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:11,727
Thanks, Win.

151
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:41,965
"Let Nut spend more time with Lin."

152
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:15,371
Why are you back so late?

153
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:21,748
Well...

154
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:24,228
After practice, I went to play at the bar.

155
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,538
You went back to play at the bar again?

156
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:29,404
Didn’t you say you were going to take a break before the competition?

157
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:31,575
Well...

158
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,264
The more I play, the better I get.

159
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:35,852
And

160
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:38,380
playing at the bar has a big audience like a real stage.

161
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:40,395
So I won't be nervous.

162
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:43,422
That's good.

163
00:11:44,682 --> 00:11:45,643
So...

164
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,926
Are you still drinking?

165
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:50,940
I've already warmed up dinner for you.

166
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,253
I'm going to bed now.

167
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,315
Did I do the right thing?

168
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:57,075
Do you remember when we were kids?

169
00:13:57,099 --> 00:13:58,900
When we were punished together.

170
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,212
I remember.

171
00:14:00,359 --> 00:14:01,743
What did you do wrong back then?

172
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:13,056
What's wrong?

173
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:15,709
What's wrong with those two?

174
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:21,045
It's nothing.

175
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:22,378
Go and sit.

176
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:26,821
Alright everyone,

177
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:28,105
let's practice.

178
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,336
Hey.

179
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:50,889
Sorry.

180
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:52,501
Let's do it again.

181
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:54,464
Are you okay?

182
00:14:54,824 --> 00:14:55,944
You seem distracted.

183
00:14:57,425 --> 00:14:58,259
It's nothing.

184
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,911
I'm just thinking about things.

185
00:15:04,163 --> 00:15:05,418
It's almost the big day.

186
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,700
Focus, man.

187
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:12,363
Let's go again.

188
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:15,547
Let's go, Ek.

189
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:28,361
Chai.

190
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:31,111
What's wrong with you lately?

191
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:33,601
After practice, you don't talk to anyone

192
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:34,770
and just walk away.

193
00:15:35,523 --> 00:15:37,638
I'm going to play at the bar.

194
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:41,456
I thought you’d stop playing at the bar,

195
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,831
until after the competition.

196
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:46,437
I want to practice until I'm fluent.

197
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:48,386
And also,

198
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:51,315
I want to practice with an audience.

199
00:16:01,397 --> 00:16:02,763
Have you been getting any sleep?

200
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,025
Of course.

201
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,813
It's okay.

202
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,004
This is nothing.

203
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:13,554
I...

204
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,176
I'm going now.

205
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:16,731
Okay.

206
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:24,754
Are you okay today?

207
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:26,581
You seem unusually stressed.

208
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:30,171
No, I'm just...

209
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:31,575
Win.

210
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:35,483
I'm going now.

211
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,440
Hey Biu, where are you going?

212
00:16:41,695 --> 00:16:43,107
Are you not free these days?

213
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:45,802
I haven't eaten your stir-fried vegetables in a long time.

214
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:49,523
Lately, I've been...

215
00:16:49,547 --> 00:16:50,847
studying for exams a lot.

216
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,357
Didn't you already take your final exams?

217
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:08,011
I'm going now.

218
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:19,663
"Confess love to Nut"

219
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,154
How are you, Nut?

220
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,887
Was today's practice okay?

221
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:01,930
I'm okay.

222
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,276
Today, I thought Win seemed a little stressed.

223
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:07,269
Do you know what's wrong with him?

224
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:10,199
I don't know either.

225
00:18:11,663 --> 00:18:13,156
Maybe he's stressed about his exams.

226
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:18,439
I'm sleepy, Lin.

227
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:21,549
I'm going to bed now.

228
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:23,371
Okay.

229
00:18:37,743 --> 00:18:38,763
Hello.

230
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,000
Hello.

231
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,209

232
00:19:15,342 --> 00:19:16,448

Sorry.

238
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:26,454
Let's continue.

239
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,482
One more time.

240
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,666
♪ Still cool. ♪

241
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,444

00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:45,484
Can you guys please focus?

245
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:49,283
Nobody wants to make a mistake.

246
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,138
What the hell is wrong with you?

247
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:52,906
Ever since you came in.

248
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,241
Hey, hey, it's okay.

249
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,085
We can do it again.

250
00:19:58,326 --> 00:19:59,313
Ek, count in.

251
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,072

00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:05,850

Are you okay?

257
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:22,505
Okay.

258
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:27,347
One more time.

259
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:29,768
Why don't you scold him?

260
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:31,708
Huh?

261
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,113
What do you mean by that?

262
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:37,801
The reason I complained about you

263
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:40,008
is because it's not the first time.

264
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:42,101
Do you want me to say it?

265
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:45,255
I know you've been secretly playing at the bar

266
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:46,606
until you barely have time to sleep.

267
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:57,666
I don't know why you're doing this.

268
00:20:58,934 --> 00:21:00,750
But I just ask that you all

269
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:02,390
take the competition more seriously.

270
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:04,563
It's almost the final round.

271
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:07,098
If you really want to play at the bar,

272
00:21:07,477 --> 00:21:09,188
can you not get drunk every day?

273
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:15,578
What I do is my business.

274
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:20,154
You guys

275
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,293
don't understand a damn thing about me.

276
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,694
Never understood a damn thing about me.

277
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:08,833
Chai.

278
00:22:25,437 --> 00:22:26,643
Are you okay?

279
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,717
Since there's no bassist anyway,

280
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:36,615
I'm going home.

281
00:22:46,775 --> 00:22:48,982
Ek, golden bags, son.

282
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,041
This is your favorite.

283
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:52,036
Yes.
Eat up.

284
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:00,023
Dad, Mom.

285
00:23:00,983 --> 00:23:02,800
Can I ask for your advice?

286
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:04,800
Of course, son. What is it?

287
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:11,657
When we see someone feeling bad,

288
00:23:12,122 --> 00:23:13,957
and we feel bad too,

289
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:16,791
what is this feeling?

290
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,559
This thing,

291
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:23,785
it's just that we're tying our feelings

292
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:25,305
to someone else.

293
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,081
But I think,

294
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,292
we shouldn't do that.

295
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,065
Unless

296
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:32,266
when we see someone suffering

297
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,544
or they are sad,

298
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:36,212
we should try to make them happy.

299
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:37,966
Don't you think so, son? Dear?

300
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:39,111
Yes, dear.

301
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:40,411
Do you know why?

302
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:43,323
Because when we see someone happy,

303
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:45,770
we become happy too.

304
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:47,669
Do you understand?

305
00:23:48,726 --> 00:23:49,660
Yes.

306
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:55,255
It's like how I take care of you every day.

307
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,715
Because when I sees you happy,

308
00:23:57,955 --> 00:23:59,803
I'm even happier.

309
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:03,071
Here is your favorite snack.

310
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:04,984
Eat a lot, son.

311
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:06,852
Yes, and when you eat a lot, what happens?

312
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,952
Mom will be happy, right?

313
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:22,239
Win.

314
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:27,971
What are you doing here?

315
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:29,899
I'm here to see you.

316
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:36,461
You don't cook for me.

317
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,281
I can cook for you.

318
00:24:39,153 --> 00:24:40,560
And should we go for a run this evening?

319
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:43,889
Take it.

320
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,129
Deal?

321
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:51,295
It's getting late, I have to go.

322
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,543
See you this evening.

323
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,853
Study hard.

324
00:25:11,146 --> 00:25:12,753
Let's see, did you finish it all?

325
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:18,015
Oh.

326
00:25:19,704 --> 00:25:20,764
So much left.

327
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:22,610
Don't you like it?

328
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:26,324
Or did I not cook it well?

329
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:29,333
Uh...

330
00:25:29,913 --> 00:25:30,785
So...

331
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:38,874
Ew...

332
00:25:41,035 --> 00:25:42,530
So tough.

333
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:43,710
It really isn't good.

334
00:25:54,855 --> 00:25:56,189
Then how about this?

335
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:58,154
What's your favorite dish?

336
00:25:58,178 --> 00:25:59,405
I'll go practice making it for you.

337
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,805
What's wrong with you lately?

338
00:26:04,224 --> 00:26:06,345
Suddenly you're being unusually nice to me.

339
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:10,967
And you?

340
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:14,233
A while ago you were being unusually nice to me too.

341
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,091
I wasn't being unusually nice at all.

342
00:26:19,116 --> 00:26:20,345
I was being normal.

343
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,767
Then I'm being normal too.

344
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,221
Then I'm going for a run now.

345
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:28,685
When I'm done, I'm not waiting.

346
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:32,967
Hey, wait for me.

347
00:26:34,363 --> 00:26:35,236
Nut.

348
00:27:01,189 --> 00:27:02,316
Chai.

349
00:27:18,606 --> 00:27:20,092
The reason I play at the bar

350
00:27:20,699 --> 00:27:21,872
is because...

351
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:24,298
I'm saving up to buy my mom's necklace back.

352
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,282
Necklace?

353
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:29,757
Mmm.

354
00:27:30,237 --> 00:27:32,109
My mom's necklace has been missing since...

355
00:27:33,435 --> 00:27:35,407
when she bailed me out of jail.

356
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:38,358
But I'm almost done saving up now.

357
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:40,213
How much more do you need?

358
00:27:40,824 --> 00:27:41,877
Can I help?

359
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:43,439
What?

360
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,496
Why should I let you help?

361
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,222
Are you saying I can't earn my own money?

362
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:49,606
Huh?

363
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,739
That's not what I meant.

364
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:53,641
I just...

365
00:27:54,814 --> 00:27:56,727
I don't want you to go through that again.

366
00:27:57,587 --> 00:27:58,693
Please.

367
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:00,308
Let me help.

368
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,094
No way!

369
00:28:03,486 --> 00:28:04,426
How about this?

370
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:06,468
I'll buy mine.

371
00:28:06,493 --> 00:28:08,389
If you want to buy one, you can buy yours.

372
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,870
Okay?

373
00:28:11,018 --> 00:28:12,139
But...

374
00:28:12,164 --> 00:28:13,666
No more buts.

375
00:28:14,247 --> 00:28:15,579
Let's go buy it together tomorrow.

376
00:28:17,032 --> 00:28:19,172
After we buy it, I'll take you for mookrata.

377
00:28:19,737 --> 00:28:20,575
Deal?

378
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,828
Deal.

379
00:28:32,372 --> 00:28:33,599
Wow.

380
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,310
So many pictures of me.

381
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:40,371
Hey.

382
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:42,945
This is the picture I couldn't find.

383
00:28:43,078 --> 00:28:44,667
I thought you gave me all of them.

384
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:47,233
Well, this is a surprise.

385
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:50,805
Then can I have it?

386
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,700
Hey, hold on.

387
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:54,717
I'll give it to you after the exhibition.

388
00:28:55,455 --> 00:28:57,614
Okay, don't forget.

389
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:04,132
Then take this picture as a deposit.

390
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,587
Hey, that's cute.

391
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,061
Why didn't you put it on display?

392
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:11,385
No way.

393
00:29:11,596 --> 00:29:12,854
I...

394
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:14,976
don't really like showing my face.

395
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,536
Why?

396
00:29:21,835 --> 00:29:23,424
I think you're so cute, Biu.

397
00:29:27,054 --> 00:29:28,521
Hey, Lin.

398
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:31,797
I think...

399
00:29:34,736 --> 00:29:36,009
I like you, Lin.

400
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,272
I'm sorry, Biu.

401
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,722
I'm sorry for making you think that.

402
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:04,695
But I'm already dating Nut.

403
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:27,476
Panting like this, are you okay?

404
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:32,037
I'm fine.

405
00:30:33,326 --> 00:30:35,916
I'm so fit I could compete again.

406
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,784
Look at this.

407
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:08,310
See, acting tough.

408
00:31:18,845 --> 00:31:20,438
Actually, I just wanted to know

409
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:24,675
if you would come and help me up.

410
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:27,442
That's all.

411
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:50,454
Is Chai on time today?

412
00:31:57,007 --> 00:31:58,549
Ek, let's go.

413
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:05,622
♪ You know I can't be alone. ♪

414
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:08,084
♪ I just talk big like that. ♪

415
00:32:08,109 --> 00:32:10,439
♪ When you're not here... ♪

416
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,110
What are you looking at?

417
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:20,548
Do I have to be late every day?

418
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,975
But I didn't see your motorcycle.

419
00:32:24,874 --> 00:32:26,876
I picked up Chai myself today.

420
00:32:28,998 --> 00:32:29,885
Why?

421
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:33,067
I just didn't want Chai to be late.

422
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:35,614
Yeah, that's it.

423
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,466
I don't want to be a burden to you.

424
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:43,140
Hey, why are you two here together today?

425
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:44,460
Win.

426
00:32:45,524 --> 00:32:47,785
You already knew that Lin and Nut are dating?

427
00:32:48,939 --> 00:32:50,445
Why didn't you tell me?

428
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:53,917
Biu, calm down.

429
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,212
How could you let me be a fool like this?

430
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,972
Biu, wait, Biu.

431
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:05,671
Hey.

432
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,506
Just now,

433
00:33:09,574 --> 00:33:10,608
who's dating?

434
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:11,874
Who's dating who?

435
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:13,817
That was so fast.

436
00:33:15,653 --> 00:33:16,646
Biu.

437
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:18,895
Biu.

438
00:33:23,988 --> 00:33:24,855
Biu.

439
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:32,564
Win.

440
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,123
Nut.

441
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:39,625
Nut.

442
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:41,858
Nut.

443
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:49,357
Nut is resting now.

444
00:33:49,698 --> 00:33:51,366
He probably didn't get enough rest.

445
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,893
There's nothing to worry about.

446
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:56,025
I think...

447
00:33:56,874 --> 00:33:58,609
I think you should take Nut to the doctor.

448
00:34:02,237 --> 00:34:04,509
If Nut doesn't feel better after sleeping,

449
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,383
I'll take him to the doctor myself.

450
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:20,639
Oh.

451
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:23,320
What are you guys doing here?

452
00:34:23,705 --> 00:34:24,519
Nut.

453
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:25,828
How are you?

454
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:27,634
I'm great.

455
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,205
But I'm going to take a rest first.

456
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:33,774
I'll have to practice in my room for now.

457
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,129
Anyway,

458
00:34:38,455 --> 00:34:40,275
I'll leave you guys to practice without me for now.

459
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:51,182
Hey.

460
00:34:51,207 --> 00:34:52,976
See you at the rehearsal room.

461
00:34:55,246 --> 00:34:56,539
See you, everyone.

462
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,053
Why are you greeting me?

463
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:02,773
You're coming with me.

464
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:04,526
Okay.

465
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:17,084
See you.

466
00:35:45,573 --> 00:35:46,613
Win.

467
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,218
Actually, you like Nut too, right?

468
00:35:58,432 --> 00:36:00,025
Whether I like him or not,

469
00:36:00,813 --> 00:36:02,053
it doesn't matter, Lin.

470
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:05,754
Anyway, you're dating Nut now.

471
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:08,342
And your family wants you to get engaged.

472
00:36:10,286 --> 00:36:11,614
How did you know?

473
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:12,994
Did Nut tell you?

474
00:36:15,315 --> 00:36:16,355
So...

475
00:36:17,295 --> 00:36:18,708
I just guessed.

476
00:36:22,489 --> 00:36:25,797
I think I left something at home.

477
00:36:26,704 --> 00:36:28,093
You can go to the rehearsal room first.

478
00:36:28,118 --> 00:36:29,159
I'll follow you.

479
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:50,110
It's worth all the sleepless nights.

480
00:36:54,562 --> 00:36:56,613
You know, the auntie at the gold shop

481
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:58,299
was stunned when I went to buy it.

482
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:00,166
Confused.

483
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,905
She didn't think I could save up to buy it.

484
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:06,275
So what should I buy for your mom?

485
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:08,196
Anything.

486
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:11,193
Just one thing, don't buy my mom alcohol.

487
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:12,280
Please,

488
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:13,585
I'm begging you.

489
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:15,662
Win is the main culprit.

490
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,537
Or maybe a hat?

491
00:37:20,879 --> 00:37:21,832
A hat?

492
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:24,862
That's a good idea.

493
00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:27,948
Hey, Chai.

494
00:37:29,816 --> 00:37:32,055
Thoed's gang is ganging up on our guys over there.

495
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:33,550
Go help them, please.

496
00:37:34,244 --> 00:37:35,723
I'll go get some help for a moment.

497
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:48,203
Wait here, Ek.

498
00:38:07,824 --> 00:38:08,964
Damn it.

499
00:38:35,266 --> 00:38:36,406
Chai.

500
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,160
Ek.

501
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,163
Ek.

502
00:39:11,431 --> 00:39:12,351
Ek.

503
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:55,312
Hey, what are you doing to my bro?

504
00:40:28,686 --> 00:40:30,984
Hurry up, Ek is at the hospital.

505
00:40:31,622 --> 00:40:32,688
Slowly.

506
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,469
Honey, slow down, or you'll fall.

507
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:38,564
Ek.

508
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:40,655
Ton, get the car for the hospital, quickly.

509
00:40:56,266 --> 00:40:57,040
Hello, ma'am.

510
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:58,706
Ek is at the hospital now.

511
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,290
Dad and I are going now.

512
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:01,825
Ton, hurry up.

513
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:21,430
Excuse me, this is an emergency case.

514
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:22,183
Hurry up.

515
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:23,187
Excuse me.

516
00:41:23,554 --> 00:41:24,547
Move aside, please.

517
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:06,524
Chai, you jerk!

518
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,963
Didn't you say you wouldn't get into trouble again?

519
00:42:08,988 --> 00:42:10,660
Why did you do this again, huh?

520
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:12,851
You're always in trouble, aren't you?

521
00:42:13,222 --> 00:42:14,444
Huh, you jerk!

522
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:15,638
I told you, didn't I?

523
00:42:15,857 --> 00:42:17,498
Why do you like to cause trouble for others?

524
00:42:17,597 --> 00:42:19,807
What's it like? Can't you eat properly?

525
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,360
I'm talking to you.

526
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,594
Look at me.

527
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:30,875
Who are you looking at, huh?

528
00:42:31,147 --> 00:42:33,081
You're nothing but trouble.

529
00:43:13,486 --> 00:43:14,486
Where are you going?

530
00:43:16,995 --> 00:43:17,948
To...
Hey.

531
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:21,522
You see that I'm not saying anything,

532
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:23,948
don't think I'm allowing you

533
00:43:23,972 --> 00:43:25,604
to do that stupid band thing.

534
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:27,543
Dad.

535
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:30,182
But it's almost over.

536
00:43:30,782 --> 00:43:32,315
I don't want to argue with you.

537
00:43:33,608 --> 00:43:34,601
Go and rest.

538
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:36,825
Rest?

539
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:37,909
Yes.

540
00:43:38,424 --> 00:43:39,584
Go and rest first.

541
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:41,834
You're not feeling well, are you?

542
00:43:45,395 --> 00:43:47,692
I don't want the tutor to come all this way

543
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:49,612
and have to teach you in a sick state.

544
00:43:50,953 --> 00:43:51,980
Tutor?

545
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,544
What tutor, Dad?

546
00:43:56,346 --> 00:43:57,805
You're going to study in England.

547
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,129
Your language skills aren't strong enough.

548
00:44:00,495 --> 00:44:01,596
I'm going to have a tutor come

549
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,935
and teach you every evening

550
00:44:03,295 --> 00:44:04,608
from now on.

551
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:09,107
Dad.

552
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:13,079
Stop it already, with that stupid music practice.

553
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:15,155
In this condition,

554
00:44:16,077 --> 00:44:17,530
save your energy for studying.

555
00:44:22,362 --> 00:44:23,469
No, Dad.

556
00:44:25,324 --> 00:44:27,385
Do you want me to smash another one of your guitars?

557
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:45,571
If this is the case,

558
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:47,132
I don't think it's convenient for you

559
00:44:47,156 --> 00:44:49,047
to use the rehearsal room here anymore.

560
00:44:55,814 --> 00:44:56,821
Ek.

561
00:44:57,334 --> 00:44:58,414
Go inside.

562
00:45:09,301 --> 00:45:10,501
Hey.

563
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,236
I...

564
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:16,739
I'm sorry.

565
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:22,049
It's okay.

566
00:45:23,984 --> 00:45:26,719
You're still hurt, I don't know if you can practice.

567
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,940
And Nut...

568
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:31,306
I don't know if he's feeling any better.

569
00:45:57,534 --> 00:45:58,760
(Next Episode)
What are you going to do?

570
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:01,107
Do you want to sleep in my room?

571
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:04,966
Can you talk to me first?

572
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:06,490
From today onwards,

573
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,955
I'm not talking to you anymore.

574
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,290
I'm not feeling well today.

575
00:46:11,758 --> 00:46:13,698
The competition is the day after tomorrow.

576
00:46:13,964 --> 00:46:16,104
We have a big rehearsal tomorrow.

577
00:46:16,583 --> 00:46:17,621
Do you think

578
00:46:17,646 --> 00:46:18,976
Nut will be able to make it?

579
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,240
You have to stay here.

580
00:46:21,264 --> 00:46:22,680
I'll have the doctor prepare your surgery

581
00:46:22,705 --> 00:46:23,782
as soon as possible.
