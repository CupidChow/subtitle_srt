00:00:00,143 --> 00:00:01,817
(Previously)
I'll have Lin help out with the band for a while.

2
00:00:01,842 --> 00:00:03,569
That way you can focus on your work.

3
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:05,004
I used to be very shy.

4
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:06,421
So I had to wear a hat all the time.

5
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,966
I have one at home.

6
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:10,266
With you, it might become something important.

7
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,585
Nut.

8
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,372
Let's go eat at our usual chicken stir-fry place.

9
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:15,924
You like him, why don't you flirt with him?

10
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,677
What if he doesn't like me back?

11
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:20,091
See, you admit it. You like him.

12
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,353
Hey, Win.

13
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:23,303
You're really serious.

14
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:24,631
Thank heaven,

15
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:26,211
or whatever,

16
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:27,611
for letting me go back in time

17
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:29,388

"Rearrange" (Episode 5)

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,200
(Men Detention Room)

37
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:16,968
Hey, young man.

38
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,214
You can go home now. Someone has bailed you out.

39
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:24,367
This way, ma'am.

40
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:34,250
Ma'am, please sign the document here.

41
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:35,281
Okay.

42
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,190
Thank you.

43
00:02:58,623 --> 00:02:59,623
Mom.

44
00:03:01,518 --> 00:03:02,285
I...

45
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,451
Let's go home.

46
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,501
It must be my karma.

47
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,854
To have to raise someone like you.

48
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:04,661
Mom.

49
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,263
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,145
You don't have to say anything.

51
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:20,445
Just be good, that's enough.

52
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:39,394
Hey, I'd say this concert

53
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:41,095
is the best concert of the year.

54
00:04:41,316 --> 00:04:41,916
True.

55
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:44,028
But they haven't released the song "Stop It Now".

56
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,795
Otherwise, we would have heard it live today.

57
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,542
Oh, I want to hear it.

58
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,081
But I've heard it already.

59
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,822
Oh, you've already heard it?

60
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:52,882
Lin recorded it for me.

61
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,642
I want to hear it too.

62
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:56,858
You'll have to wait. They'll release it soon.

63
00:04:58,526 --> 00:04:59,608
Just wait.

64
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,169
Do you...

65
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:06,996
have any plans to travel out of town soon?

66
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,910
If it's around this time, I think...

67
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,055
You shouldn't go yet.

68
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:21,436
Hey.

69
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:23,721
Is something wrong, Win?

70
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:26,529
What?

71
00:05:49,461 --> 00:05:50,546
Dad.

72
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:54,008
Do you think...

73
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:56,376
that the future is really a result

74
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,487
of what we do in the present?

75
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:00,303
Or

76
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,848
is the future already determined?

77
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,447
That's a strange question.

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,836
Did you get your fortune told?

79
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:09,017
No.

80
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:11,210
I just want to know.

81
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,180
For me, I think...

82
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,323
Life...

83
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:24,896
might be like a song

84
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:27,767
that's already been written from beginning to end.

85
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,548
What if we don't like the original song?

86
00:06:35,198 --> 00:06:36,238
Well,

87
00:06:37,683 --> 00:06:39,808
if you don't like the song that's written,

88
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:44,085
you have to rearrange it.

89
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,726
"Rearrange"?

90
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:15,562
Win.

91
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,499
Win.

92
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:19,842
Oh, Nut.

93
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:20,949
Hello, sir.

94
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:21,969
Hello.

95
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:23,251
What are you doing here?

96
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:24,841
Is Win here?

97
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:26,485
He's not here.

98
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,624
Do you know where Win went?

99
00:08:28,648 --> 00:08:30,364
He went out this morning.

100
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:33,164
Then I'll be going now.

101
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:34,424
Okay.

102
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,649
Take care.

103
00:08:49,584 --> 00:08:50,587
Ek.

104
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,182
Is this Chai?

105
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:54,310
Let me see.

106
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:56,472
Yeah.

107
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:58,242
Yes, it's really Chai.

108
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:01,889
I never thought

109
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:04,028
that Chai would be a gangster like this.

110
00:09:04,643 --> 00:09:05,939
From now on, Ek,

111
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,112
don't get involved with him anymore.

112
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:09,610
I'm worried.

113
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,025
But Mom.
Ek.

114
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,625
No more "buts," son.

115
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,455
Look at this.

116
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:16,843
This matter

117
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:19,752
concerns your safety.

118
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:23,498
Even the newspaper reported it.

119
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,630
I'm strictly forbidding it.

120
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:29,266
From now on,

121
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,398
I will not allow you

122
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:32,051
to go with Chai anymore.

123
00:09:34,588 --> 00:09:35,601
Yes, Dad.

124
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:39,645
It's so scary.

125
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:41,404
How could this happen?

126
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:42,584
He seemed so well-behaved

127
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,202
when he came to our house.

128
00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:16,063
This time, I couldn't help you again.

129
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,306
So did it get better or worse?

130
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,698
This time, you and I

131
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:35,028
won't be able to buy tapes together again.

132
00:10:43,301 --> 00:10:44,914
You're a rocker, right?

133
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,193
A rocker doesn't lose to something like this, bro.

134
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:54,287
You have to recover.

135
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:57,644
You have to do it.

136
00:11:12,286 --> 00:11:13,893

00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,893
The song hasn't been released yet.

147
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,207
You must be wondering

148
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,822
how I knew this song beforehand.

149
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,264
If you want to know,

150
00:12:09,582 --> 00:12:11,182
you have to recover quickly.

151
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:14,981
And then I'll tell you myself.

152
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:34,974
I'm going now, bro.

153
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:39,905
See you.

154
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,829
Explain it to me.

155
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:07,517
You know you can't lie to me.

156
00:13:13,848 --> 00:13:14,723
Well...

157
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:17,281
I just heard it from a recording they made.

158
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,573
Then tell me where.

159
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,928
On Jeeab's show, "See San Tonight".

160
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,132
He definitely didn't sing this much of it.

161
00:13:24,156 --> 00:13:25,218
Tell me.

162
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:26,596
What are you hiding from me?

163
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,661
I've told you before, right?

164
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,589
That I time-traveled from the future.

165
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:47,522
Then why did you come from the future?

166
00:13:47,642 --> 00:13:49,585
Or were you turned into a robot

167
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,740
and sent on a Time Machine

168
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:52,065
to come back and do some mission?

169
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:54,459
You should go with Nut.

170
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:55,630
You movie lovers.

171
00:13:55,655 --> 00:13:58,162
You just don't get Sci-Fi movies.

172
00:13:58,186 --> 00:13:59,401
So cool.

173
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:03,255
Seriously.

174
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,556
I don't know either

175
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:07,384
how I got back here.

176
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:09,731
It's weird.

177
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:11,156
But you must know

178
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,670
what's going to happen, right?

179
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:15,076
Like, will my mom win the lottery tomorrow?

180
00:14:17,213 --> 00:14:19,060
Whether your mom wins the lottery?

181
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,167
That's not in my memory at all.

182
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:24,565
Then just tell me the numbers

183
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:25,510
so I can win.

184
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:29,818
I wasn't prepared to time travel back.

185
00:14:30,018 --> 00:14:32,208
If I knew I was going to time travel back,

186
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:34,199
I would have written down many draws.

187
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,980
Hey, but I can tell you one thing.

188
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:39,773
You have to buy Bitcoin.

189
00:14:40,135 --> 00:14:42,423
What is Bitcoin?

190
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:43,818
Come on,

191
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,684
when the time comes, just buy it like I do.

192
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,658
Oh, in the future,

193
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:50,463
do you and Nut end up together?

194
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,448
I can only tell you that

195
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,632
in the future,

196
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:01,760
people of the same sex

197
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:03,897
can holding hands in malls normally.

198
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,181
And get married legally too.

199
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,293
Shit, really?

200
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:09,819
Are you kidding?

201
00:15:10,353 --> 00:15:11,663
Why would I lie?

202
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:13,365
Hey, and also,

203
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,711
soon, in the future,

204
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:17,409
people will be watching Y series

205
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,226
and Yuri series all over the country.

206
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,104
Y series, Yuri series.

207
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:23,668
What are those?

208
00:15:25,346 --> 00:15:27,789
They're dramas

209
00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,620
where the mail character are of the same gender

210
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:31,091
and they like each other.

211
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:32,940
Shit.

212
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,499
You're definitely lying.

213
00:15:34,587 --> 00:15:36,436
The neighbors

214
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,295
or even motorcycle taxi drivers

215
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:40,582
will watching gay dramas all over the country?

216
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:41,888
I don't believe it.

217
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:43,773
You'll just have to wait and see.

218
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:46,866
Really?

219
00:15:47,273 --> 00:15:48,769
Oh, and in the future,

220
00:15:48,793 --> 00:15:49,856
do I get any taller?

221
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,853
What do you think?

222
00:15:52,032 --> 00:15:53,119
Maybe a little.

223
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:13,597
Why are you back so late today?

224
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,872
I was helping Paew deliver rice.

225
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:24,282
Are you working harder because of me?

226
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:28,449
I warmed up the food for you.

227
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,797
Why didn't you just eat and get it over with?

228
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:33,772
I was waiting to eat with you.

229
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,498
Here, Mom,

230
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:38,721
let's eat.

231
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:42,096
There's a fragrant omelet and hot curry.

232
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,351
Looks delicious.

233
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,729
What's the occasion?

234
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:49,432
Such good service.

235
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:50,628
Hey.

236
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,402
You told me to be good.

237
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:54,870
Mmm, just be good.

238
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:56,338
Don't cause me trouble.

239
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:57,456
Not act weird.

240
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,231
Mom.

241
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:01,353
This time, I really feel guilty.

242
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:03,896
Please forgive me, Mom.

243
00:17:04,578 --> 00:17:06,669
Okay, just don't do it again.

244
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,705
I promise.

245
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:10,541
You forgive me, right?

246
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:12,674
Right? Right?

247
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,735
Geez, you're so persistent.

248
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:15,972
Let's just eat.

249
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,251
I'll feed you.

250
00:17:17,276 --> 00:17:18,856
Here, this omelet.

251
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,636
It's almost not hot anymore.

252
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:23,882
Is this even edible?

253
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:26,501
Why wouldn't it be? It's delicious.

254
00:17:29,318 --> 00:17:30,166
Is it delicious?

255
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:31,952
It's as delicious like I cook.

256
00:17:32,128 --> 00:17:33,187
You are the one who cooked this.

257
00:17:33,212 --> 00:17:34,592
Here, eat up.

258
00:17:50,588 --> 00:17:51,747
Hello.

259
00:17:57,258 --> 00:17:58,767
I'm Phop's brother.

260
00:17:59,277 --> 00:18:00,764
For now,

261
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,492
I'll be taking care of the Phop's shop instead.

262
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:03,523
Anyway,

263
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,225
make yourselves at home.

264
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:16,898
We miss Phop.

265
00:18:24,022 --> 00:18:25,330
Guys.

266
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,848
I have good news.

267
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:30,771
The event organizers called to say...

268
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,329
that we've passed the first round!

269
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,420
Hey!

270
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:36,607
Really?

271
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:37,861
Shit.

272
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:40,837
I'm going to play on a big stage!

273
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:43,876
Everyone.

274
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:47,155
I'm quitting the band.

275
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,007
It's because of me, isn't it?

276
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,548
It's because of me, right?

277
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:17,642
I knew it.

278
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,116
That it was because of me.

279
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:27,485
Damn it.

280
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,153
Can I talk to your parents?

281
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:00,860
Sir, ma'am.

282
00:21:01,472 --> 00:21:02,932
May I have a word with you?

283
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:04,914
What is it?

284
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:08,844
I'm truly sorry that

285
00:21:10,408 --> 00:21:12,208
I've made you worry.

286
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,148
But can you please give us one more chance?

287
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,253
If not for our sake, then

288
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,431
consider it for Ek's sake.

289
00:21:33,487 --> 00:21:34,558
I think

290
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:36,613
you would understand best

291
00:21:37,521 --> 00:21:38,895
how hard Ek has tried.

292
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,558
Practicing until his hands hurt,

293
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:44,725
and overcoming his fear

294
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:46,819
to be able to play in front of people.

295
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:49,525
You would understand best

296
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,043
how hard Ek has tried.

297
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,435
Please give us one more chance.

298
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:06,915
And how can we be sure

299
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:08,453
that Ek will be safe?

300
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:21,511
I'm...

301
00:22:22,269 --> 00:22:24,603
resigning as the leader of the Red Hawk gang.

302
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:30,674
As for you,

303
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:31,974
Man.

304
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:34,366
I trust you the most.

305
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,733
You

306
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:39,677
have to be the leader

307
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:41,546
in my place.

308
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:43,966
Then where are you going?

309
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:50,933
I'm going to follow my dream.

310
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:01,584
What are we going to do about Ek?

311
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:06,116
We can't practice without a drummer.

312
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:09,024
What should we do, Win?

313
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:11,669
Calm down.

314
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:13,560
I'm trying to figure out a way.

315
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:15,801
And why do you have to think?

316
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:16,932
Because you're from the fut...

317
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,516
What's wrong with you guys?

318
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,466
Biu just likes to talk nonsense.

319
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,677
How many things do you know?

320
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:33,741
Ek.

321
00:23:34,106 --> 00:23:35,654
My parents gave their permission.

322
00:23:36,701 --> 00:23:37,747
Really?

323
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:44,658
Then let's start practicing.

324
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:46,148
Let's do it?

325
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:46,855
Go.
Let's go.

326
00:23:49,454 --> 00:23:50,808
Where's my guitar?

327
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:00,916
Everyone.

328
00:24:04,387 --> 00:24:05,481
Phop...

329
00:24:08,672 --> 00:24:09,832
is gone.

330
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:39,357
I tried everything, Biu.

331
00:24:43,322 --> 00:24:45,035
But in the end, it's still the same.

332
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:52,275
Would you two like to eat something?

333
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,353
The rice soup is delicious.

334
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,487
I can't really eat anything right now.

335
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:10,144
I think...

336
00:25:10,733 --> 00:25:13,518
Phop has probably started a rock band in heaven.

337
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:15,834
And playing some awesome songs.

338
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:16,998
Yeah, true.

339
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:18,800
Don't let Phop scream.

340
00:25:18,824 --> 00:25:20,312
Heaven would be in chaos.

341
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:26,698
I think...

342
00:25:27,643 --> 00:25:29,202
soon Phop will probably

343
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:30,781
be thrown down from heaven.

344
00:25:36,227 --> 00:25:37,904
Phop would probably be happy

345
00:25:38,422 --> 00:25:40,634
to look down and still see you smiling, Win.

346
00:25:45,266 --> 00:25:46,433
Thanks, Lin.

347
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:51,372
And don't worry.

348
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,659
Phop's shop will stay the same.

349
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:54,777
I promise.

350
00:25:58,482 --> 00:25:59,769
That's it.

351
00:25:59,795 --> 00:26:00,660
Good.
Send it over.

352
00:26:01,656 --> 00:26:02,792
That's it.

353
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:04,150
Slowly.

354
00:26:05,324 --> 00:26:06,691
Great.

355
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,752
You promised the shop would stay the same.

356
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:12,680
Oh.

357
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:13,947
Yes.

358
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,090
The shop is still here.

359
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:17,022
But it's going to be a restaurant instead.

360
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:18,612
Anyway, please come and support us.

361
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,525
Bro, continue here.

362
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:22,306
What should we do?

363
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:50,295
Chai.

364
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,228
Huh?

365
00:26:51,252 --> 00:26:53,135
Please put on the slippers.

366
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,978
Oh.

367
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:56,510
Sorry.

368
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:09,541
So big.

369
00:27:24,755 --> 00:27:25,587
Hello.

370
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:26,738
Hello.

371
00:27:28,817 --> 00:27:31,010
Practice hard, kids.

372
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:33,059
Mom and I will be cheering for you.

373
00:27:33,505 --> 00:27:34,957
And if you need anything,

374
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:36,671
just let us know.

375
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:38,997
Thank you.

376
00:27:42,616 --> 00:27:44,401
Here, have some water first.

377
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:45,801
Make yourselves comfortable.

378
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:52,919
Great, this place is very close to my house.

379
00:27:52,943 --> 00:27:54,751
I can come watch the practice every day.

380
00:27:57,146 --> 00:27:59,117
But you came to the old place almost every day.

381
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:00,768
You're very diligent.

382
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:01,932
It's okay.

383
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:03,820
I can get the travel expenses from my dad.

384
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:06,217
Let me tell you, this is my turf.

385
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:07,809
I'll take you to eat something delicious.

386
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:08,961
Should we go today, Nut?

387
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:13,520
Today?

388
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,267
Um...

389
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:19,851
I can't go today.

390
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:21,746
Oh, really?

391
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:23,712
What a shame.

392
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:40,478
Hey, Lin.

393
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:43,267
I just got a new camera.

394
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:44,439
I want to try it out.

395
00:28:44,463 --> 00:28:46,041
Can you be my model for some photos?

396
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:47,238
Sure.

397
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:48,404
Where?

398
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:02,926
Hey, Nut.

399
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,740
Can I ask you something?

400
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:07,763
The reason you didn't go eat with Lin,

401
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,061
where are you going?

402
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:12,841
I have to eat with my family today.

403
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,668
Okay, I'm ready.

404
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:30,186
Where should I stand?

405
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:38,368
Then, Lin, you can stand here.

406
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:43,575
Here, right?

407
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:49,429
1, 2, 3.

408
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,695
1, 2, 3.

409
00:29:57,494 --> 00:29:59,135
Let me take a picture of you.

410
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:02,140
How do I do it? Teach me.

411
00:30:02,532 --> 00:30:04,771
So when you shoot,

412
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,537
you look here.

413
00:30:06,562 --> 00:30:07,598
And before you shoot,

414
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:09,138
pull this all the way.

415
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:10,289
And then press this button.

416
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:11,502
But you have to wait for it to focus first.

417
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:12,553
Then press down.

418
00:30:13,074 --> 00:30:14,547
Got it.

419
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:22,639
Strike a pose.

420
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:24,264
This isn't for an ID card.

421
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:30,443
What was that?
What?

422
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:34,457
Hey, taking a candid shot like that

423
00:30:34,481 --> 00:30:35,671
makes my face look dumb.

424
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:37,056
- Very dumb.
- No, no.

425
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,725
Let me take a vertical shot.

426
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:43,477
Cute.

427
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:45,483
I'll save this film to take pictures of you.

428
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:46,871
My face looks funny.

429
00:30:46,895 --> 00:30:48,036
Not funny.

430
00:30:49,093 --> 00:30:51,513
Go stand over there like before.

431
00:30:54,127 --> 00:30:55,536
Take a good one.

432
00:30:58,044 --> 00:31:00,411
1, 2, 3.

433
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:35,553
Dad.
Huh?

434
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:38,172
I've finished washing the dishes.

435
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,738
Okay.

436
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,451
The ideas are starting to flow.

437
00:31:43,275 --> 00:31:44,257
Um...

438
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:45,601
I have something to ask you.

439
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:47,483
Is something wrong lately?

440
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:49,556
You seem

441
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:51,193
not quite yourself.

442
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:54,404
Well...

443
00:31:55,037 --> 00:31:56,890
I guess I feel guilty.

444
00:31:57,676 --> 00:31:58,956
I just feel that

445
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:01,229
I haven't really done much for yo.

446
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,201
And

447
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:05,200
I spend my time on useless things

448
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:08,432
instead of spending more time with you.

449
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,453
You talk like an old man.

450
00:32:12,478 --> 00:32:13,885
You want to do something for me, right?

451
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:15,899
The piano.

452
00:32:15,923 --> 00:32:17,126
Play it for me.

453
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,526
How does the melody go, Dad?

454
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:30,195
That chord from before.

455
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:32,845
Start here.

456
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,020
Start with D flat.

457
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:36,323
D flat.

458
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,041
Then go to F sharp.

459
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,763
Um... here.

460
00:32:42,658 --> 00:32:44,626
And try, if you want to add some bass.

461
00:32:44,650 --> 00:32:46,171
It'll add more depth, Okay?

462
00:32:46,204 --> 00:32:47,344
- Okay.
- Alright, try it.

463
00:32:55,914 --> 00:32:57,161
Can I play too?

464
00:32:57,989 --> 00:32:59,074
Come on.

465
00:32:59,098 --> 00:33:00,328
Bring the guitar, son.

466
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:01,413
Come on.

467
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:06,186
The chord will be

468
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,192
D flat and then F sharp, Tim.

469
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:11,172
Ready, 3, 4.

470
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:19,534
Win, Win.

471
00:33:19,951 --> 00:33:21,138
I think...

472
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,590
add an E flat minor

473
00:33:23,614 --> 00:33:24,843
before the F sharp?

474
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:27,411
I think we can try it.

475
00:33:27,435 --> 00:33:29,262
Try playing it for me.

476
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:30,868
3, 4.

477
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:40,163
Do you like it, Dad?
It's good, I like it.

478
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:43,328
Then I'll add it for you.

479
00:33:43,352 --> 00:33:44,662
It has more depth.

480
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:47,248
E flat minor as a passing chord.

481
00:33:47,676 --> 00:33:49,276
OK, come on, one more time.

482
00:34:08,852 --> 00:34:09,732
Nut.

483
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:12,132
Come home a little earlier tomorrow.

484
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:15,058
Why?

485
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,001
Just hurry back, that's all.

486
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:56,822
Mom.

487
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:59,546
Can you check if the shirt is ironed yet?

488
00:35:01,775 --> 00:35:04,515
If it were any smoother, it would be a marble tile.

489
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:07,026
That's enough. It's wasting electricity.

490
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:09,740
Marble tile?

491
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:15,828
Just a little more ironing, Mom.

492
00:35:23,627 --> 00:35:26,307
No more. It's wasting electricity.

493
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:29,998
Not even a little bit more?

494
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,323
All done.

495
00:35:40,145 --> 00:35:41,418
Thanks you.

496
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:46,346
Is this Nut's?

497
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,323
Yeah.

498
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:50,589
He returned it.

499
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,912
Shit.

500
00:35:52,936 --> 00:35:53,907
You bring each other food

501
00:35:53,931 --> 00:35:55,639
and drinks almost every day.

502
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:57,382
What's going on between you two?

503
00:35:58,608 --> 00:36:00,560
We're friends.

504
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,757
Hey.

505
00:36:02,089 --> 00:36:03,343
What the heck?

506
00:36:03,702 --> 00:36:05,982
Why did you give way to Lin so easily?

507
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:07,704
I think you and him

508
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:09,308
still have more hope than me.

509
00:36:13,273 --> 00:36:14,888
Thank you so much, Biu.

510
00:36:14,912 --> 00:36:16,368
For trying to help me.

511
00:36:17,867 --> 00:36:19,525
But you don't have to.

512
00:36:19,716 --> 00:36:21,605
Hey, why are you talking like that?

513
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:24,450
Well,

514
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:26,493
honestly,

515
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,206
I just feel that

516
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,224
I don't want to steal their time anymore.

517
00:36:31,643 --> 00:36:33,129
What do you mean?

518
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,476
What's going to happen?

519
00:36:37,368 --> 00:36:39,059
Let's just say when the time comes,

520
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:40,612
I'll tell you.

521
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:41,649
OK?

522
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:43,624
Can't you tell me now?

523
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:44,806
You can go now.

524
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:48,045
Bro, get the money from Biu.

525
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,829
Hey, Win!

526
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,735
100 baht.

527
00:36:58,322 --> 00:36:59,579
Wow.

528
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:01,345
Beautiful than I thought.

529
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:03,711
You're underestimating me.

530
00:37:04,017 --> 00:37:05,285
No.

531
00:37:05,631 --> 00:37:07,111
But they're really beautiful.

532
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:09,268
Like pictures in a magazine.

533
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:12,429
It's because the lighting helped.

534
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,282
And also...

535
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:17,659
the model was good.

536
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:22,859
Look at this.

537
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,359
Hey.

538
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:26,545
I should have taken these pictures out first.

539
00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:28,103
You don't have to.

540
00:37:29,123 --> 00:37:31,463
Then should we go take pictures again this evening?

541
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,209
The light should be nice.

542
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,314
I don't think I can.

543
00:37:35,946 --> 00:37:37,555
I have to go to Nut's house this evening.

544
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:13,080
The house is huge.

545
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:24,276
Chai.

546
00:38:26,974 --> 00:38:29,522
You're dressed strangely today.

547
00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:31,375
I've never seen you dress like this before.

548
00:38:32,028 --> 00:38:34,450
I'm just dressing for the location.

549
00:38:44,415 --> 00:38:46,202
Where are you two dressed up to go?

550
00:38:47,695 --> 00:38:50,561
Chai said to dress for the location.

551
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:52,503
Wow.

552
00:38:52,795 --> 00:38:54,494
Do you have to dress up this much?

553
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:57,757
And

554
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:59,538
did you get a new haircut?

555
00:39:01,143 --> 00:39:02,303
Well,

556
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:04,756
Chai said he wanted us to look good today.

557
00:39:06,962 --> 00:39:08,388
This style

558
00:39:09,168 --> 00:39:10,481
is pretty cute too.

559
00:39:13,967 --> 00:39:15,508
Let's start practicing. Go.

560
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:24,279
So cool.

561
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:26,972
I think that last round was really good.

562
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,473
Tomorrow, just play like you practiced.

563
00:39:31,112 --> 00:39:32,841
There will be a lot of people tomorrow

564
00:39:32,865 --> 00:39:34,739
and I won't be able to play like I practiced.

565
00:39:36,184 --> 00:39:37,400
Tomorrow, just play

566
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:38,848
without paying attention to the audience.

567
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,132
How many times have you practiced this set?

568
00:39:42,873 --> 00:39:45,140
We believe you can do it, Ek.

569
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,041
If we get through tomorrow,

570
00:39:48,065 --> 00:39:49,385
all that's left is the final round.

571
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,078
If we can practice like this,

572
00:39:51,453 --> 00:39:53,140
I'm confident that we'll win no matter what.

573
00:39:54,502 --> 00:39:55,986
Hey, guys.

574
00:39:56,658 --> 00:39:58,145
See that up there?

575
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:00,751
Over there.

576
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:02,875
That's the best bassist award.

577
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:05,754
I'm going to go get it for you all to admire.

578
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,555
If you really win best bassist,

579
00:40:08,675 --> 00:40:10,826
I'll treat you to your favorite Mookrata.

580
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:11,967
You said it.

581
00:40:12,504 --> 00:40:13,592
Then I want the big set.

582
00:40:14,105 --> 00:40:15,925
You eat so much.

583
00:40:18,765 --> 00:40:19,847
How about this instead?

584
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:22,558
I think no matter who wins an award,

585
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:24,358
we should all go celebrate together.

586
00:40:24,951 --> 00:40:26,161
My treat.

587
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:28,269
Then

588
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:31,237
Biu, you're buying the drinks, okay?

589
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:33,181
Give an inch and you'll take a mile.

590
00:40:35,353 --> 00:40:36,780
Let's pack up and go home.

591
00:40:46,972 --> 00:40:48,074
Nut.

592
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,167
After this, want to go get something to eat?

593
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,456
Sorry.

594
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,857
I have to go home early today.

595
00:41:12,535 --> 00:41:14,129
Do you still like to eat this?

596
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:17,439
Thanks, Lin.

597
00:41:21,272 --> 00:41:22,608
Seeing Lin and Nut

598
00:41:22,632 --> 00:41:24,172
become close again like before

599
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:25,781
makes me miss the old days.

600
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:28,561
I know, right?

601
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:29,881
But it's a shame

602
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:30,874
that next year,

603
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:32,753
Lin will be going to study in England.

604
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:38,197
Really?

605
00:41:38,423 --> 00:41:39,525
That's great then.

606
00:41:39,556 --> 00:41:41,231
I was also just thinking about sending Nut

607
00:41:41,255 --> 00:41:42,782
to study abroad.

608
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,477
Should they go together?

609
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:48,021
Sure.

610
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:49,573
Lin will have a friend with her then.

611
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,466
Um...

612
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:00,784
So...

613
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:05,380
But Nut wants to be a musician

614
00:42:05,404 --> 00:42:07,365
and have a band here in Thailand, doesn't he?

615
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:10,261
Lin.

616
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:12,488
Don't be so serious about that.

617
00:42:12,661 --> 00:42:15,974
That music thing is just a dream.

618
00:42:16,054 --> 00:42:17,456
It can't be a real career.

619
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,774
Nut knows that well.

620
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:28,240
Thank you.

621
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,761
Wow, you really know what I like.

622
00:42:33,602 --> 00:42:34,942
Thank you.

623
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,344
Tomorrow is the competition day, right?

624
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:40,798
Yes.

625
00:42:41,798 --> 00:42:43,211
So, you two,

626
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:44,813
are you ready?

627
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,801
We're fully prepared.

628
00:42:46,825 --> 00:42:48,769
We've practiced very hard.

629
00:42:48,793 --> 00:42:50,207
We'll definitely get to the next round.

630
00:42:51,431 --> 00:42:52,551
By the way,

631
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:54,676
Chai, you look cute dressed like this.

632
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:57,198
You look cool and smart.

633
00:42:57,451 --> 00:42:59,998
You look very handsome today.

634
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:00,750
Thank you.

635
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:02,132
I've never seen this look on you before.

636
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:03,805
Very cool.

637
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:05,496
I forgot to ask.

638
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:07,188
Coming to eat at our house,

639
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:09,325
how's the food? Is it okay?

640
00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:10,805
The food is delicious.

641
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:12,225
Very delicious.

642
00:43:12,871 --> 00:43:14,089
I miss my mom.

643
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:19,084
If that's the case, next time,

644
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:20,886
Chai, you should invite your mother

645
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,131
to come have dinner with us.

646
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:24,674
Yes, exactly.

647
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:25,868
Sure.

648
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,147
Yeah, bring her along.

649
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:29,967
Ek, serve some food for Chai.

650
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:33,443
The eggs are fine, that's it.

651
00:43:40,735 --> 00:43:41,745
Mr. Chai.

652
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:43,816
Ma'am give you this pork leg.

653
00:43:44,975 --> 00:43:46,004
Thank you very much.

654
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,809
This is a delicacy.

655
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,941
Thank you.

656
00:43:57,741 --> 00:43:59,063
Tonight,

657
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:00,950
get some sleep.

658
00:44:02,277 --> 00:44:04,487
I'm not sure if I'll be able to sleep tonight.

659
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:06,672
Because I'll definitely be very excited.

660
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:09,960
If you're excited,

661
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:11,881
then tonight,

662
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,788
try closing your eyes

663
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:16,257
and counting geese one by one.

664
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:19,556
1, 2.

665
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:22,598
Wait a minute.

666
00:44:23,158 --> 00:44:24,304
Counting geese?

667
00:44:25,495 --> 00:44:26,901
Don't people usually count sheep?

668
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:29,555
No, I'm going to count geese.

669
00:44:29,861 --> 00:44:32,208
Geese can fly over fences too.

670
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:33,594
Okay.

671
00:44:33,618 --> 00:44:35,498
Tonight I'll sleep while counting geese.

672
00:44:37,399 --> 00:44:39,166
And tomorrow, tell me

673
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:40,926
how many you counted.

674
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,508
Okay.

675
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:45,713
I'm going. Good luck tomorrow.

676
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,387
Okay.

677
00:44:51,048 --> 00:44:52,196
Chai.

678
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,761
Drive safely.

679
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:57,136
Thanks.

680
00:44:58,002 --> 00:44:59,153
And also,

681
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:01,053
tell me how many geese you counted.

682
00:45:01,085 --> 00:45:02,113
Okay.

683
00:45:43,288 --> 00:45:44,635
Beautiful than I thought.

684
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:48,165
But I feel like

685
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:49,720
something's missing.

686
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,760
Why?

687
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,961
Is a picture missing?

688
00:46:58,346 --> 00:46:59,360
Mom.

689
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:03,041
Here.

690
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,461
Pork leg with skin, just the way you like it.

691
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,766
Oh, thanks.

692
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:10,232
After you finish eating,

693
00:47:10,256 --> 00:47:11,730
just leave it here. I'll come wash it.

694
00:47:13,015 --> 00:47:14,271
Oh, Chai.

695
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,435
Tomorrow, good luck.

696
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:27,160
Leave it here, I'll do it tomorrow.

697
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:48,522
It's okay, go and rest.

698
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:49,934
I'll clear it myself.

699
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:51,187
Okay, Mom.

700
00:47:52,597 --> 00:47:53,670
Nut.

701
00:47:55,596 --> 00:47:57,003
Tomorrow,

702
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:58,484
I'm taking you to apply

703
00:47:58,508 --> 00:47:59,793
for a scholarship to study abroad.

704
00:48:00,063 --> 00:48:01,388
Lin's father recommended it.

705
00:48:01,568 --> 00:48:02,988
Get your documents ready.

706
00:48:03,438 --> 00:48:04,403
Dad.

707
00:48:04,663 --> 00:48:07,984
- But tomorrow...
- If you're going to talk about your useless band,

708
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:09,604
I don't want to hear it.

709
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:11,545
I'm not going.

710
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:13,365
Have you ever asked me, Dad,

711
00:48:14,004 --> 00:48:15,864
what I really want?

712
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:18,936
Well, if what you want

713
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,328
doesn't make your future better,

714
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:23,134
why should I care?

715
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:24,712
Dad.

716
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,570
Go get your documents ready.

717
00:48:31,168 --> 00:48:32,255
No.

718
00:48:40,761 --> 00:48:41,759
Tim, give it a sniff.

719
00:48:41,783 --> 00:48:43,451
How is it? Does it smell good?

720
00:48:43,876 --> 00:48:45,235
Here you go, Dad.

721
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,469
Here, Tim.

722
00:48:48,261 --> 00:48:49,768
Vegetables again?

723
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:51,837
It's good that you're eating vegetables,

724
00:48:51,861 --> 00:48:52,653
you're old dad.

725
00:48:52,686 --> 00:48:54,565
Eating only fried and oily food isn't good.

726
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,343
Old? I'm only 49.

727
00:48:57,695 --> 00:48:59,876
49? Up to 50.

728
00:48:59,909 --> 00:49:01,825
Yes, my lovely son.

729
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:03,990
So lovely, cursing your dad.

730
00:49:08,286 --> 00:49:09,776
Win.

731
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,749
Can I have some omelet, please?

732
00:49:12,343 --> 00:49:13,579
Win.

733
00:49:13,603 --> 00:49:15,624
Can I have some omelet, please?

734
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:18,497
Didn't you just have an omelet this morning?

735
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,284
But Tim likes it.

736
00:49:20,637 --> 00:49:22,664
But Vithoon likes it.

737
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:26,960
Okay, Tim. Okay, Vithoon.

738
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:28,782
How many eggs?

739
00:49:28,806 --> 00:49:29,795
2, please.

740
00:49:29,819 --> 00:49:31,473
Plus 2, please.

741
00:49:34,256 --> 00:49:35,957
Win.

742
00:49:35,988 --> 00:49:37,989
Can I have some fried chicken, please?

743
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,348
Win.

744
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:41,501
Can I have some fried chicken, please?

745
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:43,874
That's enough, both of you.

746
00:49:47,148 --> 00:49:48,641
At least we get an omelet.

747
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,110
Thank you.

748
00:50:05,031 --> 00:50:07,395
Why is there chicken now that Nut is here?

749
00:50:07,703 --> 00:50:08,512
Yeah.

750
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:11,065
Why is there chicken now that Nut is here?

751
00:50:11,413 --> 00:50:13,805
Because Win knows that I likes to eat fried chicken.

752
00:50:14,421 --> 00:50:15,963
But Tim likes it too.

753
00:50:15,987 --> 00:50:19,106
Oh, yes, but Vithoon likes it too.

754
00:50:21,215 --> 00:50:23,801
Then should we share it?

755
00:50:24,181 --> 00:50:26,355
That's great.

756
00:50:27,753 --> 00:50:29,560
Tim, you eat first.

757
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,499
Okay.

758
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:33,705
Fried chicken, sir.

759
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,107
Thank you very much, Nut.

760
00:50:36,131 --> 00:50:37,291
Thank you.

761
00:50:47,371 --> 00:50:48,258
So,

762
00:50:48,497 --> 00:50:50,525
didn't you just have dinner at Lin's house?

763
00:50:54,878 --> 00:50:56,323
I'll tell you later.

764
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:02,948
Your dad

765
00:51:03,247 --> 00:51:04,387
hasn't changed at all.

766
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,807
You talk like you've known my dad for a long time.

767
00:51:15,102 --> 00:51:16,652
Actually, it has been a long time.

768
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,603
Just a few months?

769
00:51:31,328 --> 00:51:33,229
I really want to show my dad

770
00:51:34,903 --> 00:51:36,940
that playing music can be a career.

771
00:51:40,179 --> 00:51:41,527
If you want to prove it,

772
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:44,773
there's only one way, isn't there?

773
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:55,707
We have to win the competition.

774
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:58,500
♪ I once made a wish ♪

775
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:03,255

♪ Just no one cruel to me ♪

778
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,176
In the future you came from,

779
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,808
did we win the competition?

780
00:52:22,241 --> 00:52:23,368
No.

781
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:26,496
If I already know that

782
00:52:26,521 --> 00:52:28,661
in the end, it'll turn out the same way,

783
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:31,136
why should we even try?

784
00:52:33,003 --> 00:52:34,410
I'm still hoping.

785
00:52:35,116 --> 00:52:36,203
Hoping for what?

786
00:52:38,062 --> 00:52:38,988
Hoping that

787
00:52:39,701 --> 00:52:40,710
even though we already know

788
00:52:40,734 --> 00:52:42,341
how the destination will end,

789
00:52:43,025 --> 00:52:45,560
we might be able to do something better along the way.

790
00:52:49,845 --> 00:52:52,303

791
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:55,205

00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:10,109

♪ Am I asking for too much? ♪

804
00:53:33,868 --> 00:53:35,854
In the end, we still lost, right?

805
00:53:38,255 --> 00:53:39,930
Just the fact that I get to be here,

806
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,538
get to be with you guys,

807
00:53:43,735 --> 00:53:45,374
get to see the person I love again.

808
00:53:46,341 --> 00:53:48,064
That alone makes it different from before.

809
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:13,066
(Next Episode)
Hey, why do you suddenly want to go camping?

810
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,205
Look for inspiration to write a song.

811
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,401
Because in the final round,

812
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:17,592
we have to use a new original song.

813
00:54:17,938 --> 00:54:18,987
What were you thinking?

814
00:54:19,011 --> 00:54:20,982
Coming all this way to celebrate a victory.

815
00:54:21,315 --> 00:54:22,848
Tired.

816
00:54:22,872 --> 00:54:24,090
But it's worth it, right?

817
00:54:24,115 --> 00:54:25,297
Of course.

818
00:54:26,134 --> 00:54:28,071
I used to think that I wanted to have a band,

819
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,157
and invite everyone to go camping,

820
00:54:30,314 --> 00:54:31,809
and eat Mookrata like this for a long time.

821
00:54:32,176 --> 00:54:33,164
Now that you're here,

822
00:54:33,194 --> 00:54:34,176
have you gotten more

823
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,525
inspiration to write songs?

824
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:36,530
Hey, you.

825
00:54:36,554 --> 00:54:37,728
Can I ask you something?

826
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:40,975
20 years later, Lin and Nut...
