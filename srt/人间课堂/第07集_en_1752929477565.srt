1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,966
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,927
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,226
Fuck!

4
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,272
Open up!

5
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,048
Where are these fuckers?

6
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,095
Hey, go that way. Not there.

7
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,818
NOT FALSIFYING SPREADING INFORMATION
IT'S SPREADING FALSE INFORMATION

8
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,445
DETECTIVE HAEGYONG LEE

9
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:50,235
My gosh. What is all this
in the middle of the night?

10
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,298
My daughter, where are you? It's late.

11
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,430
BANANA KARAOKE CLUB

12
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,247
Hey, he's sleeping.

13
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,166
He's out of his mind.

14
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,001
I'm speechless.

15
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,878
Hey, wake up!

16
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,213
Hey, wake up!

17
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,425
Look at him sleeping so peacefully.

18
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,097
You know,
Mijung has such strange taste.

19
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,516
I understand paying for sex,

20
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,726
but someone like him?

21
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,103
When you eat steak everyday,

22
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,771
you start craving fast food.

23
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,400
Hey, stay still.

24
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,695
Hey! Stay still before I pound you.

25
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:18,907
Hey, Fast Food.

26
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,076
I'll explain why you must die,
so listen carefully.

27
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,038
Hey.

28
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,291
She's my girlfriend.
You slept with her, right?

29
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,210
Right?

30
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,214
As her boyfriend, I'm pissed off.
I need to get revenge.

31
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,591
-Start.
-Okay.

32
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,305
EMERGENCY ROOM

33
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,233
Are you going to stay here all night?

34
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,196
You must be very worried.

35
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,286
Who is that man in there?

36
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,873
You know him, right?

37
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,800
-Jisoo.
-What?

38
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,802
Where's Jisoo?

39
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,264
Was someone else there?

40
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,688
-They took him.
-They took him?

41
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,608
I'm sure...

42
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,736
I'm sure they took him.
Where is he?

43
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,074
Minhee, who's Jisoo?

44
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,243
They took him.

45
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,044
Hey, Minhee.

46
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,505
Hello.

47
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,641
I was exhausted last time
after cutting the leg.

48
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,893
-Let's take it easy today.
-Cut off his arm.

49
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,481
Hey, that's a tendon.
It's too stringy to cut.

50
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,691
The bone is easier.

51
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,944
-Here?
-Yes, around there.

52
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,573
Stay still. It's okay.
It'll be over quickly.

53
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,538
You must have redecorated it yourself.

54
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,749
Come on in. It's vintage style.

55
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,709
You can move in at any time--

56
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,129
What are you doing?

57
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,469
What's with all the plastic?

58
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,887
It's under construction.

59
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,142
You can move in anytime you want,

60
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,062
but this room isn't finished yet.

61
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,396
I can't show you today.

62
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,399
Is there a problem?

63
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,276
-Shit. We're fucked.
-What do we do?

64
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,944
Hey, clean that up first.

65
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,488
-Gosh.
-Hurry up and clean!

66
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,448
If Mijung sees this, we're dead.

67
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,617
Hurry!

68
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,535
Hey, Daeyeol Ryu!

69
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,414
Are you a moron?

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,001
I told you the realtor was bringing
someone today.

71
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,128
When?

72
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,299
How many times did I tell you
not to do this crap at the shop?

73
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,843
Why not? It's under my name.

74
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,887
What? Your name? Fuck.

75
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,808
You're so fucking brazen. I got confused.

76
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,936
Don't you feel sorry for me?

77
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,105
For what?

78
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,192
Hey, I do all the work by myself
and run the store on my own.

79
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,652
Don't you feel bad for me?

80
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,572
Fuck. Please don't do these stupid things

81
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,491
and stop going out all the time.

82
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,910
Try being helpful in my life for once!

83
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:51,828
It's because...

84
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,414
you cheated on me.

85
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,666
That's why I'm doing something
this extreme.

86
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,293
I know you hired a compensated date.

87
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,007
Did you go through my phone?

88
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,096
Is that important right now? Is it?

89
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,517
He's like this because of you.
Don't you feel sorry?

90
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,188
Please help me.

91
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,899
-Who is this kid?
-What?

92
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,861
Who the hell is he?

93
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,697
Goodness.

94
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,035
You fucking thug.

95
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,256
Wait outside.

96
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:46,924
Okay.

97
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,482
Hey.

98
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,443
Have you ever satisfied a woman?

99
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,572
Don't bother trying.

100
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,991
You can't do it. It's impossible.

101
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,913
No matter what shit I do,
I can't make her happy.

102
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,124
She wanted a store,
so I got her one.

103
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,711
She wanted a karaoke bar,
so I got her one.

104
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,755
There's nothing I didn't do for her.

105
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,135
How is it my fault that she can't pay rent
because business is slow?

106
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,056
What did I not do for her?

107
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,978
What is it? What?

108
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,941
Shit.

109
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,110
What?

110
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,113
May I go now?

111
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,823
-You want to leave?
-Yes.

112
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,286
It looks like
there was a misunderstanding.

113
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,542
Oh, that's right.

114
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,502
Sorry. I'm sorry.

115
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,005
I'm really sorry.

116
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,259
Darn it. You should go to the hospital.

117
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,302
Go straight to a hospital.

118
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,518
-Hey.
-Yes?

119
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,561
It's really not you?

120
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,355
What?

121
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,066
How could you not be him?

122
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,363
When I sent the message earlier,
it showed up on your phone.

123
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,533
Hold on.
I'm sure it showed up on your phone.

124
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,828
Look. "Blue Flavor. Hello."

125
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,292
I think Mijung lied to me.

126
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,420
Logically, it has to be you.

127
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,506
Am I wrong?

128
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,510
It's okay...

129
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,637
It's okay.

130
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,640
No, it's not okay.

131
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,808
A person was hurt.

132
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,354
If you had told me something,
anything, at school,

133
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,897
he might not have gotten hurt.

134
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,483
Why are you picking on me?

135
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,612
I'm not the bad guy.

136
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,656
Why is everyone picking on me?

137
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,116
Of course, you're not.

138
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,120
But if you don't say anything,

139
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,664
you're helping the bad guys.

140
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,333
I...

141
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,752
I...

142
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,879
I...

143
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,048
Minhee.

144
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,175
When will you tell me?

145
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,720
Once that boy Jisoo is found dead,

146
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,513
will you tell me then?

147
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,390
Stop it!

148
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,019
What are you doing to her?

149
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,731
She's already traumatized.

150
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,234
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,363
I lost my cool
because of the urgency.

152
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,656
I understand, but...

153
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,200
grilling her won't get you anywhere.

154
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,284
Jisoo--

155
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,702
Jisoo is my student too.

156
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,373
I'm sorry.

157
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,583
Get up, Minhee.

158
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,670
I'll take you home.

159
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:15,841
It's okay. Get up.

160
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,605
A hundred sixty five, fifty two.

161
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,107
B, 26.

162
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,110
What are those numbers?

163
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,529
-Specs.
-What?

164
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,031
Height, weight, cup size, and pay.

165
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,324
I see!

166
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,367
Okay.

167
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,285
Hey, I'm sorry.

168
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,287
Oh, hey.

169
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,998
You got something.

170
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,627
"Where are you?" Look.

171
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,338
He wants to meet you now.

172
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,423
Wow!

173
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,258
This is quick.

174
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,302
I'm just a middleman for the chats.
That's all.

175
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,346
I see...

176
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,640
That's why when you sent the message,

177
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,935
I got the text alert on my phone.

178
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,145
Nickname, Blue Flavor.

179
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,730
So, you're...

180
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,149
a part-timer that responds
to text messages.

181
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,818
-Yes, that's right.
-That's right.

182
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,363
In that case, that old man is
the pimp, right?

183
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,743
I'm right.

184
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,453
So this is how they do it now.

185
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,749
Hey, then...
what's the benefit of doing it this way?

186
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:31,333
First,

187
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,961
there's no physical place
of business like this,

188
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,629
so you save on expenses.

189
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,547
Oh!

190
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,257
-The rent!
-The rent!

191
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,301
You don't have to pay rent, right?

192
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,471
Fucking landlords.
They take all our money.

193
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,597
Yes, that's right.

194
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,099
Still, our role is very important.

195
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,311
When you work on a personal basis,

196
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,480
it can get dangerous

197
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,064
if you rely too much on that.

198
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,317
There are some bad incidents
at times, too.

199
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,485
Like what?

200
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,111
Like psycho clients.

201
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,780
-Oh, psycho...
-That's right.

202
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,449
You don't know
whether the person is a psycho.

203
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,076
What if it's someone like him?
He's a total psycho.

204
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,787
That's bad news. You're screwed.

205
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,163
Shit.

206
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,501
Anyway, even mobile transactions need
a middleman to moderate.

207
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,755
The client list is sort of the core.

208
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,634
But since it's done via an app,
there are many variables.

209
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,260
Wow...

210
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,680
He's like AlphaGo or something.

211
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,057
You did your research!

212
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,142
He is so fucking smart.

213
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,561
AlphaGo! AlphaGo!

214
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,907
-Keep talking.
-Yes, go on.

215
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,784
-I want to learn and use it.
-More?

216
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:47,993
-Yes.
-Tell us more.

217
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,120
Do you have a pen?

218
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,664
-Hey, get him a pen!
-Pen.

219
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,915
-And paper.
-Write here.

220
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,459
-First...
-Yes.

221
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,756
Like this.

222
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,093
First, you can hack the network with this.

223
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,636
DNS checking

224
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,471
and MX reboot hacking.

225
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:08,889
This is a free tool.

226
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,559
You use it to modify standard websites.

227
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,310
Hey, stop.

228
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,188
Do you know what your problem is?

229
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,608
-You're fucking bad at explaining.
-It's--

230
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,444
You should dumb it down
so the person can understand.

231
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,697
If you write English

232
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,073
and speak in English,

233
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,450
do you think we'd want to learn or not?

234
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,578
We'd stop wanting to learn.

235
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,496
There are YouTube videos,

236
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,208
where they explain very carefully
and thoroughly step by step.

237
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,377
-So I--
-"Step by step" is also English.

238
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,795
-Daeyeol.
-What?

239
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,715
Will you just let him go?

240
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,009
What?

241
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,971
We're not doing that?

242
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,182
Hey! It was a misunderstanding.

243
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,685
He's not the one that slept with Mijung.

244
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,146
So what happened was...

245
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,523
This is...

246
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,693
You see "Blue Flavor" here, right?

247
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,529
If you open the app

248
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,114
and type "Hello"--

249
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,408
Shit, how much do I have to explain?

250
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,243
Still, given the circumstances,

251
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,037
I think we should kill him.

252
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,330
Stop it. You'll scare him.

253
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,999
I mean, he knows way too much.

254
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,085
He knows where we are, right?

255
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,380
And he knows what kind of business
Mijung runs.

256
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,595
Being exposed makes me uneasy.

257
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,395
You see that?
That's how you explain things.

258
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,606
Get the saw.

259
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,526
-Fuck!
-What did you say?

260
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,988
Then you should've blindfolded me
when you brought me here.

261
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,073
Come here, asshole.

262
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,616
-You asshole.
-I'm sorry.

263
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,618
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

264
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,875
I'll do it all.

265
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,002
You'll do this?

266
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,340
Then what's this?

267
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,175
Job application?

268
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,844
He seems smart, but still...

269
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,931
Even convenience stores vet
the applicants.

270
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,307
We can't just take anyone.

271
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,310
-That's right.
-It'd be nice if we could ask his boss.

272
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,813
But you hacked him with an ax.

273
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,232
Shit, I know.

274
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,692
No.

275
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:27,778
He isn't the boss.

276
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,155
It's someone else.

277
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,323
That...

278
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,076
pimp.

279
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,552
Un... Uncle...

280
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,226
Uncle, it's Jisoo.

281
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,068
Uncle.

282
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,946
I don't know how to explain this,

283
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:16,035
but some people kidnapped me--

284
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,202
Shh!

285
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,704
Don't say that!

286
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,623
I'm with some people right now.

287
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,503
They want to ask you something.

288
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,172
-Silence.
-Silence.

289
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,007
-Oh.
-Sorry?

290
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,552
-I'll do the talking.
-I'll do the talking.

291
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,554
That voice is creepy.

292
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,640
Identify yourself.

293
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,727
Oh, us?

294
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,231
Does he always talk down to people
from the get-go?

295
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,734
Uncle, I--

296
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,028
Hello, Sir.  How are you?

297
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,782
So you really do exist.

298
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,492
Uncle.

299
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,827
Please find Mr. Lee.

300
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,330
He must be at a hospital nearby.

301
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,040
He was badly injured earlier...

302
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,458
I've already checked.

303
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,210
He's alive.

304
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,253
He's alive?

305
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,964
That's one persistent prick.

306
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,259
Then what about that girl, Minhee?

307
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,764
-Police.
-Police.

308
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,725
Gosh, Sir.

309
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:23,811
My goodness.

310
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,896
So...

311
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,857
which organization are you with?

312
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,526
Does it have a name?

313
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,905
Like something corporation
or something gang.

314
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,620
Samun Gang.

315
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,622
Samun Gang?

316
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:45,874
Have you heard of it?

317
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,834
I'm not sure.

318
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,586
Do gangs still name themselves?

319
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,839
If you're done talking to your nephew,

320
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,966
let me talk about us.

321
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,220
One of the babies who work under you

322
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,890
took on my fiancée as a client.

323
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,891
He slept with her.

324
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,726
You understand so far?

325
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,480
That's why I'm very hurt right now.

326
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,525
I need to be compensated.

327
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,450
Our man's medical bills.

328
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,660
Our man's medical bills.

329
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,288
Lost opportunities
due to losing resources.

330
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,456
Lost opportunity and psychological trauma.

331
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,876
The stifled business
due to police involvement.

332
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,252
How will you compensate us?

333
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:31,670
What?

334
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,589
He's a total psycho.

335
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,509
If you take my words like that,

336
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,886
-we'll--
-Uncle.

337
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,347
Let me work here for the time being.

338
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,641
-What, asshole?
-What, asshole?

339
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,852
Tell him.

340
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,355
It's a long story, so I'll explain later.

341
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,693
For now, just confirm my identity.

342
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,862
Otherwise, I'm really dead.

343
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,281
Shut up. Are you kidding me?

344
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,491
Shit. He's mad.

345
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,370
It'll be just for a short while.
It won't take long.

346
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,289
I just need to teach them...

347
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,958
-the know-how.
-Boss.

348
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,753
Our kids can't work right now.

349
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,382
-What kids?
-Uncle, this business...

350
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,800
is a front.

351
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,136
-These people--
-How many?

352
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,388
There are eight full-time

353
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,434
and about 30 freelancers, right?

354
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,603
-Front business?
-A karaoke bar.

355
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,064
-Second Round Karaoke.
-How about security?

356
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:32,981
Security...

357
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,651
It seems sufficient.

358
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:36,944
And age range?

359
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,154
Early 20s to late 20s.

360
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,616
They said early 20s to late 20s.

361
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,286
But why are you asking these things?

362
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,290
-Stand by.
-What?

363
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,960
-Uncle.
-Hey, give me that.

364
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,671
Boss! Shit.

365
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:57,798
Shit.

366
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,508
Let's wait.

367
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,094
UNCLE, I WANTED TO SAY BYE
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

368
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,887
MINJU CHO LEFT THE ROOM

369
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,276
He's calling.

370
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,323
-Yes, Uncle.
-Mr. Daeyeol Ryu.

371
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,617
Oh, yes. Yes, Sir.

372
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,662
I guarantee
that our employee is hardworking.

373
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:33,458
However, I cannot consent
to the disclosure of our core know-how.

374
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,714
-Gosh, is that so?
-Wait, uncle...

375
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,965
Hold on.

376
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,216
-Cut it off.
-Get the saw.

377
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,718
-Uncle, you see--
-However,

378
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,053
I can send him on assignment...

379
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,221
on my terms.

380
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,558
What are those terms?

381
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,562
A partnership between you and us.

382
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,064
Those are my terms.

383
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,360
-Partnership?
-He wants to work with us.

384
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,703
Do you agree?

385
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,792
See that?
This is how you do a showdown.

386
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,046
They did everything
and told us what to do.

387
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,672
How is this a showdown?

388
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,426
You got something on your face.
Come here.

389
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,304
What do you know?

390
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,640
This is all strategy

391
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,518
to make them think they're in control.

392
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,396
This is business psychology.

393
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,108
Okay, all done.

394
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,445
Jisoo Oh.

395
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,947
So our AlphaGo's name is Jisoo Oh.

396
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,282
This is for you.

397
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,035
HELLO, I'M JISOO
I WILL BE LOYAL TO DAEYEOL

398
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,998
Okay, from now on,

399
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,126
call me here.

400
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,253
This is our direct line.

401
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,714
Okay? This is so great.

402
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,673
YANG

403
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,886
Oh, Yang. Who cares about Yang?
Cross this out.

404
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,597
Al... Pha...

405
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,015
Go.

406
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,560
Okay. Eat up.

407
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,063
Oh, right. You have like 20 missed calls.

408
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,858
Call him back. He must be worried.
Mr. Jinwoo Cho or something?

409
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,945
Jinusean? Is that who it was?

410
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,321
Tell me

411
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,949
Tell me to eat

412
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,411
Tell me to mix it

413
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,956
Minhee, you did nothing wrong,
so don't worry about it.

414
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,959
They must have their situations.

415
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,961
And it's their jobs, that's why.

416
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:44,381
It's called a panic attack.

417
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,258
If you can,

418
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:47,801
quit this work.

419
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,512
-I said I'm fine.
-Why are you...

420
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,557
here?

421
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,308
You don't want to do this.

422
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:59,563
Without this, I'm nothing.

423
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,232
Stop it already.

424
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,083
Hello? Jinwoo Cho speaking.

425
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,545
Mr. Cho, this is Jisoo.

426
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,340
You called, right?
My battery was dead.

427
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,849
Can you hear me? Hello?

428
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,855
-Hello?
-Hey! Jisoo Oh!

429
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,107
Why couldn't I reach you?

430
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,777
If your phone had died, you...

431
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,991
You irresponsible jerk!

432
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,121
I'm sorry.

433
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,336
My battery kept dying randomly

434
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,672
before I even knew it, so...

435
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,302
-Mr. Cho?
-Seriously...

436
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:15,805
Dang it! Seriously.

437
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,643
Hey.

438
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,527
Jisoo, you little jerk.

439
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,948
Are you hungry?

440
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:42,999
No way.

441
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,085
I got carded.

442
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,711
No way.

443
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,256
I got caught
because they got a new cashier.

444
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,137
And my cigarettes?

445
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,015
What? You don't have them?

446
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,437
-Sorry.
-Don't ask for something you don't have?

447
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:05,897
Just deal with it?

448
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,275
I'll try the store in front of the school.

449
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,943
Fucker.

450
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,738
What am I supposed to do
while you go all the way there?

451
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,032
Hey. Come here.

452
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,375
What is this?

453
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,335
You don't look that young.

454
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,047
Why do you keep getting caught?

455
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,301
Hey. Go.

456
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,387
-What?
-Go. Scram.

457
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,643
Hello?

458
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,198
No, there's nothing.

459
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,082
I thought it over,
but I did nothing wrong.

460
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,587
So what's with this mood?

461
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,977
Give me a cigarette.

462
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,230
I want some cigarettes.

463
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,484
-Kitae wants to smoke.
-I've been doing compensated dating.

464
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,612
While I was seeing you.

465
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,409
You said you liked my money, right?

466
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,955
That's how I earned it.

467
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,003
The money for your cigarettes,
your alcohol,

468
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,256
your presents,

469
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,842
and the condoms.

470
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,554
All of it.

471
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,350
That's how I bought them.

472
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,817
Do you still like my money?

473
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,909
Do you still like me?

474
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,297
Why did you tell me?

475
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,761
Why did you tell me?

476
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:44,848
What?

477
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,101
So...

478
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,729
why did you tell me?

479
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,165
Did you...

480
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,627
Did you know?

481
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,275
KWAKKI

482
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,359
I'll tell.

483
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,530
I'll tell everyone.

484
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:45,825
Fuck off.

485
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,798
-Is this a game to you?
-Why are you giving me crap?

486
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,051
Everything is a game to you, right?

487
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,933
You said you'd work there.

488
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,020
-You asked me to play along.
-I said to play along, not make it worse.

489
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,441
I said it would be
for a short time, didn't I?

490
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,693
For a short time!

491
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,493
Do you even know what they do?

492
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:33,206
Hey. Look.

493
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,006
Do you know what did this?

494
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,469
A saw.

495
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,723
They were going to chop me up.

496
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,938
I was almost murdered.

497
00:30:58,565 --> 00:30:59,524
But you lived.

498
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:03,194
What?

499
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,780
I saved you.

500
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,951
I know you.

501
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,831
I know you did that for the money.

502
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,713
Even my life is a game to you, isn't it?

503
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,279
They left the chat room.
All of your clients.

504
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,617
I think they cut us off.

505
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:54,871
Why?

506
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,916
I don't know.

507
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,502
Will you keep working?

508
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,381
Then those jerks are...

509
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,800
our only option now.

510
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,537
BANANA KARAOKE CLUB

511
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,156
Who's this?

512
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,741
It's me. Jisoo.

513
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,831
-How did you get my number?
-I found it...

514
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,751
on our class emergency contact list.

515
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,633
What's up?

516
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:33,803
Well...

517
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,141
I was just... wondering if you were okay.

518
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,410
You really came.

519
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,338
You must have nothing better to do either.

520
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,723
What about the cops?

521
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,017
What about them?

522
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,479
Did you tell them anything?

523
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:15,488
You said...

524
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,491
you got away.

525
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,076
I wondered if you told them...

526
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:22,995
because of me.

527
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,046
Not really.

528
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,632
Good.

529
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:42,890
Don't tell them.

530
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,351
Don't say anything.

531
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,952
Minhee is so fucking late.

532
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,704
Can't she show up early for once?

533
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,165
She'll throw a fit
if we smoke without her.

534
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,959
-She must be sleeping.
-Hey, Hyemin.

535
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,003
I need nicotine.
Look at my hand shaking.

536
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,796
You're practically an addict now.

537
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,963
My... my phone.

538
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,465
What?

539
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,385
My phone... my phone...

540
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,180
My...

541
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,599
Get my phone from my car.

542
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,351
My phone.

543
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,186
My phone.

544
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,256
MINHEE SEO
TWENTY MISSED CALLS

545
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,590
Who's calling?

546
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,640
Minju!

547
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,018
I know you're sleeping! Open up!

548
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,149
Please open up!

549
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,318
Minju!

550
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,709
Minju, Uncle's number.

551
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,877
-What?
-You have his number, right?

552
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,963
Give me his number. Fast.

553
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,900
MINHEE

554
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,325
UNCLE

555
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,047
MR. LEE

556
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,063
What are you doing?

557
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,273
The passcode...

558
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,903
Why are you doing this to me?

559
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:26,489
Are you trying to get me
kicked off the force?

560
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,240
You can't do that nowadays.

561
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,993
They'll bite your head off
for stealing personal data.

562
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,663
The door. Hurry.

563
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,172
UNCLE

564
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:49,970
Mr. Lee?

565
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,184
MESSAGE FROM MINHEE

566
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,977
MR. LEE AWAKE
COPS TOOK HIS PHONE

567
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,366
Are you Uncle?

568
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:22,878
What was that?

569
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,548
What was that call?

570
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,008
UNCLE

571
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,387
Who could this Uncle be?

572
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,180
First, I don't know.

573
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,557
Second, I don't care.

574
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,685
Third, why do you have that?

575
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,814
Well... Remember the witness
Minhee Seo?

576
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,276
-The girl who got dragged into this.
-What about her?

577
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,946
She came to see the victim
in the middle of the night.

578
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:51,365
But the victim asked her

579
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,452
to find his cell phone for him.

580
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,620
Is that a favor

581
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,039
you'd ask someone you don't know?

582
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,042
I'm sure they know each other.

583
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,714
The question is,
how do they know each other?

584
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:09,425
It's not like they're Leon and Mathilda.

585
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,767
Fuck.

586
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:31,989
We won't get caught.

587
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,659
We won't.

588
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:38,787
-We won't?
-We won't.

589
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,623
-Really?
-I think this is...

590
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,709
a sex trafficking case.

591
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,380
It may be much bigger than we think.

592
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,675
With a big boss on top
like an organized crime ring.

593
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,472
Okay. Then let's do this.

594
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,935
Well... this is an assault
and battery case, right?

595
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,020
This isn't sex trafficking case to them.

596
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,105
It's an assault and battery case.

597
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,608
Mr. Lee is the victim.

598
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,777
His phone is passcode-protected, right?

599
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,237
Yes.

600
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,784
-We're fine then.
-What if they hack it?

601
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,911
Can the cops...

602
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,706
crack his passcode and hack his phone?

603
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,210
It's the victim's phone.

604
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,629
How could they get a warrant to hack it?

605
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,924
I guess... we won't get a warrant, right?

606
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,677
For what? The victim's phone?

607
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,178
Right?

608
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,390
Whether it's bagged for evidence

609
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:42,935
or a warrant is requested,
it's up to Violent Crimes Unit.

610
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:44,937
Am I right?

611
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,741
Anyway, what will you do about them?

612
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:02,079
They called this morning.
They want to see you.

613
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,421
Are you telling me to meet
those psychos again?

614
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,139
Yes. Or pack your things right now
and run away.

615
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,057
It's one or the other.

616
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,646
Is it comfortable just talking like that
from a distance?

617
00:43:29,398 --> 00:43:30,232
What?

618
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:37,114
It was Minhee who texted me
to warn me earlier.

619
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:42,202
So?

620
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,705
Even she knows how serious
the situation is,

621
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,624
and she is trying to fix it.

622
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:50,711
What about you?

623
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,549
Whether the cops round us up
and arrest us

624
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,676
or the psychos take us and kill us,

625
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,929
you're safe. Is that it?

626
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,476
You're always at a safe distance
from trouble.

627
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,201
Where are you going?

628
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,579
Where are you going?

629
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,000
I'll handle it then.

630
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,294
Handle what?

631
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,504
Those psycho assholes.

632
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,602
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

633
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,689
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.

634
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,738
