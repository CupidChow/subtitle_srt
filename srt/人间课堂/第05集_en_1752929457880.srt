1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,674
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:10,927
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:17,809
I don't consent.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,854
I don't consent to your searching...
I mean,

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,899
I can't consent.

6
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,698
Why not?

7
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,416
It's sort of a violation
of my civil rights.

8
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,295
How so?

9
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:51,801
Because it's my personal property.

10
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,430
Are you the hero of your class?

11
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,434
Do you think this is your time?
You want attention?

12
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,396
Excuse me, sir.

13
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,442
This can blow up on us.
You know how things are lately.

14
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,943
You punk!

15
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,029
This isn't your social media page.

16
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,116
If you want attention,
do it on your Myspace page.

17
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,702
It's gone, sir.

18
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:18,787
You punks!

19
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,498
-Who's laughing?
-No one uses that now.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,126
Open your bag.

21
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,295
Open your bag!

22
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,131
Now!

23
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,135
Mr. Cho.

24
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,305
-Huh?
-Do I have to?

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,891
Do I have to open my bag?

26
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,775
No.

27
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,737
You don't have to.
This is a civil rights violation.

28
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,407
Oh, man.

29
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,413
Let go, you punk. Let go.

30
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,290
You won't? Let go, you punk!

31
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,959
Come on. Take your hands off.

32
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,794
Let go of this, now.

33
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,171
-Come on.
-Sir, I think you should stop.

34
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,298
-The kids are watching.
-Mr. Cho.

35
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:17,011
It's because of teachers like you
that kids don't respect teachers!

36
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,388
Seriously! Let go.

37
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,224
Let go, you punk. Come on!

38
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,780
Fire!

39
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,324
Okay, quiet down!

40
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,578
You know the drill, right?
From the kids at the back--

41
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,080
-Hey! Sit back down!
-Fire!

42
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,291
Sit down! It's just a drill.

43
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,709
It's not a real fire.

44
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,751
Everyone sit.

45
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,086
What are you doing?

46
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,797
How do you know if it's a drill or not?

47
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,925
Do you want to burn the kids to death?

48
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,511
Right, the front row first.

49
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,014
Go now and gather at the field, okay?

50
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,121
Line up by class. Teachers!

51
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,791
Okay, line up by class. Quiet!

52
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,460
The boys playing basketball.

53
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,003
Hey!

54
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,255
Class Two, come on!

55
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,216
Teachers, please gather your students.

56
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,342
Class Two, line up!

57
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,928
Please make sure
all your students are present.

58
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,681
Pipe down!

59
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,017
Make two lines. Come on.

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,186
Hey, did he get screwed?

61
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,981
I don't know, shit.

62
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,358
Be quiet.

63
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,401
Please make sure everyone is here.

64
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,778
Hey, are you all right?

65
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,613
Make sure everyone's here.

66
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,033
Line up and face forward.

67
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,245
Okay. See if anyone's missing.

68
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,913
Is everyone here?

69
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,748
Is everyone here?

70
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,875
-What about over there?
-Everyone's here.

71
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,876
Is everyone here?

72
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,837
Are the classrooms empty?

73
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,256
Yes.

74
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,091
Okay, good.

75
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,550
Hey, you didn't get caught?

76
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,219
Wear your uniform properly!

77
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,336
What did I just see?

78
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,133
Why did you press that?

79
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,262
Gyuri, you wouldn't do that for no reason.

80
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,264
That's right.

81
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,599
You're well-behaved
even when no one's looking.

82
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,608
Because no one's looking.

83
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,280
What?

84
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,284
If I didn't do that,

85
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,787
no one would look at me.

86
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,045
What do you mean by that?

87
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,129
Sir.

88
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,590
I can't do it anymore.

89
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,260
Why not?

90
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,012
I need to do well in everything.

91
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,807
At school,

92
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,436
with friends...

93
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,272
Everything.

94
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,400
Everything.

95
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,904
I need to do well, but...

96
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,494
I just can't...

97
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,915
I just can't... do it anymore...

98
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,252
I can't hold back this loneliness anymore.

99
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,674
-It's so lonely.
-Gyuri.

100
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,260
Gyuri, look. Hey, Gyuri.

101
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,929
Let go...

102
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:28,971
Sir.

103
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,810
Why don't you get back to work?
I'll talk to her.

104
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,480
Gyuri. Right...

105
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,650
Hang in there. Then I'll...

106
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,823
You rang the fire alarm
because you were lonely?

107
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,202
Hey, Gyuri.

108
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,746
Stop acting.

109
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,290
Tell me now.

110
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
What were you doing?

111
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,716
I want to just look the other way,

112
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,636
but the entire school had to evacuate
because of you.

113
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,264
If the fire department had come,
it would've been a mess.

114
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,807
It's not like you didn't know.

115
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,726
Why did you do it?

116
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,821
I thought I was going crazy.

117
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,657
Why?

118
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,580
Sometimes, I want to just barf.

119
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,916
Why?

120
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,922
The smell of my breath.

121
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,175
Your breath?

122
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,595
Your breath?

123
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,432
Why does it make you want to barf?

124
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,062
Because...

125
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,528
I can breathe even if I do nothing.

126
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,924
What are you doing?

127
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,885
What did they say?

128
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:33,763
About what?

129
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,101
Did you get in trouble?

130
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,022
I got my ass whooped.

131
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,483
Did you get demerits?

132
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,653
Stop asking the obvious.

133
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,572
At least I'm not being disciplined.

134
00:08:58,955 --> 00:08:59,997
Where are you going?

135
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,082
The school store.

136
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,209
Here.

137
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,674
Chicken?

138
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,261
-Not beef?
-Forget it.

139
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,906
-So what did you do with it?
-What?

140
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,913
Don't tell me it's still in your bag.

141
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,392
What are you doing?

142
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,452
-You want me to hide it here?
-It can fit hundreds of millions of won.

143
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,080
Are you nuts? Mr. Cho is always here.

144
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,875
He never ever cleans the room.

145
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,462
I used to hide things I stole in here,

146
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:30,755
and I was never caught.

147
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,135
Do you have other options?

148
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,013
You said
you don't want to leave it at home.

149
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,524
What is this?

150
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,817
What?

151
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,362
What is it?

152
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,156
ADULT TOY FOR MEN

153
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,793
Hey! Give it back!

154
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,461
Why? You said it wasn't yours.

155
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,921
No, it isn't.

156
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,133
Hey, it's okay to use things like this.
Don't be embarrassed.

157
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,011
No... I really didn't know what that was.

158
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,221
But you know,

159
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,765
this looks really soft. Wanna see?

160
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,766
-Look.
-Get lost.

161
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,562
Seriously.

162
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,201
Hey!

163
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,009
Why don't you get in too?

164
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,097
-Sorry?
-I'd like to talk since we met.

165
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,310
Aren't you going home?

166
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,855
-We'll go first, then.
-Okay, bye.

167
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,232
-Mr. Cho, good job today.
-Goodbye.

168
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,442
-Heading home?
-Yes.

00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,880
HIGH INTELLIGENCE... LOW SENSITIVITY?

187
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,261
Hello?

188
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,138
Yes, I'm leaving soon.

189
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,183
Pardon?

190
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,101
The police?

191
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,403
So? How do you know each other?

192
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,532
-We're in the same club.
-Sorry.

193
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,784
I asked your friend.

194
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,500
How and where did you meet Gyuri?

195
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,253
We're in the same club.

196
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,386
So that's the club she mentioned.

197
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:12,685
You seem to be with her every day
lately after school, right?

198
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,273
No, well... It isn't every day.

199
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,442
Did you two have sex already?

200
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,780
Sorry?

201
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,950
Are you admitting it or denying it?

202
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,618
Admitting...

203
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,580
No, I'm denying... I'm denying it.

204
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,456
Do you plan to do it?

205
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,166
You have such a wild imagination.

206
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,626
Gyuri.

207
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,964
Do you think
this relationship is profitable to you?

208
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,885
I got a call from the dean of your school.

209
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,512
The fire alarm?

210
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,890
I was stunned.

211
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,850
What happened with that was...

212
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,477
We're still talking.

213
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,613
I heard your explanation for that behavior
was this:

214
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,907
We exert undue stress

215
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:13,621
on you to perform well academically,
and that was why you did that.

216
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,916
To be honest, I was offended.

217
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,417
We...

218
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,128
never did that to you.

219
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,909
Is it the cliche that romantic feelings
lead to rebellious acts?

220
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,538
To be honest,

221
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,959
this isn't the first time you rebelled
by doing something irrational.

222
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,670
I'm sure your boyfriend doesn't know
about it, but...

223
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,382
I wasn't rebelling.

224
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:10,511
What?

225
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,432
I was really trying to die back then.

226
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,561
You have to cut deep
along the vein to die,

227
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,563
but I couldn't figure out exactly where.

228
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,567
That's why I cut myself twice.

229
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,028
But I must've missed both times.

230
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,840
Happy birthday dear Kitae

231
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:54,930
Happy birthday to you

232
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,811
Yes! I'm a year older!

233
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,146
One, two, three.

234
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,027
Hey!

235
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,695
Why did you do that?

236
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,696
Stop it.

237
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,074
I'll wipe it off for you.

238
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,744
MR. CHO

239
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,620
Let me wipe it off. Come here.

240
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,206
So you're drunk.

241
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,542
-Move.
-Right.

242
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,712
-Ta-da.
-What?

243
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,630
Here, take this.

244
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,009
Thank you, Lord Minhee.

245
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,429
Whatever it is, I'll use it well.
Thank you.

246
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,347
That's a good boy. Open it.

247
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,265
What is it?

248
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,397
-Is this it?
-What?

249
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,857
Put it on.

250
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,108
Is this it?

251
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,071
What? You like this character.
Try it on. I think it'll look good on you.

252
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,573
-It's cute.
-It looks good.

253
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,743
-Hey, it looks nice.
-No, that's not what I mean.

254
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,290
Your tributes have been
very subpar lately.

255
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,043
-Forget it, shit.
-Hey, hey.

256
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,088
Get lost. Don't wear it.
You're fucking rude, you son of a bitch.

257
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,216
-Hey, don't be like that.
-Say it's cute, punk.

258
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,300
Tell her you love her.

259
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,885
-She's pissed off.
-My gosh.

260
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,429
-It's cute. What's the problem?
-I'm so annoyed.

261
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,811
-It looks good.
-That's right. It looks good on you.

262
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,857
This is on the house.

263
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,527
-Thank you!
-Nice.

264
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,362
Thank you.

265
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,697
Give me a smoke.

266
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,076
-Hey, is that beer for me?
-I want a smoke too.

267
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,039
Shit, this is so fucking annoying.

268
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,584
Are you pissed off?

269
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,505
-Hey, where's my vape pen?
-There it is.

270
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,341
Shit, who uses stuff like this?

271
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,093
I'm so annoyed.

272
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,554
Oh, right. Hey.

273
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,347
-What?
-Do you know what Kitae did?

274
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,849
What did he do?

275
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,977
You know why they checked our belongings?

276
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:06,895
Why did they?

277
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,940
Do I tell you or not?

278
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:10,858
Why did they?

279
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,401
Well...

280
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,445
-Hey, do you know?
-Know what?

281
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,198
That woman,
the owner of the Banana Karaoke Club.

282
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,908
Her boyfriend is a gangster.

283
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:24,204
What bullshit is that?
There's no gangster in this day and age.

284
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,207
It's real, bitch.
I heard from the girls at Dongmyung High.

285
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,169
This bitch believes everything
the Dongmyung girls say.

286
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,171
Don't you know
this is a karaoke bar by day

287
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,505
but a whore house by night?

288
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,008
Her boyfriend runs it.
He's the head honcho.

289
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,553
Head honcho? You sound like a child.

290
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,390
What do you call him then?
Should I say gangster boss?

291
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,185
Just listen. You talk too much.

292
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,270
Okay. Keep going.

293
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,439
So, what is it? Tell me.

294
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,901
So, I heard
her boyfriend buried a lot of people

295
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,319
and is a fucking psycho.

296
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,280
I bet the psycho asshole beats her up too.

297
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,198
Really?

298
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,661
Shit, so gross.

299
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,163
Minhee, let's sing.

300
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,207
You thoughtless asshole!

301
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,583
What now?

302
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,294
I was almost caught with my vape pen
because of you, moron.

303
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,213
Fine, okay. I'm sorry.

304
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,674
If you're going to do something stupid,
I need a heads up.

305
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,468
Don't you care if I'm fucked?

306
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,928
Let's go for round two.

307
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,430
Let's go for round two.

308
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,473
I'm not going.

309
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,683
What's wrong with her?

310
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,770
-Let's go, come on.
-I'm not... I said, I'm not going!

311
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,439
Who will pay for round two
if you don't go?

312
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,275
-Shit, I have no money.
-Me neither.

313
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,443
You son of a bitch.

314
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,740
Yes. I'm here, but I don't see you.

315
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,118
-Where should we go?
-Where?

316
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,248
The office?

317
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,292
Hey.

318
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,961
Who is she?

319
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,379
-Here.
-Oh.

320
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,256
Hello.

321
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,550
-Do you know her?
-No, I don't.

322
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,844
-Let's go.
-How would I know her? Let's go.

323
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,264
Let's go for round two.
Come on, Junghwan. Let's go.

324
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,265
-Okay.
-Come on.

325
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,224
Where should we go?

326
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,934
You came alone.

327
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,771
Most girls don't come to places like this
without their agent.

328
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,692
I'm here because I heard about it
through people, so...

329
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,360
How old?

330
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,695
I'm 21.

331
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,780
-And the girls under you?
-I have four.

332
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,824
Oh, three.

333
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,909
Oh, how old are they?

334
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,828
Same as me.

335
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,997
How much do you charge?

336
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,084
It varies by the day.

337
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,171
Normally, it's 200,000 to 250,000 won
each time,

338
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,507
but up to 300,000 if I'm lucky.

339
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,093
Is that right?

340
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,512
So why don't you keep doing it?

341
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,015
I have an issue
with our insurance company.

342
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,224
Who do you use?

343
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,227
I've never met him.

344
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,272
We just call him "Uncle."

345
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,943
So you want to be a junior madam
at our shop?

346
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:00,902
That's right.

347
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,071
Since I have girls I can bring.

348
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,365
This girl's got guts.

349
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:12,289
Do you even know whom we work with?

350
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:28,847
Babe.

351
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,267
You should've told me we had a guest.

352
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,311
I didn't know you were in there.

353
00:22:34,394 --> 00:22:36,897
I said I'd be here this afternoon.

354
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,733
Why do you ignore my texts?

355
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,153
How would I have known you'd be naked?

356
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:46,073
Why are you walking around naked here?

357
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,074
How disgusting.

358
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,035
I was bathing Areung.

359
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,244
Plus,

360
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,997
I hate people seeing my body.

361
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:58,752
Shit, you're so sensitive.
You don't have much to show anyway.

362
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,713
That's not true!

363
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,592
-Get back inside.
-You saw everything, shit!

364
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,137
Shit, where were we?

365
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,472
That's right.

366
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,808
Anyway, I have too many girls to feed.

367
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,434
So I can't afford more.

368
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,895
Give them a call. Tell them I sent you.

369
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:24,778
Shit.

370
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,864
I told you Areung hates hot air!

371
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,366
I only used warm air.

372
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,534
Areung!

373
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,037
Was that hot?
You poor thing. There, there.

374
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:50,887
The images you and I drew together
In the past, holding hands

375
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,641
And unforgettable memories pass
Before my eyes

376
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,977
All the memories come to me

377
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,522
Our times together from back then
Which we can't find anymore

378
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,317
Crash down on me like rough waves

379
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,237
I fear you'll dissipate

380
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,489
And disappear from my side

381
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,366
We're not how we used to be...

382
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,828
The tears stream down my face

383
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,872
Don't say a word, look at me

384
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,426
I don't know
what I'm supposed to listen to.

385
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,556
You don't have the basics,
like understanding the song.

386
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,475
I'm sorry.

387
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:37,893
Taerim.

388
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,686
-Taerim?
-Yes?

389
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,481
That way you drag the beat...

390
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,734
You still haven't fixed it.

391
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,319
Right.

392
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:48,778
I'm sorry.

393
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,033
Hey, If we record this, it'll be obvious
that you have no sense of rhythm.

394
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,201
What will you do?

395
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,786
I'm sorry.

396
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,167
There's nothing worth picking up here.

397
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,423
Taerim.

398
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,300
Yes, ma'am?

399
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,761
Are you upset about going down to Group B?

400
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,180
No, ma'am.

401
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,642
Does it hurt your pride to be trained
with kids who came in later than you?

402
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,019
No, ma'am.

403
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,812
It shouldn't.

404
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,108
You don't have the luxury of worrying
about your pride.

405
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,402
-That's a luxury you can't afford.
-Yes, ma'am.

406
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,154
You need to kick it into gear.

407
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,323
Yes, ma'am.

408
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,159
-Shall we take a break?
-Sure.

409
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,869
Good work.

410
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,375
-Hi.
-Here's what you asked for.

411
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,336
Oh, Gyuri.

412
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:55,470
It's so refreshing after being surrounded
by gloomy old boys. I just love it.

413
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,098
Ms. Cho.

414
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,309
You have a blue chip
right under your nose.

415
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,936
Why don't you realize that?

416
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,438
You're overestimating her.

417
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,440
She's far from ready to do anything.

418
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,734
She's so tough.

419
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,282
Why are the kids in your agency
so lacking in quality then?

420
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,540
You look even prettier today.
I shouldn't hold a girl's hand

421
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,000
for this long these days, huh?

422
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,129
Why are you still standing there?
Go in and rest.

423
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,688
GYURI: FOUND A REPLACEMENT
FOR THE JUDO GUYS

424
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,526
Mr. Choi, that fucking asshole.

425
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,113
Why did he come
when I had a sore throat?

426
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,866
I didn't smoke for a week because of this.

427
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,119
Shit.

428
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,624
I'll be demoted to Group B now.

429
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,253
So? Will you give up and quit?

430
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,796
I can't even afford the dorm.

431
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,507
I was dropped to Group B.

432
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,635
How can I ask my parents for money?

433
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,724

2. HOW TO TURN ON THE DEVICE

447
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,432
WE CAN SHARE THE RECORD VIA EMAIL

448
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,580
MR. LEE

449
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,602
He says he'll try to get used to it.

450
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:18,274
Okay, we'll learn
trigonometric functions today.

451
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:22,070
A trigonometric function is a method
of determining the trigonometric ratio.

452
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:27,033
Trigonometric ratio can be based
on this acute angle here.

453
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,743
If we... Look here.

454
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:33,206
Let's draw a vector here like this
and create an acute angle. Okay?

455
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:37,001
Then you can create
a right-angled triangle like so.

456
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,797
Once a coordinate is on the unit circle,

457
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,676
you can figure out the sine, cosine,
and tangent values. Now...

458
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,560
-Do you have extra sweatpants?
-What?

459
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,856
No?

460
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,071
Hey, you should tell me

461
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,365
if you're coming over.

462
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,245
-What's the update on Taerim?
-Who?

463
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,290
The boy band trainee I hooked you up with.
What happened?

464
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,502
-He got a job.
-For real?

465
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,796
That's right. Mr. Lee's standing by.

466
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,343
When do you plan to go home
since you just got here now?

467
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:28,845
I'm sleeping over.

468
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,182
What time is his job?

469
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,644
What time is Taerim's job?

470
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,046
-Hello?
-Are you standing by?

471
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,507
Yes, I'm standing by now.

472
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,802
Please report
the client's current situation.

473
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,554
He's still frozen stiff.

474
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,391
He's been chain-smoking
for 15 minutes now.

475
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,228
I think he plans to flake.

476
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,358
I understand. Thank you.

477
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,865
Hey, is that it?

478
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,827
Aren't you going to try something more?

479
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,664
Gosh.

480
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,332
Shit.

481
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:50,843
Hello?

482
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,223
Nickname, The Fan?

483
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,225
Nickname, The Fan?

484
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:01,729
I'm sorry.

485
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,736
You don't have to do it.

486
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,242
Sorry?

487
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,911
It's harder to do
than you expected, isn't it?

488
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,247
Yes.

489
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,548
We will never pressure you

490
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,758
to do anything against your will.

491
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,011
We will never demand compensation

492
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,637
resulting therefrom.

493
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,432
So,

494
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,726
you don't have to do it.

495
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,813
However, since the client
you were matched with

496
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,523
is still waiting for you,

497
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,153
we would appreciate it
if you'd make your decision now.

498
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,989
And don't worry too much.

499
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,826
If, by any chance,

500
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,412
something inappropriate occurs
while you're working,

501
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,708
we are always standing by
somewhere close

502
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:07,253
so that we can help you immediately.
Have confidence.

503
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,261
Should I tell the client to leave?

504
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:30,902
No.

505
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:32,653
I'll do it.

506
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,783
Awesome.

507
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:44,957
Hey.

508
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,919
What if he gets a sicko client?

509
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,545
What do you mean?

510
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,424
If he gets a sicko for his first job,
he'll never do this again.

511
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,094
She isn't a sicko.

512
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,554
How can you be so sure?

513
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,349
I planted the client, stupid.

514
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,895
I had Mr. Lee hire her
and tell her to be good to him.

515
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,443
You freak, psychopath, asshole!

516
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,712
By the way...

517
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,298
What?

518
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,468
Did you get in trouble at home?

519
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:40,972
I got my ass whooped.

520
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,684
What did she say?

521
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,437
Shut up. I'm in a good mood right now.

522
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,357
Can you be here right now?

523
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,819
Your mom may get the wrong idea again.

524
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,322
What wrong idea?

525
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,243
Well, that you and I are...

526
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,580
What? Having sex?

527
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:06,706
Jeez!

528
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,624
What?

529
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,044
How can you say that so easily?

530
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,005
THE FAN REVIEW
FIVE STARS, EXCELLENT!

531
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,511
Jeez.

532
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,916
Hey.

533
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:51,751
Good night.

534
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,490
Gosh.

535
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,700
Here, take one.

536
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,119
Let's root out school violence!

537
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,330
Hey, where are you going?

538
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,331
Go inside, come on.

539
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,749
Straighten your tie.

540
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,375
Is school violence okay or not?

541
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,626
Good morning.

542
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,712
Is school violence okay or not?

543
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,255
It's not, okay? Give me five.

544
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,798
High five.

545
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,634
Is school violence okay or not?

546
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,893
They haven't been here for a while.
They're at it again, shit.

547
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,396
I know. Why are the cops here
first thing in the morning?

548
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,898
All of a sudden. So annoying.

549
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,816
-What?
-SPO's here.

550
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,276
-Where?
-Front gate.

551
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,319
Didn't you see?

552
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,863
No, I smoked and came through the hole.

553
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,949
We were going to cut first period,
but we had to come back.

554
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,744
My heart almost stopped
when I saw the cop in the costume.

555
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,287
You didn't get caught?

556
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:36,374
I was almost caught
with smokes in my pocket.

557
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,001
Why do you carry them around?

558
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,253
Just leave them here like I do.

559
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,255
-Where would I leave them?
-In your locker.

560
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,091
You're fucked if they check you.

561
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,551
You never see
what's right under your nose.

562
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,470
Why are you saying a proverb?

563
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,305
Like you're so smart.

564
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,392
Shit.

565
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,644
What the fuck--

566
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,562
Sorry.

567
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:05,903
Hey.

568
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,035
-You keep it.
-What?

569
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,301
Hey.

570
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,096
-What was that?
-What?

571
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,307
The cops at the front gate.

572
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,476
-The SPO?
-SPO?

573
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,688
-What's that?
-S-P-O. Haven't you seen them before?

574
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:44,150
-What is that?
-They're cops in charge of schools.

575
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,611
They don't do anything anyway.
Don't freak out.

576
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:53,367
-I thought my head would explode.
-Naeun!

577
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,785
-Did you finish it?
-I did.

578
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,871
My intelligence is capped out right now.

579
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,456
-Hey.
-I don't want to look at it.

580
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,332
MATCHED 3 TIMES
NOT ON BLACKLIST, AGE 43

581
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,250
MINJU: OKAY

582
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,169
UNCLE: WHERE ARE YOU?
MINJU: DAEJUNG-DONG

583
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,798
-Hello.
-Hi.

584
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,678
Hey, Minhee.

585
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,764
Why didn't you take my call yesterday?

586
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,392
I was busy.

587
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,019
I'm sure you were.

588
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,396
Go to the counseling office during lunch.

589
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,690
-Hello, Mr. Cho.
-Hi.

590
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,525
Don't sneak away.

591
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,987
You're counseling me again?

592
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,323
No, it's not me this time.

593
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:51,842
So...

594
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,428
It went well last night.

595
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,139
What?

596
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,309
That guy last night.

597
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,940
You said you don't talk about work
at school.

598
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,526
Well, if it's secretly here and there...

599
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,241
Oh, right.

600
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:22,373
I decided to join your club.
Social Issues Research Club.

601
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,332
And?

602
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,253
Well, I'm just saying.

603
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,589
Social Issues Research Club!
Yes, the social issues are important.

604
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,299
Yes, of course they are.

605
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:35,844
Hey, are you two the only members
of that club?

606
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:37,680
That's right.

607
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,392
No wonder.
Well, I thought... It's kind of...

608
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,481
I ask because I'm sincerely curious.

609
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,857
What do you do at your club?

610
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,486
We discuss things
in a crazy fucking formal manner.

611
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,114
-And counsel kids.
-Counsel?

612
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,200
Hey, do kids actually go for that?

613
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:03,372
Mentally-challenged kids like you
need counseling.

614
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,127
Shit, you hit a bone.

615
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,383
Hey. Why is your girl so mean to me?

616
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,516
Hey, Gyuri. Did you have lunch?

617
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:24,560
Give me that.

618
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,316
Why didn't you wake me up?

619
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,193
Are you nuts?
We can't come to school together.

620
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,865
-Did you resolve everything?
-Resolve what?

621
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,867
Your fight with your mom.

622
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,287
I don't fight with those people.

623
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,874
How come?

624
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,669
Because I'd lose big time right now.

625
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,719
-What was that earlier?
-What? What do you mean?

626
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,640
What did Minhee give you earlier?

627
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,061
Oh, that. I don't know. It was just a cap.

628
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,647
-A cap?
-Yes.

629
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,773
What cap?

630
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,691
I don't know, just a cap.

631
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,778
Why did she give that to you?

632
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,992
Does she like you or something?

633
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,536
Come on.

634
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,372
No way.

635
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,458
You're smiling.

636
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,586
Is she your dream girl?

637
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,673
No. That's not it.

638
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,300
It would get so complicated
if you two date.

639
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,552
Is that considered an office romance?

640
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,637
COUNSELING OFFICE

641
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,514
Hey, she...

642
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,392
She really isn't my type.

643
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,144
She really, really isn't my type, but--

644
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,145
But? Who then?

645
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,441
Who?

646
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,591
POLICE

647
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,807
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

648
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,727
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.
