1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,757
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,927
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,597
Good morning.

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,099
Morning.

5
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,102
All right.

6
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,816
Here, for a perfect figure.

7
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,945
Here you are.

8
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,655
Ms. Gyuri Bae.

9
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,450
How are you up so early?

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,203
So you read the book I gave you, huh?

11
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,121
-What book?
-Good Morning Me.

12
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,874
It's a book about top CEOs' lifestyles.

13
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,042
It's a great book.

14
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,586
You should read it too.
It should be in her room.

15
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,712
That's right.

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,925
A person
who has a decent life doesn't sleep in.

17
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,596
Some kids never learn
even if they're taught.

18
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,265
But look at her.
She applies it right away.

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,351
Gyuri picks things up quickly.

20
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,394
Do you? Is that so?

21
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,650
There are even books
about how you should live these days.

22
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,776
What a great world.

23
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,987
Back when we were young,
we had to find the answers ourselves,

24
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,572
struggling a lot.

25
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,450
Yes?

26
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,249
There's a board meeting this Saturday.
You should come.

27
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,127
Me?

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,588
It's about time you start learning
how the company works.

29
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:14,676
You can't just merrily take over
the position of CEO, can you?

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,059
You can't just be a name
on the list of shareholders forever.

31
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,649
Gyuri?

32
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,985
Bang.

33
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,331
-If you keep acting--
-Bang.

34
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,722
Gyuri?

35
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,584
You'll come, right? Our future CEO?

36
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,809
EVERY DAY IS THE SAME
WHAT DOES INDEPENDENCE MEAN?

37
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,938
ENTER PASSWORD

38
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,195
INCORRECT PASSWORD
TWO ATTEMPTS REMAINING

39
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,373
You thief asshole.

40
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,963
JISOO: 1:00 P.M.?

41
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,048
GYURI: 1:00 P.M. AT FAMOUS LAMB
JISOO: SORRY

42
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,093
Gosh, sorry. Are you okay?

43
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,608
CAUGHT YOU!

44
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,155
That was a quick trip to the bathroom.

45
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,162
Are you an outcast?
Why are you always by yourself?

46
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,790
I'm not an outcast.

47
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,419
Now, you really sound like one.
Come. Let's go to the school store.

48
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,796
What is that rare scene?

49
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,673
-What?
-Over there.

50
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,591
What do you mean?

51
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,928
Why is a perfect girl like Gyuri
with such a loser?

52
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,263
"Loser"?

53
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,974
Fine, wait up.

54
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,855
Who is Malbok? Tell me. Who is Malbok?

55
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,901
What are you doing after school?

56
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,987
-Academy.
-What time?

57
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,864
Four o'clock.

58
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,574
What about work?

59
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:08,951
Work...

60
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,830
What did you say your part-time job was?

61
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,209
Well, this and that...

62
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,587
This and that, what?
What do you do? Convenience store?

63
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,757
Well, something like that.

64
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,429
Don't bullshit me.

65
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,183
-What?
-The time is off.

66
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,396
Don't convenience store jobs usually start
around four o'clock?

67
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,440
What job lets you work for only one hour?

68
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,070
I work the night shift, so...

69
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,364
I see.

70
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,617
Were you on the night shift
yesterday as well?

71
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:50,785
Yes.

72
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,540
Hey, Oji.

73
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,084
Yes?

74
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,676
If you worked the night shift yesterday,
you should be there now.

75
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,179
Hey, Oji.

76
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,890
-Yes?
-I want to do it too.

77
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,269
-What?
-The job you have.

78
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,606
You have time for the academy,
and it pays enough to pay the bills.

79
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,524
It's sweet-ass.

80
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,485
Hook me up too.

81
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,783
It's something you do alone,

82
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,077
so I can't really hook you up.

83
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,210
Fine.

84
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,547
So are you working today as well?

85
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:45,923
Yes.

86
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,009
I guess you can't, then.

87
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:50,720
Can't what?

88
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,854
I joined because I thought
it was a fake club,

89
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,064
but now I'm practically Mr. Cho's servant.

90
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,025
But I thought

91
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,444
it may be fun if you did it with me.

92
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,871
It's okay if you don't have the time.

93
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,254
I'm interested.

94
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,223
I'm interested in social issues
and stuff.

95
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,811
What was that? That was so random.

96
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,527
I want to join the club.

97
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,701
I'll invite you to the group chat.
Fill out the application later.

98
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,760
Doggo.

99
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,346
Doggo?

100
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,977
Bad doggo. Why aren't you answering?

101
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:35,051
ENTER PASSWORD

102
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,103
Let's see...

103
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,278
Go...

104
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,615
Go home, you brat.

105
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,661
Why are you always bumming in here?
Get a life.

106
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,955
-I know you like it.
-Bullshit.

107
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,458
Just give me the questionnaire.

108
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,710
-Are you done fixing it?
-It's on your desk.

109
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,676
Seriously.

110
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,388
You act as if you don't care,
but you always do a good job.

111
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,305
It's annoying.

112
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,099
Sure.

113
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,851
Did you do this with Jisoo?

114
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,270
Yes.

115
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,065
You two seem to hit it off.

116
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,567
You usually suck at working with others.

117
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,445
I guess.

118
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,488
What do you think?

119
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,908
Shall we take this chance
to accept a new member?

120
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,410
I already asked him to join.

121
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:43,786
What?

122
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,205
I already asked him to join the club.

123
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:47,289
You did?

124
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,167
-Did he say he would?
-Yes.

125
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,169
-He did?
-Yes.

126
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,174
Why are you brats suddenly
so enthusiastic?

127
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,096

Hey!

144
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,615
Maybe it was that bitch.

145
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,034
-What bitch?
-That angel bitch.

146
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,622
Are you crying?

147
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,124
Are you crying?

148
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,417
Cut it out, bitch.

00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,175
Hey!

00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,389
Hey, can I ask you something?

Minhee, this is for you.

160
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,983
Hey, it's on fire!

161
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,651
Put it out. Hurry!

162
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,320
Hey, put it out.

163
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,285
-What are you doing?
-What's going on?

164
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,162
I said, what are you doing?

165
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,414
What? What's the matter with you?

166
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,502
Look at that.

167
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,298
There you go!

168
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,145
Why aren't they coming? Why!

169
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,688
Why aren't they?

170
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,073
There, there. Is my honey mad?

171
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,033
Let's just go. It's our anniversary.

172
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,035
-Let's go, okay?
-Get the fuck off me!

173
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,625
Let's go.

174
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,669
Let's just go.

175
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,465
This fucking bastard...

176
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,467
I never liked him.

177
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,385
Hey!

178
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,762
What the hell are you doing?

179
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,266
Break it up. Right now.

180
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,566
Starting tomorrow, we're friends.

181
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,654
Those bastards.

182
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,280
Hey, Jisoo.

183
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,117
Jisoo, are you all right?

184
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,245
Those assholes.

185
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,414
Are you hurt?

186
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,832
Huh?

187
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,792
Hey.

188
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:43,377
Oh, no.

189
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,174
Hey, Jisoo.

190
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:51,844
Hey, Jisoo.

191
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,350
Come have dinner with your dad.

192
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,275
FIND MY PHONE

193
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,989
Those politician bastards...

194
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,615
Those pricks...

195
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,576
-Who ordered omelet rice?
-He did.

196
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,670
Were those kids from earlier
like the school bullies?

197
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:28,881
Are they?

198
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,177
Do you want me to teach them a lesson?

199
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,261
You'll lose.

200
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,348
Right, I can't beat them physically.
But you know,

201
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,017
the thing about fights is...

202
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,187
What game are you playing?

203
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,732
Come on. Don't be so cranky.

204
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,610
I know how to play mobile games too.

205
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:52,196
-What game is popular among kids these--
-Go ahead.

206
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,156
What do you mean?

207
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,867
You said you wanted to talk.
Make it quick and go.

208
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,789
After you finish eating.

209
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:06,752
Jisoo.

210
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,546
Do you want to live in Ulsan with me?

211
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,550
I can support you now. I make money.

212
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,802
Who believes you?

213
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,762
I will make money. I'm...

214
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,224
-I'm doing something like a business.
-What business?

215
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,309
Well, we...

216
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,728
The Internet... Damn it.

217
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,273
It's just some business.
It's hard to explain.

218
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,983
With whom? Uncle Gilsung?

219
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,531
Two gamblers doing business?

220
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,866
Gilsung quit gambling.

221
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,576
How many times has he quit?

222
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,121
He quit for real this time.

223
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,622
Hey, come here.

224
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,290
Come here.

225
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,503
Ulsan has great schools.
The kids are nice.

226
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,255
Look at your face.

227
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:55,884
Jisoo Oh.

228
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,513
Let me be your dad again.

229
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,223
I don't talk to Mom.

230
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,308
What do you mean?

231
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,811
you won't get money from Mom
even if you live with me

232
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:11,066
-You punk. When did I ask you that?
-Isn't that why you're here?

233
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,778
You want to be a dad
only when you're out of money.

234
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,282
Don't get me wrong!

235
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,875
Damn it.

236
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,257
I already told your homeroom teacher
you are transferring.

237
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,886
What?

238
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,014
The adults are done talking,
so just listen to me.

239
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:46,643
You have a sharp tongue,
just like your mom.

240
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,811
It's so annoying.

241
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,023
Seriously!

242
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,692
Why do you keep pulling this bullshit?

243
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,905
You and your temper.
I'm just trying to bond with you--

244
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,448
I'm doing fine by myself.

245
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,909
Why do you keep showing up
and ruining everything?

246
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,620
-Shit.
-What?

247
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,331
-You punk. I'm your dad.
-Oh, come on!

248
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,709
Never try to do anything for me.

249
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,086
Leave me alone.

250
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,547
You left home.
Stay out of my life for fuck's sake!

251
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,050
You brat... Hey, sit back down.

252
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,636
I said, sit down!

253
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,055
Hey, Jisoo Oh!

254
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,308
Where are you going? Come here. Hey...

255
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,559
I'm not leaving.

256
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,353

Who still loves you

260
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,235
And you know that too

261
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:22,739
You see me calling you every night

262
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,994
Even hearing
Your unfamiliar and cold voice

263
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,206
Which I'm not used to at all

264
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,752
Like a fool,
I still can't forget about you

265
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:36,920
Do you want more time?

266
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,017
I started seeing you
Knowing what would happen

267
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,396
I feel so bad for her

268
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,441
As each day passes...

269
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,735
Hey, Suji, Hyemin!

270
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,987
You traitors! Where are you going?

271
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,449
-Enough already.
-You said you'd stay up all night with me.

272
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,409
-I need to go.
-Don't you feel bad for me?

273
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,411
-Let's go.
-Come on! You can't leave!

274
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,079
Hey! Damn it.

ACCEPT THE REQUEST?

00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,735
Look, when you see a bullet flying at you,

285
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,613
you should dodge.
You don't just stand there, you idiot.

286
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,323
It's hard to tell.

287
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,660
Use a headset.
This ass never focuses on the sound.

288
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,036
Headsets give me a headache.

289
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,497
I don't want to play with him.

290
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,749
-Me neither.
-Whatever. Don't.

291
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,418
Forget it. Let's call it quits.

292
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,087
You're so annoying. You make me sick.

293
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,634
Anyone!

294
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,515
Come in.

295
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,143
Come in.

296
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,482
Wait.

297
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,740
What are you doing?

298
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:16,950
Help.

00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,662
Help.

301
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,511
Excuse me.

302
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,598
Did you find a phone here?

303
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,141
What the hell?

304
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,247
What the hell?

305
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,999
CANNOT FIND CURRENT LOCATION

306
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,083
Shit!

307
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,975
Do you...

308
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,021
really need me

309
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,983
in this situation?

310
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,740
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

311
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,700
You will be charged after the connection.

312
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,121
No answer?

313
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,545
Shit. He's one mysterious man, isn't he?

314
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,382
Hey, Old Man.

315
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,426
Isn't it frustrating to work
with someone you've never seen?

316
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,678
Are you okay?

317
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,100
I've seen it happen before. That thing.

318
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,605
Old Man.

319
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,192
I'm hungry.

320
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,744
You said you've seen it happen before.

321
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,624
Where did you see someone act
batshit crazy? What were you doing?

322
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,587
It was during the war, right?
During a gunfight?

323
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,717
You used to be
a soldier or a gangster, right?

324
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,719
You were in that kind of business,
right?

325
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,762
I'm sure you've stabbed
quite a few people.

326
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,230
What did you do before you got old?

327
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,899
To be completely honest,

328
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,068
I'm sure you didn't work in some office.

329
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:04,492
A panic attack, that's what it's called.

330
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:10,832
Are you...

331
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,295
going to keep doing this job?

332
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,638
I'm not crazy.

333
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,432
I can do it.

334
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,641
Without this,

335
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,480
I'm nothing.

336
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:40,945
Don't tell Uncle.

337
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,866
Stop writing!

338
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,666

Hello, sir.

348
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,251
We have a little problem.

349
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:05,256
Therefore, we're not accepting
any protection or brokering requests.

350
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,383
Just so that you know.

351
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,260
But you accepted it.

352
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,138
A protection request.

353
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,600
I did?

354
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,810
I was at the scene just now.

355
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,397
Didn't you approve the request yourself?

356
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,315
I did?

357
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,113
It's me.

358
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,867
It's my number.

359
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,078
By any chance,

360
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,164
have you lost your phone?

361
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,417
Please hold.

00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,058

00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,237
Thank you for calling, but--

364
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,155
What is your monthly income?

365
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,037
How many ladies in total?

366
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,336
-Not sure what you're talking--
-Is the man called Mr. Lee

367
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:26,796
just a puppet boss?

368
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:30,883
I have no idea what you're talking about.

369
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,177
Are you a student at Kyewang High School?

370
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,518
NEW MESSAGE FROM UNCLE-OLD

371
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,811
UNCLE'S PHONE

372
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,190
How do you deal with a blackmailer
like me?

373
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,901
Well... I know it's late
and I'm really sorry,

374
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:52,071
but can I go get my phone now?

375
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:53,489
Oh, right.

376
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,242
Is this for real?

377
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,281
You'll get yourself killed.

378
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,702
So it was true.

379
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,541
Once I leak this phone, you're doomed.

380
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,004
You'd better bring it back
before you regret it.

381
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,800
Who the hell are you?
Who the fuck are you, you asshole!

382
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,927
How far will you go
to get this phone back?

383
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,763
You have no idea.

384
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,807
Then say, "Bow-wow."

385
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:05,520
-What?
-Say, "Bow-wow."

386
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,982
Like a dog, bow-wow.

387
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,277
Like a dog, bow-wow.

388
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,738
-Like a dog, bow-wow.
-What a freak.

389
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,747
Whoever you are, stop talking bullshit
and give me my phone.

390
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,832
I can't.

391
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:29,585
Fine.

392
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:31,587
Then bye.

393
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,048
Hey, don't hang up. Hey!

394
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,518
UNCLE'S PHONE

395
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:49,981
Hey, all right. Don't hang up!

396
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,732
Hello?

397
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,999
Hey, don't... I said don't hang up!

398
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,292
Don't hang up!

399
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,690
I'll be in touch.

400
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,608
Hey!

401
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,322
Shit.

402
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,708
-Yohan Kim.
-Here.

403
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,585
-Byoungho Kang.
-Here.

404
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,629
-Taewoo Im.
-Here!

405
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,424
There's one more freak here.

406
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,134
Jisoo Oh.

407
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,095
Keep it down, will you?

408
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,014
Jisoo Oh.

409
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:06,807
Is Jisoo not here?

410
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,143
No, he's not here.

411
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,396
What? Has he ever been absent?

412
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,847
Just hide in there, Jisoo. Don't come out.

413
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,814
No, you can't.

414
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,316
Run away, Jisoo.

415
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,028
Just hide in there, Jisoo. Don't come out!

416
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,114
No, you just can't.

417
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,448
You have to run!

418
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,975
Hey, Oji!

419
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,562
Oji, open the door.

420
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,315
Hey!

421
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,030
Why do you always look like shit?

422
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,661
Mr. Cho asked me to check
whether or not you're alive.

423
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,746
Wait.

424
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,291
I'm not feeling well.

425
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,293
I can see that.

426
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,175
Hey, what are you doing?

427
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,302
-What?
-But...

428
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,056
You want me to just leave?
When I came all the way here?

429
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,644
Well... I'm in the middle
of something important right now.

430
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,982
You know
your place is fucking far away, right?

431
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,788
Hey, wait!

432
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,500
Fine, then...

433
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,003
Give me a moment.

434
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,046
Just a second, okay?

435
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,408
This place is fucking filthy.

436
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,495
It's usually not, but...

437
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,551
THE PRINCIPLES OF MATHEMATICS

438
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,645
Hey.

439
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,731
Oh, no.

440
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,443
Why would you put
something like this here?

441
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,111
Gosh.

442
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,155
Leave it. I'll do it.

443
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,786
Let me.

444
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,804
How do you feel?

445
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,472
I don't think it's hurt.

446
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,850
I'm talking about you, idiot.

447
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,395
-What?
-You said you were sick.

448
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,646
Right.

449
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,731
I'm still not so well.

450
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,862
Look.

451
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,491
An evil pimp who sells women
of all ages, including minors,

452
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,036
is crazy about a teeny-tiny crustacean.

453
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,958
-What?
-Nothing.

454
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,090
Did they give birth to you?

455
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,887
Who do you like better, Mom or Dad?

456
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,352
Same for me.

457
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,356
I knew you would like it.

458
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,027
What is this?

459
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,780
Arabian double truffle
quadruple mocha chocolate.

460
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,408
Oh, right.

461
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,951
There's no such thing.

462
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,244
It's just hot chocolate.

463
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:25,871
I see.

464
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,836
Are you going somewhere?

465
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:34,880
What?

466
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,091
What's with the bag in there?

467
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,555
Well...

468
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,265
That's...

469
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,352
Ulsan.

470
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,688
What's in Ulsan?

471
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:53,023
-My dad.
-You're going to your dad?

472
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,777
Why?

473
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:02,700
Just to see him and catch up.

474
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,159
But why?

475
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,579
Because he's family.

476
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,252
When are you coming back?

477
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,003
Well...

478
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,174
I won't go to school for a while.

479
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,593
Why not?

480
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,512
I have a situation. There's a problem.

481
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,683
What problem?

482
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,352
Just something.

483
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,609
What is it? Is it so bad
that you have to leave for good?

484
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,739
I don't know.

485
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,827
I'm just so exhausted.

486
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:57,504
I don't think I can join the club.

487
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,485
-I need to use the restroom.
-Oh, the restroom...

488
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,107
-Hello?
-Hi.

489
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,905
What do you need? Money?
Tell me how much you want.

490
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,075
-I don't need money.
-Come on.

491
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,371
Then why are you doing this?

492
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,750
The phone.

493
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:18,627
Do you want it?

494
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,302
No?

495
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,472
Give it back.

496
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:35,227
Say "Please."

497
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,527
Please.

498
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,699
Bark.

499
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,800
Woof.

500
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,554
Woof, woof.

501
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,564
Jaws Tteokbokki in front of the school.

502
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,399
You got 30 minutes.

503
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,902
Hey.

504
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,076
Well...

505
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:34,870
Gyuri.

506
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,918
Look. Sorry, but I really need to go.

507
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,963
-Okay, I'm almost done. Wait.
-No, that's not what I mean.

508
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:48,133
Something urgent came up,
so I need to go out.

509
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,217
Again?

510
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,511
Where are you going this time?

511
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,682
I'm really sorry, but... please leave now.

512
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,561
But it's going to take a while.
My stomach hurts.

513
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,481
Then I'll go first.

514
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,733
Please close the door when you leave.

515
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,404
Oh, and thanks for the mocha choco thing.

516
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,238
DID YOU LOSE YOUR PHONE?

517
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,156
CANNOT FIND CURRENT LOCATION

518
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:55,886
Damn it.

519
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,348
I don't know.

520
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:01,808
I'm just so exhausted.

521
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,529
Shit.

522
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,170
It's just that no one's ever told me
those things before.

523
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,219
It's been a while.

524
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,309
Goodness, this punk...

525
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,855
I know he lives on his own, but still...

526
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:32,440
why does a young boy's room get
old-man stink?

527
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,407
Oh, boy.

528
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,994
Gosh.

529
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,706
Shit.

530
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,791
This will not do.

531
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,501
The vacuum cleaner.

532
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,628
There should be one.

533
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:02,053
Gosh, this punk.

534
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,225
Goodness, seriously.

535
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,937
Gosh, it stinks in here.

536
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,480
Jeez.

537
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,196
And he acted like he wouldn't come.

538
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,573
Oh, boy.

539
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,826
Shit.

540
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,270
Wow, shit.

541
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,272
Look at this...

542
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,742
Shit.

543
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,916
That freak.

544
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:20,382
God, shit!

545
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,480
Ouch! Damn it.

546
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,101
Sorry.

547
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,067
Kyewang High School?

548
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,411
What the...

549
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,414
What the hell? Get off me!

550
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,625
Hey! Who are you?

551
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:44,591
Stop right there!

552
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,093
Hey, your phone!

553
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:49,304
LOCATION CONFIRMED

554
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,473
FIND MY PHONE

555
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,725
MY HOME

556
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,477
Take me back to where I got in.

557
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,736
That fucking asshole!

558
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,624
Hey, your phone!

559
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,334
What the hell?

560
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,131
-Get off me.
-Give it back!

561
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:27,884
-Let go.
-Give it back!

562
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,720
Damn it.

563
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,024
Hey, look.

564
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,276
I managed to grab this for you.

565
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,527
It's yours, right?

566
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,762
It was you?

567
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,527
Was it you all along?

568
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:44,831
I thought you...

569
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,017
I...

570
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:10,023
I thought you...

571
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,656
That's a half times one, so that's a half.

572
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:02,450
Sine of 60 degrees

573
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,913
equals root three over two.
Root three over two.

574
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,206
And then--

575
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,589
Who is coming in now?

576
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,345
Guys,

577
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,472
is this cool or not cool?

578
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,557
Not cool, sir.

579
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:27,975
Right.

580
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,769
Halibut!

581
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,020
Swim, you asshole.

582
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:31,938
Halibut!

583
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,735
Halibut, get your ass out of here.

584
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,488
Kwakki, Minhee didn't come today...

585
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,447
Are you okay?

586
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,409
You came to school today, my friend.

587
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,411
Come here.

588
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,662
Kang Bbang.

589
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,915
-Yes, Dominus!
-You can go home. Bye.

590
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:52,667
What?

591
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,504
You can just go home today, you moron.

592
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,305
I'll fire him.

593
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:10,935
Starting today, you're replacing him.

594
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,481
We decided to be friends yesterday,
remember?

595
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,943
Are we or not?

596
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,653
Are we or not?

597
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,655
Hey.

598
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:24,741
Hey.

599
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,546
What's going on?

600
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,256
Sorry?

601
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,175
Hey.

602
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:43,760
I said, what's going on?

603
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,185
Are you two close?

604
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,146
Why are you being nosy?

605
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,482
Are you two close?

606
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:00,943
We're dating.

607
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,537
Don't mess with him.

608
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:13,915
Don't mess with Jisoo.

609
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,500
Damn, this is crazy.

610
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,834
Shit!

611
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:20,296
-Hey, wait. I mean...
-She was really cool just now.

612
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:24,008
-She's just bullshitting.
-They must be really dating.

613
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:25,510
Follow me.

614
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:28,137
Don't you need your phone back?

615
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,809
Damn it. I can't hit one fucking ball.

616
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:35,186
Hey.

617
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:37,730
Hey!

618
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,320
Give it back.

619
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:47,949
-Gosh, I told you to wait.
-You said I'd get it if I came with you.

620
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,492
So that you'll just leave?

621
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,078
What the hell are you doing?

622
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,121
Isn't it obvious? I'm playing baseball.

623
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:56,874
Try it.

624
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,429
I won't go out with you.

625
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,308
I won't, either. I'm not crazy.

626
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:16,018
Then why did you say that?

627
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,312
So I can hang out with you.

628
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,481
Why would I hang out with you?
Are you crazy?

629
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,444
-Hanging out with me is only good for you.
-Why is it good for me?

630
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,238
Don't you see you ruined everything?

631
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:31,075
Fuck. Hey.

632
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,412
I'm done now, thanks to you.

633
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:40,167
I lost all the money I saved up
because of you.

634
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,503
You don't understand, do you?

635
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,716
Of course I don't know anything
about your sad story.

636
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,759
My family is fucking rich.

637
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,761
It was hard to make the money!

638
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:54,599
Why don't you start saving again
through your business?

639
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,434
That's going to take forever!

640
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,978
I need to start preparing for the CSAT
next year.

641
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,772
Fuck this!

642
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:05,109
Hey, Baeggyul!

643
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:08,988
-Baeggyul!
-What are you doing?

644
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:09,906
Long time no see.

645
01:05:11,198 --> 01:05:13,367
-You're late.
-We had to work out.

646
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:14,327
Do you want to die?

647
01:05:14,827 --> 01:05:17,246
You're getting prettier and prettier, huh?

648
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,540
My gosh.

649
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,752
-Who is that?
-A friend from school.

650
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:25,046
-A friend from school?
-Hey.

651
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,091
Nice to meet you.

652
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,261
Look at him glaring.

653
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:35,348
He's scary.

654
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,766
Hey, we need nicknames.

655
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:39,226
-Baeggyul, what's yours?
-Drogba.

656
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,228
-Drog...
-It suits you.

657
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,230
-Okay, Drogba.
-It perfectly suits her.

658
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:46,025
Hey, we need to pick teams.
Let's pick teams.

659
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,610
-Let's do up or down.
-Up or down.

660
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:48,569
Up or down.

661
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,196
Up or down.

662
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:52,531
Hey, haven't we met before?

663
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,284
I've seen him somewhere.

664
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,079
You guys should cut that
if you lose the game.

665
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,128
Hey.

666
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,714
He's talking to you. Answer him.

667
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,177
-We'll talk after the game.
-Way to go!

668
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:14,512
Baeggyul!

669
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:35,032
All right.

670
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,284
-Okay.
-Hey.

671
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:41,998
Hey.

672
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:43,708
What?

673
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,002
What do you think of them?
Aren't they good?

674
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:48,462
Who gives a shit?

675
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:51,465
Hey.

676
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:53,843
Give me my phone.

677
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:55,428
You don't seem to get it.

678
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:00,474
You need more people to work, don't you?

679
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,644
To save that much money within the year.

680
01:07:05,479 --> 01:07:06,772
So take a good look.

681
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,658
What do you say?

682
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,299
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

683
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,761
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.
