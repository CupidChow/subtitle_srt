1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,216
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,011
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,581
Are you leaving without eating?

4
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,044
What am I supposed to do with that?

5
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,924
You take care of it.

6
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,428
I mean the kid inside, you punk.

7
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,767
No need to keep her around too long.

8
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,562
Feed her lunch and send her away.

9
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:03,772
Seriously.

10
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,942
Just get dementia or something.

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,951
It's because I'm a coward.

12
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,458
Gosh!

13
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,148
Let's have...

14
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,152
dinner later or something.

15
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,147
Do you know this person? Do you?

16
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,649
Hey, it's the master from before.

17
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,609
Right. That fucking master.

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,863
-The master!
-He was awesome.

19
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,615
Is he your boss or something?

20
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,326
Anyone who fights that well is our boss.

21
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,537
Did you see him pound on those guys?

22
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,456
-No weaving, just pounding.
-Sit down, you idiot.

23
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,834
Hey, what's this? He's wrecked.

24
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,377
-Is he dead?
-No way.

25
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,629
-He looks pretty dead.
-He really is.

26
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,090
He's totally dead.

27
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:55,967
Attention!

28
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,136
Sit.

29
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,181
Stop smirking!

30
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,062
Spit out your gum.

31
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,401
Do you want to end your life here?

32
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,282
Do you? Should I lock you up
for attempted murder and assault?

33
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,370
Look carefully at the photo
and give your statements properly.

34
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,414
Kitae Kwak.

35
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,584
We've met before, right?

36
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,298
Who told you to go there
and wreck the place?

37
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,719
Was it him?

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,223
You'll be here
until you tell us everything you know.

39
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,519
Your husband was involved
in sex trafficking,

40
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,981
gang violence, and murder.
And you knew nothing?

41
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,317
We're not legally married.

42
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,818
What?

43
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,780
He's not my husband.

44
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,292
This is Daeyeol Ryu's, right?

45
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:16,214
This has all the details
of the sex trafficking that he oversaw.

46
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,426
There were dozens every day.
How could you not know anything?

47
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,221
You even watched the shop
during the day for him.

48
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,227
You have to know him.

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,272
I don't know this old man.
I've never seen him before!

50
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,274
Then why did you go wreck the place?

51
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,277
Actually, why did we go there?

52
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,238
These punks.

53
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,156
Spill it.

54
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,785
Wangchul hired you to do this, right?

55
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,036
What?

56
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,872
-Hired?
-Tell us.

57
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,084
How much did you get paid
to wreck the karaoke place?

58
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,628
-What is he talking about?
-Paid? Money?

59
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,048
-Did you get money for that?
-Fuck. What money?

60
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,218
-It's news to me.
-Fuck. What's going on?

61
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,554
Did Kwakki pocket it all himself?

62
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,308
-Do you know?
-How the hell would I know?

63
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,894
Mijung Cho!

64
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,146
You punks.

65
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,232
You know something, don't you?

66
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,572
You need to tell us.

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,326
-Son of a bitch.
-What?

68
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,369
I knew it.

69
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,291
He was busy answering calls
from bitches whenever it got dark.

70
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:39,213
Mister. I never expected anything
from that bastard Daeyeol.

71
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,508
I didn't want to know
what shit he did at night,

72
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,597
if he killed people or sold people,
as long as I got my money.

73
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,808
Mister, can I have a smoke?

74
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,770
Tell me what you know.
Then I'll let you smoke.

75
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,980
Fuck! No one made me do anything!

76
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,400
I went on my own.

77
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,069
No one paid me!

78
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:01,986
You punk!

79
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,488
Keep it down.

80
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:08,159
How many times must I repeat myself?
Who is he? I don't know him.

81
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,287
Fuck. Why are you accusing us?

82
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,081
Kitae Kwak .

83
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,543
What is it? Why did you go there?

84
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,797
-Why did we?
-Say it.

85
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,423
-What is it?
-Come on, tell us.

86
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,884
-Tell us.
-We went for Minhee, assholes.

87
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,719
Fuck. Happy now?

88
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,057
-Minhee?
-Minhee Seo?

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,601
What do you mean?

90
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,920
ALPHAGO

91
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,553
What are you doing?

92
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:10,847
-Hey.
-Come on!

93
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,977
CHEONHO-DONG ASSAULT CASE

94
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,019
Why check the news?

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,065
Aren't you worried about Mr. Lee?

96
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,318
I can't contact him. This is the only way.

97
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,154
How would it be on the news already?

98
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,614
You heard what he said.

99
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,118
He meant he's quitting.

100
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,997
What will you do?

101
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,419
-About what? What will I do about what?
-Mr. Lee's replacement.

102
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,298
How much money do we have left?

103
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,971
You still want to do this crap?

104
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,517
Seriously? Even after this mess?

105
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,521
Aren't you scared?

106
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,443
How could you...
Are you really not scared?

107
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,154
Why should I be?

108
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,656
Daeyeol Ryu is now Uncle.

109
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,661
He can't tell the cops anything.
He has no proof.

110
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,663
That's not what... Hey!

111
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:18,998
What?

112
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,334
We almost died once a day recently.

113
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,921
How do you lack all sense of reality?

114
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,173
Aren't you scared?

115
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,051
-Of what?
-Of dying!

116
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,636
Of course, I'm scared!

117
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,352
Can't you see

118
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,729
why this happened?

119
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,733
I admit it.

120
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,152
I screwed up trying to grow the business.

121
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,863
Trying to grow the business isn't
the problem. You are!

122
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,950
You and me! We are the problem!

123
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,494
Got it?

124
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:58,871
This is because we're together.

125
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,042
It's insanely dangerous

126
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,628
if you and I stay together.

127
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:06,879
Don't you get it?

128
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,849
Forget it.

129
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:27,984
Go home.

130
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,112
Go and live.

131
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,283
At least you can live.

132
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,869
Your family's rich.

133
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,005
First, calm down.

134
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,174
Then let's calculate our losses.

135
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,595
Let's figure out exactly what we lost.

136
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,349
First, we lost Mr. Lee.

137
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,851
Taerim Lee left.

138
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,313
-All the girls we had--
-Listen to me, will you?

139
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,273
It's because I can't just live!

140
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,612
I can't live...

141
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,196
there.

142
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,890
Then do it by yourself.

143
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,022
Here.

144
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,895
What was his name again?

145
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,275
Wangchul. Wangchul Lee.

146
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,783
You told me
the business took a break for a while.

147
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,287
That was probably because of money.

148
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,834
That's probably when he
and Uncle began to have conflicts.

149
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,837
Uncle...

150
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:58,008
didn't call this morning, right?

151
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,930
About your boyfriend, Kitae?

152
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,184
Did he not know Wangchul Lee at all?

153
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,439
Regardless...

154
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,528
he died, right?

155
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,498
Then...

156
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:32,752
it's over now.

157
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,638
It's over, right?

158
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,078
Right?

159
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,173
Are you okay?

160
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,097
-Wanna go buy snacks later?
-Are you buying?

161
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,890
Isn't that fucking insane?

162
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:13,269
-Two people died or something.
-What?

163
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,897
-Did Kwakki's crew commit murder, too?
-No, they didn't kill them.

164
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,483
I heard from kids in my class
that a gang--

165
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,277
Hey, pipe down.

166
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,238
Taewoo Lim. Quiet.

167
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,949
Why are you still here?

168
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:27,908
Sorry.

169
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,368
-Get to your class.
-Yes, Sir.

170
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,122
Wake him up.

171
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,794
Let's begin our morning homeroom.

172
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,712
Good morning.

173
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,881
Good morning.

174
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,302
Well...

175
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,598
It looks like you've heard
the news already, right?

176
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,433
Yes.

177
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,352
You punks are so quick.

178
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,772
Yesterday,

179
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,526
some of our students were involved
in an unfortunate incident.

180
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,072
Anyway, the mood
at school is pure hell right now.

181
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,575
-You know that, right?
-Yes.

182
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,494
Please don't spread rumors

183
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,039
about the kids involved,

184
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,500
or get excited and post on social media,

185
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,586
or anything like that.

186
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,714
-Understood?
-Yes.

187
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,134
Okay. It is what it is.

188
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,181
-Gosh. Minhee's here.
-Talk about being shameless.

189
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,016
Is she insane or what?

190
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,852
-So many kids did shit because of her...
-Stay away from her.

191
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,647
Don't you smell something foul?

192
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,066
Listen.

193
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,693
It is what it is,

194
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,781
but we have the mock college entrance exam
coming up.

195
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,368
Shit. So fucking gross.

196
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,577
Gosh, it stinks.

197
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,121
-We should use the second-floor bathroom.
-Why?

198
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,540
Because we don't get "compensated"
on this floor?

199
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,334
It sucks here. Fuck.

200
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,044
Fuck. I'm speechless.

201
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,965
What are you looking at, bitch?
What are you looking at?

202
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,467
-Don't touch her. You'll catch something.
-Disgusting.

203
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,844
Hey. Don't you have anything to say?

204
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,763
Anything to say?

205
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,473
-Say something.
-Hey!

206
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,225
What the fuck?

207
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,770
The dean...

208
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,065
-Damn it.
-What are you doing?

209
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,149
Hey, let's go.

210
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,031
Did you eat?

211
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,618
If you didn't eat yet, neither did I.
So...

212
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,330
What's for lunch today?
Right, it was sausages and vegetables.

213
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,210
Did you tell them...

214
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,295
about your job?

215
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,717
You shouldn't have.

216
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,806
You're okay, right?

217
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,809
Should I be excited in this situation?

218
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,312
Hey, who the hell are you?

219
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,316
What are you?

220
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,402
Are you my lawyer?

221
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:10,738
No.

222
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,407
So why do you keep trying to shut me up?

223
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,325
It's because if you tell,

224
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,202
things will--

225
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,120
Please!

226
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,040
Can you please shut up?

227
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,377
Do you know what happened to me
because of you?

228
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,049
People died.

229
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,637
Two people died.
Do you know who one of them is?

230
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:39,683
Who?

231
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:45,064
If you hadn't stuck your big nose in
and told me to keep my mouth shut,

232
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,025
that busybody old man...

233
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,781
would've still been alive.

234
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,344
What do you mean?

235
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,516
Everything sounds like fucking bullshit,
right?

236
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,188
But it's true. He died.

237
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:49,920
So Heaven Entertainment's
legal team approved it, right?

238
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,465
Why is it so stuffy in here?

239
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,929
Don't change your tune
out of the blue later, okay?

240
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,430
You'll hurt my feelings.

241
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,519
Tell Mr. Choi not to be too submissive

242
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,312
regarding the kids' training.

243
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,356
Why is she here?

244
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,652
Okay. Keep me posted.

245
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,201
Gyuri, do you have something to say?
We're extremely tired.

246
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,621
Can you sit for a minute?

247
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,418
Nickname, The Fan.

248
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:35,090
We will never pressure you to do anything
against your will.

249
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,551
We will never demand compensation

250
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,303
resulting therefrom.

251
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,722
However, since the client
you were matched with

252
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,682
is still waiting for you,

253
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,477
we would appreciate it
if you'd make your decision now.

254
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,355
Should I tell the client to leave?

255
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,359
No.

256
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,028
I'll do it.

257
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:06,163
That was Taerim accepting an offer
for prostitution.

258
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,080
Why you...

259
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,048
Gyuri. You've got some explaining to do.

260
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,592
One.

261
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,136
Where did this come from?

262
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,140
Two. Why do you have this?

263
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,560
This is all I'll tell you.
I've explained plenty.

264
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,230
-What?
-Gyuri Bae.

265
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,399
This is no time for egos.

266
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,276
Answer us!

267
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,197
If this goes viral, Mr. Choi's
investment will go down the drain, right?

268
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,667
What's the maximum you can transfer?
You two combined?

269
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,396
You're so kind, you know that?

270
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:58,859
-Can you get into college like this?
-Is it really bad?

271
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,654
Let's see.

272
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,033
First, two dead.

273
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,659
Several injured.

274
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,328
One PTSD.

275
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,455
One ostracized from society.

276
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,083
And you kept whining
to the only friend you had

277
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,502
and eventually cut ties with her.

278
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,760
What level am I in then?

279
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,056
-Does that even matter right now?
-Of course.

280
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,394
The body...

281
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,814
changed.

282
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,025
Sorry?

283
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,100
Let's...

284
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,979
never meet again.

285
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,843
GYURI BAE

286
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,733
Are you still feeling like shit?

287
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,411
What do you want?

288
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,499
Why weren't you at school?

289
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,462
Did you check the sofa
in the counseling office?

290
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:25,505
No.

291
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,882
Check it.

292
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:29,509
Fine.

293
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,103
GYURI BAE SENT A PHOTO

294
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,574
FROM INCHEON TO SYDNEY

295
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,292
When will you be back?

296
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,712
It's a one-way ticket.

297
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,340
How did you afford it?

298
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,343
I got the money somehow.

299
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,763
Thanks for this.

300
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,696
I randomly picked a country
on the other side of the globe.

301
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:38,411
I'm going to roam around the country
until I leave.

302
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,542
I'll think about my next step
once I get there.

303
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,962
Shall I bring you along?

304
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,801
Want to go too?

305
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,142
You have nothing left here anyway.

306
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,401
Do you want to just leave?

307
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,489
No one there knows us.

308
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:32,799
Like, we'll pick fruit in an orchard
all day long and stuff?

309
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,760
Sure, if you want.

310
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:42,809
And look at kangaroos and koalas
and stuff?

311
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,563
Sure, if you want.

312
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:49,649
Just the two of us?

313
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,072
Minus the dangerous stuff.

314
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:02,621
Sounds nice.

315
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,754
That sounds nice.

316
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,562
Have a safe trip.

317
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,696
Do you hate me that much?

318
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,576
That's not it.

319
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,414
Then what?

320
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,513
See you tomorrow. Bye.

321
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,232
How long have you been standing there?

322
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:56,943
What?

323
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,071
Did you find anything?

324
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,407
No.

325
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,829
Gosh, it's a closed case.

326
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,874
Why are you still investigating it?

327
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,709
Well...

328
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,920
The timing is odd.

329
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,048
Timing?

330
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,972
I just don't think
Wangchul Lee brought those kids.

331
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,815
Well... why not?

332
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,985
Well...

333
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,821
that kid Kitae Kwak, Minhee's boyfriend.

334
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:44,157
You saw his phone.

335
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,702
Daeyeol Ryu really did send him
her picture,

336
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,120
and told him to come.

337
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,289
That means he called the kids over.

338
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,750
Then the kids went there
and wrecked the place.

339
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,667
So what?

340
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,085
But...

341
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,298
it happened to be at the same time
that Wangchul Lee attacked Daeyeol Ryu.

342
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,717
Isn't the timing too perfect?

343
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,306
Gosh.

344
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,643
Anyway,

345
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,229
let's go home.

346
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,814
Go home and wash up.

347
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,235
Come on. Go home.

348
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,321
Go first.

349
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,198
I'll leave in a little bit.

350
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,200
Seriously. Haegyong.

351
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,495
How long will you do someone else's work?

352
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,455
Our case files are piling up.

353
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:37,085
Well, Kyewang High School's kids
are involved--

354
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:41,130
That's exactly why
our case files are piling up.

355
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,634
Everyone's suffering from dealing
with the teachers and parents.

356
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,886
You know that, don't you?

357
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,099
Well...

358
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,394
Give these back.

359
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,273
Go home and rest,

360
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,817
and go to the school tomorrow.

361
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,610
My goodness.

362
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,671
STUDENT ID, MINHEE SEO

363
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:24,340
KYEWANG HIGH SCHOOL

364
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,751
Areung is within range.

365
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,923
Areung is within range.

366
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,258
TRACK YOUR PET

367
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,594
Areung is within range.

368
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,555
Tracking is complete.

369
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,751
Hello.

370
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,798
COUNSELING OFFICE

371
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,222
-What are you doing?
-Oh, well...

372
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,058
My back was hurting.

373
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,726
You're such a weirdo.

374
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,896
-What are you doing here?
-Well, I...

375
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:06,359
Well, I left something here. My phone.

376
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,821
Don't skip class.
Go back to your classroom.

377
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,781
Lunch is almost over.

378
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,260
Hey, Oji.

379
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,638
Why isn't Baeggyul coming to school?

380
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,099
Have you heard anything?

381
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,441
Do you feel sick?

382
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,696
My gosh. Hey, come here.

383
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,908
Are you all right?

384
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,245
Mr. Cho.

385
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,581
Yes? What is it?

386
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,126
Remember what you said before?

387
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,587
What did I say?

388
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,424
You know, that you couldn't stand me.

389
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,051
What?

390
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:15,845
You know...

391
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,266
You said I keep everything inside
and endure it alone.

392
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,893
Oh.

393
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,230
It was just a figure of speech.

394
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,110
Why are you bringing that up?

395
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,280
Have you ever done that?

396
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,200
Enduring something?

397
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,914
Feeling like you're going to explode,

398
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,834
but enduring it anyway...

399
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,670
all alone.

400
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,094
I have.

401
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,680
What happened in the end?

402
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,600
I eventually exploded.

403
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,649
You have entered the building.

404
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,567
Stop it!

405
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,402
-I told you to stop!
-Gosh.

406
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:16,197
Your pet's current location,
Kyewang High School.

407
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,205
Wrong direction.

408
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,541
Recalculating the direction.

409
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,091
But I got lucky.

410
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,054
I had someone
to take care of my explosion.

411
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,725
I didn't know I had someone like that
before then.

412
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,533
Do you... want me to take care of things?

413
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,287
Pardon?

414
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,913
So...

415
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:11,460
Do you want to explode in front of me?

416
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,151
Let's meet here when you're done.

417
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:44,202
-Shouldn't you go to the nurse's office?
-No, it's not that serious.

418
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:51,459
-Hello.
-Hello.

419
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,842
Wrong direction.

420
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,053
Recalculating the direction.

421
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,936
Wrong direction.

422
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,146
Recalculating the direction.

423
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,361
Areung is within range.

424
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,953
Areung is close by.

425
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,331
SOCIAL ISSUES RESEARCH CLUB

426
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,378
Areung is close by.

427
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,424
You have arrived at the location.

428
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,346
Look around and search for Areung.

429
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,939
According to the vice principal,

430
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,441
there is way too much garbage
on campus.

431
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,151
It's too dirty.

432
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,196
Thus, we'll have a cleaning day on Friday,

433
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,157
so bring plastic gloves and bags.

434
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,951
-What the...
-That's so annoying.

435
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,869
-Also...
-Mr. Cho.

436
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,288
Sorry, just a moment.

437
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,040
Okay.

438
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,927
-What's going on?
-Who's that?

439
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,598
We're almost done with homeroom.

440
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,228
I can't really talk about it here.
Please come to the station with me.

441
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,148
The station? The police station?

442
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,191
Yes. Come with me.

443
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,236
Go ahead. I'll finish up here.

444
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,655
-Thank you.
-Sure.

445
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,908
You're so fucking cold.

446
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,206
You ignored my calls.

447
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,000
-How can I not?
-Let me say something.

448
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,085
No, don't.

449
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,881
Hey. Shouldn't you thank me?

450
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,884
You are incredible.

451
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,678
I'm screwed now after wrecking the place.

452
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,223
I'll be expelled for sure,

453
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,643
and my family is
in a world of shit right now.

454
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,311
I thought...

455
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,774
that made us kind of even.

456
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,612
-You don't think so at all?
-That's not for you to decide.

457
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:12,868
Hey... You told the cops
you didn't go to Banana Club.

458
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,496
-Why are you making me look like a moron?
-Bullshit.

459
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,997
I went there...

460
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,836
because that pimp said you were there.

461
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:23,504
What bullshit is that?

462
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,506
Let go!

463
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:26,924
Hey!

464
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,346
This is yours. Am I wrong?

465
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:43,190
I found it that day at Banana Club.

466
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,460
Hey, Minhee.

467
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,713
Don't you have anything to tell me?

468
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,593
No, I don't.

469
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,976
Dear police officers,
the pillars of the people.

470
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,021
I am Jisoo Oh

471
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,607
from Kyewang High School.

472
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:15,324
I am writing this with all sincerity...

473
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:16,450
With all sincerity...

474
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,873
I made this decision

475
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,960
after much thought and consideration.

476
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,465
As a person directly involved,

477
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,511
I too, have suffered much pain...

478
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,825
GYURI BAE

479
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,882
Shall I bring you along?
Want to go too?

480
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,802
No one there knows us.

481
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,641
Do you hate me that much?

482
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,400
-Gyuri Bae.
-Jisoo Oh?

483
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,406
Can we meet right now?

484
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,241
I need to talk to you.

485
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,371
-Oh...
-It's kind of important.

486
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,666
-It's a bit...
-I only need a minute.

487
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,466
BANANA KARAOKE CLUB

488
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:22,951
Anyone here?

489
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,463
Don't you see the mess?

490
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,174
We're closed.

491
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,846
Hey, lady. You're the owner's wife, right?

492
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,557
Fuck. We're not legally married.

493
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,312
This is a brothel, right?
Where they sell ass?

494
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,525
Let me ask you something.

495
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,403
Has she ever worked here?

496
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:07,037
Where are you looking at?
Look at the picture.

497
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,332
Kwak... What was your name again?

498
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,177
You're that punk who came here
and wrecked the place, right?

499
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,768
You said you'll kill the asshole
who sold your girlfriend, right?

500
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,267
Why do you look like hell?

501
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,644
I'm a bit tired.

502
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:18,692
You look like you're going to die
in five minutes.

503
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,657
I'll text you how to take care of this.

504
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,451
Thanks for taking it.

505
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,496
Why did you ask me...

506
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,875
You could raise it yourself.

507
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,878
I can't for a while.

508
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:41,215
Something came up.

509
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,217
What is it?

510
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,430
Just something.

511
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:55,229
Can you just tell me
what you wanted to say?

512
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,566
Hey, Jisoo.

513
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,404
Do you like karaoke bars?

514
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,700
I'm not in the mood for that
right now.

515
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,993
Do you or don't you?

516
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,083
I don't. I've never been to one.

517
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,546
Then why did you go to Banana Club?

518
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,257
What?

519
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,636
Do you...

520
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,099
remember what I said last time?

521
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,062
About the asshole who took my money.

522
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,358
Banana is that asshole's business.

523
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,444
Why did you go there?

524
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,961
Do you have something to tell me?

525
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,355
Well...

526
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,904
So...

527
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,578
The thing is...

528
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:36,997
The thing is...

529
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,751
Well...

530
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,714
I'm sorry.

531
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,514
For what?

532
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,937
I really didn't know.

533
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,316
What do you mean?

534
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,947
What do you mean?

535
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,283
What?

536
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,286
Fuck.

537
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:18,997
I...

538
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,208
I'm really sorry.

539
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,628
I just...

540
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:27,839
I...

541
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,551
I just...

542
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,013
I just wanted to go to school,

543
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,724
go to college,

544
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,102
and just...

545
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,562
live an ordinary life.

546
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,320
I wanted to live like you guys.

547
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,031
But I...

548
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,659
I couldn't.

549
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:58,620
Because I couldn't.

550
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,706
I mean it...

551
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,919
I didn't have any bad intentions.

552
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,296
Mr. Lee, too.

553
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,716
Mr. Lee...

554
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,636
Mr. Lee, too. I really...

555
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,932
really didn't want that.

556
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,324
-It's you.
-I didn't have any bad intentions.

557
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,621
I didn't have any bad intentions.
That's not what I wanted.

558
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,790
-I really--
-What about Gyuri?

559
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:53,842
Gyuri too?

560
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,475
Don't blame Gyuri.

561
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,854
It was me. It was all me.

562
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,648
I started it and...

563
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,944
I started it. I did. And...

564
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,364
it was all a game to her.

565
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:19,826
-A game?
-She only did it to save me.

566
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,161
That's it.

567
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,374
-I mean it. I didn't mean anything bad.
-A game?

568
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,086
That wasn't what I wanted.
I'm really sorry.

569
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,966
I'm really sorry.

570
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,555
I'm really sorry, Minhee.

571
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,724
I'm really sorry.

572
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,393
I'm really sorry, Minhee.

573
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,896
I'm sorry.

574
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:48,939
Fine.

575
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,027
I said fine.

576
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,657
You want me to forgive you.

577
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,202
Really?

578
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,543
Is that really all?

579
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,253
Don't talk to me right now.

580
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,800
Right now, I...

581
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,596
I can't talk to you right now.

582
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,350
Move.

583
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,311
I'm really sorry, Minhee.

584
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,480
I'm sorry.

585
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,692
I'm really sorry.

586
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,044
A pet tracker?

587
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:59,634
Do you know Uncle,
who has been talked about a lot lately?

588
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,179
The one Minhee talked about.

589
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,391
You said he died.

590
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,602
That was what we concluded.

591
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,148
Anyway, it means someone involved with him

592
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,902
hid this money.

593
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,445
At school?

594
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,782
In the Counseling Office.

595
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,562
I didn't have any bad intentions.

596
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,648
Mr. Lee, too.

597
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,524
Gyuri too?

598
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,527
Don't blame Gyuri.

599
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,196
It was me. It was all me.

600
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,532
I started it, and... I started it. I did.

601
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,035
And... it was all a game to her.

602
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,371
I'm sorry.

603
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,999
I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry.

604
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:15,252
I'm really sorry.

605
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,837
I'm really sorry, Minhee.

606
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,884
Hey, Minhee! Hey!

607
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,636
Let go! Fuck!

608
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,054
Hey, wait.

609
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,391
I'll turn myself in.
I'm going to turn myself in.

610
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,395
So please delete that. Please.

611
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,774
Move, you jerk!

612
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,068
Please.

613
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,945
Please delete it.

614
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:44,406
You like Gyuri, don't you?

615
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,909
You're trying to keep her name
out of this.

616
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,120
Leave Gyuri alone. I'll turn myself in.

617
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:53,123
-I'll really turn myself in.
-No. Get out of my way. Fuck.

618
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:54,416
Hey!

619
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,459
Let go! Fuck!

620
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,255
Hey. It's me.

621
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,925
It's me. Me!

622
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,013
I'm... I'm Uncle.

623
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,723
I told you I was Uncle!

624
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,392
That's enough, you bitch.

625
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,227
Fuck.

626
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,483
Give me a fucking break.

627
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,778
You're all just criminals.

628
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,365
Let go! Fuck!

629
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,493
-Fuck. Give me that!
-Let go!

630
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,037
-Give me!
-Let go!

631
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,247
Fuck!

632
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,720
Let go. Fuck!

633
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,833
Hey, Minhee Seo.

634
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,469
It wasn't our kids.

635
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,721
I hope it wasn't as well.

636
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,102
You are the advisor for the club

637
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:23,273
that's using
the counseling office right now, correct?

638
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,608
Social Issues Research Club.

639
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:28,713
Please save me.

640
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,008
Save me, Gyuri.

641
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,787
I'm coming.

642
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,071
Mr. Cho.

643
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:21,743
To be honest,

644
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,454
I can't say it's nothing serious.

645
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,416
But don't worry too much.

646
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,711
Please give me a call.

647
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:32,879
Okay.

648
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,187
Jinwoo speaking.

649
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:50,897
Where are you?

650
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:54,525
Pardon?

651
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:09,707
Hey, Kitae Kwak.

652
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,668
Don't say my name, asshole.

653
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,048
Why are you...

654
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,884
How did you know where I live?

655
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:22,970
Why?

656
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,056
Were you shocked?

657
01:01:27,433 --> 01:01:29,102
I was more shocked, asshole.

658
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:34,941
Fuck.

659
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,527
I never even imagined it.

660
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:39,904
You crazy fucker.

661
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,704
What are you talking about?

662
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,206
Why are you doing this?

663
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,138
Did you sell my girl?

664
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:11,144
What?

665
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,563
Fuck. I heard Gyuri was in on it too.

666
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,066
Does Minhee know?

667
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:14,999
KITAE KWAK

668
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:25,927
What did you do to her?

669
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:32,809
You son of a bitch!

670
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,118
Gyuri...

671
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,047
-Minhee Seo.
-Are you her guardian?

672
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,884
-I'm her homeroom teacher.
-Get in.

673
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:51,971
Careful. Get her.

674
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:18,539
Oji.

675
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,209
Hang in there.

676
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,297
Get up.

677
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:55,159
Hey.

678
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:57,078
Hey, Oji.

679
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,415
Oji.

680
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,170
Hey. Get up. Come with me.

681
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,673
Come on, get up!

682
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:19,725
Go.

683
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,147
Just go.

684
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:31,404
No. Come with me.

685
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,156
Please, just go.

686
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:44,417
Go by yourself.

687
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,671
No! Get up. Hurry. Come with me.

688
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,622
He is a diligent student.

689
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:11,629
His academic performance is impressive
and he's also well-behaved in school.

690
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:15,549
He is quiet and calm
and sets a good example to others.

691
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,760
He is a model student

692
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,763
who doesn't cause trouble.

693
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,192
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

694
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:41,320
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.
