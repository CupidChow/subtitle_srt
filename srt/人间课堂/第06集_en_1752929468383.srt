1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,927
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,145
POLICE

4
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:25,275
Hi.

5
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,861
What brings you here?

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,034
And what brings you here?

7
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,454
We're in the middle of counseling.

8
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,080
This is our club room.

9
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,957
It says it's a counseling office.

10
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,087
SOCIAL ISSUES RESEARCH CLUB

11
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,883
COUNSELING OFFICE

12
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,724
You're misinformed.
This is our club room.

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,809
That's odd.

14
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,353
I was told to have
my counseling session here.

15
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,066
We need to do something here.

16
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,610
We'd appreciate it
if you'd leave the room.

17
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,414
Hello, Vice Principal.

18
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,292
This is Detective Haegyong Lee.
We met earlier.

19
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,671
I'm in the counseling office
trying to hold a counseling session.

20
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,133
Is this room used as a club room?

21
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,305
Some students came in during my session.

22
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,310
Yes, okay.

23
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,213
Hey.

24
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,258
-Leave it.
-Why?

25
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,552
Don't be stupid
and draw attention to yourself.

26
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,805
You want me to just watch
and do nothing?

27
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,602
That may not be why she's here.

28
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,147
Minhee Seo's a bully.

29
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,108
I'm sure she causes trouble
outside of the school, too.

30
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,069
Hey!

31
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,946
Do you have any concerns?

32
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:40,160
It looked like you were fighting
with your boyfriend last time.

33
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,911
He's not my boyfriend.

34
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,248
Why? Do you want me
to set you up with him?

35
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,459
My goodness.

36
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,837
Who's your boyfriend then?

37
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,922
I don't have one.

38
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,425
I need to study.
There's no time for a boyfriend.

39
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,219
That's odd.

40
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,264
Then...

41
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,600
who did you go to the motel with?

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,814
Pardon?

43
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,952
Saturday, March 28.

44
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,497
Don't you remember anything?

45
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,916
March 28.

46
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,293
When was that?

47
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,671
The sexual consciousness survey.

48
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:35,590
What?

49
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,718
When we first went to a cafe.

50
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,970
-First time at a cafe, right?
-No one has...

51
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,932
-I need to use the restroom.
-Soon the police...

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,444
Still, how could you call the cops,
you idiot?

53
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,948
What else could I do?
She was about to die.

54
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,203
That isn't me.

55
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,165
It's you.

56
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,920
You...

57
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,131
wouldn't have gone there alone, right?

58
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,843
Who did you meet there that day?

59
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:26,641
You say you don't have a boyfriend, so...

60
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,979
someone you don't know?

61
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,149
Someone you met online or something?

62
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,780
Hey!

63
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,577
What is it, Gyuri?

64
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,664
I need to ask him something.

65
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,000
He isn't back from lunch yet.

66
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,295
He went out to eat.

67
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,713
To eat...

68
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,260
DON'T THINK YOU ARE ALONE
CALL 117 FOR HELP

69
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:18,443
I won't tell anyone
about what I hear today.

70
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,364
As I said before, the teachers think

71
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,992
this as a standard counseling session.

72
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,038
No one will think differently of you

73
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,832
just because you talked with me.

74
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,547
I just...

75
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,467
want to know

76
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,763
whether or not you need help right now.

77
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,940
Can you tell me...

78
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,569
what happened that day?

79
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,579
I--

80
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,127
Did you forget something?

81
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,715
To be honest...

82
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:25,843
What?

83
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,762
To be honest, you have no authority.

84
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,223
What?

85
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,392
The police have no authority.

86
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,687
It's not like minors are banned
from motels.

87
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:37,939
She...

88
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,150
She can go wherever.
That's her personal life.

89
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,361
Can a cop dig into her life like this?

90
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,407
-Hey, kid.
-No, right?

91
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,119
Human rights, the Constitution.

92
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,788
Our country has things like that.

93
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,082
Hey. Don't say anything, okay?

94
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,710
You don't have to tell her anything.

95
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:03,172
No need to answer her.
If you don't want to, don't.

96
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,096
Hey, kid. You must be mistaken
about something--

97
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,180
Do you have a warrant?

98
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:13,808
A warrant?

99
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,810
-Hello.
-Hi.

100
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,023
Bring a warrant!

101
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:27,488
A cop shouldn't treat a student
like a suspect without a warrant!

102
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,282
Well, I...

103
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,993
What's going on?

104
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,453
Oh, yes.

105
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,164
Are you their homeroom teacher?

106
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,999
Yes, I am. But...

107
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,461
What is it? What's wrong?

108
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,675
-Hello.
-Haegyong.

109
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,969
What are you doing
at the school right now?

110
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,387
Well.

111
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,098
I'm counseling a student.

112
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,017
What are you doing with a kid?

113
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,686
A civil complaint came directly
to my cell phone.

114
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,857
A civil complaint? Just now?

115
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,150
Who--

116
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,693
Is that important right now?

117
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,529
I don't know
whether it was a parent or a teacher,

118
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,573
but the person was bitching at me,

119
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,034
saying that a cop was holding
a student hostage

120
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,620
and interrogating her like some criminal.

121
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,788
She was bitching at me like crazy.

122
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,541
Didn't I tell you not to snoop around?

123
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,669
But, I...

124
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,674
Girls, I brought chicken and coffee.

125
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,051
Wake up.

126
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,011
Wake up, Eunchae. Good morning.

127
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,221
Hey.

128
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,056
Hey, here's coffee.

129
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,808
-What time is it?
-It's 12:30 p.m.

130
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,101
The weather's so nice.

131
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,895
Hey, get up. Eunchae.

132
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,939
Did you find a shop?

133
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,524
Fuck. I told you to trust me.

134
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,364
The boss isn't a total lowlife.

135
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:55,201
He's not as mean
and a total businessman.

136
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,787
I told him all about you guys.

137
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,206
I told him
how much we charge too.

138
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,251
If you guys are in,
we can even start today.

139
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,045
What do you say? Are you interested?

140
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,507
I'm still hesitant
about apartment brothels.

141
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,342
Why you...

142
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,262
You don't like room salons
because you don't want to drink.

143
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,139
Then it's either massage parlors
or apartment brothels.

144
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,475
-Can you give massages?
-That's true, but--

145
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,811
I hear they can't handle
psycho clients as fast.

146
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:25,064
Hey, I wouldn't work somewhere
that's untrustworthy.

147
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,734
They have seven rooms in a building.

148
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,945
One of them is the manager's room.

149
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,615
If anything happens,
he'll come down right away.

150
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:36,867
What about Minhee?

151
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,997
If we all go there,
she'll be left all alone.

152
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,749
When was the last time she worked?

153
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,835
Right?

154
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,629
Why worry about a bitch
who doesn't even want to work?

155
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,089
Whatever.

156
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,968
Invasion of privacy?

157
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,054
I don't understand.

158
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,182
Be more specific.

159
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,394
What privacy did she invade?

160
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,275
Minhee Seo.

161
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,070
What exactly did that cop say to you?

162
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,744
-I'm not going to tell you.
-Why not?

163
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,454
It's my prarivocy.

164
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,289
It's privacy.

165
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,378
Did... something happen
that you can't talk about?

166
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:36,052
Or did that cop accuse you wrongly
or something like that?

167
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,473
-If that's it--
-Seriously...

168
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,225
If that's it, tell me.
We can't let it slide.

169
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,895
Just leave it alone.
I don't want to talk about it.

170
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,273
Such an old fart.

171
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,490
It's my job to be an old fart.

172
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,661
Even if I don't like it,
I have to be one for you guys.

173
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,333
Talk with me tomorrow morning, okay?

174
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,128
This is so fucking annoying.

175
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,630
You have to come.

176
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,572
Cutting Minhee loose

177
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,408
is the only solution.

178
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,121
Don't you see why things got this bad?

179
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,249
It's fucking simple.

180
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,043
It's because Minhee's a kid.
Because she's a minor.

181
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,089
The cops aren't investigating
so aggressively for no reason.

182
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,006
They're doing this

183
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,217
because it's about sex trafficking
of a minor.

184
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,557
If you keep working with her,
things like this will keep happening.

185
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,415
Why did you call me out so late at night?

186
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,292
I'm exhausted.

187
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,933
I'm not feeling well today,

188
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,227
so give me the summarized version.

189
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,147
Hello, it's me.

190
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,317
I'll give her the phone.

191
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,943
UNCLE

192
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,528
Ms. Minhee Seo.

193
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,947
How have you been?

194
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,826
Okay.

195
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,790
I apologize for asking to see you

196
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,708
so late at night.

197
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,461
Okay.

198
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,172
First,

199
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,807
we'd like to thank you
for using our services

200
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,184
for all this time.

201
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,937
We arranged this meeting today

202
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,775
to relay some unfortunate news
to you, Ms. Minhee Seo.

203
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,529
This is very difficult for us
to bring up as well, and--

204
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:44,990
Ms. Minhee Seo.

205
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,661
-You have your phone, right?
-Yes.

206
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,705
Take it out.

207
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,546
I did.

208
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,797
Open Kakaotalk.

209
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,804
Do you see our group chat room?

210
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:08,889
Yes.

211
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,267
Please exit the chat room.

212
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,646
Exit the chat room, delete our app,

213
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,692
delete all messages exchanged
with other clients and their contacts.

214
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,611
Have Mr. Lee inspect your phone
when you're done,

215
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:25,823
return the wearable device,
and go home.

216
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,911
-Pardon?
-Mr. Lee.

217
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,413
Yes?

218
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,707
I taught you how to reset a phone, right?

219
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,293
-Yes, well--
-It's like resetting a tablet.

220
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,592
Give it back!

221
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,137
Mr. Lee, give it back!

222
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,231
Ms. Minhee Seo,

223
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,736
we've decided not to provide
any services to you anymore

224
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,362
from this day forward.

225
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,326
You know the reason better than anyone.

226
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,790
Are you doing this
because I haven't been working?

227
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,878
You said you're a service provider,
not a pimp!

228
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,129
FACTORY RESETTING PHONE

229
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,214
Isn't it up to me whether or not I work?

230
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,132
RESETTING COMPLETE

231
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,259
How many times
did you have to stop working

232
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:28,802
because you fainted on the job?

233
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,513
You show symptoms

234
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,933
of a panic disorder.

235
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,143
-Are you aware of that?
-No, that's...

236
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,146
How is that my fault?

237
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,316
It happened while I was working.

238
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,654
I called, but you didn't answer,
and you guys didn't come.

239
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,074
Whose fault is that? Why is it my fault?

240
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,534
The client you took
when the incident occurred

241
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,037
was on the blacklist,
which you were advised to avoid.

242
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,415
However, you were the one
who decided to take him.

243
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,880
You have not requested our services
since the incident, have you?

244
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:11,220
Wasn't it because you determined
you were incapable of working any longer?

245
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,265
-I can work.
-Then do it.

246
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,228
But not with us.

247
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,901
You're being too harsh.

248
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,328
The bracelet.

249
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:41,917
The bracelet.

250
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,048
You assholes.

251
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,475
Stop it!

252
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,437
Damn it!

253
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,622
Get out.

254
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,041
No...

255
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,043
Stop it already.

256
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,638
You pieces of trash.

257
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,395
Ms. Minhee Seo.

258
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,232
Once again, I apologize.

259
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,486
I hope your time with us
and the memories thereof

260
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:54,782
will remain something positive for us all.

261
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,284
I wish you happiness.

262
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,832
-You brat.
-Did you do it?

263
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,376
-It's a secret, bitch.
-She did it?

264
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,004
Anyway, I think your boyfriend is awesome.

265
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,422
She did it.

266
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,548
What?

267
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,092
He's usually quiet,

268
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,844
but out of nowhere,
he's a fucking fighter.

269
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,679
What do you mean?

270
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,766
-I heard Oji faced up to a cop.
-He stood up to her.

271
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,060
That?

272
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,396
He's surprisingly tough.

273
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,232
What made him do that?

274
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,777
Same as what he told the dean
for checking our belongings.

275
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,655
He told her not to violate her rights
and respect her privacy.

276
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,698
And that being a cop isn't everything.

277
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,701
Defender of justice
fighting for democracy.

278
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,370
-Exactly. Shit.
-Seriously.

279
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:46,834
If he were born in the 80s,
he would've beheaded dozens of dictators.

280
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,001
Dozens?

281
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,714
He doesn't seem like it,
but he's a fucking fighter.

282
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
I agree.

283
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,510
Fighter, my ass.

284
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,887
He's a fucking coward.

285
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,306
What?

286
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,561
Hey, this is awesome.

287
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,521
-Did you pay for this?
-Awesome.

288
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,941
Look at the drawings.
It's insane.

289
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,860
Right?

290
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,654
-This guy is a total freak.
-Where did you get this?

291
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,489
Why should I tell you?

292
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,074
-Fuck.
-Isn't this awesome?

293
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,410
It must be nice to be so young.

294
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,997
Hey, look at this, Minhee.

295
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,039
Put that away.

296
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,041
Hyemin, give me your number.

297
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,127
You don't have my number?

298
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,713
My phone got erased. Suji, you too.

299
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:33,922
Give me.

300
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,010
This is all broken.

301
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,763
How did this happen?
Did you drop it into the toilet?

302
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,058
You have a call.

303
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,811
-Who is it?
-How would I know?

304
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,188
Hey.

305
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,064
Who is it?

306
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,193
Seriously, this is crazy.

307
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,694
This is really insane.

308
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,155
Hello?

309
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,116
Hello?
This is Ms. Minhee Seo's phone, right?

310
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,075
I'm not interested.

311
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,121
This is Detective Haegyong Lee.
We met before.

312
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,125
How have you been?

313
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,837
How did you get my number?

314
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,591
You're a student. The school had it.

315
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,302
Why did you call?

316
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,765
Just because... to check in?

317
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,188
Can we finish the conversation
we were having last time?

318
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,190
Let's meet somewhere else.

319
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,276
-Who is it?
-It must be that cop from last time.

320
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,319
You know...

321
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:38,987
Oh, from counseling?

322
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,451
Didn't you hear last time?

323
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,621
I don't need to see you
because you tell me to.

324
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,332
I have no obligation to do that.

325
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:56,713
Minhee.

326
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:01,009
Things will get complicated
if you take that attitude.

327
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,388
Your teachers will probably get involved.

328
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,268
I want to talk about this quietly
just between us.

329
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,727
You don't even have evidence.

330
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,939
Bring a warrant then.

331
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,316
Otherwise, I have nothing to say.

332
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,696
If you keep doing this,
I'll report you for falsifying

333
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,032
spreading information.
I'm hanging up.

334
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,913
She's so fucking smart.

335
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,999
Where did you pick up stuff like that?

336
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,042
-You're so smart.
-Seriously.

337
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,627
What was that? False--

338
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,379
Do you even know what you're saying?

339
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,383
-A warrant? Do the police issue that?
-Hold on. A warrant...

340
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,886
NOT FALSIFYING SPREADING INFORMATION
IT'S SPREADING FALSE INFORMATION

341
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,471
-Falsifying...
-Hold on.

342
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,265
We should write this down.

343
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,725
-Wait.
-Falsifying...

344
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,227
Hey, Minhee.

345
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,271
What was it again? False what?

346
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,356
By the way, who was it?
Is it that cop?

347
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,823
What are you looking at?

348
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,707
Let's talk for a minute.

349
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,429
You have a girlfriend.

350
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,348
Why are you going after mine?

351
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,441
I know you think I'm an easy target
because you're with Gyuri now.

352
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,235
But you should have some ethics.

353
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,487
Huh?

354
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,622
Laugh, you asshole.
You're pretty when you laugh.

355
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,207
You're such a weirdo.

356
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,634
Hey.

357
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,470
Hey, where's Oji?

358
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,681
Hey, I said answer me.

359
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,395
Did you hear something
outside the counseling room?

360
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,152
What did that cop bitch want
with Minhee?

361
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:25,695
That was...

362
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,533
-just a random--
-Fuck off.

363
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,744
Random, my ass.

364
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,206
A cop was randomly questioning
a sophomore student?

365
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:38,208
Drop the bullshit.

366
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,129
Why did you confront that cop?

367
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:43,964
What did you hear?

368
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:46,925
I didn't hear anything.

369
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,762
It's a fucking simple question, asshole!

370
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,806
What did that cop want with her?

371
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,017
I don't know.

372
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,897
Fuck.

373
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,691
-Hey.
-Hey, Kwakki!

374
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,319
What are you doing?

375
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,989
Stay out of this. I'll text you later.

376
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,033
Let's just go.
What are you doing here?

377
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,660
I said to stay out.

378
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,455
Why are you always beating up
innocent kids?

379
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,584
What are you two doing?

380
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,335
Oji.

381
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,962
Are you okay?

382
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,173
-Fuck. Is this a hot spot?
-Hey, get up.

383
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,969
Did you tell him?

384
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:33,597
No.

385
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,270
Why won't you tell him?

386
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,191
What?

387
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:47,027
You moron! Why didn't you tell him
when he beat you up?

388
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,120
Hey, Minhee Seo. You coward bitch.

389
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,332
Is it that hard to admit
your dirty acts?

390
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,543
You saw what he did to him,

391
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,379
but you're trying to save face
in front of your boyfriend?

392
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,506
Hey, Gyuri.

393
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,967
You got caught stealing
from Swarovski, you snitch!

394
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,345
You bitch.

395
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,306
And you threaten others not to talk.

396
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,478
You fucking pricks.

397
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,316
Swarovski?

398
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,610
What?

399
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,697
Are you okay?

400
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,450
Do you... like Swarovski?

401
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,164
I...

402
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:45,835
It was for you.

403
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,837
Me?

404
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,172
Yes.

405
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,259
You didn't like my birthday present
from the last time.

406
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,552
That's why...

407
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,348
Let's go.

408
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,905
COUNSELING OFFICE

409
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,478
-Well--
-Pay me back with the business.

410
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,026
We're working today, right?

411
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,741
I'll be late today.
I have to see my mom later.

412
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,331
See you later.

413
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,558
SEXY LADY: HI
COMPENSATED DATING, OKAY?

419
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,908
SEXY LADY: TELL ME WHEN YOU ARRIVE

420
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,827
Did you forget--

421
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,669
How much did you overhear?

422
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:53,963
What?

423
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:57,425
When the cop was here,
how much did you overhear?

424
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,223
-I didn't hear much--
-You heard everything, right?

425
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,766
About the motel and everything.

426
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,187
I did hear something about a motel--

427
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,146
Fuck!

428
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,691
Fuck!

429
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,739
Watch your mouth.

430
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,242
I'll kill you if a strange rumor gets out.

431
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,284
Got it?

432
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,538
But...

433
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,834
you won't talk either, right?

434
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,545
What are you talking about?

435
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,255
You think I'm crazy?

436
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,176
Right? Obviously.

437
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,723
What are you staring at?

438
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,442
Hey.

439
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,694
What's your name?

440
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,280
Jisoo Oh.

441
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:01,781
Jinsoo Oh.

442
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,200
Hey.

443
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,244
Let me ask you something.

444
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,704
It's Jisoo.

445
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,540
Why do you keep defending me?

446
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,584
What?

447
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:18,131
You fucking defend me
when I didn't even ask you to.

448
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:19,549
Why are you doing that?

449
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:22,969
Do you...

450
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,222
like me or something?

451
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,769
Please say you don't.

452
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,188
Please...

453
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,232
You're so fucking not my type.

454
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,030
It's like this.

455
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,282
It's hard to explain, so listen carefully.

456
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,825
I, a loser in your class, am

457
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,869
actually your compensated dating broker.

458
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,581
In other words, if you get fucked,
I will very likely be fucked, too.

459
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,043
So, I have no choice
but to defend you. Otherwise...

460
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,755
Hey.

461
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,758
Say something, asshole.
I asked you why.

462
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,806
Personal lives.

463
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:09,808
What?

464
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,603
So, in times like these
when individuality is being lost,

465
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,148
-personal lives are--
-What bullshit is that?

466
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,736
I mean...

467
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,906
everyone has a secret
they want to keep.

468
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,077
Bastards who know
absolutely nothing

469
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,454
dig up and expose things about people

470
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,748
and make them the bad guys.

471
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,334
I just don't get that.

472
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,588
I have the right to live
however I want

473
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,550
as long as I don't hurt others, no?

474
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,308
Hey, Jinsoo Oh.

475
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,894
It's Jisoo.

476
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,063
Go somewhere with me later.

477
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,023
Where?

478
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,943
You'll fucking know when you get there.

479
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,574
But I have something to do tonight.

480
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,371
BATTERY FULLY CHARGED

481
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,459
Hey, aren't you going to clean this up?

482
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:21,421
-What was that?
-You're so filthy.

483
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,966
I'm done washing. Hold on.

484
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,427
You didn't finish your quest yet,

485
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,137
-right?
-No.

486
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,222
Don't watch the cutscenes without me.

487
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,851
I was in a rush.

488
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,394
Let's see.

489
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:43,985
Come out.

490
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,656
No, press the triangle.

491
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:52,201
Babe, you need to press the triangle.

492
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,412
-Gosh, give it to me.
-Let go.

493
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:57,373
Come on, give it to me.
Watch me play.

494
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,625
Here, the triangle.

495
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,418
Look, like this.

496
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,965
Press the triangle, okay?

497
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,259
Good, press that.

498
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,685
Look, a dragon ball.

499
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,939
The dragon grants you a wish
if you find all seven.

500
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,690
I wonder where the other six are.

501
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,943
Are they here?
No, not here. Then...

502
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,572
-Here they are. Here.
-Stop it.

503
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,659
Baby.

504
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,453
-You were hiding them--
-I said to stop.

505
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,330
The other six are here.

506
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,916
Shit. I died because of you.

507
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,085
Stop rubbing up against me like a baby.

508
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,128
The more I look at you,

509
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,339
the uglier you look.

510
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,008
I'm losing my sex drive.

511
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,429
Keep pressing the triangle.

512
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,433
Babe, you're getting better.

513
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:58,893
Really...

514
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,627
ENTER PASSWORD

515
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,046

-Nothing, babe.

519
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,020
I'll clean this up.

I'M HERE

529
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,970
Hello?

530
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,764
Where are you?

531
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,641
Why are you ignoring my texts?

532
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,935
Hey, something came up.

533
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:24,437
Aren't you going to work?

534
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,522
Hey, get off at the next stop.

535
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,405
Is that Minhee Seo?

536
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:39,952
I don't know how to explain this.
Things are a bit awkward.

537
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,331
I think I'll be running late.

538
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,709
When will you be home?

539
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,087
I'll be home, but...

540
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,673
Can you handle business for today?

541
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,551
I hid a backup phone under my mattress.

542
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,636
You can use that.

543
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,555
Explain where you are
and what you're doing.

544
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,641
You can transfer to...

545
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:04,060
Nothing big. I'll explain later.

546
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,896
Take care of business for me
just for today.

547
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,147
Please. Just this once.

548
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,110
-Then 60-40.
-What?

549
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,782
If this happens again, make it 60-40.

550
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,704
Fine.

551
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,207
Bye.

552
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,935
Where are we going anyway?

553
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,647
Fuck. Stop asking the same thing.
It's annoying.

554
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,065
Do you want to die?

555
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,571
How about a hint?

556
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,286
I'm getting my rights back, asshole.

557
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,414
But why are you taking me
to get your rights back?

558
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,792
You know what fucking sucks?

559
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:15,214
The fact that you're the only one
I have right now.

560
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,302
Excuse me.

561
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,429
I'm here.

562
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,693
What are you doing?

563
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:20,821
Fuck.

564
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,200
-He's here.
-What?

565
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,702
He's here already?

566
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,621
I know. I'm not done getting ready.

567
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,209
-What are you doing? Grab him.
-Okay.

568
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,003
-Hey, come here.
-What are you doing?

569
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,464
Come here.
Don't make me waste my energy. It's hot.

570
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,507
Hey, stay still.

571
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,012
-Here.
-Okay.

572
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,515
Give me your hands.

573
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,684
Your hands.

574
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:56,899
Why are you doing this?

575
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,662
-Hey.
-Yes?

576
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,832
There's a gap in the plastic.

577
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,919
-The blood will leak through.
-I told you I wasn't ready yet.

578
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:19,088
He came too early.

579
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,464
Hey, get up.

580
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,883
It's okay, get up.

581
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,386
Be meticulous, okay?

582
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,472
It's such a pain every time.

583
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:33,185
We can't even smoke in case it burns
a hole through the plastic.

584
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:35,062
This is how he does it on Dexter.

585
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,316
He finishes it at the scene.
Nice and clean.

586
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,777
You didn't watch Dexter
like I told you, did you?

587
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,739
-I watched it.
-You did?

588
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,365
-I did.
-Really?

589
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,700
I did.

590
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:49,285
What's Dexter's sister's name?

591
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,582
I don't remember.
I watched it a long time ago.

592
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,167
You're full of shit.

593
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,543
Hey, do you know?

594
00:38:58,794 --> 00:38:59,628
No?

595
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,257
Okay, now.

596
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,802
I'll explain why you must die,
so listen carefully.

597
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,014
-Why are you doing this?
-Okay.

598
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,434
You know her, right?

599
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,771
She's going to be my wife.

600
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,356
But you and she...

601
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:21,567
had sex.

602
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,235
How could I not be mad?

603
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,406
She's your client, remember?

604
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,327
What are you saying?

605
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,206
It's not me.
I really don't know anything.

606
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,084
You chatted with her.
How could you not know?

607
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,836
I didn't text her.
I really don't know anything.

608
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,590
No?

609
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,677
Why wouldn't you know?

610
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,181
He says it isn't him.

611
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,645
Don't be ridiculous.
It's obvious that it's you.

612
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,064
COME TO VENEKIA HOTEL ROOM 610.
SEE YOU SOON. HELLO.

613
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:00,981
What's this?

614
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,068
Hey.

615
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,987
It really isn't him.

616
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,866
There must be other guys
who do compensated dating.

617
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,743
Then killing him is meaningless.

618
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,038
Sure, ethically too.
He didn't do anything wrong.

619
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,627
Should I pull out a tooth or something?

620
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,340
Please don't kill me.

621
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,510
Hey.

622
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,934
Who do you give money to once you're done?

623
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,158
How can you eat a burger right now?

624
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,462
What are you doing?

625
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,005
Sit.

626
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,061
I said I can't just leave, right?

627
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,524
I worked my ass off for you guys.

628
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,444
How could you fire me like that?

629
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,767
Yes.

630
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,811
He knows what I did.

631
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:08,692
What?

632
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:12,363
Did you think I'd keep my mouth shut
and suffer in silence

633
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:14,031
and leave on my own?

634
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,450
Fuck.

635
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,582
I looked it up,

636
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,211
and if I talk, you guys are the ones
who'll be in deeper shit.

637
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,423
You know that, right?
What is it? The sentence?

638
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,052
It will be completely different.

639
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,180
I may get off with a slap on the wrist,

640
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,307
but you guys will be fucked.

641
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,270
So?

642
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,024
What do you want?

643
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,615
Pay up. My severance.

644
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,033
Give it to me.

645
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,911
It's my right to get paid.

646
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,663
Why is that?

647
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,920
Because...

648
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,717
Hey.

649
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,845
Say something.

650
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,266
Rights, duty...
You're good with things like that.

651
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,728
They're bastards

652
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,731
who treat people like objects.

653
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:32,067
Please leave a message
after the tone.

654
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,987
Hello, it's me.

655
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,324
I think we should

656
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,327
change our stand-by location.

657
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,205
Call me when you get this.

658
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,308
Hey, hurry and say something.

659
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,727
Hey.

660
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,813
Hey, what are you doing?
Say something.

661
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,533
Where are you going?
We're not done talking.

662
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:43,806
SUNGMI NA HAS LEFT THE ROOM
JIYE KIM HAS LEFT THE ROOM

663
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,350
EUNCHAE YOO HAS LEFT THE ROOM

664
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:53,023
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

665
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:57,569
UNCLE, I WANTED TO SAY BYE
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

666
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,780
MINJU CHO HAS LEFT THE ROOM

667
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,417
What's going on?

668
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,044
Mister, we need to talk.

669
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,964
Hey, hurry and say something.

670
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,050
Talk already!

671
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,762
Shit. This old man is fucking annoying.

672
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,473
Hey, hurry and say something.

673
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,766
If you follow me,

674
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,394
you'll be in trouble.

675
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,732
-Hey.
-Where are you going?

676
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:35,983
Mister!

677
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,693
Let's go.

678
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,115
Mister.

679
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:44,825
Hey!

680
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,035
Where are you going?

681
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,165
I said you'd get in trouble.

682
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:53,125
Hurry and go.

683
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,711
You too. Go.

684
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,511
Hurry and go.

685
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:06,722
Hurry. Go.

686
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,385
-Let go.
-Come on. Let's go!

687
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,012
Let go. Fuck!

688
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,761
Get that asshole!

689
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,679
Hey!

690
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,074
Hey!

691
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:05,729
Fuck. Open up.

692
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,040
Open up!

693
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,708
Open up!

694
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,543
Open up!

695
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,511
You fucker!

696
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:39,971
Fuck!

697
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,932
This is so humiliating.

698
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:48,855
Damn it.

699
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,904
What are you looking at?

700
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,741
This is so humiliating.

701
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,328
Where are you going?

702
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,960
Fuck. You son of a bitch!

703
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,588
-You fucking son of a bitch--
-Move it, you fucker!

704
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,758
Son of a bitch!

705
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:18,885
Wait.

706
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,778
BLUE FLAVOR: HELLO

707
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,699
SEXY LADY: HELLO

708
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,409
Let go!

709
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,286
Found you.

710
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,206
Blue Flavor.

711
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,387
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

712
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,348
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.
