1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,049
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,927
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,795
He's a hardworking student.

4
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,843
He's well-behaved and has a high level
of academic achievement.

5
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,350
His quiet and calm attitude sets
a good example for others.

6
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,938
He is a model student

7
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,776
who rarely causes any trouble.

8
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,134
Rank one, one, one, and one.

9
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,263
One, one, you're the only one.

10
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,057
Congratulations.

11
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,893
Thank you.

12
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:48,233
You have no demerits or any warnings.

13
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,151
It's almost as if you're invisible.

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,030
I have no clue to figure out
what you're like.

15
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:58,409
Anyway, model students like you are
the most difficult.

16
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,581
Thank you.

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,085
It's not a compliment.

18
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,509
You need to make a little trouble
now and then.

19
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,470
Or you'll get into huge trouble later
all at once.

20
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,774
HOMEROOM TEACHER'S ADVICE
1. GET INTO A LITTLE TROUBLE

21
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,946
Are you able to manage your daily life?

22
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,158
I believe I am doing fine.

23
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,871
So, which universities will you apply to?

24
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,455
Just the top three.

25
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
Which one, exactly?

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,419
Wherever I get in. The best among them.

27
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,756
-And what about your major?
-Anything I get into.

28
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,845
What do you want to do later on?

29
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,348
Anything that makes money.

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,811
Wow, your attitude is fucking annoying.

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,815
What do you mean?

32
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:13,693
Forget it.

33
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,071
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

34
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:21,743
What kind of an adult do you want to be?
Is there anything you want to do?

35
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,080
Don't you have dreams, hopes,
or anything like that?

36
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,753
FIND AND CORRECT THE GRAMMAR MISTAKES

37
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,801
Shit, it's fucking annoying!

38
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:46,935
Hey, are you kidding me?

39
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,229
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

40
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,271
Take a look, bitch.

41
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,981
-What?
-Are you kidding me?

42
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,066
What's disappeared?

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,568
-Give it back.
-What the hell are you talking about?

44
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,153
The gift box that was over there!

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,614
You are the one who lost it.
Don't bitch at me.

46
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,824
It's a gift to celebrate 100 days
with Kitae.

47
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,994
-Don't mess with me and give it back.
-I didn't take it!

48
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,704
What the hell is your problem?

49
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,289
Hey!

50
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,749
Maybe it was that bitch.

51
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,335
-What bitch?
-The angel bitch.

52
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,547
That's right. It must've been Netty!
You got Nettied.

53
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,007
You idiot.

54
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,261
-Fuck! Fuck!
-You should've waited until the day.

55
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,098
How could you use such foul language?

56
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,142
-Kitae!
-There, there.

57
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:30,895
What?

58
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,398
She has lost something.
A gift for you or something.

59
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,816
-Be quiet.
-A gift?

60
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,693
What's the occasion?

61
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,988
-For me?
-"What's the occasion?"

62
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,364
Is it for me?

63
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,826
Hey, did you just ask
what the occasion was?

64
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,369
"What's the occasion," you said?

65
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,414
-"What's the occasion?"
-"What's the occasion?"

66
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,999
Huh? "What's the occasion?"

67
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,083
Dreams.

68
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,712
Dreams are expensive.

69
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,767
GUARDIAN

70
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,148
They get even more expensive

71
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,233
for a kid without parents.

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,443
JUNGJIN OH

73
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,854
You will never be able to buy them,

74
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,982
no matter how hard you try.

75
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,485
Doggo, check messages.

76
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,362
Checking messages.

77
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,490
You have one unread message.

78
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,991
First message.

79
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,577
Help.

80
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,996
Help.

81
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,040
Text Mr. Lee.

82
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,131
Not now.

83
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,384
Eat up.

84
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,138
ARE YOU NEARBY? WE HAVE A DIRTBAG.

85
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,391
PLEASE CHECK ON IT.

86
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,612
Take one.

87
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,242
Once again, I'm enlightening someone
who sold humanity to capitalism.

88
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,619
This is the record.

89
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,898
I will give you one last chance
to defend yourself.

90
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,572
How did you end up falling
into this rut of "compensated dating"?

91
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,327
Fuck off, asshole.

92
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,068
Fuck.

93
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,675
Oh, my god!

94
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,470
What the hell?

95
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,060
Don't come closer. What are you?

96
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,770
I'll stab you, huh?

97
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,188
-That wuss.
-I mean it.

98
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,316
I'll do it.

99
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,695
I'll...

100
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,093
-Scissors.
-Sorry?

101
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,271
The blades will get dull.

102
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,605
No...

103
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,692
My scissors!

104
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,987
I said the blades will get dull.

105
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,834
"It was the wind
that raised 80 percent of me

106
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,794
for the last 23 years."

107
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,380
Look, what does that mean?

108
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,925
The wind raised me?

109
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,427
SELF-PORTRAIT BY YUN DONGJU

110
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,220
Does that make sense?

111
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,681
All right, then who's here

112
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,225
with academic tuition the wind paid for?
Hands.

113
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,852
Anyone?

114
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,062
That's right, no one.

115
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,939
Who raises kids, then?

116
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:09,025
-Parents.
-That's right!

117
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,318
Parents do.

118
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,572
They pay for things and support you.
That's how they raise you, right?

119
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,409
But what does this narrator mean here?

120
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,787
He's saying that the wind raised him.

121
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,457
What could that mean?

122
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,212
Yeah, 15 for her time.

123
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,466
With the bruises, the busted lip,

124
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,385
and emotional distress and all that,

125
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,513
it'll take about two weeks to heal.

126
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,434
How much should we charge
for the hair that was cut off?

127
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,519
Now, look.

128
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,482
The warmth of parents.

129
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,067
How much did he cut?

130
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,112
About two finger-widths?

131
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,866
We request two million won
including compensation.

132
00:10:58,949 --> 00:10:59,825
Two million won?

133
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,454
That's how much I should pay?

134
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,504
He has 23,000 won in cash in his wallet.

135
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,507
He's 1,977,000 won short.

136
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,424
Fuck.

137
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:16,842
Look.

138
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:22,807
The family love and the warmth
and tenderness of parents.

139
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,935
The complete lack of these things...

140
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,312
Please search him.

141
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,606
Top, belt.

142
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,650
Bottom, socks.

143
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,865
"Some read a sinner in my eyes.

144
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,494
Some read a fool on my lips.

145
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,497
But I Regret nothing."

146
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,665
BUT I REGRET NOTHING.

147
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:50,209
"On the morning
that begins to rise brightly,

148
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,503
the dew of poetry
sitting on my forehead..."

149
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,509
In total,

150
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,096
it's 323,000 won.

151
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,639
Thank you.

152
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,309
He's 1,677,000 won short.

153
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,605
-Client.
-Yes?

154
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:12,982
Not you.

155
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,359
There is a default
in payment of 1,677,000 won

156
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,487
for the injury suffered
during the course of business.

157
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,947
-A or B.
-B

158
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,790
If you choose option B,
you may incur a loss--

159
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,293
B! You motherfucker!

160
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,503
-Babe.
-Yes?

161
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,880
-Open your mouth.
-What?

162
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,089
Open it!

163
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,175
Open. There you go.

164
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,676
Okay.

165
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,139
Option B shall be executed.

166
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,643
Mr. Lee, keep it up. Thank you.

167
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,868
What does that mean?

168
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,620
It means you'll get beaten up.

169
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,333
Just enough to pay for 1,677,000 won.

170
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,182

Here.

179
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,168
My dream is to graduate.

180
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,150
Go to college, get a job.

181
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,236
Have kids, raise kids.

182
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,697
Live a normal life and...

183
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,992
die in a normal way.

184
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:14,371
BROKERAGE FEE 350,000 WON COLLECTED
NO INCIDENT. TODAY'S WORK COMPLETE.

185
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,547
GOOD JOB, THANK YOU

186
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,550
The money I need for that...

187
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,137
is 90 million won.

188
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,768
That's the price

189
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,228
of my dream.

190
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,525
A rabbit came down from heaven and said...

191
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,614
Kang Bbang!

192
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,661
Hey.

193
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,050
You punk, shit.

194
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,929
Dominus is here,
but you're having a siesta?

195
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,764
Are you nuts?

196
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,308
Sorry, I didn't know you were here.

197
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,309
You little shit.

198
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,606
Kang Bbang, did you miss me?

199
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,525
Y-Yes, Dominus.

200
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,278
Kang Bbang, whom do you like best,
your mom, your dad,

201
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,279
or Kitae?

202
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,741
Kitae.

203
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,623
Let's play ball.

204
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,458
Let's play.

205
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,007
Dunk!

206
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,555
Pass!

207
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,140
Hey!

208
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,146
Gyuri never passes! Seriously!

209
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,564
Oh, shit. I missed.

210
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,648
Dunk!

211
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,111
Hey, get back up. Let's continue.

212
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,238
Hey, Gyoungsik. Let's go.

213
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,949
-Pass.
-Three!

214
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,997
Are you okay? Shit. I'm so sorry.

215
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,166
Hey, Kitae hit his noggin.

216
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,795
-Hey, what's your name?
-No, I'm fine.

217
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,756
-I'm really sorry.
-I said I'm fine.

218
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,675
Hey, Jisoo.

219
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,719
Mr. Cho wants to see you.

220
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,939
COUNSELING OFFICE

221
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,490
Do you think... there would be a wacko

222
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,618
who forges his parent's signature
on a report card with top grades?

223
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,996
Well, I have no idea.

224
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,218
You punk.

225
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,721
What a weirdo.

226
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,979
Hey. Do you want to join my club?

227
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,897
What club?

228
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,649
Social Issues Research Club

229
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,319
BEST CLUB IN KYEWANG HIGH:
SOCIAL ISSUES RESEARCH

230
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,279
HEY! JOIN THE CLUB!

231
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,114
Doesn't it look super fun?

232
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,824
What do you do in the club?

233
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,995
We study old-minded people like you.

234
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,833
Say it sounds fun.

235
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,585
It sounds boring.

236
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,297
You are being salty.

237
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,216
You are definitely
a subject worth studying.

238
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,135
-I won't join.
-Why not?

239
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:42,055
I'm not that interested
in social issues or anything.

240
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,559
You are just 18 years old
and uninterested in everything?

241
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,978
Then, what are you interested in?

242
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,860
Hey.

243
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,822
Are you an amphibian or what?
Why are you always drenched?

244
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,575
-Here's what you asked for.
-Give it to me.

245
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,579
Where did you get this?

246
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,414
Here and there.

247
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,625
Can I go?

248
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,919
You're citing foreign sources.

249
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,504
Did you translate it all?

250
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,133
You must be busy.

251
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,386
Baeggyul. Stop right there.

252
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,350
You'll come later
to revise the questionnaire, right?

253
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,685
Am I really supposed to do that too?

254
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,730
Of course, you are.
You're the only one in this club.

255
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,482
Why did you join then?

256
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,193
I did it to beef up
my extracurricular activities.

257
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,611
I thought it was a fake club.

258
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,030
You lazy punk.

259
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,659
The smart ones are worse, I tell you.

260
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,501
Hey, Baeggyul.
It must be hard doing this alone.

261
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,419
Sorry?

262
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:58,757
Here.

263
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,801
Your assistant.

264
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,386
What?

265
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,350
Come right away after school, okay?

266
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:13,939
Yeah...

267
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,097
The more I think about it,
the more pissed off I get.

268
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,390
-Minju.
-Yes?

269
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,642
Look at this.
It's what I told you about.

270
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,727
What is it?

271
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,021
This is it. Isn't it pretty?

272
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,398
This cost 320,000 won?
Someone stole this?

273
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,233
You're both insane.

274
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,652
The bastard who receives
such an expensive gift,

275
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,697
and the high school bitch
who spends that much money on a guy.

276
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,240
Hey, don't be so mean.

277
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,868
So? When is your 100-day anniversary?

278
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,369
Next week.

279
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,206
What's this?

280
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,460
Wait, what happened now?
The quantity went down by one.

281
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,504
What am I going to do?

282
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,426
What do I tell Kitae?

283
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,594
Cheer up.

284
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,973
Hey, your hair.

285
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:35,562
I've had a fucking stressful day.

286
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,773
Aren't you guys hot?

287
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,649
Hey, your hair...

288
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,612
You said you'd rather die
than get your hair cut. Oh, my...

289
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,030
Is it fucking ugly?

290
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:46,865
It's fucking pretty.

291
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,033
-I love you.
-Me too.

292
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,286
Jiye.

293
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,164
Add a number to the blacklist.

294
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,082
Say it.

295
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,292
I shared it in the group chat room.

296
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,169
ANOTHER DIRTBAG.

297
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:02,631
That asshole. Why did he have to cut
my bangs? That son of a bitch.

298
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,424
Shit, he cut your hair?

299
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,719
It must be a fetish or something.

300
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,388
What? Is he a psycho?

301
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,264
What was Mr. Lee doing?

302
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,018
That old man was fucking late.
It's so fucking annoying.

303
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,650
Whatever.

304
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,529
I feel like crap. Let's call it a day.

305
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,199
-Let's go out. It's on me!
-Really?

306
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,326
-What's that?
-Where did you get this money?

307
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,911
Did you get settlement money?

308
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,247
I did. I got fucking lots.

309
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,874
Hey, it was fucking hilarious.

310
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:42,504
I took option B, and asked Mr. Lee

311
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,798
to beat the crap out of that asshole.

312
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:49,594
He got his ass whooped begging me
to let him go then rushed out.

313
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,222
He withdrew a shitload of cash.
Talk about profit.

314
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,225
Shit, awesome. Uncle's really useful.

315
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,726
-I give him credit.
-Me too.

316
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,644
By the way,

317
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,064
I wonder what Uncle looks like.
How old do you think he is?

318
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,442
Well...

319
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,487
-He may be a fucking fat and ugly geek.
-I hate those types.

320
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,574
Hey. Why is she so down in the dumps?

321
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,200
She has no fucking energy at all.

322
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,577
She needs to eat meat.

323
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,954
Meat sounds good.

324
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:16,872
Let's go.

325
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,331
-Yes!
-What are you gonna wear?

326
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,251
-Should I wear this?
-Excited!

327
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,003
-What are you gonna wear?
-Hurry up!

328
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,713
Hang on. Let me change first!

329
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,339
Seriously...

330
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,842
I can't go out dressed like this.

331
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,093
Come on!

332
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,138
SOCIAL ISSUES RESEARCH CLUB

333
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,267
Okay, next old fogy question.

334
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,645
Question 14.

335
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:45,775
"What should the school do regarding
homosexual students at the school?"

336
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,527
How's it relevant?

337
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,404
It's totally related.

338
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,782
Why should the school do anything
about students' sexuality?

339
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,701
Homosexuality isn't a crime.

340
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,203
I give you props.

341
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,456
-Let's take that one off the list.
-Mr. Cho.

342
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,042
Stop using slang.
It sounds awkward when you say it.

343
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,419
No. I'll keep using it.

344
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,213
-Next.
-Hold on.

345
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,637
Jisoo...

346
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,307
Jeez, he must have never had
seasoned fries.

347
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,266
You dumb hick.

348
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,939
I'm feeding you only fast food

349
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,441
until you learn
how to eat seasoned fries properly.

350
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,195
Question 18.

351
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,657
"I've seen or heard about prostitution

352
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,325
occurring around me."

353
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,493
What about it?

354
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,204
Likewise, It's none
of the school's business.

355
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,874
What? This is definitely something
the school should care about.

356
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,711
Sex workers' rights is
a controversial issue that never ends.

357
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,048
"It's a legitimate labor
of providing a service."

358
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,593
"No, it isn't. It is unethical."
Blah Blah Blah.

359
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,304
Isn't this going too far
by ignoring the dispute?

360
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,933
You're taking it too far. The dispute
and the law are different things.

361
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,857
Regardless, prostitution is a crime
according to the current laws.

362
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,694
Plus, this is about minors.

363
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,114
It's the police that should handle
a legal matter, not the school.

364
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:16,950
Sure, if the school is only
supposed to teach kids academics.

365
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:19,202
That's actually how it is now, isn't it?

366
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,372
Wow, look how this kid talks
in front of her teacher.

367
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,002
Jisoo, don't you have any input on this?

368
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,048
You must have thoughts and ideas too.

369
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,801
I really want to know.

370
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,933
I think the person will be ostracized.

371
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,024
If someone says
they saw the prostitution scene,

372
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,693
and her name is revealed,

373
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:55,071
she won't be able to keep going to school.

374
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,752
It's not about right or wrong,

375
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,881
but about consideration
for the person involved?

376
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,930
You're surprisingly thoughtful, Jisoo.

377
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,398
Actually, what Jisoo said is
exactly what I want from you guys.

378
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,526
Are these questions really based

379
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,447
on proper respect for the students
at this school?

380
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,076
If not, fix it
from the student's perspective.

381
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,246
We'll work on it this weekend.

382
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,294
-What do you say?
-What?

383
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,755
Do you have time this weekend?

384
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:55,590
Me?

385
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,182
Leave the house and do other stuff.
At least on the weekends.

386
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,483
GYURI BAE

00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,240
I can do the questionnaire myself.

389
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,534
Don't bother if you're busy.

00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,672
JOB REQUEST, MINHEE

391
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:51,896
I can help...

392
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,357
If you need my help...

393
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,692
No, it's fine.

394
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,405
Let me help.

395
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,037
What should I do?

396
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,130
SECOND-HAND MARKETPLACE

397
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,440
Tomorrow at one o'clock?

398
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,618
One o'clock at Famous Lamb.

399
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,298
Hello?

400
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,342
Urgent notice.

401
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,511
We will be closed tomorrow.

402
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,389
We will not accept
coordination or protection requests.

403
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,225
Confirmed.

404
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,978
In the meantime, repair your phone.

405
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,189
Okay, will do.

406
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,149
Mr. Lee.

407
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,776
Yes?

408
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,444
Thank you always.

409
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,239
What?

410
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,491
Enjoy your day off.

411
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,744
Ha, ha, ha.

412
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,264
Shit, it doesn't open!

413
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:51,891
Fix this shit!

414
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,476
Damn it.

415
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,896
When are we supposed to work,
if not on weekends?

416
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,314
He does whatever he wants.

417
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,483
What the fuck! I can't stand this shit.

418
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,028
What is it?

419
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,781
What?

420
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,664
A discount for the day off.

421
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,418
Ha! What the fuck?

422
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,796
Old Man.

423
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,508
Can't you work with just me
over the weekend?

424
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,510
I won't tell the girls.
I'll pay you more.

425
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,137
-Your foot.
-Shit.

426
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,556
Please? I'm begging you.

427
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,182
I'm going to die.

428
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,269
I'm going to meet some psycho
and get slashed to death.

429
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,605
You'll regret it then, Old Man. I mean it!

430
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,649
Where are you going? Old Man!

431
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,903
Old Man! I'm really going to die!

432
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,820
Old Man!

433
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:46,988
Hey!

434
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,593
Hi.

00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,025
Eleven, twelve...

442
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:10,947
Hey!

443
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,908
Why are you here so early?

444
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,246
Hi.

445
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,498
Can we go inside?

446
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,307
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

447
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,353
Let me know when you're ready to order.

448
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,524
I'll have a double shot espresso, please.

449
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,944
Espressos have just the shot
without any water. Is that okay?

450
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,614
A double shot espresso and...

451
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,034
Iced royal milk tea
in regular size, please.

452
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,327
-So, that's two in total, correct?
-Yes.

453
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,539
I'll pay.

454
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,375
Sure.

455
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,712
A strawberry and whipped cream cake too.

456
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,063
That will be 20,500 won.

457
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,173
Hey, look. Gyuri.

458
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,094
It's my mom.

459
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,429
I'll be right back.

460
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,751
-It's your first time at a cafe, right?
-Yes. I mean, no.

461
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:33,756
-Yes.
-Are you saying it is or isn't?

462
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,219
Let's finish this quickly.

463
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,097
-Where were we?
-What about your mom?

464
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,307
What?

465
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:44,976
Is she well?

466
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:51,107
-Yes, she is. Is your mom well?
-I don't know. She left me.

467
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,833
Why is this so funny to me?

468
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,126
You're fucking random.

469
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,096
What the heck?

470
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,515
Wasn't it meant to be a joke?

471
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,978
Did I just put my foot in my mouth?

472
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:31,314
No, it's okay. Just don't tell anyone.

473
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,492
What about your dad?
Are they both gone?

474
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,205
Do you live alone, then?

475
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,169
Since when?

476
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,922
Since the end of ninth grade.

477
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,426
Wait, that was when we were
in the same class.

478
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,137
But no one knows you live alone?

479
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,598
Even Mr. Cho?

480
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,478
Will it get annoying if people find out?

481
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,482
Unbelievable.

482
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,736
-How are you alive?
-What?

483
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,572
It takes money to stay alive.
How do you pay rent?

484
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:24,075
How'd you pay
for your uniform and stuff?

485
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,452
Well...

486
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,913
I work part-time.

487
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:30,957
What do you do?

488
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,334
Just this and that.

489
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,127
"This and that"?

490
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,838
-A male escort or something?
-What?

491
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,635
I was just kidding.
With that face? No way.

492
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,312
Actually...

493
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,816
With a little work...

494
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,568
You might not be so bad.

495
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,417
Anyway, you are so fucking commendable.

496
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,923
Commendable?

497
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,342
You've been through hell
for a year and half

498
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,427
without your parents.

499
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,723
But are you okay telling me these things?

500
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,416
Hey, what's wrong?

501
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,086
Why are you crying out of the blue?
Are you bipolar?

502
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,090
It's just that no one's ever told me
those things before.

503
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,877
You can sit there and relax.

504
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:42,713
-Babe.
-Yes?

505
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,131
How old are you?

506
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:45,966
How old do I look?

507
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:55,893
What do you think?

508
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,562
You look good in glasses.

509
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,231
I hear that often.

510
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,776
You're hurt.

511
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,653
Yes, a little.

512
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,533
Take off your bag.

513
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:12,952
Oh, I like having it on.

514
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,247
I'll go wash up first.

515
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,207
Yeah, shall we wash together?

516
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,167
-No, rest here.
-Okay.

517
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,755
-Wash up.
-Okay.

518
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,098
Call the old man.

519
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,977
Go on.

520
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,146
That fucking old man.

521
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,456
Um, I need to use the restroom.

522
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,713
Doggo, check messages.

523
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:09,925
I could not understand. Bad Doggo.

Why isn't he answering?

535
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,111
You sons of bitches.

536
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,155
You scumbags.

Hey!

540
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,261
Oh, so scared!

541
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,388
No, I won't hurt you.

542
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:41,058
Okay, isn't there anyone else
you can call?

543
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,852
No. Okay, all right.

544
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:44,853
Anyone?

545
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,939
Damn it!

546
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,567
This isn't what I expected.

547
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,447
Uncle.

548
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,452
Uncle, I know you're off today,

549
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,915
and I know
you have nothing to do with this,

550
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,294
but...

551
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,172
you'll come get me, right?

552
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,426
You won't abandon me, right?

553
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,395
You have no more unread messages.

554
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,920
Why aren't they coming? Why!

555
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,256
-Why aren't they?
-Stop it, for fuck's sake!

556
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,677
-Thank you.
-I need one of these. Hurry up.

557
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,889
Those are all the batteries that we have.

558
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,478
-It's not there?
-Shit!

559
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,830
Listen carefully.

560
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,416
I have to find that old man from before.

561
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,334
That bastard.

562
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,129
That bastard who beats people up!

563
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,923
He needs to get beat up just as much.

564
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:19,925
That's only fair, right?

565
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,386
Right?

566
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,472
Shit!

567
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,517
-You asshole!
-Your nose!

568
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:29,810
Stay still.

569
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,565
Why are you bitching about that to me?

570
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,566
Are you okay?

571
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,527
What do you want me to do?

572
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:40,696
Fuck!

573
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,783
Mister, what are you doing there?

574
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,747
You can't make a mess here. Please leave.

575
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:51,999
Mister!

576
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,377
Jeez, am I talking to myself here?

577
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,464
Hey! Oh, my god!

578
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,016
Mister, here's your change.

579
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:12,895
I'm calling the cops.

580
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,822
Stay still, okay?

581
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,575
You bitch.

582
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,213
-It's him!
-Shit, come on.

583
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,756
It's him!

584
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:46,970
Client.

585
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,348
Are you all right?

586
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,518
This is it! That robotic voice!

587
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,437
Let me confirm your current location.

588
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,606
Are you at W2 Motel, Room 805?

589
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:02,319
I will now give you instructions
regarding how to exit the premises,

590
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,904
bypassing the elevator.

591
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,365
One, exit the room through the door.

592
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,658
Two, turn right.

593
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,743
Three, make a left at the end of the hall.

594
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,496
Four, descend the emergency staircase.

595
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,290
Five, take the back door
to the parking lot.

596
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,252
And six, exit. That's all.

597
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,671
-What is he talking about?
-Beats me.

598
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,967
The police will enter shortly
using the elevator. Please be careful.

599
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,969
Police? You said they can't call the cops.

600
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,554
What do we do?

601
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,515
Hey! This is all bullshit, okay?

602
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:32,933
Think about it.

603
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,143
If the cops come, she'll be arrested too.

604
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,478
Then, they're all screwed.

605
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,021
Am I right?

606
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,817
You can't call the cops.

607
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,904
Look out the window in 15 seconds.

608
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,787
Shit.

609
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,499
Hey, police... We're screwed.
Come on, let's get out. Hurry!

610
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,251
-Where are you going?
-Hurry!

611
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,253
-Where are you going?
-Come on!

612
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:05,799
What is it...

613
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,596
Shit!

614
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,274
How may I help you?

615
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,234
Excuse me.

616
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,748
Fuck!

617
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:40,167
Fuck...

618
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:42,878
Fuck!

619
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,131
You know what happens if you talk, right?

620
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,133
Shit!

621
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,373
Excuse me.

622
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,376
Sir? Please open the door.

623
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,227
-What is it?
-Hello.

624
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,354
May we check your room briefly?

625
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,856
Well... Why?

626
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,110
Well... we received a tip
about prostitution of a minor.

627
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,696
What? What are you talking about...

628
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,155
It won't take long.

629
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,699
No, that's not...

630
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,201
-Well, I...
-Excuse us, sir.

631
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,453
That's not what...

632
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,579
Jeez.

633
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:03,083
-We'd appreciate your cooperation.
-That's not it, seriously.

634
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,751
Excuse us.

635
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,963
Gosh...

636
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,632
You see? I told you that's not it.

637
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,219
-Gosh.
-I told you we shouldn't do this.

638
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,930
What are you talking about?
You said you'll do it.

639
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,099
Let me see your ID, sir.

640
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,059
Why would I have my ID right now?

641
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,324
Excuse me.

642
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,660
Are you looking for this?

643
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:38,553
"It was the wind
that raised 80 percent of me.

644
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,307
The more I see the world,
the more shameful it is."

645
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,185
When you read
Seo Jungju's Self Portrait,

646
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,105
you can see his sense of linguistics.

647
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:52,400
His poetic language shows
how the Korean language maximizes

648
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,277
the potential of linguistic expression.

649
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:56,863
GYURI

650
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:02,119
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED EARLIER TODAY

651
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:05,122
SOMETHING REALLY URGENT CAME...

652
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,279
KYEWANG HIGH SCHOOL COMMUNITY

653
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,828
WOULD YOU LIKE TO POST THIS?

654
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,466
Well, what brings you here...

655
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:00,802
Have fun.

656
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,140
Shit.

657
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,559
Damn it.

658
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,793
OJI
SORRY

659
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:38,965
HELLO, I SAW YOUR POSTING ONLINE.
IS IT SOLD ALREADY?

660
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,681
WHICH ONE?

661
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,901
400,000 WON

662
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,469
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

663
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,015
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.
