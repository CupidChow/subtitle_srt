1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,799
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,927
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,517
Oh, hello.

4
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,187
Is this Gilsung Park's phone?

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,022
I'm not a telemarketer.

6
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,150
I don't know if you remember me,
but I'm Jisoo, Jisoo Oh.

7
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,526
Yes, that's right.

8
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,903
It's because...

9
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,157
I was wondering
if you spoke to my dad recently.

10
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,869
Well, it's just that...

11
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,996
I miss him so much.

12
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,460
I see.

13
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,463
Jung-gu, Ulsan.

14
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,180
What the heck? Where are you going?

15
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,102
Hey, this isn't yours.

16
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,187
This isn't yours, you jackass.

17
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,149
Damn it.

18
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,859
Shit.

19
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,780
Give me my phone.

20
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,490
I didn't bring it.

21
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,829
Why won't you give it back?

22
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,414
What can you do with it?

23
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,582
Blackmail.

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,710
What on earth do you want?

25
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:51,838
Let me in on what you're doing.
I want to make money too.

26
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,382
Seriously, shit...

27
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,638
Hey, didn't you like my idea?

28
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,766
I showed you those judo kids.

29
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,853
They look dope.
I'll hook you up with them.

30
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,273
Stop your crazy talk.

31
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,402
What? If this is crazy talk,

32
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,404
what's everything you've been doing?

33
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,407
What?

34
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,993
Are you uncomfortable
selling guys or something

35
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,620
because you're a guy as well?

36
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,871
Why, you... shit.

37
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,044
You're going to your dad, right?

38
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,378
To get your money.

39
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,341
Where is he? I'll go with you.

40
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,926
Why would you go there?

41
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,596
You lost your money because of me.
I'll help you get it back.

42
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,067
-Hey.
-What?

43
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,736
-Just bring me my phone.
-Take my offer.

44
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,530
Don't give me that cock and bull story.

45
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,491
Hey.

46
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,576
Do you even have money for the bus?

47
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,788
Hey, you're dead broke, aren't you?

48
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,831
Right? You're dead broke.

49
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,251
Hey, you broke punk.

50
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,795
I know you're dead broke.

51
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,343
SEOUL TO ULSAN

52
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,683
GILLIM VILLA 47-3, JUNG-GU, ULSAN

53
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,809
Gillim Villa?

54
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,018
Jeez.

55
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,270
47-3?

56
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,722
Wow. Do people actually live
in these buildings?

57
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,206
Wow.

58
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,381
Where did you learn that?

59
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,133
YouTube.

60
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,471
YouTube?

61
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,367
What the hell?

62
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,314
Well, we got in.

63
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,109
What next?

64
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,386
Damn it.

65
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,896
I guess your dad hasn't run away yet.

66
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,358
His clothes and stuff are still here.

67
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,946
Are you going to wait?

68
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,866
I have to.

69
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,386
It was about 60 million won, right?

70
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,891
If it took you a year and a half
to save that,

71
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,310
that means...

72
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,438
you saved about 3,333,333 won a month.

73
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,650
Let's get more people
and aim for five million per month.

74
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,112
How much did you pay the puppet boss?

75
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,948
Don't talk about him like that.

76
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,075
-Then what should I call him?
-We're partners.

77
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,827
We're equal.

78
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,122
It seems like he doesn't even know
the pimp's face.

79
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:19,582
Partner, my ass.

80
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
Pimp? Who?

81
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,298
-Me?
-If not, what?

82
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,300
-I run a security service.
-Security...

83
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,719
What?

84
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,387
Hey, look.

85
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,725
I get requests from clients.
I protect them from physical harm.

86
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,520
I manage their clients for them.
I coordinate pickups.

87
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,689
-How can you call that a pimp?
-You are a pimp, to a T.

88
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,733
I'm talking to a wall.

89
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,443
Hey.

90
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,259
Anyway, I get it. Fine.

91
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,179
You should think
about what I suggested before.

92
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,681
Let's make money together.

93
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,684
I don't care if you're a pimp
or a security service provider.

94
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,352
Why do you want to do this?

95
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,563
For the money, what else?

96
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,480
Exactly.

97
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,150
Why do you need money?

98
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,445
Isn't your family loaded?

99
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,524
Get some more sleep. You seem tired.
It's been a while.

100
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,739
Hey, wait. Hold on.

101
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,823
Hey, you.

102
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,117
You must be his girlfriend.

103
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,535
Right?

104
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,371
Where's my money?

105
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,041
Hey, you're pretty.
Why are you with Jisoo?

106
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,334
He's got nothing...

107
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,503
Hey, what is that?

108
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,588
What... hold on, wait.

109
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,176
Hey.

110
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,678
Where's my money?

111
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,972
-I can't feel my tongue, so I can't--
-Where's my money?

112
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,808
How dare you yell at your dad?

113
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,314
HAPPY BIT
THE MOST SECURE SITE FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY

114
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,404
The login process is so complicated
every single time.

115
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,656
Oh my gosh, you scared me.

116
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:39,824
What is this?

117
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,826
Hold on, this...

118
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,203
I'm in. Look.

119
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,038
Okay, so this...

120
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,749
Well,

121
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,335
I got some inside information recently.

122
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,170
This is that.

123
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,715
This is called "Doolycoin."

124
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,883
It's what...

125
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,010
-the big party got into.
-What?

126
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,263
You idiot.

127
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,598
-What is he on about?
-You're so ignorant.

128
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,767
Okay, look.

129
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,646
You see, it looks like
it's crawling on the bottom?

130
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,482
But by the end of the month,
it'll jump way up.

131
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,484
Get it?

132
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,319
It must be a new cryptocurrency.

133
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:22,742
This looks like a dine-and-dash scam.

134
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,118
Don't tell me

135
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,537
you dumped his money into this.

136
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,457
Why not? Of course I did.

137
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,461
How much did you put in?

138
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,756
All in.

139
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,676
Don't worry.

140
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,263
Huh?

141
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,434
JUNGJIN OH'S PROFIT AND LOSS
-91.10%

142
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,437
What's this? What does this mean?

143
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,690
Your dad blew 91.1 percent of your money.

144
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,151
What?

145
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,986
JUNGJIN OH'S PROFIT AND LOSS
-91.30%

146
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,987
Now 91.3 percent.

147
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,740
No, no. This... Well, it's...

148
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:06,827
This is a bit worse than I thought,
but this, this is all part of a plan.

149
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,162
Hey, what are you...

150
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,458
-What are you doing?
-Saving what I can.

151
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,586
Shit, no. They're just trying
to get small investors to sell.

152
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,921
Don't be stupid!

153
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,089
You don't have a clue, you little punk!

154
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,634
Give it back! We need to salvage
what little we can.

155
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,594
-Let go.
-Let go of it!

156
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,472
Shit, no!

157
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,726
Shit!

158
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,979
Shit, look what you did!

159
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,398
The mousepad.

160
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,317
No, please.

161
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:42,071
Why did you break this? Why?

162
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,615
Why did you break it?

163
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,495
Who will pay for this?
This was so expensive.

164
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,164
No, no...

165
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,185
What will you do about this?
I'm going crazy.

166
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,072
Gosh, what the...

167
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:30,786
Hey.

168
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,914
Where are you going?

169
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,879
Where are you going?

170
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,885
Where are you going? Tell me!

171
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,554
Home.

172
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,308
What?

173
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,147
What's this? Are you giving up?

174
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,525
Hey.

175
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:06,238
You need to get at least some of it back.
Threaten him or torture him.

176
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,407
Will you just let that bastard off?

177
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,450
He's my dad.

178
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,415
What do you want me to do?

179
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,840
What about everything you've done?

180
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,761
You're just going to give it all up?

181
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,097
Aren't you upset?
Doesn't that piss you off?

182
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,897
Then what do you want me to do?

183
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,225
Don't.

184
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,063
Don't say anything, not a word.

185
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,944
What did I say?

186
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,116
Everything you say is part of a scheme.
Every single word.

187
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,537
So don't say anything to me.

188
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,017
ULSAN TO SEOUL

189
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,602
Let's check. There they are.

190
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,520
Over there.

191
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,646
Let's go eat.

192
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,596
Is it good?

193
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,225
What are you trying to do?

194
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,812
Why aren't you taking any jobs lately?

195
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,105
I told you.

196
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,524
We're taking a break indefinitely.

197
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,695
We're going to hit menopause
if we rest any longer.

198
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,031
How long will that break last?

199
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,866
Until Uncle says it's over.

200
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:57,993
-Something happened to him?
-I don't know.

201
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,244
Was he arrested?

202
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,456
-Is he on the run?
-I don't know.

203
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,178
What is that?

204
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,722
Count it. See if that will do.

205
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,103
We'll find the customers,

206
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,563
so just stay close if there's a psycho

207
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,815
and pick us up on time.

208
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,025
We need insurance to do our jobs.

209
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,995
Don't make things complicated.

210
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,042
What is your relationship with him?

211
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,879
I just don't get it.

212
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,966
What's the difference
whether you get it from Uncle or from us?

213
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,760
Money is money, isn't it?

214
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,938
Please scan your card.
Insufficient balance.

215
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,107
Insufficient balance.

216
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,527
Insufficient balance.

217
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:23,871
Jisoo.

218
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,082
We haven't received your payment
for next month.

219
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,500
Is everything okay?

220
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,043
Well...

221
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,965
I won't be going to the academy
for the time being.

222
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,675
What? Why not?

223
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,677
I was told to skip next month.

224
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,845
By whom?

225
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,600
My dad.

226
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,810
I don't get it.

227
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,313
Your midterm exams are coming up.

228
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,274
Yes.

229
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,611
I know, but I plan to focus
on the textbooks for a while.

230
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,447
You shouldn't rely too much
on what they teach you in school.

231
00:19:58,989 --> 00:19:59,823
I know.

232
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,035
Anyway, will you be back the month after?

233
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:05,579
Well...

234
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,748
You haven't given up on college, have you?

235
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,000
No, I haven't.

236
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:14,796
Then tell your dad to make sure
he sends the payment next month, okay?

237
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,675
Your class is full
until the end of the year.

238
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,344
All right?

239
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,784
APRIL 7, MR. LEE

240
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,495
CHECKING IN. ARE WE WORKING TODAY?

241
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,332
Sloths are very lazy animals.

242
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,712
They move so slowly

243
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:02,177
that it is amazing that they are still
in existence and have not gone extinct.

244
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,303
MIDTERM EXAMS D-12

245
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,721
APRIL 10
ARE WE WORKING TODAY?

246
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:05,973
Why was he shocked?

247
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,766
Once they stop moving,

248
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,476
they may stay still

249
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,772
in the same position for days on end.

250
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,774
I was astonished.

251
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:19,069
However, due to such slow movements,

252
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:24,241
they are not easily seen by predators,
and they can continue to live in hiding.

253
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,785
Give me that for a minute.

254
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:32,291
We were dispatched here around one...

255
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,543
Okay, here it is.

256
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,712
That's her!

257
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,589
The girl with the funny thing dangling
from her bag.

258
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,549
What about her?

259
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,843
-What did she do wrong?
-Well...

260
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,471
What do you think a young girl like her
did at a motel?

261
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,931
Especially in broad daylight.

262
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,351
Are you saying young kids

263
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,520
can't make love in broad daylight?

264
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,399
Gosh, you are much more conservative
than you seem.

265
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,359
If she were here with her boyfriend,

266
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,987
they would've gone up together,
holding hands.

267
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,613
But she went up alone.

268
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,741
She left alone too.

269
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:09,828
Do you plan to accuse everyone
who goes to motels alone of prostitution?

270
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,288
Well, you know.

271
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,667
Is it common for young people like her
to come here during the day?

272
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,754
Well, it's usually older people
during those hours,

273
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,213
wearing hiking clothes.

274
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,759
You said there's no camera
on the eighth floor, right?

275
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:31,266
My gosh, the guests would freak out
if a motel had a lot of cameras.

276
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,689
That means there's no way
to check which room she went into.

277
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,612
Sir, please email this to us.

278
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,531
-Sure.
-I can tell she's a teen at a glance.

279
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,456
Here's your food.

280
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,168
Yes, noodles. It looks so yummy.

281
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,711
Thanks, Minhee.

282
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,464
Okay, Hubby. Enjoy.

283
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,384
How is it? Is it good?

284
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:06,927
I want a bite.

285
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,934
Okay. Nice.

286
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,355
FIVE MINUTES REMAINING

287
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,650
-Minhee, extend.
-What?

288
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,112
-Hurry up. I just started. Extend it.
-What?

289
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,038
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

290
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,125
Please extend his time.

291
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,293
-For the full 10,000 won?
-Yes.

292
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,561
-Hey, Kwakki.
-Hold on.

293
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,438
-Hey, look at me.
-What?

294
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,859
If I were a broke bitch with no money,
would you dump me?

295
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:04,776
Yes.

296
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,445
-Okay, where are you?
-Gosh!

297
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,406
Don't give me that crap.
Answer me for real.

298
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,700
What's your problem? What is it?

299
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,619
Tell me. What do you like about me?

300
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,912
Why are you dating me?

301
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,330
Your tits?

302
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,333
You fucking prick!
Give me a proper answer!

303
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,545
Okay, okay. I like everything.

304
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,214
I fucking love everything about you.

305
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,593
There's no heart in your answer.

306
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,845
Shit. We're dating.
Why do you need my heart?

307
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,514
You son of a bitch.
Listen to this asshole talk.

308
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:38,143
Hey, you sound like
you don't really like me.

309
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,896
Are you dating me for my money?

310
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,149
Obviously I'm dating you
partly for your money.

311
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,901
And partly because I like your tits.

312
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,195
I'd be lying if I denied it.

313
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,114
You jackass, are you kidding me?

314
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,159
What about you?

315
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:58,288
If I weren't the top dog in our grade,
would you be dating me?

316
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,583
Would you be dating me
if I were a fucking loser?

317
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,544
Okay, I'm getting out.

318
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,254
Jump.

319
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,233
Hello, I've been waiting for your call.

320
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,568
Please resume business.

321
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,112
Please report your current location.

322
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,908
I'm 15 minutes from the standby location.

323
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,786
Are you able to mobilize right now?

324
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,831
Are you able to make a deposit right now?

325
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,925
Repeat, please.

326
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,803
I haven't received this month's pay yet.

327
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,349
You know that, correct?

328
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,727
Yes, of course I do.

329
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,064
I will start working again
as soon as you make the deposit.

330
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,239
Is there a problem?

331
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,241
No, for the deposit,

332
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,035
please wait a short while.

333
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:23,957
Please prepare to resume business
in the meantime and stand by.

334
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,668
We are ready.

335
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,714
How long should I wait?

336
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,729
I will notify you later on. I'll call you.

337
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,022
Understood.

338
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,611
How long do you plan
to idle away your time?

339
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,404
When do we start work again?

340
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,616
Once I get my pay.

341
00:26:58,992 --> 00:26:59,951
Why are you here?

342
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,955
I came to ask when we'll be working again.
Why else would I be here?

343
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,373
Hey.

344
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,838
Can you even work?

345
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,257
Hey, mister.

346
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,550
Look.

347
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,261
Take a good look.
Do I look like a crazy bitch?

348
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,056
I'm all better now. I told you.

349
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,475
Why are you so obsessed with this work?

350
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,143
It's for the money, obviously.

351
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,812
Why do you need money?

352
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,231
What's it to you?

353
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,655
Youngsin Seo.

354
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,492
That's your aunt's name, right?

355
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,038
Both your parents

356
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,332
disappeared after the divorce.

357
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,171
Ever since then,

358
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,799
you've been living with your aunt.

359
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:00,136
Your aunt and uncle both have normal jobs.

360
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,721
They have a car

361
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,684
and a three-bedroom apartment
with only a year left on the mortgage.

362
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,143
Which of these is the reason

363
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,771
you need to make money?

364
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,028
You ran a background check on me?

365
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,989
Quit this work if you can.

366
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,492
Don't act like you care.
It doesn't suit you.

367
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,747
Did Uncle say
he's uncomfortable working with me?

368
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,461
I'm the one who's uncomfortable.

369
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,093
I think...

370
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,722
you've almost reached your limit.

371
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,515
Psychologically.

372
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,980
Once you pass that limit,

373
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,399
the responsibility goes to--

374
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,109
I said I'm fine!

375
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,872
Stop treating me like some crazy bitch.

376
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,666
You're so annoying.

377
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:47,619
MIDTERM EXAMS D-7

378
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,122
Yes, come in.

379
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,376
Hi, Minhee. What's up?

380
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,089
Can you fill out an early leave form
for me, please?

381
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,383
What's the reason?

382
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,718
My period.

383
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,179
Okay, bullshit.

384
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,224
You used that excuse last week.

385
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,518
I'm just dizzy and stuff.

386
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,562
I don't feel well.
Why don't you believe me?

387
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,397
I believe you don't feel well.

388
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,192
It's the period I don't believe.

389
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,906
You're a regular at the infirmary lately.

390
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,407
Who said that?

391
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,368
The nurse. Who else?

392
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,663
She says you look as pale as a ghost
at times.

393
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,873
Are you anemic?

394
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,376
Well...

395
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,378
I think so.

396
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,466
Mr. Cho, the vice-principal is looking
for you.

397
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,384
I know.

398
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,928
-Hey, Gyuri.
-Yes?

399
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,305
Put my seal on the early leave pass.

400
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,223
Okay.

401
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,017
Make sure to bring a doctor's note
this time, okay?

402
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,197
-Reason for leaving early?
-I'm sick.

403
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,575
Period?

404
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,381
Oh no, I don't see his seal.

405
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,967
He must have it with him.

406
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,637
-Shit.
-Why don't you just wait here?

407
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,891
He went to a teachers' meeting.
He'll be back soon.

408
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,952
You're dating Kitae, right?

409
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,457
Tell him to leave my boyfriend alone.

410
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,083
Why are you picking a fight?

411
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,711
I'm not. I feel bad for Jisoo. That's all.

412
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,881
He's dealing with a lot of crap right now.

413
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,343
Then take care
of your oh-so-great boyfriend.

414
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,930
That prick Kwakki doesn't listen
to a fucking thing I say.

415
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,932
That prick Oji doesn't listen
to me either.

416
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:16,184
All guys are the same.

417
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,275
Come to think of it,

418
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,112
didn't you say someone stole
your 100-day gift for Kitae?

419
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,531
-What's it to you?
-I heard it was really expensive.

420
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,910
No fucking kidding.

421
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,746
-Are you trying to humiliate me?
-No.

422
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,666
I can tell you genuinely like him.

423
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,003
You must have worked like hell
to buy that.

424
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:48,424
I wonder if I could do that for my man.

425
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,303
Well, our 22nd-day anniversary is
coming up soon.

426
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,181
Twenty-second day?
Shit, you're just babies.

427
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,562
What's your part-time job?

428
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,356
I'm a waitress.

429
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:05,608
How is it?

430
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,946
I don't know. I'm thinking about quitting.

431
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,699
Why? Is your boss a prick?

432
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:14,951
No, that's not it.

433
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,912
The store may be shutting down.

434
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,127
They're shutting down? Why?

435
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,964
The boss didn't get paid
by his boss or something.

436
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,882
Something like that.

437
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,344
I don't know. It's too complicated.

438
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,227
Jisoo Oh.

439
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,063
Face forward, come on.

440
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,066
Okay, you're done. Go.

441
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,736
Next, Mingi Guk.

442
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,446
There's a lot today.

443
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,656
So let me know
if you can't work overtime.

444
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,657
Yes, sir.

445
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,452
Come this way.

446
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,173
Put it down carefully.

447
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,887
-Name?
-Sangmin Lee.

448
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:19,474
Thank you.

449
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,727
-Name?
-Jisoo Oh.

450
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,062
Thank you.

451
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,906
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

452
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,075
I was told this was a highly paid job,

453
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,534
that it pays the highest wage.

454
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,452
And?

455
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,245
That is a lot.

456
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,290
Sign here.

457
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,045
PART-TIMER, JISOO OH

MR. LEE
EXPENSES, ACCOUNT BOOK

459
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,347
Food costs are...

460
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,436
Transportation.

461
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,188
Living expenses.

462
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,609
The academy is 2.2 million won.

463
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,263
MIDTERM EXAMS D-7

464
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,266
MIDTERM EXAMS D-6

MIDTERM EXAMS D-5

466
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,608
Who is it?

467
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,365
What the hell?

468
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,542
It's for you.

469
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,217
"Daddy, please let me in.

470
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,470
It's so cold out here."

471
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,264
Hey.

472
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,350
It'll die if you keep it in that.

473
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,227
You have a fish tank. Put it in there.

474
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,979
I threw it out already.

475
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,691
-So let's go buy a new one.
-I have no money.

476
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,692
I have money.

477
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,821
Shit, I don't want it.

478
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,160
"Daddy."

479
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,122
-"Daddy, don't you want me?"
-Damn it, what's her problem?

480
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,335
"Don't you want me? Don't abandon me."

481
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,558
It's moving.

482
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,107
No.

483
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,944
No, what?

484
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,696
You're up to something again.

485
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,950
What is this for?
What do you want me to do?

486
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,745
Are you shadow-boxing or something?
I didn't say anything.

487
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,914
Whatever it is, no.

488
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,958
I told you to keep it.

489
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,542
I won't take anything from you.

490
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,587
Why did you buy all this crap then?

491
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,464
You raise it. Don't kill it.

492
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,050
You wimp, you can't even take a handout!

493
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,764
"He's my dad."

494
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,267
That's the bullshit you said

495
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,519
after losing your life savings, nuts.

496
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,190
Hey.

497
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,609
What?

498
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,611
Why are you bringing that up now?

499
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,780
Are you a pushover?

500
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,992
How could you not say anything
and just leave like a moron?

501
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,452
Then what was I supposed to do?

502
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,829
Huh?

503
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,498
Should I beat him up or kill him?
My own dad, huh?

504
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,419
Oh, so did you magnanimously
forgive him? Are you Jesus?

505
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,546
What are you hoping for?

506
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:24,176
Do you think that asshole will
fucking repent and change

507
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,346
and beg you for forgiveness?
Will that resurrect your fucking family?

508
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,850
Your ideals are fucking cringy.

509
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,354
Hey, has he ever given you
a single penny to help you out?

510
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,524
He doesn't think of you as his son at all.

511
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,194
Shit.

512
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,327
A new record! You're awesome.

513
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,746
Congratulations.

514
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,004
-Take this.
-What is it?

515
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,131
It said, "Congratulations." Take it.

516
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,592
Take it.

517
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,095
Take this to the puppet boss
and get back to work.

518
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,308
What? Hey, how did you...

519
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,661
Hey.

520
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,997
What is all this?

521
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,791
I fenced some stuff

522
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,043
and took my allowance savings.

523
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,254
That's not what I mean.
Why are you giving this to me?

524
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,425
You'll go under without that.

525
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,971
We're partners now.

526
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,306
What?

527
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,974
I'm not giving it to you for free.

528
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,685
Hand over my shares.

529
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,479
Shares of what?

530
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,856
Shares of your business, of course.

531
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,069
Resume business

532
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,780
and call the judo guys you met last time.

533
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,157
I'm sure some of them will accept.

534
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,122
So easy.

535
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,165
What was that?

536
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,295
It's so easy for you.

537
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,216
You just buy everything with money.

538
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,556
Hey, I don't need it.

539
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,061
Hey, don't give me that crap. You need it!

540
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,312
I won't take your money.

541
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,314
Hey, you punk.

542
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,609
How much must I give for you to let me in?

543
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,069
Give me a number.

544
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,452
Do you find it fun?

545
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,704
What?

546
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:59,498
My life looks fucking fun to you, right?

547
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,222
That was it?

548
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,142
So Old Man won't take our money?

549
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,896
How long should we work
without protection?

550
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,731
They want us to just wait.

551
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,192
Then eventually, they'll call us.

552
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,528
It's not like they work alone.
It's fucking ridiculous.

553
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,821
Put that back on.

554
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,741
-What a waste.
-Whatever.

555
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,036
Why does she have a long face?

556
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,458
-Why are you here so late?
-What?

557
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,919
I said to come early today, bitch.

558
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,086
Get your act together.

559
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,922
What? You're always late too.

560
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,216
So what?

561
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,468
He didn't say why we're taking a break?

562
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,847
I don't know. Those sons of bitches are
so fucking mysterious.

563
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,726
Shit, I should report them
to the labor department.

564
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,102
Those pricks.

565
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,104
Maybe they're losing interest.

566
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:05,773
Uncle too.

567
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,274
What do you mean?

568
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,152
They've been doing sloppy work lately,

569
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,655
including that time with Minhee.

570
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,448
That's right.

571
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,785
Mr. Lee didn't even show up that time.
It was his day off, but still.

572
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:23,958
Hey, sit over there.

573
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:30,923
Guys.

574
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,051
Do you want to switch insurance companies?

575
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,178
No.

576
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,349
-What?
-I won't.

577
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,395
Minhee Seo.

578
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,106
Sit up.

579
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,948
Say that again. What?

580
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,827
I won't work without Mr. Lee.

581
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:01,996
Why not?

582
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,291
Just because it's uncomfortable.

583
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,002
And why is that?

584
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,087
I don't know.

585
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,132
There must be a reason.
Give it to me straight!

586
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,717
I just don't want to!

587
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,344
Why are you dying to sell your body?

588
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,723
Are you in heat or something?

589
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:27,938
Hey.

590
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,275
Minhee's out.

591
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,777
What about you girls?

592
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,530
You bitch.

593
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,294
MIDTERM EXAMS D-2

594
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,089
Who wrote this frightening thing?

595
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,633
The class president.

596
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,928
You little... He's pure evil.

597
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,515
Pure evil.

598
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,851
But I'm an old fogy.

599
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:08,896
So I will not teach my lessons
centered around exams.

600
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,859
Social stratification and inequality.

601
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,653
Page 132.

602
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,160
Okay, what is social stratification?

603
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,913
That's so unlike you.

604
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,666
Falling asleep in my class.

605
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,672
You groan like a constipated dog
when you miss taking only a few notes.

606
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:36,965
Is something wrong?

607
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,009
Pardon?

608
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,262
Does it have anything to do

609
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,099
with changing your mind
about transferring schools?

610
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,853
No, I'm just a bit tired.

611
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:50,938
Why are you tired?

612
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,190
Is it from studying?

613
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,737
Are you working or something lately?

614
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,077
You're so frustrating. Say something.
I need to know in order to help you.

615
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,829
I never asked for help.

616
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,498
-What?
-After all,

617
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,584
you have no way of helping me.

618
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,176
Are things really bad with your dad
these days?

619
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,854
Do you even have friends
you can vent to about your dad?

620
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,111
Excluding me. I'm a teacher,
so I have to stay within my boundaries.

621
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,488
No, I have no friends.

622
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,533
What about Gyuri?
You've been hanging out together.

623
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,535
I can't hang out with someone like her.

624
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,912
-Why not?
-Just...

625
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,918
She and I are too different.

626
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:55,836
Really?

627
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,922
You look the same to me.

628
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,799
-She and I?
-Yes.

629
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:03,177
In what way?

630
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,848
You two only know how to hold it all in
and bear it alone.

631
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,517
I can't stand to look at either of you.

632
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,520
Seeing you two breaks my heart.

633
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,276
Anyway.

634
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,737
So... What was it?

635
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,740
That's not important.

636
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,035
CLUB APPLICATION FORM

637
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,290
Why are you giving me...

638
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,375
Shut up. Will you do it or not?

639
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,962
You said you'd join,
but you haven't said anything for days.

640
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:40,839
Must I beg you?

641
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,057
What?

642
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,893
I need to study for my midterm exams.

643
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,771
The clubs don't meet
during exam periods anyway.

644
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:58,190
I have too much to do right now.

645
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:00,442
I'm sorry.

646
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,237
Hey.

647
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:10,661
That punk is so frustrating.

648
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,418
-Oji!
-Hi.

649
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,461
Where are you off to?

650
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,635
-They fought.
-They totally fought.

651
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,804
Did you two fight? Why did you fight?

652
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,347
Why did you fight?

653
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,765
MIDTERM EXAMS D-2

654
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,183
MIDTERM EXAMS D-1

655
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,561
MIDTERM EXAMS D-DAY

656
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:37,563
Take one and pass on the rest.

657
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,359
Take it seriously
as if this were the real CSAT. Okay?

658
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,237
-Yohan.
-Yes? I'll finish up.

659
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,827
Allot your time wisely.

660
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,371
-Answer me.
-Yes, ma'am.

661
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,648
Time's almost up. Get ready.

662
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,120
Baeggyul!

663
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,289
Did you do well?

664
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,458
Number four is five.

665
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,252
No, that's not it. It's two.

666
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,296
I'm telling you, it's two.

667
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:45,839
-Hey, hang on.
-Isn't it five?

668
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,215
Hey, quiet!

669
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,217
-Hey, one person at a time.
-Shut up.

670
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,719
-I'll do it.
-Okay, you read it.

671
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,678
Yes, you do it.

672
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,388
Focus. Starting from number one.

673
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,723
-One, three.
-One, three.

674
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,058
-Two, five.
-Two, five.

675
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,517
-Three, three.
-Three, three.

676
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,311
-Four, five.
-Four, five.

677
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,771
-Five, one.
-Five, one.

678
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,314
-Six, two.
-Six, two.

679
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,774
-Seven, three.
-Seven, three.

680
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,400
-Eight, five.
-Eight, five.

681
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,652
-Nine, four.
-Nine, four.

682
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,445
-And then...
-What's wrong?

683
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,031
-Thirty-five, four.
-Thirty-five, four.

684
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,824
-Thirty-six, two.
-Two.

685
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:14,826
-Thirty-seven, four.
-Four.

686
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,079
-Thirty-eight, one.
-Thirty-eight, one.

687
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,748
-Thirty-nine, one.
-Hold on.

688
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,668
-Forty, one.
-Forty, one.

689
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,420
-Forty-one, five.
-Forty-one, five.

690
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,297
-Forty-two, two.
-Two.

691
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,549
-Forty-three, two.
-Forty-three, two.

692
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,842
Forty-four, three.

693
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,719
-Forty-five...
-Four?

694
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,762
-Four.
-Okay.

695
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:34,930
Yes, nice.

696
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,848
I only got half right.

697
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,829
This is nuts.

698
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,581
I fucking can't stand you.

699
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,585
You acted like you were so smart.

700
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,505
But you were a fucking moron.

701
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,052
Hey, pipe down!

702
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,514
Our top-grade superstar, Oji got a 48.

703
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,976
-A 48?
-Look, he got less than half right.

704
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,561
-Let me see.
-Hey, look.

705
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,023
He must have been cheating all along.

706
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,026
He really got it all wrong.
Oh, my god, he screwed up.

707
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,112
Hey, I like that you work hard, but...

708
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:34,990
What will you do now?

709
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,826
You should change your study techniques.

710
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,537
I mean, what the hell is a 48?

711
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,247
Right?

712
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,461
Fuck, I can't stand this shit!

713
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,379
Are you okay?

714
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:58,513
Hey!

715
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,477
You're in.

716
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,146
What?

717
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,064
I'll let you in.

718
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,581
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

719
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:27,501
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.
