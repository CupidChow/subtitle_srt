00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,966
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,969
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,437
ONE YEAR AGO

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,401
GARBAGE

5
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:41,291
Hey. I told you, you can't just take that.

6
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,672
Hey. Don't take...

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,425
Fine, I'll give you this. Just this.

8
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:52,510
Hey.

9
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,096
You fucking beggar.

10
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,975
Stop coming, you fucking beggar!

11
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,645
Hey, pretty boy Jisoo. Come here.

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,355
Play with us!

13
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,525
-Hey, go in.
-Hey, Jisoo.

14
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,237
-Where are you going?
-Don't move, you asshole.

15
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,615
Hey, where are you going?

16
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,532
Jisoo!

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,627
You asshole. You want to die?

18
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,339
You nerd.

19
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,175
-How much is that?
-Hey.

20
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,384
Shit.

21
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,386
Hey, get up.

22
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,389
-Stop struggling.
-Shit.

23
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,141
Fuck!

24
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,101
Let me see!

25
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,020
-Wow.
-What is it?

26
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,857
-Give it to me.
-Hey!

27
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,234
Hurry and pick it up.

28
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,152
-Hurry and pick it up.
-Hey.

29
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,321
Don't mind us and just go.

30
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,281
Hurry and pick it up.

31
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,617
Just go.

32
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,709
What's his problem?

33
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:08,002
Shit.

34
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,732
-You son of a bitch!
-Shit.

35
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,317
Shit!

36
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,634
I'll handle it, okay?

37
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,177
The psycho asshole.

38
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,763
What will you do?

39
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,139
I'll handle it,

40
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,974
so just stay down.

41
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,771
Fine.

42
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,106
Do as you please.

43
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,152
Let go.

44
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,628
Areung's location has been detected.

45
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:17,799
AREUNG'S LOCATION
FIND AREUNG, 81M AWAY

46
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,217
Look in this direction.

47
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:21,803
Northeast.

48
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,139
Northeast.

49
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,476
Areung, daddy hurts there.

50
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,813
-Ouch!
-That is the wrong direction.

51
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,690
Recalculating the location.

52
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,942
Go straight.

53
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,069
Blow on it for me.

54
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,279
Areung.

55
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,781
Areung.

56
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,827
-You have arrived at your destination.
-Areung.

57
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,706
-Look for Areung nearby.
-Wow, it works fine!

58
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,670
Can't I just follow that Uncle
or whatever he's called?

59
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,382
Let's use methods befitting
the fourth industrial revolution.

60
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,301
It's nice to look so cool.

61
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,636
I don't think
the fourth industrial revolution

62
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,221
and a pet tracker are related.

63
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,558
Hey. This was hard to get, you punk.

64
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,645
Even the American FBI bought
this technology.

65
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,189
We can't find anything this good in Korea.

66
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,191
-Right, Areung?
-Gosh.

67
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,193
Fine. Let's see what it is, then.

68
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:20,903
Open it.

69
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,199
HERBAL MEDICINE

70
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,454
-Nice!
-Enough for the old man's hospital bills?

71
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,539
Where did you plant the device?

72
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,624
You're so clueless.

73
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,918
Hold on, Areung.
Daddy needs to work.

74
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:43,968
It isn't here.

75
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,888
You can't see it right away.

76
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,100
Ta-da. It's well hidden, right?

77
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,352
Right, Areung?

78
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,394
Wow...

79
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,523
It looks pretty impressive like this.

80
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,985
Why are you taking that out? Shit!

81
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,779
Do you know how expensive this is?

82
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,740
Areung, hit him.
"You need a beating."

83
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,034
EARLY LEAVE PASS
FOR DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT

84
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,746
I told you to stay home and rest today.

85
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,415
Why did you insist on coming to school?

86
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,752
You're obsessed with attendance.

87
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,967
Eat lunch before you go.

88
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,095
I have no appetite.

89
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,640
-Here.
-Thank you.

90
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,016
That punk.

91
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,228
Hey, Jisoo.

92
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,732
-Yes?
-Has she contacted you since?

93
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,359
Minhee Seo.

94
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,056
This is my temporary number.
Please contact me when you see this.

95
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,391
NEW TEXT MESSAGE
UNCLE

96
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,310
THIS IS MY TEMPORARY NUMBER
PLEASE CONTACT ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS

97
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,378
Sir! It's me, Daeyeol Ryu.

98
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,172
Can I meet with AlphaGo today?

99
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,507
Even better if you and I can talk
in person.

100
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,425
Baeggyul.

101
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,636
Where's your boyfriend?

102
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,390
-Home.
-He didn't come to school again?

103
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,100
He left early.

104
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,269
Shit. Why?

105
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,107
Hey, Baeggyul.
Let's chat for a minute.

106
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,734
Get lost.

107
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,110
It's about Minhee.

108
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,028
Sure. Get lost.

109
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,447
I heard she does compensated dating.

110
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,325
She told me herself.

111
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,911
What bullshit is that? So what?

112
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,373
Why did you defend her
in front of me that time?

113
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,633
UNIDENTIFIED, MALE

114
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,025
Why did you come back?

115
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,402
Well...

116
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,739
I just wanted to see if he was recovering.

117
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,117
You're such a busybody.

118
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,247
Hey.

119
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,623
What?

120
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,333
Do you have money?

121
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,550
So, why did you bullshit me
about that Swarovski shit?

122
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,761
-This is why guys are useless.
-What?

123
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,808
It's Minhee's private life.
It's for her to decide.

124
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,185
You want me to tell you?

125
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,354
Are you insane?

126
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,608
Of course, I'd cover for her.
I'm a girl too.

127
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,361
What about Jisoo?

128
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,448
Why did he take my beating
and still not talk?

129
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,329
Because I told him not to tell you.

130
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,248
That asshole listens to girls,

131
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,417
unlike you, asshole.

132
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,546
Do you girls have
like a secret clan or something?

133
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,467
Why do you band together
when you're not even close?

134
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,012
-If you're done, I'm out.
-Hold on.

135
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,557
That's not important.

136
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:48,731
Didn't you hear more of what the cop said
from outside the counseling office?

137
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,650
Seriously...

138
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,319
Did you hear anything

139
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,988
about the pimp or stuff like that?

140
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,325
Shit.

141
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:04,163
Minhee is a wimp. She doesn't have
the guts to do that on her own.

142
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:05,956
I know her.

143
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,043
I'm sure some asshole has her back.

144
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,879
Why do you care so much
that you keep asking?

145
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,047
Shit, it's important.

146
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,632
You're a fucking loser.

147
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,176
Why?

148
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,388
Does your girl need to be clean,
no matter what?

149
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,684
Stealing is fine, but you can't forgive
her for selling her body?

150
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,352
Of course, I can't! You fucker!

151
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,734
But I have to. Fuck.

152
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,862
Shit.

153
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:38,948
Whatever.

154
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,367
So, did you hear or not?

155
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,910
No, that was all.

156
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,495
-You sure?
-I'm sure.

157
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,580
That cop was here to test Minhee.

158
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,752
She didn't mention any pimp
or anything. Satisfied?

159
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,389
That bitch. I can't read her mind at all.

160
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,520
Hey.

161
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,732
Did Mr. Cho say anything to you?

162
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,151
I'm fucking ignoring his calls.

163
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,988
He asked if I heard from you,
so I said no.

164
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,617
Didn't he ask you...

165
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,539
what you and I were doing there?

166
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,545
What did you say?

167
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:40,301
I said you asked me to tutor you,
so we went to McDonald's together.

168
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,137
Fuck. You moron.

169
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,265
How could you give him
such an unrealistic excuse?

170
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,196
Hey.

171
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,411
Shouldn't we just tell the cop the truth?

172
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,371
About what?

173
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,373
Just everything.

174
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,210
What I do...

175
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,257
I mean, what I used to do.

176
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,052
What do you mean?

177
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,013
-You'll get in trouble.
-Hey.

178
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,058
What could be worse than almost dying?

179
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,601
Didn't you see?

180
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,439
Seriously, that... That ax. That sound.

181
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,942
I get chills just thinking about it.

182
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,403
You'll go to jail.
The cops will arrest you.

183
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,740
-No, I won't.
-Yes, you will.

184
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,866
No, I won't.

185
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,202
I looked into it.

186
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,412
Even if I get caught, I won't go to jail.

187
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,791
Only that asshole will be fucked.

188
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:54,750
That asshole?

189
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,879
Just someone.
The asshole who takes our money.

190
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,551
That asshole deserves to be fucked.

191
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,901
You have to do it.

192
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,612
You have to lie.

193
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,657
What?

194
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,370
If you don't lie, you may die.

195
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,873
I said I won't die.

196
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,458
-The cops--
-Not the cops.

197
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,379
Him.

198
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,591
The one who takes your money.

199
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,051
What about him?

200
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,970
If you don't lie to the cops,

201
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,349
he may...

202
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,769
do something to you.

203
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,340
KITAE KWAK

204
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,980
-Hey.
-What?

205
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,649
Go up first.

206
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,235
-Why?
-I want a smoke.

207
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:49,990
And take this up.

208
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,804
Don't worry. You'll get promoted.

209
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,932
Even Seojun got promoted.
It'll happen next month.

210
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,016
What's the problem?

211
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,602
Just do a good job this time.

212
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,233
Did you give him the victim's phone?

213
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,990
Well, I gave it to him.

214
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,827
-What did Detective Kang say?
-Well...

215
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,789
He thanked me for the help.

216
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,293
They'll probably just bury it, right?

217
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,716
True. It's all circumstantial evidence.

218
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,719
Look, Haegyong.

219
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,389
Even if you keep digging,
it's just a mugging case.

220
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,350
Why are you so obsessed?

221
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,269
-Two people.
-Pardon?

222
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,063
Can I keep two officers
with me for a few days?

223
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,401
-What are you--
-That victim.

224
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,194
We need to monitor him.

225
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,072
How will you justify
putting people on him?

226
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,245
What's this?

227
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,374
It's a list of people
who came in for counseling.

228
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,836
-What about it?
-Do you see this mark?

229
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,130
This person is in that very hospital

230
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,716
with a back injury. What a pity, right?

231
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,878
You saw something you shouldn't have
in the middle of the night.

232
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,385
Are you... hurt anywhere?

233
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,682
No, thanks to you.

234
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,395
How are your injuries?

235
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,578
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,667
I wasn't able to help much back then.

237
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,637
We were...

238
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,268
We were just unlucky.

239
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,478
Sorry?

240
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,325
We were just unlucky.

241
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,204
Both you and I.

242
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,030
I... I'll go now.

243
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,074
Take care.

244
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,756
We were unlucky.

245
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,644
Shit.

246
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,451
Hey, AlphaGo!

247
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,954
It's me, Daeyeol. Yes.

248
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,122
Seriously!

249
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,791
Oh...

250
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,793
Did you go to school?

251
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,630
-Do you have--
-Seriously!

252
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,589
Okay.

253
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,300
Do you have evening study hall?

254
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,803
When I went to school,
the teachers used to beat up the kids

255
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,597
if they caught them skipping
evening study hall.

256
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,684
About wanting to meet today...

257
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,144
That's why I called.

258
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,147
What kind of food does your boss like?

259
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,566
Hey. Is he vegetarian or something?

260
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,486
When Mijung was a vegetarian,

261
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,655
it was so hard for me to eat rabbit food.

262
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,119
What do you mean?

263
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,996
Didn't you hear?

264
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,582
I'm meeting your boss later.

265
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,208
What?

266
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,210
Your boss said you can't make it.

267
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,963
I forgot to ask what he likes.

268
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,008
AlphaGo, what does Uncle like?

269
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,798
The person you have called is
not available--

270
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,262
I'll handle it, so just stay down.

271
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,477
LOOKING FOR A COMPENSATED DATE?

272
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,239
The person you have called is
not available--

273
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,242
Minhee is just straight up
ignoring my calls now.

274
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,749
-Hey.
-What?

275
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,708
Is it going well?

276
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,502
Yes.

277
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,174
"Is compensated dating available?"

278
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,635
Give me a fucking break.

279
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:50,679
-Hey.
-What?

280
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,222
Are you trying to be a loser?

281
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:53,723
Sorry.

282
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:55,267
I've never done this before.

283
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,603
Hey. They need to see her picture to know

284
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,772
who we're looking for, moron.

285
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,694
How can you find out by just chatting?
Upload the picture I gave you.

286
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:06,945
Okay.

287
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,370
I'm looking for a compensated date
that I met before.

288
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,913
Does she work for you?

289
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,500
DOES SHE WORK FOR YOU?

290
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:23,003
SHE DOESN'T WORK FOR US
NOT INTERESTED IN OTHER GIRLS?

291
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,256
Search all the rooms like that.

292
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,550
Check every single chat room.

293
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,719
But...

294
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,306
what will you do if you find them?

295
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,892
What if they're a gang?

296
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,394
Fuck. There aren't any gangs
in this day and age.

297
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,647
Anyway,

298
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,942
why are you suddenly so fucking curious?

299
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,320
You have so many questions.

300
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,868
If I find those assholes, I'll do this

301
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,745
-and fuck them over.
-Okay.

302
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,749
So just find their numbers.

303
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,710
Don't be curious. Okay?

304
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,421
Yes, Dominus.

305
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,055
MINHEE

306
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,917
I'M LOOKING FOR A GIRL I MET BEFORE
DOES SHE WORK FOR YOU?

307
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,258
Come in. This way, please.

308
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,766
I need to use the restroom first.

309
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,101
Sure. It's that way.

310
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,042
Eat up. The sashimi will dry up.

311
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,003
Eat. Stop looking at your phone.

312
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,255
-Shut up and eat.
-Gosh. Isn't she so sweet?

313
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,220
It would've been nice
if your boss made it.

314
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,515
Something urgent came up.

315
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,768
He said he's sorry
and that he'll meet you next time.

316
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,945
You should learn drinking
from an adult.

317
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,740
If you drink by yourselves,
you'll just throw up.

318
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,451
-Here, Mijung.
-Feed yourself.

319
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,621
Gosh. Mijung is so considerate of me.

320
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,457
What is it?

321
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,877
Would you like some rice?

322
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,838
Rice? We get fried rice later, right?

323
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,549
-Yes.
-I want white rice.

324
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,636
Geez. What about AlphaGo?
Fried rice, right?

325
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,055
No, I'm not hungry yet.

326
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,182
You guys don't know how to eat.

327
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,477
-Two bowls of rice, one fried.
-Okay.

328
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,813
-Please let us know if you need anything.
-Okay.

329
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,900
Hold on.

330
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,069
You're working hard.

331
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:38,323
-I only have one.
-Thank you.

332
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,496
You need to tip people
at places like this.

333
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,456
So they serve you well.

334
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,460
You see how she walked out backward?

335
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,253
I feel like a king.

336
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,008
Anyway, I'm disappointed.

337
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,510
I'm sorry.

338
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,261
Don't be.

339
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,931
This happens when you run a business.

340
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,267
It was because he thought nothing
of this meeting.

341
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,063
Don't be like that.

342
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,817
What would AlphaGo like?

343
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,320
Here.

344
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,656
Come on!

345
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,074
Open your mouth.

346
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,164
Give me a break.

347
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,083
How is it?

348
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,838
Shit.

349
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:39,217
Once you start,
I'll take you somewhere awesome.

350
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,179
Pardon?

351
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,640
We usually go somewhere else,

352
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,226
but... I couldn't get a reservation.

353
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,604
No, that's not what I mean.
When I start what?

354
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,817
You're going to work full-time
from now on.

355
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,362
-Pardon?
-Our dorm is awesome.

356
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,615
-It's like a bed and breakfast.
-Give me a fucking break.

357
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,284
It doesn't even have hot water.

358
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,536
It takes a while to heat up rainwater.

359
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,414
Mijung is the boss lady.

360
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,417
Look at this. It's huge.
Eat it.

361
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,795
We have so many mouths to feed.

362
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,139
AlphaGo shot it to you,
so you could eat it.

363
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,475
How nice of him. I'll eat it.

364
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,897
Eat. Let's eat.

365
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,732
Come on. Let's eat.

366
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,447
But...

367
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,451
what about school?

368
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:51,790
You have to drop out.

369
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:57,170
Or have the rest of it sawed off.
You're my hostage.

370
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,423
You know you can't run away, right?

371
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,759
You want me to drop out?

372
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,180
I know what school you go to

373
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,390
and where you live.

374
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,398
That's right.

375
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,526
Do you know Uncle's body constitution?

376
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,361
His yin and yang, things like that.

377
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,405
It's so heavy.

378
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,574
Gosh, so heavy.

379
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,202
Bring it to him.

380
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,497
It's good stuff.

381
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:36,751
Eat up.

382
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,625
I really don't like it.

383
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,169
What?

384
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:24,382
You insist on working with someone
you don't even know.

385
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,509
Why are you being like that again?

386
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,844
Hey, Daeyeol.

387
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,138
You're always like this,

388
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,140
but you always do what you want.

389
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,268
Of course, I do what I want.
Should I do what I don't want?

390
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,730
I feel like you're overdoing it
to impress me, that's why.

391
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,274
You only spoke on the phone once

392
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,318
with that Uncle guy, that's it.

393
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,278
You said the voice was distorted too.

394
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,280
I'm not really sure,

395
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,490
but this feels like a scam.

396
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,825
Goodness.

397
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:55,455
My dear Mijung worries way too much.

398
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,873
That fucking hurts.

399
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,708
Stop it.

400
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:01,920
You still have the habit
of underestimating your hubby.

401
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,840
I have a plan, so don't you worry.

402
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,426
I should just kill you.

403
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,720
I know you like it.

404
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:07,920
-We're from Seoul Jungbu Police Station.
-Okay.

405
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,839
There's a patient here

406
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,008
we'd like to speak with.

407
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,259
What is the name?

408
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,682
I'll meet with the person,

409
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,851
-so you two go ahead. Okay?
-Yes, ma'am.

410
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,704
Excuse me! Wait!

411
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:05,997
Stop right there!

412
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,889
-What about school?
-You have to drop out.

413
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,934
My dream is to graduate,

414
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,437
go to college, get a job.

415
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,190
The money I need for that...

416
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,066
Where's my money?

417
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,152
You're doomed without that.

418
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,571
I think I found a replacement
for the Judo guys.

419
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,572
He slept with her.

420
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,699
I'll do it all.

421
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,874
We were unlucky.

422
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,543
Both you and I.

423
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:28,829
Hey.

424
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,087
Please.

425
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,257
Please help me.

426
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,827
Areung is currently on the move.

427
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:09,704
Go straight.

428
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:10,788
Hello.

429
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,748
Is it working fine?

430
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,544
I'm following what the screen says...

431
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:20,339
-Areung is on the move...
-...but what am I supposed to check?

432
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,384
Just follow AlphaGo
and see what Uncle looks like.

433
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,511
Whether it's his office or home,

434
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,763
get the address,
see how many people he has,

435
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,557
and the overall vibe.

436
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,475
I need to know whether he's for real

437
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,728
or nothing but a fraud.

438
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,815
Areung has stopped.

439
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:42,194
Look for Areung.

440
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,286
That's not AlphaGo.

441
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,748
Then?

442
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,292
Is it that old man?

443
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,587
It isn't him either.

444
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,838
What the fuck?

445
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,299
What are you talking about, idiot?

446
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,633
Who is it?

447
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,598
KYEWANG HIGH SCHOOL

448
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,936
HOW COULD YOU RUIN ME LIKE THIS?

449
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,896
IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU

450
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,982
I HAVE NOWHERE TO RUN ANYMORE

451
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,067
HEY, OJI

452
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,268
PSYCHO ASSHOLE

453
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,863
Hello, Sir!

454
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,364
It's Daeyeol Ryu.

455
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,242
I sent you a gift.
Did you receive it?

456
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,453
I refuse.

457
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,997
I refuse your offer

458
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,249
to hire our employee.

459
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,211
You mean us hiring your nephew?

460
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,464
Didn't you get the money?

461
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,549
That's a deposit.

462
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,595
-I am very offended.
-About what?

463
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,140
Was it too little?
Is that why you're offended?

464
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,060
You made a decision unilaterally
without discussion.

465
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,521
I have no reason to accept it.

466
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,982
Are you mad because I told your nephew
to drop out of school?

467
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,402
I'll return this money.

468
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,531
You must cherish your nephew a lot.

469
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,743
Does he need a diploma
to do this business?

470
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,955
Sir, he can always take the GED.

471
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,376
I must have overestimated you.

472
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,254
You're scaring me. Stop that.

473
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:34,051
What you did made me question
your credibility as a partner.

474
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,387
Sir, Where are you?

475
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,763
I'll come to you now.

476
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,682
Don't go anywhere. Where are you?

477
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,683
In light of that,

478
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,771
I refuse your offer for partnership.

479
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,523
Come on!

480
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,651
You speak so well, kid.
You sound like an adult.

481
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,509
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

482
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,679
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.

483
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,019
