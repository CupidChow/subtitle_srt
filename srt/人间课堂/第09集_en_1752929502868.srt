1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,174
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,011
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,931
-Gyuri Bae.
-Her name is Gyuri?

4
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,769
Who's this?

5
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,811
The Samun Gang?

6
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,980
Samun Gang my ass.

7
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,358
Hey. You are fucking ridiculous.

8
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,236
How do you go around
lying to people like that?

9
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,905
Especially to adults.

10
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:20,121
-Did you do something to her?
-Who? Your Uncle?

11
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,333
Your girlfriend? Which one?

12
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,126
Enough questions. Answer me!

13
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,462
Stop talking gibberish all the time,

14
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,963
you psycho bastard!

15
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,222
You didn't do anything, right?

16
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,808
You didn't...

17
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,851
kill her, did you?

18
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,773
I didn't kill her.

19
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,567
Fucker. You're so extreme.

20
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,860
Then put her on the phone.

21
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,237
What?

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,323
Put her on the phone. I won't believe you
unless I hear her voice.

23
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,826
If you kidnap someone,
you should threaten me

24
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,703
or do something,
but do it quickly, damn it!

25
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,247
Why are you angry?

26
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,167
You're the one who lied to me first,
you fucker.

27
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,587
You've got a bad temper.
Where are you, son of a bitch?

28
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,607
Listen up.

29
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,068
Text me your location.

30
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,695
I'll send the boys.

31
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,656
Come quietly if you want to save her.

32
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,785
And if we see any cops,
this bitch is dead.

33
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,249
What the hell is that?

34
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,462
Who are you?

35
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,511
It's been a while.

36
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,057
Seriously.

37
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,685
Who are you?

38
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,604
I don't have dementia.

39
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,652
I need you to find someone.

40
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,612
Someone in this field.

41
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,199
The car he rides...

42
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,368
is pretty unique.

43
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,831
It's a van with the manga character...

44
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,166
painted on it.

45
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,170
Do you know anything?

46
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,173
How long will you fight in these wars?

47
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,010
You're all alone.

48
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,304
You dig your own trench,

49
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,097
run away on your own,

50
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,516
and make declarations on your own.

51
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,715
Want this?

52
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,069
Do you want me to do it?

53
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,281
Do I put it where it was before?

54
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,392
Are you okay?

55
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,770
I told you I didn't want to do it!

56
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,563
Oh, no.

57
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,732
That must hurt.

58
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,692
-Food.
-What?

59
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,320
Go and buy me food.

60
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,865
What? Oh!

61
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,659
Food?

62
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,956
What kind? A burger?

63
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,291
Yes, a burger.

64
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,377
Do you want a combo?

65
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,255
Sure.

66
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,550
A combo. One for you and me.
There's money in the car.

67
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,594
Do you want ice cream too?

68
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:10,888
Sure.

69
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,474
I'll go and buy some.

70
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,106
Hold on.

71
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,693
You're getting rid of me,
so you can take off.

72
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,991
Are you going to go kill them?

73
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,995
Now? When you're all fucked up?

74
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,887
What about the burgers?

75
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,639
Order delivery. Fuck.

76
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,187
The person you have called
is not available.

77
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,440
Please leave a message after the tone.

78
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,859
She's not answering my calls. Fuck.

79
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,909
Kang Bbang. Hey, Kang Bbang!

80
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,535
I'm searching hard.

81
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,579
Never mind, moron. Go home.

82
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,082
What about finding the pimp?

83
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,627
I told you to get lost.

84
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,797
I'll get going then.

85
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,259
-We're leaving?
-Let's go.

86
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,769
I'M LOOKING FOR THIS GIRL
DO YOU KNOW HER?

87
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,156
Come here.
Hurry and get over here, bastard.

88
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,702
I couldn't sleep for 40 hours.

89
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,871
I can't keep working with him.

90
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,585
This is it. I'm quitting after this.

91
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,420
Damn it.

92
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,089
Fuck.

93
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,383
Shit!

94
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,970
-What will you do now?
-About what?

95
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,972
That!

96
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,683
She's got a pretty face,

97
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,978
so I can sell her to another country.

98
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:28,901
Should I have Mr. Kim find us a buyer
in Russia or China or somewhere?

99
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,362
-What about the guy?
-I'll get that asshole.

100
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,406
-Should I bury him?
-Again?

101
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,493
-No.
-Why are you always burying people?

102
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,203
It's not like they're treasures.

103
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,956
Fine. Do that shit at the shop again.

104
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,750
-You need plastic wrap?
-Why do you talk like that?

105
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,508
Because you keep creating problems,
asshole.

106
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,263
Why do you always think
about fixing problems?

107
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,642
Can't you empathize with me first?

108
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,602
Hey, Mijung.

109
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,439
I'm frustrated right now.

110
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,441
I'm frustrated. Fuck!

111
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,823
Do you know how hard it is to talk to you
when you're so hostile?

112
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,954
I'm always the bastard. Always.

113
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:26,292
You're the one who paid for sex. Fuck.

114
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,419
That I did.

115
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,923
Was he better than me?

116
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,303
I know I paid for sex. Several times.

117
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,222
Several times?

118
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,100
So what they said wasn't a complete lie.

119
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,978
They have inventory.

120
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,273
They know how to do business
better than you.

121
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,819
So what?

122
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,448
What?

123
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,910
Why don't you ever finish your sentences?

124
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,329
This is the fourth industrial revolution.

125
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,914
Hey.

126
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,917
Let's sit them down and hear them out.

127
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,528
I'll call the cops...

128
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,322
after you leave.

129
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,626
I'll call the cops

130
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,547
and tell them
you went to kill those assholes.

131
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,716
Why don't you just get arrested?

132
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,344
That's better than dying.

133
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,932
Hey, she's awake.

134
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,018
She's awake?

135
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,983
Hey, get up. This is huge.

136
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,694
Your nephew, or uncle, or whatever,

137
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,821
must like you a lot.

138
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,823
This is insane.

139
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,950
What?

140
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,870
-I'm looking at their account book.
-And?

141
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:10,539
Do you know what they did with the money
from selling ass?

142
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:11,540
What?

143
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,875
They went to school.

144
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,835
-School?
-Yes.

145
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,338
Look at their cloned phone.

146
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,591
Lunch, maintenance, tuition, study aids,

147
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,678
and three-pack colored highlighters.
It's all stuff like that.

148
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,597
It's fucking making me tear up.

149
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,391
Are they working students?

150
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,312
You guys are practically married.

151
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,566
Then you can both go missing together.

152
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,778
I have a bed-and-breakfast in Gapyeong.

153
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,906
You two can live and work there.
This is great.

154
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,909
-Hey!
-Damn it, seriously!

155
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,744
Fuck. Damn it!

156
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,957
You're so fucking annoying.

157
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,251
That stinks.

158
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,212
What did she eat?

159
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,308
Help.

160
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,324
Did you have to do that?

161
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,252
How did this happen to you?
You're just a kid.

162
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,047
Thanks to you, Dad.

163
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,136
You should've gone to an orphanage
or died.

164
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,640
How nice would that have been?
Wouldn't that have been better?

165
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,726
Probably.

166
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,063
So why did you waste your time and energy?

167
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,274
You're just a nuisance to others.

168
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,526
I know.

169
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,780
Or you could've taken a nicer path.

170
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,657
Like being a con artist

171
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,367
or a gambler.

172
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,957
Well... that's how you went bankrupt.

173
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,752
That's why Mom ran away.

174
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,504
You punk.

175
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,092
Sure. I am a piece of trash.

176
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,305
But you're the lowest of trash.

177
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,645
What about you? You're a single dad.

178
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,402
You're practically an orphan.

179
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,863
Good for you. Your dad's a single dad.

180
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,991
What's your dream?

181
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,577
What will you do in college?

182
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,289
I want to lead the kind of life you have.

183
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,209
-What kind of life do I have?
-Working and living

184
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,711
-like a normal person.
-Really? Is that all?

185
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,015
I want to make a new family.

186
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:15,933
Why?

187
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,893
Will you marry Gyuri or something?

188
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,146
-She's a bit scary.
-Why?

189
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,357
You two are exactly the same now.

190
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,359
Exactly. We're too alike.

191
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,444
Then who? Minhee?

192
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,073
-She's also a bit...
-What?

193
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,325
I'm her pimp.

194
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,912
-I thought you provide security.
-No, I'm a pimp.

195
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,415
Regardless, is it Gyuri or Minhee?

196
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,377
Will this go in my evaluation?

197
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,838
Time's up. Hand in your test.

198
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,021
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

199
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,313
Do better next time.

200
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,742
You're here.

201
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,121
Hey, get up. Your boyfriend is here.

202
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,260
Fuck.

203
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,487
They're here.

204
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,572
Where's this bitch?

205
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,535
Don't move.

206
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,286
Hey, Daeyeol.

207
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,455
Do something, you moron!

208
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,499
Bring Jisoo Oh.

209
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,837
-Bitch.
-I'm going to kill you.

210
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,798
-You--
-Bring Jisoo.

211
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,563
Hey, get in.

212
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,070
-Reverse!
-That fucking bitch!

213
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,197
-No, not that one.
-Shit.

214
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,782
You're so dead.

215
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,577
-Get out.
-Shit.

216
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,078
Get out, you bitch!

217
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,746
Get out, bitch!

218
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,958
-Hurry!
-Get out, you fucking bitch!

219
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,002
-Hurry!
-Are you insane?

220
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,795
Get out!

221
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,256
-Get out.
-Just step on it!

222
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,799
-Fuck.
-Just do it.

223
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,344
Catch that bitch! Get her!

224
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,141
Hey!

225
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,896
Get them!

226
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,450
Get them! You son of a bitch!

227
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,830
Stop!

228
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,875

If you're going to be absent,

233
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,729
at least call or answer your phone.

234
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,565
I was going to call.

235
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,859
It's past ten o’clock.

236
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,530
-Are you at home?
-Where else would I be?

237
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,367
Stop lying.

238
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,411
I already checked with your aunt.

239
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,414
Where are you?

240
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,000
I just...

241
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,587
came out for a bit.

242
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,050
Where are you wandering about
at this hour?

243
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,803
I'm just with someone.

244
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,554
Who are you with?

245
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,472
Grand...

246
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,520
My grandfather.

247
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,356
Grandfather?

248
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,798
Who is it?

249
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,843
My mom.

250
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,760
I see.

251
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,180
What did she say?

252
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,476
She asked why I'm not at home.

253
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,103
Oh...

254
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,063
What did you say?

255
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,690
Extracurricular activity.

256
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,649
I see.

257
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,115
They'll come after us, right?

258
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:07,951
Who?

259
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,245
-Them.
-Daeyeol Ryu?

260
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,913
Won't they catch us here?

261
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,000
Probably.

262
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,223
-We're fucked.
-We are.

263
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:56,833
What?

264
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,045
What?

265
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,421
What now?

266
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,298
What do you mean?

267
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,510
What do we do now?

268
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,222
I don't know.

269
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,474
Shit.

270
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,809
Where do we go?

271
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:17,979
Your place?

272
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,565
They know where I live.

273
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,194
School?

274
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,656
That's where they caught me.

275
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,961
Where are you going?

Do you still like me?

280
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,737
No, right?

281
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,989
So why did you come...

282
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:34,950
to save me?

283
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:38,995
Why?

284
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,713
What about you?

285
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,054
What?

286
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,390
Why are you risking your life
to be with me?

287
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,144
You may die if you stay with me.

288
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,293
It's an ambulance.

289
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:12,756
Ambulance?

290
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,511
It's an ambulance,

291
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,263
not the police.

292
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,028
-Hey.
-Seriously.

293
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,799
Hey, Oji.

294
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,221
Oji.

295
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,765
What...

296
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:08,812
What do we do now?

297
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,379
What do we do?

298
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,020
I want to stop.

299
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,780

Is he becoming like Mijung?

Answer me, asshole.

Hey, did you find the punks?

305
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,320
We only found the car.

306
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,238
You'll have to scrap it.

307
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:44,991
Where's Mijung?

-Fuck.

You be a cashier.

-Can they run POS?
-Who here knows how?

317
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,240
Look at them.
They don't even know what POS is.

318
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,324
Hey.

319
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,992
Stay in room six.

You know, right?

324
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,732
He said to tell you...

325
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,027
to stay here for today.

326
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,741
It's better not to know
his business. Okay?

327
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,202
Anyway, do you not eat...

328
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,165
Do you usually not eat breakfast?

335
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,053
know what character it was?

336

I don't know.

337
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,724
I told you.

Remember that ax case from before?

I'll be right there.

349
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,637

May I ask you something?

Why did you...

352
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,567
decide to tell me this?

353
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,611
Did something happen?

354
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,412
-Because I'm annoyed.
-About what?

355
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,831
At seeing blood.

00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,916
She doesn't look like a crazy bitch.
Are you a crazy bitch?

372
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,630
I'll pay 50,000 won each. Deal?

373
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,509
What do you want to sing?

374
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,887
Mister, four people.

375
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,515
Give us a lot of extra time, okay?

376
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,851
Did you tie your hair?

377
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,895
Go to room three.

378
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,021
Okay.

379
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,399
Don't spit on the floor.

380
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,400
-Okay.
-Okay.

381
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,278
Fuck.

382
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,451
Ooh wow, it’s amazing

383
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,288
There’s nothing more to add
To her beautiful body

384
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,249
Normal girls can’t even compete

385
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,294
They’ll probably gather together
And talk badly about you

386
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,754
Listen carefully!

387
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,555
RESTRICTED AREA
STAFF ONLY

388
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,094
ALPHAGO

389
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,887
Shit!

390
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,715
You remind me of...

391
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,343
Mijung.

392
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,150
Banana!

393
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,570
-Banana!
-Hey!

394
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:07,863
Go. Shit.

395
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,866
-Come out!
-Hey!

396
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:12,993
Mister, come out!

397
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,912
-Hey!
-Come out already!

398
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,958
-What the hell?
-What's this shit?

399
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,629
Kids, what are you doing
so early in the morning

400
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,339
in front of our business?

401
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,465
Mister, is it you?

402
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,217
Banana boss?

403
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,345
Why are you being disrespectful
to an adult?

404
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,520
The boss man will run the hell down now!

405
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,356
-Come down!
-Come on!

406
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:43,774
I don't want to.

407
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,238
-That fucker is scared.
-You said to come here.

408
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,323
What is that bastard talking about?

409
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,533
Open your ears

410
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,910
-and pay attention!
-Do you have tits in your ears?

411
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,288
You're fucking deaf
because your ears are covered.

412
00:40:58,664 --> 00:40:59,498
So true.

413
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,042
What's with the cast?

414
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,422
Hey! Do you think I can see that
from here?

415
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,341
-Aren't you going to school?
-Come down.

416
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:12,219
Don't go anywhere. Wait right there.

417
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,554
-Come down.
-Come down.

418
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,474
-Have you ever lined up to get beat up
-Hurry and come down!

419
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,477
Dugi, it's me.

420
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,813
Take the boys outside.
There's a bunch of weirdos.

421
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,316
How can you sleep right now, asshole?

422
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,485
You fucker!

423
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,614
-Gosh, it's hot out.
-That freak.

424
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,740
It's hot.

425
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,949
-You scared?
-Shit.

426
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,035
-He's scared.
-Wait right there!

427
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,371
-Stop talking, you fucker!
-Hurry up and come down!

428
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,124
-Fucker!
-Get down, fucker!

429
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,043
-Fucker!
-Come down!

430
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,836
Run down now!

431
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,422
-Where did this bitch go?
-Come down already.

432
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,763
What's going on?

433
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,765
Fuck.

434
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,225
What's going on?

435
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,062
Boss!

436
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,022
Boss!

437
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,900
Why is he calling?

438
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:09,443
Why can't he just come?

439
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:13,405
What did he do with the fire extinguisher?

440
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,589
Shit. Can we do this?

441
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,508
Of course not, moron.

442
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,802
Fuck.

443
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,471
What? Say something.

444
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,933
-Slowly. One word at a time.
-Fuck.

445
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,271
Boss, come out for a second!

446
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,232
-Daeyeol!
-Boss!

447
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:50,484
-What the hell?
-Boss!

448
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,698
What's this? Why is he so big?

449
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:02,204
Mister, where's the boss?

450
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,582
Why is this kid so rude?

451
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:08,294
-Hey.
-If you don't know, we'll beat you.

452
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:19,805
Hey!

453
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,850
-Where's Minsuk?
-He went out for a smoke.

454
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:23,976
You asshole...

455
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,728
Fight!

456
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,931
You asshole.

457
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,731
It should be around here.

458
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,529
Right there.

459
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:04,535
Where is he?

460
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,204
Where's the pimp?

461
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,010
Shit.

462
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,069
-Baeggyul!
-Oji!

463
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,738
Let's go.

464
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,623
Get over here.

465
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,667
Hey, Oji!

466
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:55,502
-Run!
-Don't go!

467
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,130
-Come here!
-Just run, you asshole!

468
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:02,760
Get over here.

469
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,890
Get over here.

470
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,267
You fuckers.

471
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,534
Who are you?

472
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,752
He bites. Be careful.

473
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,049
Get over here.

474
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,148

00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,366
Do it right, fuckers.

477
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,290
Who's that?

478
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,632
What the fuck?

479
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,894
Fuck.

480
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,199
Shit!

481
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,494
Shit. You didn't die?

482
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,872
Did you eat wild ginseng or something?

483
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:56,999
I'm speechless.

484
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:05,924
Come on.

485
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,554
Come at me.

486
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,600
Why won't you die?

487
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,310
Come here, fuck.

488
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,372
Mr. Lee...

489
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,002
Let's...

490
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,633
never meet again.

491
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,600
Mr. Lee...

492
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,695
Let's go, asshole!

493
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,699
Come on!

494
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:32,094
Fuck!

495
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,479
Does that hurt?

496
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,191
Fuck.

497
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,486
Why won't you die?

498
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,031
Why won't you die? Fuck.

499
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,535
Fuck. Why won't you die, old man?

500
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,662
Fucking die, you old man.

501
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,836
Why didn't you stay in bed?
Why did you crawl out, you fucker?

502
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,171
You fucking old man.

503
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,095
Fuck! I'll kill you all!

504
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,390
Get up, you fucking old man.

505
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,601
You piece of shit.

506
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,324
Fuck.

00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,006
Is it over?

511
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,800
It was over in an instant.

512
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,679
Some psycho showed up

513
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,556
and killed them all.

514
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,724
Fucked up.

515
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:06,975
Wait. Where's Kwakki?
