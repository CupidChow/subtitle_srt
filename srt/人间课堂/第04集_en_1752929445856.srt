1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,966
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION,

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:10,927
WHICH IS NOT BASED ON REAL
CHARACTERS OR EVENTS.

3
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,511
MINJU, EUNCHAE, JIYE, MINHEE

4
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,096
6,652,100 WON IN TOTAL

5
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,537
Wow! Your uniform is so cool.

6
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,336
I was right. I'm so observant.

7
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:27,921
What?

8
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,090
Are these bullets you actually used?

9
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,592
You're freaking cool. You're super cool.

10
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,054
Mister, have you shot and killed people?

11
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,766
What do you want?

12
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,478
Did you hear from Uncle?

13
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,688
No.

14
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,901
Gosh, you and I will end up
being unemployed at this rate.

15
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,284
It's from a hamburger joint.
Not your usual fast food.

16
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,296
Mister.

17
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,925
If... by some remote chance,

18
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,010
you become unemployed, what will you do?

19
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,847
What if Uncle fires you?

20
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,643
If you do, do you want to try that?

21
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,936
MMA fighting.

22
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,857
You're fucking old,
but you're a fucking good fighter.

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,151
I feel like you could kill them all.

24
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,528
I'll be your manager.

25
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,574
What do you say? We'll be partners.
Sounds good, right?

26
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,703
Hey.

27
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,706
Why are you here?

28
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,376
I came to ask
when we're starting work again.

29
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,794
You don't want to do it.

30
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:50,879
Right?

31
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,925
You don't want to do this.

32
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,431
When did I say that?

33
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,145
Jeez.

34
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,062
Yes, hello?

35
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,481
He says whatever without knowing anything.

36
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,278
Understood.

37
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:24,954
Are you going to work?

38
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,540
Why do you ask?

39
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,418
We're back in business.

40
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,004
Do you want to work today?

41
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,465
Do you?

42
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,345
Shit, Kitae.
What's gotten into you lately?

43
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,098
-You used to suck at three-cushion.
-Pay up, sucker.

44
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,809
-Chaebin!
-Hey, Chaebin!

45
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,894
First blood!

46
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,188
-Shut up, you sons of bitches.
-He got beaten up

47
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,483
He got beaten up by a gopher

48
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,735
-Shit, I didn't get beat up.
-He got beaten up

49
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,153
Hey, are you crying?

50
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,739
-Stop it. Fuck off.
-Tell us.

51
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,659
How does it feel to be beaten up
by a loser?

52
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,244
A loser? Give me a break.

53
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,580
Shut the fuck up.
You can't touch Jisoo either.

54
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,457
What does he mean?

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,793
Who is he? Why can't you touch him?

56
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:54,794
Food delivery.

57
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,380
What is it?

58
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,340
Who's Gyuri Bae?

59
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,968
She's a classmate who's the "It insider."

60
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,304
Juniors and seniors have her back.

61
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,889
Shit, what happens if you beat her up?

62
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,101
Hey, if you beat up Gyuri,

63
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,186
the seniors will beat the crap out of you.

64
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,064
Who cares about seniors?
Just beat them up too.

65
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,568
Hey, that bitch Gyuri is close
to the senior judo team members.

66
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,737
Can you beat up big muscles, too?

67
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,407
And ifÂ Seokhwan
from the judo team gets involved,

68
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,743
we'd be pummeled to the ground.

69
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,453
That sounds fucking complicated.

70
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,121
What is this, Game of Thrones?

71
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,499
Politics is always fucking complicated.

72
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,711
You need to be choosy
about which losers you beat up now.

73
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:38,588
Shit.

74
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,048
Junghwan.

75
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,008
Remember that asshole from ninth grade?

76
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,053
-Who?
-The one we kept fucking with.

77
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,347
Shit, we fucked with too many to count.

78
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,057
-Right? Who, moron?
-Hilarious.

79
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,058
That asshole.

80
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,727
"My uncle is a prosecutor judge.
You know, shit!"

81
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:54,896
Shit, you freak.

82
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,731
Jungsoo Koo.

83
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,358
What? Who's that?

84
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,276
There was this kid with a bad lisp.

85
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,488
I used to think there was a job
called "prosecutor-judge".

86
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,324
What is that? A top prosecutor?

87
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,409
Yes, someone higher than a prosecutor.

88
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,453
Hey, the fucking twist is

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,955
that his uncle really was a prosecutor.

90
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,750
What the fuck?

91
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,294
Then how did you fuck with him?

92
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,546
We fucked with him little by little,

93
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,091
so he didn't even realize
we were fucking with him.

94
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,095
Like putting super glue on his chair
and stealing his gym uniform.

95
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,806
Shit, you played so sissy.

96
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,809
Imagine those sissy things
happening to you for a year.

97
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:35,937
It makes you want to kill yourself.

98
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,316
That's right.
He really tried to jump off the roof.

99
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,361
Didn't the teacher give you crap?

100
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,239
Come on, I worked the teacher real good,

101
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:49,158
so he'd believe me instead of the loser.

102
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,371
Did you think I kissed the dean's ass
for nothing?

103
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:56,791
Kwakki, this freakshow is smart
when it comes to those things.

104
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,587
If you look for it, there's always a way.

105
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,756
You need to try hard for that.

106
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,733
Hi, my boyfriend.

107
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,323
Oh, sausages. Sweet.

108
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,871
Did you pay the puppet boss?

109
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,086
-Did you pay the puppet boss?
-Hey, keep it down.

110
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,631
That's right.

111
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,969
-Did you call them?
-Who? What? About what?

112
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,680
The judo guys. I gave you their numbers.

113
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,515
That again.

114
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,684
Hey, I said it's not gonna happen.

115
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,352
Why not?

116
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,146
They wouldn't do it.

117
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,774
They wouldn't do it?

118
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,321
My man is like such an outcast at times.

119
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,494
You think you're the only one
at this school?

120
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,954
What do you mean?

121
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,334
You're not the only one here
practicing creative economy.

122
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,461
Look at him over there.

123
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,215
Do you know how he makes money
on the side?

124
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,677
Jinhwan's nickname is Duty Free.

125
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,180
His big brother works
at a cigarette factory.

126
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,475
He brings him
all the defective cigarettes.

127
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,936
He takes them and sells them at school.

128
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,898
Think about why someone
so normal is close to the bullies.

129
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,443
And her, Hyesoo Choi.

130
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,404
She's the Author.
I don't know the details, but I bet

131
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,115
she raised the average grade
of the junior class.

132
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,367
She charges a lot.

133
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,410
She charges for reports by the page.

134
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,498
And our class bully, Minhee.

135
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,292
I wondered where she got the money
to support her boyfriend.

136
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,962
But I found out, thanks to you.

137
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,384
-Hi!
-Thank you, Baeggyul.

138
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,554
He's a club owner's gopher.

139
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,307
And that girl

140
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,143
-slept with a teacher in middle school.
-What?

141
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,233
How do you know all that?

142
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,819
Me? I'm the "It Insider."

143
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,407
So, what's your point?

144
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:39,245
Those judo guys you met
at the batting cage are experienced.

145
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,538
Experienced?

146
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,542
They used to party with rich older girls
for money.

147
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,853
They're not as innocent and pure
as they look.

148
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,023
They'll definitely want to do it
if you give them a chance.

149
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,985
It's not about that.
I'm sure they won't do it.

150
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,404
Then what's the problem?

151
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,031
Look at that traitor.

152
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,200
-Baeggyul! Did you eat?
-Hi.

153
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,952
-I ate.
-Hi.

154
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,412
She won't eat with us anymore.

155
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,914
We couldn't reach you,
so we three went to karaoke.

156
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,167
-Where were you?
-Yeah, where were you?

157
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:28,836
I was with this asshole.

158
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,921
-What?
-What?

159
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,923
At that late hour,

160
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,093
what could a guy and girl do together?

161
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,013
No...

162
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,306
Are you mad?

163
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,684
I'm going to go.

164
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,728
Okay, bye.

165
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,229
Oh, no.

166
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,316
Man,

167
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,401
I still can't believe

168
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,613
that Jisoo socked Chaebin.

169
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,614
Baeggyul, come here.

170
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,995
I'm really curious.

171
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,623
-What do you see in him?
-Yeah.

172
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,294
I see zero charm in your boyfriend.

173
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,129
Why do you like him so much?

174
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,177
Gosh.

175
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,389
-You scared me.
-He broke the chair. What the fuck?

176
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,598
It broke.

177
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,059
-Sit lightly.
-What's wrong with his butt?

178
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,103
-What?
-What is it?

179
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,896
His butt looks hilarious.

180
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,439
That was so fucking funny.

181
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,900
-Your pants ripped.
-I smell super glue.

182
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:33,943
Get lost.

183
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,696
Oh, no. You'll have to go home.

184
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,199
It's not that I'm crazy about him,
but more like...

185
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,619
He's fun. He can be quite amusing.

186
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,289
Nonsense. It's obvious you like him
more than he likes you.

187
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,833
No, not that.

188
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,462
There must be something
we don't see that you fell for.

189
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,672
What is it?

190
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,051
First, he's smart.

191
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,274
Please proceed to the maximum.

192
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,570
There's sort of charisma about him too.

193
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,115
And he has
an unexpected wolfish side to him.

194
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,411
But he thinks he's a puppy.

195
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:30,207
-I get it. I totally get it.
-What are you talking about?

00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,132
Seriously.

227
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,926
Must we acceptÂ her request?

228
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,055
Is it your assessment that she is
incapable of performing the job?

229
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,392
Well, I'm not an expert in that field.

230
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,519
But she seems unstable.

231
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,023
-You were on your phone before too.
-I was not.

232
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,527
It's just here because I put it down here.

233
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,155
Don't get annoyed, seriously.

234
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,865
She seems unwilling to work.

235
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,536
She never said herself that she'd quit.

236
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,455
I don't know why,

237
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,583
but she's adamant about staying on.

Hey! Let me sleep!

I'm sorry!

246
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,163
Fuck, look at the time!

250
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,933
Report what?

251
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,059
It's Friday.

252
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,021
It's collection day.

253
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,357
How much did we get?

254
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,412
I'll pull out my investment.

255
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,482
What is this ancient document?

256
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,649
None of your business.

257
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,360
Do you really want to lose my money?

258
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,113
It's the collection record.

259
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,493
-Is this from the puppet boss?
-He isn't a puppet boss.

260
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,578
But is it necessary

261
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,915
to write this by hand and exchange it?

262
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,125
We have our reasons.

263
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,878
-Just use e-mail.
-He's not familiar with that stuff.

264
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,380
Who? The puppet boss?

265
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,882
He isn't a puppet boss!

266
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,592
Then teach him.

267
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,932
Won't your mom look for you?

268
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,935
I already have my alibi.

269
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:26,939
By the way,

270
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,609
you still haven't contacted
the judo guys, have you?

271
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,074
Hello.

272
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,785
I told you not to do a shoulder throw.

273
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,787
I figured, so I contacted them.

274
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,372
You told them yourself?

275
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:44,665
Of course not.

276
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,416
Here.

277
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,963
ONE MESSAGE

278
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,880

280
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,468

281
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,678
THE BEST OPPORTUNITY

282
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,430
You got it too? I got it as well.

283
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,810
What the heck?

284
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,104
It's just a spam message.

285
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,193
I created an open chat room.
They'll join if they're interested.

286
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,503
Will they join?

287
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,465
Seriously.

288
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,431
Hey.

289
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,183
Hands off.

290
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,737
He holds such a grudge. Asshole.

291
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,201
111 JOINED THE GROUP

292
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,744
Hey, someone came in.

293
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,454
What should I say?

294
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,293
Hey, look.

295
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,711
HELLO, DID YOU SEE THE AD?

296
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,504
What are you doing? Delete it.

297
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,841
No, you should help each other
in times like these.

298
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,927
Look, they're working so hard.

299
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,804
HEY... DON'T SPEW NONSENSE

300
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,474
PERVERTED BASTARDS

301
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,268
What the heck?

302
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:36,985
Told you so.

303
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:43,700
Well, he's the first one.
More will come in later.

304
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,287
-I bet he'll be the last.
-Why wouldn't they do it?

305
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,125
Hey, use your brain, will you?

306
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,211
Do you think they need us?

307
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,048
I told you. We provide security.

308
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,927
Why would big guys
like them need security?

309
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,347
They can handle any problems
with their clients themselves.

310
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,517
Seriously.

311
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,603
You are so clueless.

312
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,022
Why did you want to work with me?

You're home.

317
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,115
-Jordan Newman?
-Yes.

318
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,286
I wondered what you were doing up so late.

319
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:12,914
So, what did you think?

320
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,501
It was interesting.

321
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:17,961
In what way?

322
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,341
In how laughably sincere he is.

323
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,428
The left wing skips these issues
because they're a headache.

324
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,556
But he must feel the need
to discuss them one by one.

325
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:31,975
And?

326
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,188
It's novel as well.

327
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,358
I guess McCarthyists say things now

328
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,235
that the left-wingers are supposed to.

329
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,239
You're still such a baby, Gyuri.

330
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,953
-Remember the meeting tomorrow.
-Okay.

331
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,373
You know what the meeting is for, right?

332
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,166
I do.

333
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,486
Are you almost done?
Let me see your makeup.

334
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,865
Not bad.

335
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,826
Stop by the salon.

336
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,329
You can be a little late.
I'll book it for 4:00 p.m.

337
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,872
With the manager, Myunghee Baek.

338
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,870
-That's not true.
-Yeah, right.

339
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,003
Didn't you have something
more formal to wear?

340
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,714
She's finally here.

341
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,633
This is our daughter, Gyuri.

342
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,219
I called her here to meet important people

343
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,221
and learn the business.

344
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,556
Say hi, Gyuri.

345
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,808
Mr. Choi, CEO of Heaven Entertainment.

346
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:40,061
And they are actresses
with Heaven Entertainment.

347
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:42,314
Hello, I'm Gyuri Bae.

348
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,150
It's nice to meet you.

349
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,902
I should get up to say hi.

350
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,363
Nice to meet you.

351
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,658
We are so grateful that he's our partner.

352
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,162
Our company wouldn't have made it this far
without his help.

353
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,079
That's right.

354
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,373
You should make him your role model.

355
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,668
Aren't you going to have her become
a celebrity?

356
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,462
She says she's not interested.

357
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:08,298
Business management must be her calling.

358
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,009
What? Such a waste.

359
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,554
Why do you want her
to work with boring numbers?

360
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,097
Send her to my agency instead.

361
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,433
What's this?

362
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,561
Was Gyuri just scouted by Mr. Choi?

363
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,483
-What an honor.
-An honor?

364
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,400
Right?

365
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:36,743
I'M TAKING MY SHARE

366
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,661
What the...

367
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,721
Seriously, I won't let it slide.

368
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,975
She does nothing
and takes half of the money?

369
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,351
What are you doing there?

370
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,756
You're saying 50-50 is unfair, right?

371
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,508
That's right.

372
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,886
You don't think I do enough to take half?

373
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,972
That's right.

374
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,894
I agree.Â How about 60-40?

375
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,481
-I say 90-10.
-No, 70-30.

376
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,691
I said 90-10.

377
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,782
-Hello? Police?
-Fine, okay.

378
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,784
-Let's do 80-20.
-Let's do 70-30.

379
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,248
-70-30...
-Okay!

380
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,208
-No.
-It's 70-30. Thank you.

381
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,566
Hey!

382
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,526
Why do you carry that around?

383
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,612
-Nowhere to hide it.
-What about at home?

384
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,657
There are too many thieves
that frequent my home.

385
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,204
Still, you can't carry all of that around.

386
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,832
What if you have more money?
Will you carry 60 million won in cash?

387
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,543
Shut it.
I'll find a hiding place before then.

388
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,712
You're so paranoid.

389
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,497
JISOO OH

390
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,127
What's this?

391
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,315
Shit, how could you actually do that?

392
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:59,446
That's so childish.
We did that in middle school.

393
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,156
Shit, what else could I do?

394
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,117
I can't stand that fucker.
I need to fuck with him somehow.

395
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,662
Anyway, Chaebin is quite sensitive.

396
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,122
-Of course, shit.
-So?

397
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,833
Is Jisoo on the path to suicide now?

398
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,920
That asshole has
a surprisingly strong mentality.

399
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,174
Look, he never reacts to anything.

400
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,886
Even if he falls and crap,
he has the same look on his face. You saw.

401
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,680
You loser, you have to do it right.

402
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,016
Hey, did you bring it?

403
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,231
Let's see. Shit.

404
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,404
I never bought this before.

405
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,781
-It's interesting.
-Whatever.

406
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,240
Don't bullshit me, asshole.

407
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,451
You have piles of these at home,
don't you?

408
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,120
-In every size.
-Shut up, moron.

409
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,079
Hey.

410
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,916
Maybe he tried it out already.

411
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,167
Jeez, fucking gross!

412
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,127
-I did not, morons.
-Pick it up!

413
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,922
-I didn't use it, shit.
-This is great.

414
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,391
-Kang Bbang.
-Yes, Dominus.

415
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,687
What is the task
that you must perform today?

416
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,857
-Assassin's Creed.
-That's right.

417
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,734
Assassination.

418
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,994
-Good luck.
-Don't use it yourself!

419
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,788
Shit, you're fucked.

420
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,082
You're fucked. Oh, no.

421
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,751
What are you so excited about?

422
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:41,381
You're so hardworking. You just started.

423
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,967
All schools are the same.

424
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:48,137
I mean, you'll be there every day
and see it every day.

425
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,265
That's Kyewang High School, right?

426
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,767
What? Yes.

427
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,937
What's it like there?

428
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,398
Well, you know...

429
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,110
All regular high schools are the same.

430
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,738
There are all sorts of kids there.

431
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,907
The good kids are endlessly good.

432
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,785
And the delinquents are delinquent
to no end.

433
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,997
That sounds like it'll keep me busy.

434
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,919
Haegyong, how long were you
with Violent Crimes

435
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,213
before joining
the Woman Juvenile division?

436
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,799
Violent Crimes?Â Eight years.

437
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,263
You totally seem like
a Violent Crimes detective.

438
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,806
You don't let anything go.

439
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,851
You latch onto every little thing
and dig as far as you can.

440
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,521
Didn't you have a nickname?

441
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,982
They must've given you one.

442
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,108
I did.

443
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:43,943
What was it?

444
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,864
Smiling Bitch.

445
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,750
My gosh, seriously...

446
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,545
But you know.

447
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,465
I think it's time for you

448
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,759
to change your style.

449
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,180
School police officers

450
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,350
have to coax and appease kids
all the time.

451
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,269
With your current style,
you'll scare all the kids.

452
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,440
So from now on,
let's stop being the Smiling Bitch.

453
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,527
And just keep the smiling part.
We can do without the rest.

454
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,033
Seriously, my gosh.

455
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,247
Smiling...

456
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,876
Where is she going now?

457
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,504
What is it?

458
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,756
Why are you always keeping things from me?

459
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,050
It's better not to know.

460
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,469
Kitae, you are so annoying.

461
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,138
Sorry to interrupt,

462
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,100
but can you put that out first?

463
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,812
Who the hell is that?

464
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,654
What happens if we don't?

465
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:13,282
Then, it'll be big trouble for all of us.

466
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,369
DETECTIVE HAEGYONG LEE, WOMAN JUVENILE
SEOUL JUNG-GU POLICE

467
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,710
Would it be worth the trouble though?

468
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,719
I should never have tried this.

469
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,554
Put them out. All of you.

470
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,681
Pick up the butts. Let's throw them out.

471
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,559
Wow, you guys are cool.

472
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,145
So? Are you done?

473
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,106
You punks.

474
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,357
Minhee.

475
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,568
-Minhee Seo.
-Huh?

476
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,615
Those young punks.

477
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,996
Pick up all the cigarette butts!
Throw them all away!

478
00:34:31,944 --> 00:34:33,112
Hey, so what?

479
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,199
Choose between beef or pork.

480
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,076
No. Hey, listen.

481
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:39,827
Oh, her?

482
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,080
The one who has less will do it.

483
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,915
-You'll give it away?
-One, two, three.

484
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,792
The thing we did the next day.

485
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,835
Don't you remember?

486
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,221
KANG BBANG: MISSION COMPLETED

487
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,893
Let's not get involved
in each other's life anymore.

488
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,770
What was that?

489
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,855
I'm apologizing, asshole.

490
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,899
For hitting you that time.

491
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,570
My 100-day performance was wrecked
because of you too.

492
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,614
So let's call it even.

493
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,699
Then why on earth did you...

494
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,910
-Why did you do it?
-Do what?

495
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:22,870
The dye.

496
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,206
My locker and my chair.

497
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,124
What?

498
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,585
What chair?
What is this asshole talking about?

499
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,923
Anyway, we made up, okay?

500
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,680
Let Baeggyul know, okay?

501
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,321
Oji.

502
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,243
You have my class next, right?

503
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,664
Hey, I heard a scandalous rumor, you know.

504
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:07,999
What?

505
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,458
It's not true, is it?

506
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,002
What?

507
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,087
That you and Baeggyul are dating.

508
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,136
I put you together
to work on club matters.

509
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,556
And you were too busy dating
and bombed your midterms.

510
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,225
Well, Mr. Cho.
Dating has nothing to do with...

511
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:30,271
If that's why you bombed your exams,
that's very commendable.

512
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,858
Had it been for another reason,
I'd have killed you.

513
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,693
-That hurts.
-You youngsters.

514
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,613
-I'm jealous.
-That really hurts.

515
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,950
-Hello.
-Hi, Kitae.

516
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,161
-Hello.
-Hi.

517
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,674
Four of a kind.

518
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,510
Don't be a penny-pincher.

519
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,346
Hi, Kitae.

520
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,847
Hello, sir.

521
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,099
What's up? Didn't the bell ring?

522
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,392
Oh, yes.

523
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,647
But... I have to tell you
something urgently.

524
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,568
Earlier, when I was in the bathroom.

525
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,738
I saw this in the trash.

526
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,752
Let's read that out loud.

527
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,798
"Certain members of society

528
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:43,177
threaten the safety and the order
of society by illegal acts.

529
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,596
Then the governmental authority

530
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,808
punishes those members

531
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:51,352
in order to maintain order."

532
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,271
That's a given.

533
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,190
I think so.

534
00:37:57,191 --> 00:38:00,945
However, don't just skim these words.

535
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,030
Let's play devil's advocate.

536
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,451
Who are they to decide to punish anyone?

537
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,787
Who in the world

538
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,956
gave them

539
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,292
the authority to do that?

540
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,379
Hello, Ms. Baek.
Sorry to interrupt your class.

541
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,797
How may I help you?

542
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,549
-May I have a few minutes?
-Yes.

543
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,801
I'd like to inspect
the kids' bags and lockers.

544
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,554
The truth is, I gave it to them.

545
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,350
-How could you give it to them?
-You're so full of it.

546
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:32,977
And...

547
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,062
you gave it to them.

548
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,647
The psycho dean is here.

549
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,065
We gave it to them.

550
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:43,070
Average citizens
like you and I gave them the authority.

551
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,948
Everyone, put your bags on your desks.

552
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,286
Come on! Do it now.

553
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,747
Do it.

554
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,208
Go.

555
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,170
He's checking personal belongings
starting with my class.

556
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,340
No matter how difficult life may be,

557
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,551
let's not cross this line at least.

558
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,136
Hey.

559
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,722
Don't tell me that's still in your bag.

560
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,436
Hey, check your phone.

561
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:35,539
The law is a societal agreement
reached on a person-to-person basis.

562
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:38,000
Gosh, I'll roll you over!

563
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,257
All checked?

564
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,176
He's almost done.
Your class is next.

565
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,469
Like this.

566
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,826
Mr. Cho.

567
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,287
-Hello, Mr. Cho.
-Oh, hello.

568
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,872
How may I help you?

569
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,874
Sorry to interrupt.

570
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,044
Well...

571
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:24,380
It won't take long.

572
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,424
Okay.

573
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,426
Attention.

574
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,802
Today,

575
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,138
this was found

576
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,682
in the bathroom.

577
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,726
Thus, we will now

578
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,062
search everyone's personal belongings.

579
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,357
Empty the contents of your bags
onto your desks.

580
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,317
Now!

581
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,917
Well, sir.

582
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,629
Officially,
you need the students' consent.

583
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,633
Does anyone...

584
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:12,511
not consent?

585
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,432
No one, right?

586
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:18,642
Now, put your bags on your desks.

587
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,813
If you have a lock on your locker,

588
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,483
go now and open it.

589
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,819
Get moving.

590
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,863
Get up now!

591
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,541
I don't.

592
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,087
You don't what?

593
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,339
I don't consent.

594
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,676
What was that?

595
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,221
I don't consent to your searching...
I mean,

596
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,350
I can't consent.

597
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,440
IF YOU NEED HELP, REACH OUT TO A PARENT,
A FRIEND, A SCHOOL COUNSELOR

598
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,193
OR AN ADULT YOU TRUST,
OR CALL A LOCAL HELPLINE.
