What have you thought of?

161
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,410
Madam Qi told me

162
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,650
that she doesn't want our kids

163
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,770
to become merchants or workers.

164
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,770

But once they went out,

167
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,530
they lost their confidence.

168
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,970
However, I believe

169
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,090
that no profession

170
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,330

171
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,940
So, every five days,

172
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,890

174
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,940

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,770
For this first lesson,

177
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,650

178
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,380

179
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,210

Madam Hua,

182
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,020
why the academy

183
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,970
doesn't teach proper history books

184
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,410
but offers lessons of Diversity instead?

185
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,140
Isn't this a bit

186
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,410
unprofessional?

187
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,620
I wonder

188
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,970
what Zhi is planning on this time.

189
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,580
Don't overthink it.

190
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,260
Just wait and see.

It'd be disrespectful to refuse.

194
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,090
Today, I shall be your

195
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,260
Master of Diversity.

196
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,730
Good.

197
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,700
Master of Diversity!

198
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,580
Master of Diversity.

199
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:26,700
Good.

200
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,530
Do you know where this is?

201
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,330
Where?

202
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Where?

203
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,580
This is the northern land.

204
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,180
The place

205
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,380
where your fathers and grandfather
went to.

206
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,580
I went up north at a young age

207
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,210
and spent ten years there.

208
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,020
Today, I will share with you

209
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,180
my experiences in the northern land.

210
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,060
If you depart from the Imperial Capital,

211
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,410
by walking,

212
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,060
it'll take you four months

213
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,580
to cross the Mountain Kun.

214
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,260
Four months!

215
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,940
Then,

216
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,060
you'll need to walk for
another 500 miles

217
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,730
to reach the frontier town.

218
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,290
The northern land is cold.

219
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,090
Even in March and April,

220
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,700
it's still covered in snow.

221
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,060
Mr. Yan,

222
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,380
our grandfather and the others,

223
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,580
what do they eat

224
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,650
and what do they wear?

225
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,620
Up in the northern land,

226
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,290
before heavy snow closes
the mountain passes,

227
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,530
regardless of age,

228
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,940
everyone must go
into the mountains to hunt.

229
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,060
As for the women,

230
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,210
they grind wheat at home
to make dry food,

231
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,940
skin the prey for clothing

232
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,650
and smoke the meat into jerky.

233
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:33,820
In fact,

234
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,940
the northern land is not all about
harsh and cold.

235
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,410
Take winter for example.

236
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,770
You can go hunt deers in the mountains.

237
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,940
Deers tend to hide in the snow pits.

238
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,730
At that time, if you set an ambush,

239
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,850
you'll catch them easily.

240
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,500
If the weather is good,

241
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,500
you can also go ice fishing.

242
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,530
Ice fishing?

243
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,210
Ice fishing.

244
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,530
When late spring comes,

245
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,020
the weather starts to warm up.

246
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,020
At that time,
both inside and outside the border town

247
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,140
will be covered in apricot blossoms.

248
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,020
They're like clouds.

249
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,850
When summer arrives,

250
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,940
there will be sweet apricots to eat.

251
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,500
The northern land is cool in summer,

252
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,530
not as scorchingly hot as here...

253
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,380
Mr. Yan did give a great lesson.

254
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,330
He surely has seen the world.

255
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:35,890
Impressive.

256
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,770
Right, Madam?

257
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,060
Mr. Yan.

258
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,060
Mr. Yan, you are amazing!

259
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,380
Mr. Yan, so amazing!

260
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,940
So amazing.

261
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,410
So amazing.

262
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,380
So amazing.

263
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,970
So amazing.

264
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,330
There is another thing.

265
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,460
Starting tomorrow,

266
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,090
you can stop practicing the squat.

267
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,380
That's great.

268
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,850
However,

269
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,060
at daybreak,

270
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,410
you'll gather at here.

271
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,890
For what?

272
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,650
Mr. Yan,

273
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,410
what will we do

274
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,500
so early?

275
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,820
Right.

276
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,730
You'll know once you get here.

277
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,330
Now, go home.

278
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,580
Alright, let's go.

279
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,250
What is he trying to do?

280
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,850
This first lesson of Diversity is over.

281
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,180
Are you satisfied?

282
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,850
I really want to see

283
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,330
those apricot trees you mentioned.

284
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,580
You will have a chance.

285
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,250
What are you going
to teach them tomorrow?

286
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,060
You started the lessons of Diversity
for self-cultivation.

287
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,180
You want them to learn

288
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,300
to respect and value themselves.

289
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:34,610
I receive a monthly allowance,

290
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,850
so I must put in some effort.

291
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,940
Tomorrow, I'll teach them
how to strengthen their neck muscles

292
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,460
and tell them no matter where they are,

293
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,300
they must always hold their heads high.

294
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,250
I want to sleep.

295
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,210
Boli.

296
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:56,580
Boli.

297
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,540
Boli.

298
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,060
You're not even fully awake yet.

299
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,370
How come the training starts so early?

300
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:02,660
It's cold in the morning.

301
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
Put this on.

302
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,490
Alright, go.

303
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,780
Starting today,

304
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,940
you'll gather at 6 am every morning

305
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,180
and jog around the city

306
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,370
to strengthen your bodies.

307
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,090
Morning jog?

308
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,210
Those who dare to slack off

309
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,460
shall run an extra lap.

310
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,420
The other day, didn't Mr. Zheng

311
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,610
teach you Thousand Character Classic?

312
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,180
Recite it while you run.

313
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,460
We have to do that too?

314
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,490
The cold and heat arrived by turns.

315
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,580
Harvest in autumn and store in winter.

316
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,060
The cold and heat arrived by turns.

317
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,370
Harvest in autumn and store in winter.

318
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,660
They're not fully awake yet.

319
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,330
Yes.

320
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,660
Chin up, chest out, and speak up.

321
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,130
What's wrong?

322
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,820
Feeling embarrassed?

323
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,180
You're no longer in an official family

324
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,010
and have become merchants.

325
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,660
Are you so shamed of that?

326
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,090
The darkling skies and yellow earth,

327
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,580
amid great chaos had their birth.

328
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,370
The sun...

329
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,780
The sun...

330
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,090
Mr. Yan,

331
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,180
I forgot the next line.

332
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,940
The next line is

333
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,130
"The sun and moon their courses ran.
Stars were set and around their span."

334
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,250
Good girl,

335
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,700
I'll take you to the front later.

336
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,130
Is that okay?

337
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,330
She is so young.

338
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,850
Yet she can face the others
without shame.

339
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,820
Are you not even as good as her?

340
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,460
Recite.

341
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,180
The darkling skies and yellow earth,

342
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,090
amid great chaos had their birth.

343
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:39,730
Louder.

344
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,970
The sun and moon their courses ran.

345
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,820
Stars were set and around their span.

346
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,820
Louder.

347
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,970
The cold and heat arrived by turns.
Harvest in autumn and store in winter.

348
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,490
Good.

349
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:54,970
Let's start running.

350
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,690

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,110

358
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,300
Gold is found in the River Li.

359
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,210
Jade is found in the Mountain Kunlun.

360
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,210
The best-known sword is called Juque.

361
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,180
The most famous peal is known as
Night Shine.

362
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,090
Valuable fruits, plums, and wild pears.

363
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,250
Important vegetables include
mustard and ginger...

364
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,010
What is this used for?

365
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,420
What is this for?

366
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,300
This is rice.

367
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,540
This is cotton.

368
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,330
The darkling skies and yellow earth,

369
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,300
amid great chaos had their birth.

370
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
The sun and moon their courses ran,

371
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,180
stars were set and around their span.

372
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,370

377
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,420
Good virtue brings them good fame

378
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,180
and noble forms will look the same.

379
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,820

Tell me how.

568

570
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,010
to see how seriously she hurt you.

571
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,810
Come on, let me see.

572
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,530
Come on.

573
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,700
Stop.

574
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,860
I'm not feeling well today.

575
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,460
You guys go ahead and play.
I'm heading back.

576
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:23,970
Come here, take a look.

577
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,100
Hey, baby.

578
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,490
Hello.

579
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,620
Is it tasty?

580
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,660
Shaoyao?

581
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,380
How come you finished school so early?

582
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,290
Ling was teaching today.

583
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,100
She didn't teach well.

584
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,010
So we left early.

585
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,530
We're bustling right now.

586
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:36,970
Go and play by yourself.

587
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,380
Alright, go.

588
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,810
Why are you still here?

589
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,290
Yes!

590
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,570
Shen Huan is so ill. He's dying!

591
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,730
Who?

592
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,660
Shen Huan,

593
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:01,940
the one you pricked with a needle,

594
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,250
the Shen family's second son!

595
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,050
That idiot.

596
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,140
What happened to him?

597
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,250
After you pricked him with the needle,

598
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,570
his face became covered with sores.

599
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,730
He's had a fever for days.

600
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,050
He's dying.

601
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,620
If he really dies,

602
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,380
it will be your fault.

603
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,700
And this shop will be closed down!

604
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,100
How could it be so serious?

605
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,490
I studied medicine. Take me to him!

606
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,530
- Let's go, hurry!
- Hurry!

607
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,380
Hurry up!

608
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:39,570
Chanlu!

609
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,940
What happened?

610
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:41,970
Have you seen Shaoyao?

611
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:42,940
No, I haven't.

612
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,290
I was busy with customers just now.

613
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,770
Shaoyao has gone missing!

614
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,380
Tell the others to look for her!

615
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:48,970
Chang!

616
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:50,940
We have to

617
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,970
let Lady Zhi know.

618
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,970
Go home

619
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:53,900
and tell her

620
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,530
and Mr. Yan.

621
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,250
Hurry up!

622
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:55,620
Yes!

623
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,460
In such a short time,

624
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,970
where could she possibly go?

625
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,180
She can't go far.

626
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,970
Could it be

627
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,460
she gets abducted?

628
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:05,770
Let's move.

629
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,770
We need to find her!

630
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:07,660
Let's go.

631
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,570
We will be there soon.

632
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:21,140
Is that idiot

633
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,730
in this pavilion?

634
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,210
Yes, he is right inside.

635
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,380
That's strange.

636
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,940
If he is seriously ill and dying,

637
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,140
shouldn't he be at home?

638
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,860
Just come along!

639
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,530
Stop talking.

640
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,530
Hurry, let's go!

641
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,420
- Come on.
- Come on.

642
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:32,940
Hurry up.

643
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,700
You're lying to me!

644
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
No, I want to go home!

645
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,290
Come on.

646
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,290
I'm not going up!

647
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,700
Come on. Hurry.

648
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,770
Don't leave.

649
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:44,970
Just play with us!

650
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,010
Stop it!

651
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:56,100
Let's go.

652
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,210
What are you doing?

653
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,570
We just want to play with her.

654
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,660
Yeah.

655
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,010
You should join us.

656
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:03,570
Play?

657
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,810
I'll play with you!

658
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,290
Come with me.

659
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:09,730
You can't leave.

660
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,100
You want to leave?

661
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,570
I insist

662
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,290
on playing with her today.

663
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,100
No one dares to

664
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,810
reject me yet!

665
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:27,970
What a letdown!

666
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:55,620
Alright.

667
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:57,810
Those people have left.

668
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,010
You should go home too.

669
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,570
Where's that needle from last time?

670
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:10,620
Aren't you pretty tough?

671
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,420
Why didn't you jab them?

672
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:12,940
I didn't bring it.

673
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,290
I didn't bring it today.

674
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,570
Alright,

675
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,810
stop crying.

676
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,530
From now on,

677
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,340
I'll definitely carry it with me
every day.

678
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:33,250
Yeah, don't forget to bring it again.

679
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:40,530
You didn't die?

680
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,250
They said you've got a high fever

681
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:45,970
and you're nearly dead.

682
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,050
That's impossible!

683
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,490
I am so...

684
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,700
Eh, so strong.

685
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,340
That's what I thought.

686
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,380
That drug only causes rashes.

687
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,700
It can't possibly cause a fever.

688
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:58,860
Rash?

689
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,140
What do you mean?

690
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,620
These rashes on my face

691
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,530
were caused by your drug?

692
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,570
You!

693
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,100
I can't believe I just saved you!

694
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,660
You actually drugged me!

695
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,940
Your face is covered in wounds.

696
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,810
There're wounds on your body too, right?

697
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,100
I'll get some medicine for you.

698
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,700
I'm fine.

699
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,860
Shaoyao!

700
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,700
Shaoyao, where are you?

701
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,660
Shaoyao.

702
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:30,940
Shaoyao.

703
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,730
Shaoyao!

704
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,490
I am right here!

705
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,010
Over there!

706
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,810
This way!

707
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,420
Yingchun!

708
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,140
Shaoyao.

709
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,100
Shaoyao.

710
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:38,620
Shaoyao!

711
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:40,460
Shaoyao,

712
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,420
how did you come here?

713
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,460
We looked for you everywhere!

714
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,810
Thank god you're fine.

715
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:45,940
Thank god.

716
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,460
I am fine.

717
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,460
He is not.

718
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:49,620
Let's go.

719
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,340
Let's go.

720
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:50,810
Come on.

721
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,660
Sorry for causing you to worry.

722
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,250
We looked for you everywhere!

723
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,940
From now on, no matter who you see

724
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,660
and where you want to go,

725
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,620
you must ask me first,

726
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,290
or your brother.

727
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:12,940
Do you understand?

728
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:15,490
I understand.

729
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,770
That pavilion by the bridge

730
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,970
is booked all year round for pleasure.

731
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,490
Do you know who it is?

732
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,140
I've seen that person.

733
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,100
He came to the shop before,

734
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,380
sneaking around suspiciously.

735
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,290
He stood there for a long time.

736
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,810
He is called Shen Huan.

737
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,250
How do you know him?

738
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,340
One day,

739
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,700
he followed me.

740
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:34,460
Baoxia said

741
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,010
he wanted to bully Zhi.

742
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,050
He mistook me for Zhi.

743
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,810
I pricked him with a needle.

744
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,050
The riverside

745
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,420
is so beautiful.

746
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,180
Yanxi,

747
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:43,970
Zhi,

748
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:44,570
next time,

749
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,010
we should go there together.

750
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:52,380
He's angry.

751
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,940
Sir, he has passed out.

752
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,940
Let me see.

753
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,530
[Name list]

754
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,860
[Shen Huan]
The last one is with the surname Shen.

755
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,250
Alright,

756
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,380
the commander will handle this himself.

757
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,010
Let's go.

758
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,210
Are you Shen Huan?

759
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:57,770
Yes.

760
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,100
You wanted to bully Lady Hua,

761
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,770
but you got the wrong person.

762
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:02,940
And you got pricked.

763
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,530
How do you know that?

764
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,180
Are you pounding herbal medicine?

765
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,770
Zhi.

766
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,140
Can you tell me

767
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,730
what a good person is

768
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,700
and what a bad person is?

769
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,380
Why suddenly ask such a question?

770
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,210
That Shen Huan

771
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,140
is very silly.

772
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,810
He wanted to bully someone,
but in the end,

773
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:29,940
even someone like me

774
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,810
could bully him.

775
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,380
And yet, he came to help me.

776
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,290
Also, because of me,

777
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,210
he fought with his friends

778
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,770
and got covered in wounds.

779
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,100
But why?

780
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,770
Perhaps at that moment,

781
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
he considered you a friend

782
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,530
instead of those who bullied you.

783
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,180
That's right.

784
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,660
I see.

785
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,660
Friend.

786
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:03,700
Sir,

787
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,730
Ms. Wei, Empress Dowager's maid,

788
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,490
went out of the palace earlier today.

789
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,860
She went to Shanhua Temple
on behalf of the Empress Dowager

790
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,660
to offer donations.

791
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,420
She's been sending letters
to the Hua Family.

792
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,100
This time we can catch her in the act.

793
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,250
Sir,

794
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,210
should I follow her?

795
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,290
Yes.

796
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:17,860
Do it yourself.

797
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,380
Get the letter
and bring it directly to me.

798
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:19,860
Yes, sir.

799
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,010
Well...

800
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,620
Sir,

801
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:24,340
if we do find out something,

802
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,250
what should we do

803
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,660
with the Hua Family?

804
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,770
Tell Zhi to come here.

805
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:06,810
Yes.

806
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:17,210
Madam,

807
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,340
Lady Zhi is here.

808
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:19,860
Grandmother.

809
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,810
There is something
that can't be entrusted to others.

810
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,340
I need your help.

811
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,460
Anything, Grandmother.

812
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,100
My vision has gone blurry.

813
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,100
I can't write.

814
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,940
These letters in this box,

815
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,050
I need you to copy them for me.

816
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:38,570
Can you do that?

817
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,660
Copy letters?

818
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,700
If you have the time,

819
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,050
please copy them for me.

820
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,660
But if you're too busy,

821
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,530
then forget it.

822
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,010
It's not a big deal.

823
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,730
I'll have them copied in a few days.

824
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,050
See you.

825
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:57,940
Madam,

826
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,970
why do you want...?

827
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,770
For the first time in forty years,

828
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,050
the box at the temple

829
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,100
was emptied.

830
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,380
I'm afraid someone might have found out

831
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,380
about our letters.

832
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,810
That means

833
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,380
these letters of mine

834
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,940
will be gone.

835
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:13,860
That's

836
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,660
why I asked Zhi to copy them,

837
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,250
so I get to keep them

838
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,380
as a keepsake.

839
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,860
How long has it been
since you last looked at the stars?

840
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,620
I forgot.

841
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,250
[Security Bureau Guard]

842
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,380
Ms. Su did not bring home any letters.

843
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,460
Madame Hua will figure it out.

844
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:02,380
There are no more new letters.

845
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:03,860
If His Majesty asks about it,

846
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,250
we can only give him the old letters

847
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:05,770
from the Hua Family.

848
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,100
You should get back.

849
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,180
Yes, sir.

850
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:13,210
Someone was there!

851
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,730
It's Hua Zhi.

852
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:32,570
I just saw you

853
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,460
coming out of the government office.

854
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,660
Are you in trouble?

855
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,620
The other day,

856
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,010
he came to me

857
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,900
asking about Master Hua.

858
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,940
You can't read his mind.

859
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:43,570
We must be cautious.

860
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,940
Still up?

861
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,780
You're still up as well.

862
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,530
Can I help you?

863
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,220
It's cold out here.

864
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,380
Let's talk inside.

865
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,860
You shouldn't have followed me in.

866
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,050
Why?

867
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,300
Don't you know that the Security Bureau

868
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,780
never cares about human lives?

869
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,940
Do you care?

870
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,970
Aren't you afraid I'm going to kill you?

871
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,570
Are you going to kill me?

872
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,260
Next time when you try to scare me,

873
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,340
pull out your blade first.

874
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,170
Don't just talk.

875
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:45,860
What do you want to know?

876
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,380
I can tell you everything.

877
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,570
What do you have to tell me?

878
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,380
Hua Zhi,

879
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,420
no matter who I really am,

880
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,940
I will not harm you,

881
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,570
nor your family.

882
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,780
During your time here with my family,

883
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,940
what have you reported
to the Security Bureau?

884
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,260
Nothing.

885
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,010
In that case,

886
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,090
won't you be punished?

887
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,740
At this point,

888
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,340
you're still worried about me?

889
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,900
Before, the Security Bureau

890
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,050
had their people watching us.

891
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,780
Now, they've sent you here undercover.

892
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,610
But I am not worried.

893
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,170
We have done nothing wrong.

894
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,570
I am not afraid of them.

895
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,820
You can tell them everything.

896
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:28,940
I came here

897
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,090
to investigate a case
on behalf of those above.

898
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:32,780
Earlier, you said

899
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,380
your family has no ties
to the Empress Dowager.

900
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,970
But in Madam Hua's room,

901
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:36,780
there is a box

902
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,300
filled letters

903
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,130
from the Empress Dowager.

904
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,300
Those are from the Empress Dowager?

905
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,740
You know about those letters?

906
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,260
Does the Security Bureau fear

907
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,090
that we will reply
on the Empress Dowager

908
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,130
and become a threat?

909
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:48,780
Yes.

910
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:50,940
Follow me.

911
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,340
How could this be?

912
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:15,940
In these letters,

913
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:16,690
there is nothing

914
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,010
to hide.

915
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,220
Indeed.

916
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,010
Nothing is related to politics.

917
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Instead, they're even quite...

918
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,490
Cute.

919
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,130
Two young ladies

920
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,650
met since their maiden years

921
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,010
and then separated when they married.

922
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,050
After that, they both had children

923
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,610
and witnessed the world's harshness.

924
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,380
But their friendship has never waned.

925
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,340
They can't see each other,

926
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,570
but they kept in touch by letters.

927
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,860
These letters

928
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:42,900
contain no complaints,

929
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:43,780
nor grudges.

930
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,610
They only write about
the beauty of nature

931
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,010
and share their innermost feelings.

932
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,300
In these letters,

933
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:49,220
they've stayed

934
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,300
young,

935
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,220
untouched by worldly matters,

936
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,460
and been untainted by dust.

937
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:54,740
However, Hua Zhi,

938
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,610
I have to confiscate these letters.

939
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:58,570
They can prove the innocence
of the Hua Family.

940
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,530
My grandmother knew it.

941
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,490
No wonder she asked me to copy them.

942
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:03,940
Can you

943
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,010
give me some more time?

944
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,740
I'll finish before dawn.

945
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:07,970
Okay.

946
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,710
[Hua Mansion]

947
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,220
Wait for me to come back.

948
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:07,970
Zhi.

949
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,860
What are you looking at?

950
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,420
Zhi,

951
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,690
just now,

952
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,050
you were like me when I'm back at home.

953
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,570
Did you used to daydream a lot?

954
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,650
I got nothing to do,

955
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,860
so I daydream.

956
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:27,300
Shaoyao,

957
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,690
tell me about your brother.

958
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,970
What kind of person is he?

959
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,570
My brother

960
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,220
is

961
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:35,740
very busy.

962
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,780
He has a lot of things to do

963
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,090
and little to say.

964
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,970
He is weird.

965
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,570
He's different with you, though.

966
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,860
How?

967
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,860
He likes talking to you.

968
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,740
Today, I learned something shocking

969
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,050
about him.

970
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,570
But surprisingly,

971
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,780
I am not afraid of him at all.

972
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,650
Why should you be?

973
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,780
He is a good person.

974
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,420
I'm going to send medicine to a friend.

975
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:09,970
Let's talk when I return.

976
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,170
Ridiculous.

977
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:29,940
At such an old age,

978
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,650
they went through all the trouble
to write to each other

979
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,650
just to talk about unimportant things.

980
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,130
The Empress Dowager and Madam Hua

981
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,900
have been friends

982
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:39,900
since they were young.

983
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,050
Perhaps when people get old,

984
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,050
they'll all reminisce about the past.

985
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,380
What's the meaning of that?

986
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,130
She still can't leave the palace,

987
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,300
nor change her status.

988
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:50,170
Other than self-deception

989
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:50,970
and self-comfort,

990
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,530
I see no meaning in this.

991
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:54,050
If there's some consolation,

992
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,860
perhaps that's the meaning.

993
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,740
Yanxi,

994
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,780
you are a decisive man.

995
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,610
You cannot be like the Empress Dowager,

996
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,650
so sentimental.

997
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,090
I don't understand their friendship.

998
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,860
That was just a guess.

999
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,420
I heard that to find out the truth,

1000
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,530
you've been with the Hua Family.

1001
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:14,650
You worked hard.

1002
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:15,900
Uncle,

1003
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,690
I'm spending time with the Hua Family

1004
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,780
not solely because of your order.

1005
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,420
That fire at Lord Ling's Mansion

1006
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:25,340
was witnessed by someone
from the Hua Family.

1007
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,460
I went there

1008
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,050
to find clues.

1009
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:29,740
Yanxi,

1010
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,170
with me,

1011
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:33,570
you have always been so honest.
