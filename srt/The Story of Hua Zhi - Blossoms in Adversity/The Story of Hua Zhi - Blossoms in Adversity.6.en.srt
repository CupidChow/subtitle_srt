00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,900
<font size="20">Let me do it, let me.</font>

159
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,620
<font size="20">I was here first.</font>

160
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,380
<font size="20">Get out of the way.</font>

161
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,660
<font size="20">Why the pushing?</font>

162
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,620
<font size="20">Back off, you there.</font>

163
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:14,980
<font size="20">I was here first.</font>

164
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,340
<font size="20">Me first, me first.</font>

165
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,860
<font size="20">What nonsense!</font>

166
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,860
<font size="20">Why did you tear it?</font>

167
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,020
<font size="20">After all,</font>

168
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,740
<font size="20">it was bought with money.</font>

169
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,780
<font size="20">Just joining in on the fun.</font>

170
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,140
<font size="20">Just to take a look at the young lady.</font>

171
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,460
<font size="20">The Hua family is so unlucky.</font>

172
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,620
<font size="20">I, I certainly don't
want to stick it in my house.</font>

173
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,300
<font size="20">You dare?</font>

174
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,300
<font size="20">But, you see,</font>

175
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,460
<font size="20">if she would</font>

176
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,940
<font size="20">agree to be my concubine,</font>

177
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,860
<font size="20">then I could possibly</font>

178
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,740
<font size="20">consider it.</font>

179
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,100
<font size="20">That makes sense.</font>

180
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,100
<font size="20">Forget it, I don't want it anymore.</font>

181
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,540
<font size="20">Yes, getting involved with the Hua family</font>

182
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,020
<font size="20">could only bring us a plague deity</font>

183
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,780
<font size="20">instead of good luck.</font>

184
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:07,900
<font size="20">Let's go.</font>

185
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,260
<font size="20">I...</font>

186
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,580
<font size="20">What's wrong?</font>

187
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,300
<font size="20">Take a look at the floral cloth.</font>

188
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,500
<font size="20">Look, look.</font>

189
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,780
<font size="20">You try one.</font>

190
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:29,940
<font size="20">Then I'll do it.</font>

191
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,380
<font size="20">I'll sell this cheap.</font>

192
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,060
<font size="20">Stop writing.</font>

193
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,060
<font size="20">They're just bored</font>

194
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,060
<font size="20">and playing tricks on you.</font>

195
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,100
<font size="20">Come take a look at this!</font>

196
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,180
<font size="20">They do it out of boredom;
I do it for money.</font>

197
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,740
<font size="20">Isn't this the best for both?</font>

198
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,220
<font size="20">Are you going to buy it or not?</font>

199
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,540
<font size="20">If you're not buying,
don't get in our way</font>

200
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,260
<font size="20">to look at the young lady.</font>

201
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,940
<font size="20">Yeah, exactly.</font>

202
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,020
<font size="20">Exactly.</font>

203
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,900
<font size="20">We are still waiting for it.</font>

204
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,580
<font size="20">Today,</font>

205
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,620
<font size="20">I, Shen Qi, has learned another lesson.</font>

206
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,420
<font size="20">You said the other day</font>

207
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,340
<font size="20">that we have no relation to each other.</font>

208
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,940
<font size="20">That's not the case.</font>

209
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,020
<font size="20">I admire you</font>

210
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,900
<font size="20">and respect you.</font>

211
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,700
<font size="20">Since the first time
we met at the coppersmith's,</font>

212
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,060
<font size="20">it has been this way.</font>

213
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,660
<font size="20">Even if you are not
a member of the Hua family,</font>

214
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,580
<font size="20">even if you are not a girl,</font>

215
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,820
<font size="20">I still want to be your friend</font>

216
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,060
<font size="20">and your confidant.</font>

217
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,940
<font size="20">Of course, no problem.</font>

218
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,980
<font size="20">Are you going to let her do business?</font>

219
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:28,900
<font size="20">He is going.</font>

220
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,140
<font size="20">Isn't this causing trouble?</font>

221
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,500
<font size="20">Exactly.</font>

222
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,540
<font size="20">Such deep affection and loyalty!</font>

223
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,300
<font size="20">Your Excellency,</font>

224
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,540
<font size="20">there is some intelligence.</font>

225
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,860
<font size="20">[There is suspicion of financial collusion
between the Shen and Hua families]</font>

226
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,260
<font size="20">From now on,</font>

227
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,500
<font size="20">you don't need to send me</font>

228
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,700
<font size="20">such unsubstantiated news anymore.</font>

229
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,140
<font size="20">Yes, Your Excellency.</font>

230
00:08:59,540 --> 00:08:59,860
<font size="20">Go</font>

231
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,660
<font size="20">and buy a pair of
Spring Festival couplets.</font>

232
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,620
<font size="20">It's for the New Year's Day.</font>

233
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,380
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

234
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,620
<font size="20">Please wait, sir.</font>

235
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:18,940
<font size="20">Step back.</font>

236
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,500
<font size="20">Could you tell me how to
get to the city's pharmacy?</font>

237
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,860
<font size="20">You don't recognize me?</font>

238
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,740
<font size="20">You are the one who seized my house.</font>

239
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,300
<font size="20">Then why do you ask me?</font>

240
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,220
<font size="20">The Hua family bears the guilt;
when I ask them,</font>

241
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
<font size="20">either they dare not speak</font>

242
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,620
<font size="20">or they just deceive me recklessly.</font>

243
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,780
<font size="20">So I can only ask you.</font>

244
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,220
<font size="20">Aren't you afraid of me?</font>

245
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,140
<font size="20">No.</font>

246
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,900
<font size="20">You're not afraid of me every time.</font>

247
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,260
<font size="20">Our family is now
as insignificant as ants.</font>

248
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,180
<font size="20">You, the Seven-Star Bureau,
carry out cases by imperial decree</font>

249
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,340
<font size="20">and have been closely watching us.</font>

250
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,260
<font size="20">You disdain to kill me</font>

251
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,620
<font size="20">and are unable to kill me.</font>

252
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,660
<font size="20">It seems</font>

253
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,580
<font size="20">that your profit is
quite substantial today.</font>

254
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,700
<font size="20">Look,</font>

255
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,660
<font size="20">along that alley,</font>

256
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,260
<font size="20">turn left,</font>

257
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,540
<font size="20">and when you see the stone lion,
you're there.</font>

258
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,620
<font size="20">I heard that Shen was engaged to you.</font>

259
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,340
<font size="20">Now that the marriage is off,</font>

260
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,060
<font size="20">you've started to appear in public</font>

261
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,500
<font size="20">and given up on yourself.</font>

262
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,820
<font size="20">If appearing in public</font>

263
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,900
<font size="20">equals giving up on oneself,</font>

264
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,580
<font size="20">then you, who cover
your face all day long</font>

265
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,260
<font size="20">and avoid people,</font>

266
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,580
<font size="20">shunning even the daylight,</font>

267
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,260
<font size="20">aren't the world's foremost</font>

268
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,340
<font size="20">paragon of virtue and propriety?</font>

269
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,660
<font size="20">I just saw Shen</font>

270
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,020
<font size="20">coming to buy your
Spring Festival couplets.</font>

271
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,140
<font size="20">Truly a pair of ill-fated lovers.</font>

272
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,820
<font size="20">Quite sigh-inducing.</font>

273
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,420
<font size="20">I've long had no ties
with the Shen family.</font>

274
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,780
<font size="20">Shen bought it;</font>

275
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,100
<font size="20">everyone in the city also bought it;</font>

276
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,980
<font size="20">could they all
be related to the Hua family?</font>

277
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,380
<font size="20">Why are you in such a hurry
to clear the connection?</font>

278
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,740
<font size="20">You want to protect him, huh?</font>

279
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,740
<font size="20">Do you hate me?</font>

280
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,420
<font size="20">In private,</font>

281
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,700
<font size="20">you and I are strangers.</font>

282
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:18,940
<font size="20">In public,</font>

283
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,100
<font size="20">you and my grandfather
both serve as court officials.</font>

284
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,860
<font size="20">Your Excellency
enjoys the emperor's grace.</font>

285
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,380
<font size="20">The Hua family
bears the emperor's wrath.</font>

286
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,700
<font size="20">I'm just uncertain about</font>

287
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,540
<font size="20">whether this wrath will</font>

288
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,900
<font size="20">fall upon your head or not.</font>

289
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,940
<font size="20">What does these couplets mean?</font>

290
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,620
<font size="20">Can't you read?</font>

291
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,460
<font size="20">I only recognize half of it.</font>

292
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,860
<font size="20">What do you mean
you only recognize half?</font>

293
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,380
<font size="20">I recognize
the first half of the sentence.</font>

294
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,140
<font size="20">It's a fine verse by Song Yanqing.</font>

295
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,140
<font size="20">Descending Mount Song,
my thoughts are manifold.</font>

296
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,460
<font size="20">Accompanied by a beauty,
our steps linger.</font>

297
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,820
<font size="20">Among the pines,
the bright moon is always like this.</font>

298
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,940
<font size="20">When will you roam again?</font>

299
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,100
<font size="20">With such a scene,</font>

300
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,580
<font size="20">complemented by your latter half,</font>

301
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,180
<font size="20">all elegance is lost.</font>

302
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,060
<font size="20">Now without the bright moon or a beauty.</font>

303
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,220
<font size="20">Your Excellency,</font>

304
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,300
<font size="20">is your carriage broken?</font>

305
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,340
<font size="20">Why does it travel so slowly?</font>

306
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,260
<font size="20">Anyway,</font>

307
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,420
<font size="20">you shouldn't have left the lady behind</font>

308
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
<font size="20">and let her come back alone.</font>

309
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,300
<font size="20">How come I can't make you understand?</font>

310
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,300
<font size="20">It was she who asked me to return first</font>

311
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,820
<font size="20">to bring you food.</font>

312
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,220
<font size="20">You always blame me.</font>

313
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,460
<font size="20">The lady has returned.</font>

314
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,820
<font size="20">My Lady.</font>

315
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,820
<font size="20">Move everything down.</font>

316
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,540
<font size="20">My Lady, are you alright?</font>

317
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,900
<font size="20">We've got everything
for eating and using;</font>

318
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,060
<font size="20">even the medicine for
Madam Hua has been prepared.</font>

319
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,220
<font size="20">So why are you still not happy?</font>

320
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,900
<font size="20">Zhi,</font>

321
00:12:59,060 --> 00:12:59,540
<font size="20">These...</font>

322
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,860
<font size="20">These...</font>

323
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,060
<font size="20">All of these are earned by you?</font>

324
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:06,980
<font size="20">At least there's no need to go hungry</font>

325
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,660
<font size="20">on New Year's Eve.</font>

326
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,140
<font size="20">Come.</font>

327
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,140
<font size="20">Come on, hurry and move.</font>

328
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,860
<font size="20">Madam Hua,</font>

329
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,380
<font size="20">drink some more hot soup.</font>

330
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,140
<font size="20">There's actually meat in today's soup!</font>

331
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,740
<font size="20">Everyone, eat up.</font>

332
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,660
<font size="20">In the past,</font>

333
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,380
<font size="20">not even the family dog would eat it.</font>

334
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,780
<font size="20">But now,</font>

335
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,300
<font size="20">it has become a rare delicacy.</font>

336
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,180
<font size="20">Boli,</font>

337
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,300
<font size="20">there's meat today,</font>

338
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,260
<font size="20">eat more of it.</font>

339
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,420
<font size="20">It's really delicious.</font>

340
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,340
<font size="20">Isn't it?</font>

341
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,620
<font size="20">Now, just smelling this hint of</font>

342
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,300
<font size="20">meat aroma</font>

343
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,020
<font size="20">feels like ushering in the New Year.</font>

344
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,940
<font size="20">Aunt Qi, have you lost your wits?</font>

345
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,380
<font size="20">Tonight is indeed New Year's Eve!</font>

346
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:53,820
<font size="20">Is it?</font>

347
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,380
<font size="20">Then I didn't know</font>

348
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,500
<font size="20">whether the lord and masters</font>

349
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,740
<font size="20">would be able to have a warm meal.</font>

350
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,380
<font size="20">I really want to have
another reunion dinner.</font>

351
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,580
<font size="20">Even if it's just a poor life,</font>

352
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,740
<font size="20">as long as the family</font>

353
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,980
<font size="20">is together, that's good enough.</font>

354
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,740
<font size="20">Then let's eat up.</font>

355
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,380
<font size="20">Don't waste Zhi's effort.</font>

356
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,180
<font size="20">Eat up quickly.</font>

357
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:42,540
<font size="20">Eat.</font>

358
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,940
<font size="20">Eat.</font>

359
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:43,980
<font size="20">Eat, eat.</font>

360
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,540
<font size="20">Zhi,</font>

361
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,340
<font size="20">you must be exhausted.</font>

362
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,740
<font size="20">Aunt Wu.</font>

363
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,620
<font size="20">I saved up five coppers today</font>

364
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,700
<font size="20">to buy something for you.</font>

365
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,060
<font size="20">What is it?</font>

366
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,620
<font size="20">Fried plums.</font>

367
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,830
<font size="20">(Jin's)</font>

368
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,940
<font size="20">There is some candy for</font>

369
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,820
<font size="20">Madam Hua's medicine left.</font>

370
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,900
<font size="20">I tried frying the plums
you brought back last time</font>

371
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,700
<font size="20">with some sugar.</font>

372
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,460
<font size="20">Madam Wu, please have a taste.</font>

373
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,940
<font size="20">Delicious, Hua Zhi.</font>

374
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,500
<font size="20">You try it.</font>

375
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,420
<font size="20">It's too sour.</font>

376
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,180
<font size="20">Delicious, I'm not kidding you.</font>

377
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:07,700
<font size="20">Fudong,</font>

378
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,820
<font size="20">You really have a knack for this.</font>

379
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,300
<font size="20">Delicious!</font>

380
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,420
<font size="20">If you ask me,</font>

381
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,900
<font size="20">this is even tastier than</font>

382
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,740
<font size="20">Jin's fried plums;</font>

383
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,820
<font size="20">Those plums cost five coppers per pack.</font>

384
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,540
<font size="20">Now you know they cost five coppers.</font>

385
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,220
<font size="20">If Fudong puts her heart into it,</font>

386
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,460
<font size="20">I'm afraid Jin's
would have to close shop.</font>

387
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,420
<font size="20">If Madam Wu likes them,</font>

388
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,900
<font size="20">I could actually try to make some</font>

389
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,660
<font size="20">according to Jin's flavor.</font>

390
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,980
<font size="20">It's just that I don't know
where these red fruits</font>

391
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,420
<font size="20">come from.</font>

392
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,300
<font size="20">To the east,
three miles from this village,</font>

393
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,100
<font size="20">there's a grove,</font>

394
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,860
<font size="20">filled with red fruits.</font>

395
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,980
<font size="20">If you go to pick them again,</font>

396
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,020
<font size="20">remember to take some food along</font>

397
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,860
<font size="20">to feed the old widow living there.</font>

398
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:45,780
<font size="20">Okay.</font>

399
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,180
<font size="20">With only an old woman and a child,</font>

400
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,500
<font size="20">they cannot pick them,</font>

401
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,620
<font size="20">or sell them.</font>

402
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,260
<font size="20">That's why they're left until winter</font>

403
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,420
<font size="20">to let us get such a good deal.</font>

404
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,180
<font size="20">Now in this world,</font>

405
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,460
<font size="20">there are truly many pitiable people.</font>

406
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,260
<font size="20">And now there is</font>

407
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
<font size="20">our big family included.</font>

408
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,980
<font size="20">Come here,</font>

409
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:01,820
<font size="20">Come.</font>

410
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,100
<font size="20">Zhi,</font>

411
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,060
<font size="20">right now,</font>

412
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:04,860
<font size="20">do you have a moment?</font>

413
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,300
<font size="20">Madam Xia, please speak.</font>

414
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,140
<font size="20">You can leave for now.</font>

415
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,860
<font size="20">It was only yesterday that I found out</font>

416
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,140
<font size="20">what it means that the jingle of coppers</font>

417
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,020
<font size="20">sounds like the music of immortals.</font>

418
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,420
<font size="20">You know,</font>

419
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,620
<font size="20">Ling's writing was counted as the best</font>

420
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,420
<font size="20">in the mansion before.</font>

421
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,420
<font size="20">Next time,
bring your younger sister along</font>

422
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,500
<font size="20">to write
Spring Festival couplets together.</font>

423
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,300
<font size="20">I won't go.</font>

424
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,220
<font size="20">I thought it was something important.</font>

425
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,020
<font size="20">It's a wonder you were also born into</font>

426
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,540
<font size="20">a family of courtesy traditions,</font>

427
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,500
<font size="20">even my two maids are ashamed to do</font>

428
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,420
<font size="20">such an embarrassing act on the street.</font>

429
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,900
<font size="20">Today, I will make things clear.</font>

430
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,540
<font size="20">I would rather starve to death</font>

431
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,740
<font size="20">than earn this filthy money.</font>

432
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,860
<font size="20">Does having read a few lines of text</font>

433
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,620
<font size="20">mean that one can live on air?</font>

434
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,180
<font size="20">How did I give birth
to someone like you,</font>

435
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,340
<font size="20">a girl impermeable to persuasion?</font>

436
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,260
<font size="20">You won't write it, will you?</font>

437
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,860
<font size="20">Isn't there a ready-made one?</font>

438
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:56,500
<font size="20">Mother,</font>

439
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,740
<font size="20">this is my Early Spring
Creek Journey painting.</font>

440
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,500
<font size="20">Don't touch it!</font>

441
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,500
<font size="20">You... You don't touch it!</font>

442
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,580
<font size="20">What's this
West Journey or East Journey?</font>

443
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,220
<font size="20">After eating dust bunnies
for so many days,</font>

444
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:02,900
<font size="20">when has this thing</font>

445
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,780
<font size="20">ever filled our stomachs?</font>

446
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,740
<font size="20">You might as well
give it to your elder sister</font>

447
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,620
<font size="20">to sell for a good sum of money.</font>

448
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,220
<font size="20">At least it will stave off hunger.</font>

449
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,300
<font size="20">Give it to me!</font>

450
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,620
<font size="20">You... you...</font>

451
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,500
<font size="20">Give it to me!</font>

452
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,060
<font size="20">You...</font>

453
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,780
<font size="20">Today, I'd rather burn it</font>

454
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,500
<font size="20">than sell it.</font>

455
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,940
<font size="20">Fine.</font>

456
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,020
<font size="20">Go ahead and burn it.</font>

457
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,020
<font size="20">Burn it!</font>

458
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,100
<font size="20">Burn it!</font>

459
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,500
<font size="20">Go ahead and burn it!</font>

460
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,580
<font size="20">If you have the nerve,</font>

461
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,460
<font size="20">then burn it all.</font>

462
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,940
<font size="20">If you don't put an end
to this idea today,</font>

463
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,700
<font size="20">I'm afraid that in the future,</font>

464
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,340
<font size="20">you will focus all your attention on</font>

465
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,900
<font size="20">these trivial matters.</font>

466
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,020
<font size="20">Trivial matters?</font>

467
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,540
<font size="20">You used to boast to everyone about</font>

468
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,500
<font size="20">how talented I was;</font>

469
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,660
<font size="20">no matter how I tried to persuade you,</font>

470
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,260
<font size="20">you would not listen.</font>

471
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,300
<font size="20">Today, you have
finally spoken the truth.</font>

472
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,420
<font size="20">You have never truly thought</font>

473
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,340
<font size="20">that I had any strengths,</font>

474
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,460
<font size="20">only taking me</font>

475
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,540
<font size="20">to show off in front of others!</font>

476
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,300
<font size="20">You...</font>

477
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,860
<font size="20">Madam Xia,</font>

478
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,700
<font size="20">today marks the end of
the New Year's celebration.</font>

479
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,620
<font size="20">After the festival celebration,</font>

480
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,940
<font size="20">whether it's couplets or calligraphy,</font>

481
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,700
<font size="20">most have lost their appeal.</font>

482
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:57,700
<font size="20">I just took advantage of</font>

483
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,780
<font size="20">the fanfare of our family's stall.</font>

484
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,060
<font size="20">Once the novelty wears off,</font>

485
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,140
<font size="20">I fear no one will show interest.</font>

486
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,820
<font size="20">This is not a long-term solution.</font>

487
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,420
<font size="20">Hua Ling need not get involved.</font>

488
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,860
<font size="20">That wretched girl.</font>

489
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,380
<font size="20">No matter how much we earn,</font>

490
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,420
<font size="20">every copper counts.</font>

491
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,300
<font size="20">The year has passed,</font>

492
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,140
<font size="20">but what will we eat in the future?</font>

493
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,260
<font size="20">There are as many ways to
make money as you can imagine.</font>

494
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,580
<font size="20">I'm just afraid you won't agree.</font>

495
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,820
<font size="20">Zhi,</font>

496
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,540
<font size="20">before I was married,</font>

497
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,900
<font size="20">I was used to handling the abacus.</font>

498
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,340
<font size="20">The trades I handled were much more</font>

499
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,860
<font size="20">than the streets you
have ever wandered through.</font>

500
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
<font size="20">You, a young girl,</font>

501
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,980
<font size="20">need not advise me.</font>

502
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,140
<font size="20">It's just</font>

503
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,740
<font size="20">that engaging in trade
is considered lowly.</font>

504
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
<font size="20">It's alright for a temporary fix,</font>

505
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,100
<font size="20">but if it's taken as a long-term plan,</font>

506
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,420
<font size="20">I'm afraid</font>

507
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,180
<font size="20">it's resigning ourselves
to a lower status.</font>

508
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,500
<font size="20">If you says so, then it is so.</font>

509
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:53,340
<font size="20">My Lady,</font>

510
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,140
<font size="20">Mr. Shen has arrived.</font>

511
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,460
<font size="20">Mr. Shen,</font>

512
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,140
<font size="20">You have come.</font>

513
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:01,580
<font size="20">Madam Xia.</font>

514
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,100
<font size="20">The news I've just received</font>

515
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,620
<font size="20">is that the Ministry of Justice
has concluded the trial.</font>

516
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
<font size="20">And the masters are
without risk to their lives.</font>

517
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,420
<font size="20">Heavens bless!</font>

518
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:11,940
<font size="20">Following the conclusion,</font>

519
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,140
<font size="20">the male members of your family
will be escorted in batches</font>

520
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,140
<font size="20">to be exiled to the north.</font>

521
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,020
<font size="20">The side branches
have already set out today.</font>

522
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,340
<font size="20">In three days' time,
early in the morning,</font>

523
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,420
<font size="20">the masters</font>

524
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,540
<font size="20">are to be escorted out of the city.</font>

525
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,180
<font size="20">Outside the Wansheng Gate
there's a Shili Pavilion,</font>

526
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,380
<font size="20">all those who are exiled</font>

527
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,580
<font size="20">will linger for a moment in the pavilion</font>

528
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,300
<font size="20">to examine their identities.</font>

529
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,180
<font size="20">If you wish to meet them,</font>

530
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,180
<font size="20">then it shall be here.</font>

531
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,620
<font size="20">But not many can go;</font>

532
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,700
<font size="20">at most two or three people.</font>

533
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,660
<font size="20">Otherwise, I'm afraid
the officials won't allow the meeting.</font>

534
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:38,740
<font size="20">Alright.</font>

535
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,100
<font size="20">Thank you for informing me.</font>

536
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,460
<font size="20">I will go and discuss it
with Madam Hua at once.</font>

537
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,540
<font size="20">Hua Zhi,</font>

538
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
<font size="20">it's inconvenient for me
to stay here any longer.</font>

539
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,140
<font size="20">Three days from now,
early in the morning</font>

540
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,460
<font size="20">I will wait outside the bamboo forest</font>

541
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,700
<font size="20">to take three ladies along</font>

542
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,980
<font size="20">to Shili Pavilion for the meeting.</font>

543
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,060
<font size="20">If there's anything
you wish to send to them,</font>

544
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,860
<font size="20">take it all along.</font>

545
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,820
<font size="20">I've heard that</font>

546
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,900
<font size="20">in the Northern Land,
where water drips to form ice,</font>

547
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,780
<font size="20">the snow has yet to
melt in April and May.</font>

548
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,900
<font size="20">My husband has always
been sensitive to the cold.</font>

549
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,860
<font size="20">Now, going up north in this season,</font>

550
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,980
<font size="20">how will he endure it?</font>

551
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,420
<font size="20">Let alone the Lord.</font>

552
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,060
<font size="20">Zhi went shopping yesterday,</font>

553
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,100
<font size="20">and I remember
she brought back some fabric.</font>

554
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:28,740
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

555
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,260
<font size="20">Spring is upon us,</font>

556
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,180
<font size="20">and I intended to
have clothes made for everyone.</font>

557
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,060
<font size="20">No.</font>

558
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,020
<font size="20">Bring all that fabric here.</font>

559
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,380
<font size="20">Make them into padded jackets.</font>

560
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,420
<font size="20">Remember,</font>

561
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,900
<font size="20">they must be made larger.</font>

562
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,980
<font size="20">And bring those
previously purchased by Mr. Shen</font>

563
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,620
<font size="20">as well.</font>

564
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,580
<font size="20">Take them apart,</font>

565
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,180
<font size="20">take out the cotton batting,</font>

566
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
<font size="20">and stuff it into heavy clothing.</font>

567
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,180
<font size="20">Bring along a few maids</font>

568
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,660
<font size="20">to buy more needles and thread.</font>

569
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,020
<font size="20">The sturdier the better.</font>

570
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,020
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

571
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,820
<font size="20">Besides our own men,</font>

572
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,820
<font size="20">the men from the side lines</font>

573
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,020
<font size="20">must not be forgotten either.</font>

574
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,180
<font size="20">Their families</font>

575
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,900
<font size="20">are mostly without news.</font>

576
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,180
<font size="20">There's not much they can prepare.</font>

577
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,660
<font size="20">Within three days,</font>

578
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,900
<font size="20">no matter what,</font>

579
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,100
<font size="20">we must produce forty-three pieces</font>

580
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,900
<font size="20">of cotton clothing.</font>

581
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,780
<font size="20">No man from our Hua family</font>

582
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,020
<font size="20">should freeze to death out there.</font>

583
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,100
<font size="20">Yes,</font>

584
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:14,940
<font size="20">Madam Hua.</font>

585
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,620
<font size="20">Don't use up all the cotton batting;</font>

586
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,860
<font size="20">lay it out thinly in three layers</font>

587
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,220
<font size="20">and leave a layer inside.</font>

588
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,220
<font size="20">Otherwise,</font>

589
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,380
<font size="20">the masters won't freeze to death,</font>

590
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,660
<font size="20">but we will all be frozen.</font>

591
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,180
<font size="20">Do you understand?</font>

592
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,340
<font size="20">Yes!</font>

593
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,980
<font size="20">If we know</font>

594
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,660
<font size="20">which ones are for the masters</font>

595
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,220
<font size="20">I'll lay them out extra thick.</font>

596
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<font size="20">My sister,</font>

597
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,020
<font size="20">you're confused.</font>

598
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,780
<font size="20">The ones for the masters</font>

599
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,300
<font size="20">are naturally sewn by the ladies.</font>

600
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,460
<font size="20">When will it be our turn to do that?</font>

601
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,060
<font size="20">The work we do</font>

602
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,900
<font size="20">is mostly for the male relatives.</font>

603
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,540
<font size="20">Yuzhu,</font>

604
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,420
<font size="20">Honglei,</font>

605
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,180
<font size="20">and Lianyou.</font>

606
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,460
<font size="20">You three, come with me.</font>

607
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,380
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

608
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,820
<font size="20">Where are the people?</font>

609
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,060
<font size="20">Don't you all have eyes?</font>

610
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,140
<font size="20">Come and help quickly.</font>

611
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,100
<font size="20">Madam,</font>

612
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,260
<font size="20">what nice things</font>

613
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,300
<font size="20">have you gotten again?</font>

614
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:56,940
<font size="20">So much of it!</font>

615
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,340
<font size="20">It smells so good!</font>

616
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,780
<font size="20">Those masters</font>

617
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,620
<font size="20">are about to set off.</font>

618
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,420
<font size="20">Whether they can return is not certain.</font>

619
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,700
<font size="20">We can't let them</font>

620
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,860
<font size="20">go on the road on an empty stomach.</font>

621
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,460
<font size="20">I went into town</font>

622
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,020
<font size="20">and bought Zhang's roasted mutton,</font>

623
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,300
<font size="20">Sheng's roast chicken,</font>

624
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,900
<font size="20">and a few jars of Tusu wine.</font>

625
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,540
<font size="20">Mother,</font>

626
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,420
<font size="20">where did you
get the money to buy all this?</font>

627
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,140
<font size="20">I sold Yuzhu</font>

628
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,820
<font size="20">and your</font>

629
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,340
<font size="20">two maids.</font>

630
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,180
<font size="20">What?</font>

631
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
<font size="20">Lianyou and Honglei</font>

632
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,980
<font size="20">have been with me for so long.</font>

633
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,580
<font size="20">What gives you the right to sell them</font>

634
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,380
<font size="20">without my consent?</font>

635
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,500
<font size="20">Why are you all</font>

636
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,340
<font size="20">staring at me like this?</font>

637
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,340
<font size="20">These maids</font>

638
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,380
<font size="20">were originally bought by me</font>

639
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,340
<font size="20">and I hold their servitude contracts.</font>

640
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,540
<font size="20">Now that we are driven to a dead end,</font>

641
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,300
<font size="20">what's wrong with</font>

642
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,140
<font size="20">selling them?</font>

643
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,580
<font size="20">After much thought,
I've come to an understanding.</font>

644
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,660
<font size="20">Rather than suffering together,</font>

645
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,540
<font size="20">with some stealing</font>

646
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,740
<font size="20">and some running away,</font>

647
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,860
<font size="20">it's better to
hand them over to a broker.</font>

648
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,900
<font size="20">The money earned by</font>

649
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,140
<font size="20">selling a maid</font>

650
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,620
<font size="20">can support an entire household</font>

651
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,340
<font size="20">for half a month.</font>

652
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,100
<font size="20">What are you all gathered here for?</font>

653
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,220
<font size="20">Move it inside!</font>

654
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:09,740
<font size="20">Fudong,</font>

655
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,660
<font size="20">you belong to me,</font>

656
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,620
<font size="20">not to Madam Xia.</font>

657
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,220
<font size="20">Don't be afraid.</font>

658
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,780
<font size="20">But my servitude contract</font>

659
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,980
<font size="20">is still with Madam Xia.</font>

660
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,420
<font size="20">My Lady,</font>

661
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,060
<font size="20">I've been sold through several hands.</font>

662
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,820
<font size="20">Luckily, I met a fine lady like Madam,</font>

663
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,940
<font size="20">a Buddha-like mistress.</font>

664
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,140
<font size="20">And that's how
I've survived up till now.</font>

665
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,420
<font size="20">If I were to be sold again,</font>

666
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,380
<font size="20">I would surely not survive.</font>

667
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,020
<font size="20">Come.</font>

668
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:42,860
<font size="20">Let me do it.</font>

669
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,420
<font size="20">Shaoyao,</font>

670
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,260
<font size="20">are you happy today?</font>

671
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,660
<font size="20">I've talked to father about it;</font>

672
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,100
<font size="20">there will never be</font>

673
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:10,900
<font size="20">a physician here.</font>

674
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,740
<font size="20">Even they won't come anymore?</font>

675
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,220
<font size="20">Even them?</font>

676
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,700
<font size="20">If the physicians come,</font>

677
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,260
<font size="20">I can at least argue with them.</font>

678
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,100
<font size="20">If they don't come,</font>

679
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,020
<font size="20">who can I talk to?</font>

680
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,060
<font size="20">I...</font>

681
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,740
<font size="20">The cat can't talk.</font>

682
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,940
<font size="20">Yes, indeed.</font>

683
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,260
<font size="20">Isn't it?</font>

684
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,140
<font size="20">Aunt Xiao is so busy,</font>

685
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,100
<font size="20">she probably doesn't
have time to accompany you.</font>

686
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,140
<font size="20">What about those maids then?</font>

687
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,580
<font size="20">Are there anyone you like?</font>

688
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,900
<font size="20">Then, after I'm done with my work,</font>

689
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,140
<font size="20">I'll come to keep you company every day.</font>

690
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,300
<font size="20">Okay?</font>

691
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,180
<font size="20">How much time can I accompany her daily?</font>

692
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:04,900
<font size="20">Mercy, please!</font>

693
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,220
<font size="20">Spare my life!</font>

694
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,860
<font size="20">Don't be afraid.</font>

695
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,500
<font size="20">I'll go have a look.</font>

696
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,100
<font size="20">Greetings to Your Excellency.</font>

697
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,220
<font size="20">What's the matter?</font>

698
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,380
<font size="20">These maids have been
disrespectful to the former princess.</font>

699
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,100
<font size="20">I've been ordered
to rectify the household.</font>

700
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,180
<font size="20">In what way disrespectful?</font>

701
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,780
<font size="20">And whose orders are you following?</font>

702
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,100
<font size="20">These gossips and discussions,</font>

703
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,820
<font size="20">I wouldn't dare repeat them.</font>

704
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,100
<font size="20">It's the Princess Xiao
who really couldn't stand it anymore,</font>

705
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,980
<font size="20">and thus she had me deal with it.</font>

706
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:45,860
<font size="20">You can go now.</font>

707
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,180
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

708
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,100
<font size="20">Blood...</font>

709
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,500
<font size="20">Boss,</font>

710
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,180
<font size="20">that's Prince Ling's Mansion.</font>

711
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,580
<font size="20">You can come and go as you please.</font>

712
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,500
<font size="20">But if we get caught, then...</font>

713
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,980
<font size="20">Then just don't get caught.</font>

714
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:51,740
<font size="20">You go tonight.</font>

715
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,860
<font size="20">Do as I say.</font>

716
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,820
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

717
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,220
<font size="20">[Hua Boyu]</font>

718
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,780
<font size="20">Boyu is growing up so fast.</font>

719
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,540
<font size="20">I don't know
how long the clothes will fit.</font>

720
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,460
<font size="20">Jin'e,</font>

721
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,900
<font size="20">I still have some
cotton padding left here.</font>

722
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,180
<font size="20">Let's add it to Boyu's clothing.</font>

723
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,980
<font size="20">The child can't catch cold.</font>

724
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,700
<font size="20">Take it.</font>

725
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,540
<font size="20">Where...</font>

726
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,580
<font size="20">Where did this orange come from?</font>

727
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,460
<font size="20">I went to town to shop yesterday.</font>

728
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,580
<font size="20">I saw a vendor selling oranges.</font>

729
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,580
<font size="20">I originally wanted to
buy a few to take home.</font>

730
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,740
<font size="20">But I was reluctant to spend the money.</font>

731
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,460
<font size="20">I felt upset inside.</font>

732
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,980
<font size="20">So I followed that vendor</font>

733
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,420
<font size="20">and walked a long way.</font>

734
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,460
<font size="20">Guess what?</font>

735
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
<font size="20">From his load,</font>

736
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,340
<font size="20">an orange fell out.</font>

737
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,620
<font size="20">I quickly picked it up.</font>

738
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,460
<font size="20">Back in the mansion,</font>

739
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,620
<font size="20">who would fancy oranges?</font>

740
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,220
<font size="20">Let's not talk about this.</font>

741
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,700
<font size="20">Just eat it.</font>

742
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,340
<font size="20">No, no.</font>

743
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,020
<font size="20">Why would I eat it?</font>

744
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,540
<font size="20">You foolish girl,</font>

745
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,980
<font size="20">you think I don't know?</font>

746
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,860
<font size="20">You are always with Zhi</font>

747
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,700
<font size="20">sneaking around</font>

748
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,460
<font size="20">and vomiting behind people's backs.</font>

749
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,220
<font size="20">I'm experienced in that.</font>

750
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,060
<font size="20">This is just</font>

751
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,340
<font size="20">a matter of getting
familiar with repetitions.</font>

752
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,300
<font size="20">Quickly eat it.</font>

753
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,540
<font size="20">Jin'e,</font>

754
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,620
<font size="20">I really don't want it.</font>

755
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,580
<font size="20">Fudong made me</font>

756
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
<font size="20">quite a few fried red fruits.</font>

757
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,260
<font size="20">They are enough to eat.</font>

758
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,220
<font size="20">Duo is the youngest.</font>

759
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,180
<font size="20">Let Duo have it.</font>

760
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,340
<font size="20">She's losing her baby teeth.</font>

761
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,260
<font size="20">She can't eat sour things.</font>

762
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,700
<font size="20">Jin'e,</font>

763
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,260
<font size="20">I truly won't eat it.</font>

764
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,460
<font size="20">Thank you, Jin'e.</font>

765
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,820
<font size="20">Not until you recite
a passage from Mencius tomorrow</font>

766
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,100
<font size="20">can you eat one.</font>

767
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,380
<font size="20">They were brought out</font>

768
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,020
<font size="20">of the mansion with difficulty.</font>

769
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,660
<font size="20">After this,</font>

770
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,540
<font size="20">I don't know if there will be any more.</font>

771
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,060
<font size="20">Come in.</font>

772
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,900
<font size="20">Huilan,</font>

773
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,700
<font size="20">give it to Boli.</font>

774
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,260
<font size="20">He is pressured to study all day.</font>

775
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,180
<font size="20">Such a poor thing.</font>

776
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,460
<font size="20">Yingzhen,</font>

777
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,100
<font size="20">your Bolin is older than Boli.</font>

778
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,020
<font size="20">So I have to give it to Boli.</font>

779
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,060
<font size="20">It's alright.</font>

780
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,740
<font size="20">He's a young fellow.</font>

781
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,780
<font size="20">Even if he studies diligently all night,</font>

782
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,700
<font size="20">it's just as it should be.</font>

783
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,460
<font size="20">No need.</font>

784
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,300
<font size="20">Take it.</font>

785
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,620
<font size="20">Yingzhen,</font>

786
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,980
<font size="20">how did you still keep some money?</font>

787
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,420
<font size="20">It's no big deal
for us to suffer a little.</font>

788
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,580
<font size="20">Even if we have to beg, we'll survive.</font>

789
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,180
<font size="20">This</font>

790
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,220
<font size="20">silver I saved up painstakingly</font>

791
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,300
<font size="20">must be used first for the men.</font>

792
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,980
<font size="20">They say a poor family
must make for a rich journey.</font>

793
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,860
<font size="20">With high mountains and long roads,</font>

794
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,380
<font size="20">they at least</font>

795
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,660
<font size="20">should have some money by their side.</font>

796
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,260
<font size="20">So,</font>

797
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,020
<font size="20">I was thinking</font>

798
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,060
<font size="20">to sew this silver</font>

799
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,060
<font size="20">inside their clothes</font>

800
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,900
<font size="20">and send it to them.</font>

801
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,180
<font size="20">You have some, too?</font>

802
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,340
<font size="20">The other day,</font>

803
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,860
<font size="20">Zhi gave them to me.</font>

804
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,300
<font size="20">That's all we two,</font>

805
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,500
<font size="20">mother and child, have.</font>

806
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,420
<font size="20">Then,</font>

807
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,220
<font size="20">should we</font>

808
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,740
<font size="20">let them know?</font>

809
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,980
<font size="20">Absolutely not.</font>

810
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,420
<font size="20">Madam Hua</font>

811
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,700
<font size="20">asked us to hand over money before,</font>

812
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,980
<font size="20">but we tightly clutched onto it.</font>

813
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:07,900
<font size="20">But now,</font>

814
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,100
<font size="20">if others find out,</font>

815
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,340
<font size="20">what should we say then?</font>

816
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,060
<font size="20">Huilan,</font>

817
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,380
<font size="20">I'll follow your advice.</font>

818
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,340
<font size="20">Your Highness,</font>

819
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,420
<font size="20">you really are a kind person.</font>

820
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,620
<font size="20">Every wrong has a perpetrator,
every debt has a debtor.</font>

821
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,380
<font size="20">You must absolutely</font>

822
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,140
<font size="20">never come to me.</font>

823
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,340
<font size="20">Absolutely...</font>

824
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,420
<font size="20">Is this the Hall of King Yama?</font>

825
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,340
<font size="20">Spare my life!</font>

826
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,220
<font size="20">Spare my life!</font>

827
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,340
<font size="20">Chen Qing,</font>

828
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,100
<font size="20">go outside and keep watch.</font>

829
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,100
<font size="20">Don't let anyone in.</font>

830
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,060
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

831
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,820
<font size="20">You, you are...</font>

832
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,340
<font size="20">You are the son of Prince?</font>

833
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,940
<font size="20">Since you recognize me,</font>

834
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,020
<font size="20">you must be someone from our mansion.</font>

835
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,100
<font size="20">What is your name?</font>

836
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,260
<font size="20">Your Highness, please spare my life.</font>

837
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,620
<font size="20">I, your servant, am surnamed Dong.</font>

838
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,460
<font size="20">I work in the mansion's kitchen.</font>

839
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,580
<font size="20">Why were you in my mother's courtyard,</font>

840
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,660
<font size="20">burning paper, lighting incense,</font>

841
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,620
<font size="20">and even spilling dog blood?</font>

842
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:52,980
<font size="20">I...</font>

843
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,140
<font size="20">I have wronged the princess...</font>

844
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,260
<font size="20">I has grown old,</font>

845
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,420
<font size="20">and next year,</font>

846
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,220
<font size="20">I will have to leave the mansion.</font>

847
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,460
<font size="20">But over these years,</font>

848
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,460
<font size="20">I have had nightmares every night,</font>

849
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,380
<font size="20">fearing the princess' wronged spirit</font>

850
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,180
<font size="20">might come to claim my life.</font>

851
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,220
<font size="20">Having no other choice,</font>

852
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,820
<font size="20">I resorted to such despicable acts.</font>

853
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,820
<font size="20">Explain it clearly.</font>

854
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,740
<font size="20">How have you wronged her?</font>

855
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,300
<font size="20">That day,</font>

856
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,940
<font size="20">it was the Lantern Festival,</font>

857
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,020
<font size="20">when the mansion was
filled with people everywhere;</font>

858
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,740
<font size="20">it was bustling until late at night;</font>

859
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,020
<font size="20">only the Princess' residence</font>

860
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,900
<font size="20">was quiet and deserted.</font>

861
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:31,900
<font size="20">I, I</font>

862
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,420
<font size="20">stole a few silver items.</font>

863
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,820
<font size="20">With nowhere to hide them,</font>

864
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,260
<font size="20">I came to the outside
of the princess' courtyard,</font>

865
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,780
<font size="20">intending to bury them there first</font>

866
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,020
<font size="20">and dig them up later</font>

867
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,900
<font size="20">to sell.</font>

868
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,420
<font size="20">But then I suddenly heard</font>

869
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,340
<font size="20">a loud noise from the courtyard.</font>

870
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,620
<font size="20">Just like...</font>

871
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,820
<font size="20">Just like a small
firecracker had gone off.</font>

872
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,220
<font size="20">Immediately after,</font>

873
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,140
<font size="20">flames erupted in the courtyard.</font>

874
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,020
<font size="20">I heard the princess crying for help.</font>

875
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,820
<font size="20">When the fire had just started,</font>

876
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,300
<font size="20">no one was aware.</font>

877
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,420
<font size="20">I originally wanted to
run to the courtyard entrance</font>

878
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,500
<font size="20">to see what was happening.</font>

879
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,860
<font size="20">Put out the fire!</font>

880
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,700
<font size="20">But I saw</font>

881
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,020
<font size="20">quite a few people coming over.</font>

882
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,740
<font size="20">I was scared to death then,</font>

883
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,260
<font size="20">I could only run away.</font>

884
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,540
<font size="20">Later, I heard that</font>

885
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,460
<font size="20">the princess couldn't escape alive.</font>

886
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,060
<font size="20">I kept thinking afterward,</font>

887
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,340
<font size="20">if I hadn't run away at that time,</font>

888
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,340
<font size="20">whether it would...</font>

889
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,860
<font size="20">Later, there was a heavy rain,</font>

890
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,220
<font size="20">and only then was the fire put out.</font>

891
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,820
<font size="20">The princess' residence</font>

892
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,940
<font size="20">was burnt to a pitch black.</font>

893
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,460
<font size="20">I feel guilty in my heart.</font>

894
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:36,940
<font size="20">After some days had passed,</font>

895
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,940
<font size="20">I went to pay respects
with incense and candles.</font>

896
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,900
<font size="20">However, I saw</font>

897
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,380
<font size="20">a layer of white frost</font>

898
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,420
<font size="20">on those pitch-black tiles.</font>

899
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,820
<font size="20">That must be
the princess' restless spirit.</font>

900
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,620
<font size="20">She...she has shown her spirit.</font>

901
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,140
<font size="20">I will let you go today.</font>

902
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,940
<font size="20">But there's one thing.</font>

903
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,300
<font size="20">Think carefully about the past event.</font>

904
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,020
<font size="20">If you remember anything,</font>

905
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,020
<font size="20">pull this signal banner,</font>

906
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,820
<font size="20">and someone will bring you to see me.</font>

907
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,220
<font size="20">If the clue is useful,</font>

908
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,140
<font size="20">I will reward you handsomely.</font>

909
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:07,820
<font size="20">Thank you very much!</font>

910
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,820
<font size="20">Thank you very much!</font>

911
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,300
<font size="20">I'll keep it on my mind.</font>

912
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,580
<font size="20">Guards,</font>

913
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,420
<font size="20">take him out.</font>

914
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,860
<font size="20">The first bow.</font>

915
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,860
<font size="20">The second bow.</font>

916
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,460
<font size="20">The third bow.</font>

917
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,190
<font size="20">[In memory of the late
and venerable Mrs. Zhou]</font>

918
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,100
<font size="20">The family expresses gratitude.</font>

919
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,260
<font size="20">Wipe it off.</font>

920
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,860
<font size="20">Your snot has dripped onto your clothes.</font>

921
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,020
<font size="20">Here you go.</font>

922
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,620
<font size="20">I came with Censor Hua.</font>

923
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,500
<font size="20">I just now at the memorial hall</font>

924
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,460
<font size="20">watched for a long time.</font>

925
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,580
<font size="20">All those officials
were pretending to cry,</font>

926
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,900
<font size="20">only you were truly shedding tears.</font>

927
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,580
<font size="20">I really can't understand that</font>

928
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,780
<font size="20">the princess is such a good person,</font>

929
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,980
<font size="20">but except for you, a child,</font>

930
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,700
<font size="20">there's actually no one</font>

931
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,180
<font size="20">willing to shed tears for her.</font>

932
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,500
<font size="20">You...</font>

933
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:12,820
<font size="20">recognize her?</font>

934
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,300
<font size="20">That night,</font>

935
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,860
<font size="20">I got lost in the garden</font>

936
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:16,940
<font size="20">and blundered in here.</font>

937
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,780
<font size="20">The princess not only did not blame me</font>

938
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100
<font size="20">but also sent an old nanny</font>

939
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,980
<font size="20">to escort me out.</font>

940
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,020
<font size="20">My mother has always lived alone</font>

941
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,660
<font size="20">with no nanny by her side.</font>

942
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,900
<font size="20">You are mistaken.</font>

943
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,460
<font size="20">Is she your mother?</font>

944
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,980
<font size="20">That child could come to
Prince Ling's Mansion with Hua Yizheng.</font>

945
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,860
<font size="20">Either she's really a child servant,</font>

946
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,700
<font size="20">or a young relative of the Hua family.</font>

947
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,300
<font size="20">She should be about
eighteen or nineteen years old now.</font>

948
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,660
<font size="20">She had seen that so-called nanny.</font>

949
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,740
<font size="20">Boss,</font>

950
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,300
<font size="20">I have sent him away.</font>

951
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,820
<font size="20">These days, I will have Monkey</font>

952
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,460
<font size="20">keep a close watch on him.</font>

953
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,540
<font size="20">The Hua family's men are exiled today.</font>

954
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,300
<font size="20">When do they set off?</font>

955
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,100
<font size="20">At Mao hour.</font>

956
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:07,860
<font size="20">Yingzhen,</font>

957
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,620
<font size="20">I asked Bolin for a pair of shoes.</font>

958
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,060
<font size="20">you must bring them to Boyu.</font>

959
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,260
<font size="20">The child's feet are tender;</font>

960
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,460
<font size="20">walking such a long distance,</font>

961
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,740
<font size="20">he surely can't endure.</font>

962
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,100
<font size="20">Thanks a lot.</font>

963
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,700
<font size="20">Good, handle it carefully.</font>

964
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,500
<font size="20">Yes, Madam.</font>

965
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,580
<font size="20">Once Mr. Shen's carriage arrives,</font>

966
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,660
<font size="20">Huilan, Jin'e,</font>

967
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,940
<font size="20">You two accompany me.</font>

968
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:24,940
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

969
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,620
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

970
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,260
<font size="20">You troublemaker!</font>

971
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,100
<font size="20">Before, I used to turn a blind eye</font>

972
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,460
<font size="20">and overlooked things as they were.</font>

973
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,100
<font size="20">But today,</font>

974
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,020
<font size="20">you dare to openly go to</font>

975
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,060
<font size="20">bid farewell to Hua Yizheng.</font>

976
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,580
<font size="20">Do you insist on
dragging down your grandpa</font>

977
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,420
<font size="20">and father until they die
before you're satisfied?</font>

978
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,800
<font size="20">♪Not a patch of land is wasted♪</font>

979
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,380
<font size="20">♪A tea plant never grows old♪</font>

980
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:36,250
<font size="20">♪The sky drops rain, birds eat worms, chickens leave manure♪</font>

981
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:43,680
<font size="20">♪Effort and sweat to water and nourish♪</font>

982
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,380
<font size="20">♪The tea leaves may be rustic♪</font>

983
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,000
<font size="20">♪But the taste is of spring♪</font>

984
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,400
<font size="20">♪Ah, joy in the clear spring,
pick a little♪</font>

985
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,880
<font size="20">♪Ah, enjoy the abundant spring together♪</font>

986
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,590
<font size="20">♪Not a patch of land is wasted♪</font>

987
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,170
<font size="20">♪A tea plant never grows old♪</font>

988
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:50,040
<font size="20">♪The sky drops rain, birds eat worms, chickens leave manure♪</font>

989
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:57,600
<font size="20">♪Effort and sweat to water and nourish♪</font>

990
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,210
<font size="20">♪The tea leaves may be rustic♪</font>

991
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:04,890
<font size="20">♪But the taste is of spring♪</font>

992
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:12,280
<font size="20">♪Ah, joy in the clear spring,
pick a little♪</font>

993
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:19,640
<font size="20">♪Ah, enjoy the abundant spring together♪</font>

994
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:26,810
<font size="20">♪Ah, joy in the clear spring,
pick a little♪</font>

995
