<font size="20">our relatives and acquaintances</font>

122
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,320
<font size="20">will surely avoid us.</font>

123

<font size="20">don't contact your parents.</font>

131
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,530
<font size="20">That would implicate them.</font>

132

137
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,970
<font size="20">You are a strong-willed woman,</font>

138
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,730
<font size="20">it took a lot for you
to manage the family,</font>

<font size="20">I can handle it.</font>

143
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,010
<font size="20">I will do whatever it takes</font>

144
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,200
<font size="20">to save my husband and the sons,</font>

145
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,120
<font size="20">even if it means spending our last dime.</font>

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,160
<font size="20">If they cannot make it,</font>

147

<font size="20">Madam Hua,</font>

148
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,240
<font size="20">don't worry.</font>

149
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,290
<font size="20">I will take care of the others</font>

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,210
<font size="20">in this family</font>

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,240
<font size="20">as long as you want me to.</font>

152
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,650
<font size="20">I'm always be by your side.</font>

153
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,210
<font size="20">In the past days,</font>

154
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:13,480
<font size="20">what you managed
were the household affairs.</font>

155
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,680
<font size="20">That was because the men in our family</font>

156
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,210
<font size="20">were working hard in the outside world.</font>

157
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,240
<font size="20">But now they're in the prison.</font>

158
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,040
<font size="20">For example,</font>

159
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,650
<font size="20">anyone can get straight inside</font>

160
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,680
<font size="20">and rob us</font>

161
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,290
<font size="20">because we are a bunch of women.</font>

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,890
<font size="20">A family won't thrive long</font>

163
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,000
<font size="20">without men.</font>

164
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,480
<font size="20">We must find a way</font>

165
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,890
<font size="20">to put the feelers out</font>

166
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,480
<font size="20">and see</font>

167
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,160
<font size="20">if the Emperor changes his mind.</font>

168
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,680
<font size="20">If he won't change his mind,</font>

169
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,730
<font size="20">we must, as soon as possible,</font>

170
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,480
<font size="20">find a reliable man for our family.</font>

171
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:47,800
<font size="20">I don't care it's a butler</font>

172
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,120
<font size="20">or a kept man,</font>

173
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,040
<font size="20">whoever can take charge of the family
for us</font>

174
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,890
<font size="20">will do.</font>

175
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,210
<font size="20">Father,</font>

176
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,160
<font size="20">I wanna...</font>

177
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,730
<font size="20">Eat your meal.</font>

178
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,450
<font size="20">Do not talk while you're eating.</font>

179
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,730
<font size="20">Why hasn't Huan come back?</font>

180
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,890
<font size="20">Have you seen your brother?</font>

181
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,730
<font size="20">Maybe now</font>

182
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,650
<font size="20">he is at some brothel enjoying himself.</font>

183
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
<font size="20">He's spoiled</font>

184
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:16,890
<font size="20">because of you.</font>

185
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,000
<font size="20">Father, calm down.</font>

186
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,850
<font size="20">I will deal with that little brat</font>

187
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,650
<font size="20">when he comes back.</font>

188
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:34,330
<font size="20">Sorry I'm home late</font>

189
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,560
<font size="20">and wasn't able to
have a meal with Grandpa.</font>

190
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,290
<font size="20">Please forgive me.</font>

191
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,290
<font size="20">[The second son of the Shen family,
Mister Shen Huan]</font>

192
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,240
<font size="20">Get over here and eat with us</font>

193
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,330
<font size="20">if you wanna make that up.</font>

194
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
<font size="20">Why were you still outside so late?</font>

195
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,160
<font size="20">Come on in.</font>

196
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,530
<font size="20">Mother.</font>

197
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
<font size="20">Where have you been?</font>

198
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,480
<font size="20">Slow down a little.</font>

199
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,450
<font size="20">Grandpa.</font>

200
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,210
<font size="20">I'm exhausted today.</font>

201
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,040
<font size="20">I watched puppet shows all day.</font>

202
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,680
<font size="20">I thought the puppet</font>

203
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,730
<font size="20">was pretty funny,</font>

204
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,360
<font size="20">so I bought one</font>

205
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,450
<font size="20">from the puppeteer.</font>

206
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,090
<font size="20">Give me a couple of days
and I'll be able to perform as well.</font>

207
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,890
<font size="20">How much did it cost?</font>

208
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,040
<font size="20">Two hundred of qian.</font>

209
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,770
<font size="20">Two thousand?</font>

210
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,800
<font size="20">You were the one who said</font>

211
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,120
<font size="20">'do not talk while you're eating'.</font>

212
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,480
<font size="20">He has bought that anyway,</font>

213
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,450
<font size="20">just let him</font>

214
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,560
<font size="20">finish the meal first, okay?</font>

215
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,680
<font size="20">Go ahead.</font>

216
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,450
<font size="20">Go ahead.</font>

217
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,650
<font size="20">Go ahead.</font>

218
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,560
<font size="20">Thank you, dad.</font>

219
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,850
<font size="20">Qi,</font>

220
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,920
<font size="20">how is your study recently?</font>

221
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,160
<font size="20">The coming year</font>

222
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,240
<font size="20">will be your imperial examination.</font>

223
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,850
<font size="20">I know, I'm doing my best here.</font>

224
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,290
<font size="20">Good.</font>

225
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,650
<font size="20">I'm doing my best here.</font>

226
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:24,800
<font size="20">Father.</font>

227
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,240
<font size="20">What's the matter?</font>

228
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,330
<font size="20">I need money for an emergency.</font>

229
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,970
<font size="20">I wonder if I can ask the accountant</font>

230
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,560
<font size="20">to advance on some money first.</font>

231
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,290
<font size="20">You're not like Huan</font>

232
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,680
<font size="20">spending all day idly outside.</font>

233
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,240
<font size="20">You are always at home,</font>

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,090
<font size="20">why would you need money?</font>

235
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,680
<font size="20">If you need to
buy some stationery and books,</font>

236
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,560
<font size="20">just tell your mother,</font>

237
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,000
<font size="20">she can have someone buy them for you.</font>

238
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,360
<font size="20">Your studies come first now.</font>

239
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,770
<font size="20">Do you hear me?</font>

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,530
<font size="20">Brother,</font>

241
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,120
<font size="20">my dear big brother,</font>

242
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,890
<font size="20">my best big brother.</font>

243
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,210
<font size="20">What?</font>

244
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,730
<font size="20">Are you short of money?</font>

245
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
<font size="20">How about I lend you some?</font>

246
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,450
<font size="20">Do you know how much money</font>

247
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,640
<font size="20">our mother gives me a month?</font>

248
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,760
<font size="20">Do you know that?</font>

249
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,810
<font size="20">Do you know that?</font>

250
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,880
<font size="20">Do you know that?</font>

251
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,120
<font size="20">Do you kno...</font>

252
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,930
<font size="20">Hear me out.</font>

253
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,930
<font size="20">Yesterday I heard
that our mentor was in trouble.</font>

254
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,480
<font size="20">so I went to our colleagues.</font>

255
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,280
<font size="20">We raised some mone together,</font>

256
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,120
<font size="20">and had a discussion.</font>

257
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,520
<font size="20">If we can't get our mentor out of prison
with that money,</font>

258
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,210
<font size="20">we'll send it to those women
of the Hua family,</font>

259
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,520
<font size="20">and it's the least we can do.</font>

260
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,640
<font size="20">Madam Hua is old,</font>

261
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,520
<font size="20">and now just women and children
are left in the house.</font>

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,810
<font size="20">How can they make a living?</font>

263
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,880
<font size="20">Chen,</font>

264
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
<font size="20">we are both commoners,</font>

265
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,930
<font size="20">although I want to help,</font>

266
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,400
<font size="20">I don't have that much money.</font>

267
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,600
<font size="20">It's all right,</font>

268
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,050
<font size="20">I still have some here,</font>

269
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
<font size="20">that can support them for a while.</font>

270
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,170
<font size="20">If it's money we're talking here,</font>

271
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,450
<font size="20">we can't help much.</font>

272
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,570
<font size="20">I'm afraid the main concern
of those women</font>

273
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,850
<font size="20">are not about money.</font>

274
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,450
<font size="20">Our mentor was always good to me,</font>

275
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,810
<font size="20">and now his family is in need of help,</font>

276
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,570
<font size="20">we have to do something.</font>

277
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,170
<font size="20">How about this...</font>

278
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,730
<font size="20">You go prepare some clothes,</font>

279
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,480
<font size="20">and food.</font>

280
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,330
<font size="20">I'll figure out a way</font>

281
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,690
<font size="20">to mortgage the house.</font>

282
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:16,850
<font size="20">It's the south,</font>

283
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,090
<font size="20">but it is still cold at night
out in the wild.</font>

284
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,090
<font size="20">There isn't even a bed here,</font>

285
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,570
<font size="20">but the straw is all clean,</font>

286
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,520
<font size="20">we can sleep on it.</font>

287
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,280
<font size="20">How?
There're so many people</font>

288
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,120
<font size="20">in the house.</font>

289
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,640
<font size="20">Do we need to sleep</font>

290
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,570
<font size="20">with the servants together?</font>

291
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,480
<font size="20">It's warmer</font>

292
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,450
<font size="20">that way.</font>

293
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,640
<font size="20">Keep your voices down,</font>

294
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,970
<font size="20">Madam Hua is already sleeping</font>

295
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,760
<font size="20">in her bedroom.</font>

296
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,170
<font size="20">Just bear with it for a few more days,</font>

297
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,240
<font size="20">once the furniture and bedding come,
it'll be fine,</font>

298
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,280
<font size="20">it will also be easier for the maids
to attend to us.</font>

299
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,050
<font size="20">Can we add more charcoal fire then,</font>

300
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,330
<font size="20">for such a big house, it's just too...</font>

301
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,400
<font size="20">Mom,</font>

302
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,450
<font size="20">I moved the charcoal</font>

303
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,970
<font size="20">out from the kitchen,</font>

304
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
<font size="20">we need to be frugal now.</font>

305
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,880
<font size="20">Maids,</font>

306
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
<font size="20">go to these two corners,</font>

307
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,330
<font size="20">sleep there,</font>

308
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,810
<font size="20">and don't make a sound.</font>

309
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,930
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

310
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,760
<font size="20">Close your eyes.</font>

311
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,280
<font size="20">I'm not sleeping,</font>

312

<font size="20">he will also do the same to you</font>

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,450
<font size="20">for some words</font>

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:07,520
<font size="20">The one with the osmanthus fragrance.</font>

469
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,520
<font size="20">I need to buy a bottle of that.</font>

470
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,760
<font size="20">Madam Zia,</font>

471
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:11,360
<font size="20">I want to eat plum blossom pancakes,</font>

472
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,880
<font size="20">and buttered snails.</font>

473
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,480
<font size="20">Let's buy more
while we still have money.</font>

474
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:23,810
<font size="20">Bolin.</font>

475
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,760
<font size="20">You brought</font>

476
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,090
<font size="20">your cricket, huh?</font>

477
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,360
<font size="20">I want to buy Daddy.</font>

478
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:44,890
<font size="20">Fine.</font>

479
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,760
<font size="20">Write them all down,</font>

480
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,280
<font size="20">go to the downtown at dawn tomorrow.</font>

481
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,410
<font size="20">Bring home everything we need,</font>

482
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,080
<font size="20">okay?</font>

483
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,480
<font size="20">Mr. Zhong, how did you come back?</font>

484
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,450
<font size="20">The moment we went in the prison,</font>

485
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,560
<font size="20">they separated us</font>

486
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,760
<font size="20">from our lords.</font>

487
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,130
<font size="20">Those guards</font>

488
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,480
<font size="20">verified our identities,</font>

489
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,040
<font size="20">and after that,</font>

490
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,520
<font size="20">they kept the stewards</font>

491
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,210
<font size="20">and the accountants behind</font>

492
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,650
<font size="20">and released</font>

493
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,840
<font size="20">the rest of the servants.</font>

494
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,000
<font size="20">I was gonna</font>

495
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,170
<font size="20">stay by the Lord,</font>

496
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,000
<font size="20">but who knew?</font>

497
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,240
<font size="20">They drove me out.</font>

498
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,800
<font size="20">Then how did you find your way here?</font>

499
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,000
<font size="20">I asked around,</font>

500
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,170
<font size="20">they told me</font>

501
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,210
<font size="20">that you were out of town</font>

502
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,450
<font size="20">and went to this directon.</font>

503
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,000
<font size="20">So I guess</font>

504
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
<font size="20">this is the right place.</font>

505
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,370
<font size="20">Actually, I've been here</font>

506
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,520
<font size="20">a few time before</font>

507
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,170
<font size="20">to escort Madam Hua.</font>

508
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:28,970
<font size="20">Tell me,</font>

509
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,560
<font size="20">Mr. Zhong,</font>

510
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,410
<font size="20">why you're the only one</font>

511
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,040
<font size="20">coming back?</font>

512
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,800
<font size="20">What about the servants and the guards?</font>

513
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:34,800
<font size="20">And Li Gui?</font>

514
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,930
<font size="20">I couldn't stop them,</font>

515
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,320
<font size="20">they all ran away.</font>

516
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,480
<font size="20">All of them?</font>

517
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,930
<font size="20">I've never shorted them
on their monthly pay,</font>

518
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,520
<font size="20">but they were just ungrateful.</font>

519
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,800
<font size="20">We are still hang in there.</font>

520
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,000
<font size="20">Forget it.</font>

521
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,450
<font size="20">Those servants</font>

522
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,650
<font size="20">are all big and burly,</font>

523
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,410
<font size="20">I will be worried for your safety</font>

524
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,890
<font size="20">if they're really here.</font>

525
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,760
<font size="20">Alright, Mr. Zhong,</font>

526
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,610
<font size="20">go inside and have some rest.</font>

527
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,610
<font size="20">Zhi,</font>

528
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,240
<font size="20">Mr. Zhong is a manservant after all.</font>

529
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,480
<font size="20">Does he have to share our room?</font>

530
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,610
<font size="20">Right.</font>

531
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,970
<font size="20">It's inappropriate.</font>

532
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,000
<font size="20">Go back inside.</font>

533
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,890
<font size="20">Mr. Zhong,</font>

534
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,480
<font size="20">you can share the house with us.</font>

535
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,890
<font size="20">Hua Zhi.</font>

536
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,930
<font size="20">Madam Qi was right,</font>

537
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,370
<font size="20">I can't</font>

538
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,760
<font size="20">share the room with you.</font>

539
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:24,800
<font size="20">It's okay.</font>

540
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,730
<font size="20">It's not too cold recently</font>

541
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,560
<font size="20">in the Imperial Capital,</font>

542
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,800
<font size="20">it might be cold at night,</font>

543
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:31,840
<font size="20">but</font>

544
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,130
<font size="20">I can get by.</font>

545
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,130
<font size="20">Let me tell you,</font>

546
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,210
<font size="20">before your father was born,</font>

<font size="20">ran all aorund the country.</font>

549
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,130
<font size="20">We even slept</font>

550
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,280
<font size="20">in the snow cave.</font>

551
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,480
<font size="20">Alright.</font>

552
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,410
<font size="20">Go back now.</font>

553
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,210
<font size="20">Don't catch a cold.</font>

554
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,520
<font size="20">They are</font>

555
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,240
<font size="20">spies from the Seven-Star Bureau,</font>

556
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,080
<font size="20">followed me all the way here.</font>

557
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:57,560
<font size="20">I guess</font>

558
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,370
<font size="20">they won't leave for a while.</font>

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,130
<font size="20">I had someone</font>

564
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,450
<font size="20">clean up your room right away</font>

565
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,240
<font size="20">once I knew you came back.</font>

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,890
<font size="20">It was a bit hurry though.</font>

567
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,800
<font size="20">Settle down first</font>

568
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,930
<font size="20">and tell me</font>

569
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,410

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:03,800
<font size="20">Where are you going?</font>

580
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,320
<font size="20">To that bitter and cold place?</font>

<font size="20">To the Palace.</font>

582
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,130

<font size="20">visit us more often</font>

584
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,370
<font size="20">when you have time then.</font>

585
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,520
<font size="20">I have made some stewed mutton for you.</font>

586
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,890
<font size="20">It's already in your room.</font>

587

<font size="20">How is Shaoyao?</font>

589
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,520
<font size="20">She's doing fine.</font>

590
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,890
<font size="20">Grown up to be a young lady.</font>

591
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,520
<font size="20">You might not recognize her.</font>

592
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,760
<font size="20">I'll go see her.</font>

593
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,210
<font size="20">All right.</font>

594
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,840
<font size="20">I'll take you there.</font>

595
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:40,970
<font size="20">Your Highness,</font>

596
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,730
<font size="20">Over the years, Prince</font>

597
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,370
<font size="20">has kept Shaoyao in the house.</font>

598
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,840
<font size="20">I have also told him that was not good.</font>

599
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,730
<font size="20">But having such a daughter</font>

600
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,130
<font size="20">who is mentally defective</font>

601
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,410
<font size="20">is indeed an ominous sign.</font>

602
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,650
<font size="20">If outsiders were to know,</font>

603
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,370
<font size="20">it would certainly cause an uproar.</font>

604
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,890
<font size="20">So we just claim</font>

605
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,690
<font size="20">that she is ill.</font>

606
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,760
<font size="20">She is mentally fragile,</font>

607
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,690
<font size="20">so she do need a quiet space.</font>

608
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:13,970
<font size="20">Don't worry though,</font>

609
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,040
<font size="20">our servants</font>

610
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,240

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,800
<font size="20">Shaoyao was not born</font>

612
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,890
<font size="20">like this.</font>

613
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,080
<font size="20">How would I not know?</font>

614
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,650
<font size="20">In the years since you left,</font>

<font size="20">I am...</font>

626
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,930
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

627
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,410
<font size="20">He's your brother.</font>

628
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,610
<font size="20">Did I scare you?</font>

629
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,370
<font size="20">I'm sorry.</font>

630
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,410
<font size="20">You're not my brother.</font>

631
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,930
<font size="20">She likes studying these things.</font>

632
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,170
<font size="20">Over the years,</font>

633
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,210
<font size="20">she stays in the yard
to get medical treatments.</font>

634
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,280
<font size="20">Medicinal herbs are everywhere</font>

635
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,240
<font size="20">in here.</font>

636
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,370
<font size="20">She has to take medince</font>

637
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,760
<font size="20">every single day.</font>

638
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
<font size="20">Medical techniques are the only topic</font>

639
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,210
<font size="20">that those physicians would talk to her.</font>

640
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,840
<font size="20">As the days passed,</font>

641
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,610
<font size="20">she was learning herself.</font>

642
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:34,970
<font size="20">In the usual days,</font>

643
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,040
<font size="20">she would make medicinal ointments
and pills for fun.</font>

644
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,450
<font size="20">A few days ago,</font>

645
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,170
<font size="20">a kitten came into the yard.</font>

646
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,480
<font size="20">it was all covered in wounds.</font>

647
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,970
<font size="20">Shaoyao said she would treat the kitten.</font>

648
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,130
<font size="20">She went through medical books for days</font>

649
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,730
<font size="20">and she made so many ointments</font>

650
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,730
<font size="20">all in a sudden.</font>

651
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,450
<font size="20">Every day,</font>

652
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,520
<font size="20">she applied them to the little cat.</font>

653
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,450
<font size="20">Smearing and smearing.</font>

654
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,970
<font size="20">And somehow</font>

655
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,690
<font size="20">the kitten was healed.</font>

656
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:56,760
<font size="20">I had no idea</font>

657
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,730
<font size="20">where she got the prescription from.</font>

658
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,410
<font size="20">That book over there.</font>

659
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,270
<font size="20">[Treatise on the Origin
and Symptoms of Diseases]</font>

660
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,370
<font size="20">Let me help you put these medicines</font>

661
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,280
<font size="20">into the jars,</font>

662
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,690
<font size="20">okay?</font>

663
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,970
<font size="20">Go ahead.</font>

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,040
<font size="20">Aunt Xiao,</font>

665
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,890
<font size="20">I want to be with her for a while.</font>

666
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,170
<font size="20">Alright.</font>

667
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,590
<font size="20">Mom,</font>

668
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,460
<font size="20">I'm so cold.</font>

669
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:13,740
<font size="20">Put up a little</font>

670
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,390
<font size="20">It's nothing.</font>

671
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,870
<font size="20">That wretched girl.</font>

672
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,350
<font size="20">Doesn't she know how to shut a door?</font>

673
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,070
<font size="20">What was wrong with her?</font>

674
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,670

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,020
<font size="20">Wake up.</font>

677
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,630
<font size="20">Wake up.</font>

678
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,260
<font size="20">Everyone, wake up.</font>

679
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,150
<font size="20">Come on.</font>

680
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,020
<font size="20">Mr. Zhong.</font>

681
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,590

<font size="20">that you have returned,</font>

696
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,980
<font size="20">so I hurried back late at night.</font>

697
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,190
<font size="20">You were not in your room,</font>

698
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,460
<font size="20">so I figured</font>

699
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,500
<font size="20">you must have come here.</font>

700
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,740
<font size="20">The fire</font>

701
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,980
<font size="20">has already been ten years ago.</font>

702
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,190
<font size="20">Recently</font>

703
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,500
<font size="20">I often dream of your mother</font>

704
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,460
<font size="20">at night.</font>

705
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,190
<font size="20">Thank you.</font>

706
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,150
<font size="20">For still remembering her.</font>

707
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,260
<font size="20">How long can you stay this time?</font>

708
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,870
<font size="20">I'm not leaving.</font>

709
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,540
<font size="20">Great.</font>

710
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,260
<font size="20">What would you like to eat tomorrow?</font>

711
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,020
<font size="20">I'll tell the kitchen to prepare.</font>

712
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,070
<font size="20">I've got things to do tomorrow.</font>

713
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:16,390
<font size="20">Alright then.</font>

714
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,590
<font size="20">Rest early.</font>

715
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,700
<font size="20">Prince,</font>

716
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,300
<font size="20">Xi has been away from the capital
for many years.</font>

717
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,390
<font size="20">It's normal</font>

718
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,350
<font size="20">that he is a little estranged.</font>

719
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,870
<font size="20">He will get used to us again soon.</font>

720
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,070
<font size="20">He was never close to me</font>

721
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,980
<font size="20">even before he left the capital.</font>

722
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,940
<font size="20">The Emperor truly has his ways.</font>

723
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,220
<font size="20">It's fine that he's paranoid</font>

724
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,980
<font size="20">and thinks ill of us, his own brothers.</font>

725
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,260
<font size="20">But now he also wants to</font>

726
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,150
<font size="20">take Xi away from me.</font>

727
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,780
<font size="20">Keep him by his side every day.</font>

728
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,740
<font size="20">You know what?</font>

729
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,700
<font size="20">I don't blame Xi,</font>

730
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,910
<font size="20">he is a good kid.</font>

731
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,940
<font size="20">It's just that</font>

732
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,260
<font size="20">he was still young
when going into the palce,</font>

733
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,500
<font size="20">without the ability
to see through things.</font>

734
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,670
<font size="20">Xi,</font>

735
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,150
<font size="20">He has grown up now.</font>

736
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,460
<font size="20">and also has returned.</font>

737
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,300
<font size="20">He will understand one day.</font>

738
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
<font size="20">You sacrificed a lot</font>

739
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,670
<font size="20">all these years.</font>

740
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,350
<font size="20">Prince, how can you say such a thing?</font>

741
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,870
<font size="20">Consort Zhou died of disease</font>

742
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,190
<font size="20">and left two children behind.</font>

743
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:29,740
<font size="20">You became their stepmother</font>

744
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,630
<font size="20">when you were so young.</font>

745
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:32,870
<font size="20">Over these years,</font>

746
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,300
<font size="20">I am aware of all that</font>

747
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,590
<font size="20">gossip in the mansion.</font>

748
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,150
<font size="20">But I know in my heart</font>

749
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,430
<font size="20">that no one</font>

00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,430
<font size="20">treat those kids better than you.</font>

751
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,700
<font size="20">You have also taken</font>

752
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,190
<font size="20">the medicine to sterilize yourself,</font>

753
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,020
<font size="20">you won't have your own kids anymore.</font>

754
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,430
<font size="20">Do you really think it's worth it?</font>

755
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,390
<font size="20">A stepmother is no different
from a mother.</font>

756
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,430
<font size="20">I know</font>

757
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,940
<font size="20">all your sufferings and bitternesses.</font>

758
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,670
<font size="20">One more heir in our family,</font>

759
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,910
<font size="20">more suspicion from His Majesty.</font>

760
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,350
<font size="20">As long as you are safe and sound,</font>

761
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,300
<font size="20">and Xi can find time to visit us
from time to time,</font>

762
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,460
<font size="20">then I want nothing more.</font>

763
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,740
<font size="20">Thank god we didn't get injured.</font>

764
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,190
<font size="20">Right.</font>

765
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,670
<font size="20">Nothing else matters.</font>

<font size="20">Zhong,</font>

767
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,260
<font size="20">We owe you one.</font>

<font size="20">Madam Hua,</font>

769

<font size="20">you didn't sleep with us.</font>

776
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,780
<font size="20">How come</font>

777
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,780
<font size="20">none of you sensed that?</font>

778
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,460
<font size="20">While the charcoal is burning,</font>

779
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,630
<font size="20">you can't shut
all the doors and windows.</font>

780

<font size="20">If something comes up,</font>

781
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,910
<font size="20">we could suffocate inside.</font>

782
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,460
<font size="20">That's not right.</font>

783
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,980
<font size="20">We spent the first half of the night</font>

784
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,220
<font size="20">chatting here.</font>

785
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,260
<font size="20">I now remember!</font>

786
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,150
<font size="20">When we lay down,</font>

787
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,700
<font size="20">Zhi was still outside.</font>

788
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,420
<font size="20">If you knew it would be stifling,</font>

789
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,030
<font size="20">why closed the attic door</font>

790
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,220
<font size="20">so tightly?</font>

791
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,420
<font size="20">It wasn't me.</font>

792
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,190
<font size="20">After I fell asleep,</font>

793
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,380
<font size="20">someone else locked the door.</font>

794
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,030
<font size="20">It wasn't you?</font>

795
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,150
<font size="20">Everyone was asleep.</font>

796
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
<font size="20">Who shut that door?</font>

797
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,070
<font size="20">Zhi.</font>

798
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,630
<font size="20">It's okay to be careless,</font>

799
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:09,700
<font size="20">we won't blame you.</font>

800
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,550
<font size="20">Don't deny it.</font>

801
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,510
<font size="20">Be honest.</font>

802
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,150
<font size="20">Concubine Qin,</font>

803
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,470
<font size="20">perhaps it really wasn't Zhi.</font>

804
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,260
<font size="20">Then tell us,</font>

805
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,900
<font size="20">who was it?</font>

806
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,670
<font size="20">Concubine Qin did it.</font>

807
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,700
<font size="20">I saw it.</font>

808
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,630
<font size="20">That wretched girl.</font>

809
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,070
<font size="20">Doesn't she know how to shut a door?</font>

810
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,220
<font size="20">Boli.</font>

811
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,780
<font size="20">You were all dazed and all,</font>

812
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,030
<font size="20">you must have mistaken
someone else as me.</font>

813
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,420
<font size="20">It wasn't me.</font>

814
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,510
<font size="20">It wasn't me.</font>

815
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,860
<font size="20">It wasn't me.</font>

816
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,030
<font size="20">It wasn't me.</font>

817
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,700
<font size="20">I slept like a baby.</font>

818
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,420
<font size="20">It wasn't me.</font>

819
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,030
<font size="20">Madam Hua, I've been wronged</font>

820
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,070
<font size="20">Madam Hua.</font>

821
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,340
<font size="20">Madam Hua, it wasn't me.</font>

822
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,470
<font size="20">He's just a kid.</font>

823
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,950
<font size="20">Why would he accuse you</font>

824
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,820
<font size="20">of something you didn't do?</font>

825
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,260
<font size="20">If it weren't for these kids,</font>

826
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,030
<font size="20">I would have died after what happened.</font>

827
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,110
<font size="20">And now I'm still here</font>

828
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,900
<font size="20">and even wronged by you.</font>

829
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,030
<font size="20">You are just a lowlife,</font>

830
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,990
<font size="20">stop pretending.</font>

831
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,950
<font size="20">I really wish to sell you.</font>

832
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,740
<font size="20">Huilan,</font>

833
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,340
<font size="20">this</font>

834
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,780
<font size="20">should be up to me, right?</font>

835
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,070
<font size="20">Do you mean</font>

836
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,300
<font size="20">Boli is lying?</font>

837
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,420
<font size="20">I don't know</font>

838
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,300
<font size="20">about that.</font>

839
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,670
<font size="20">Concubine Qin is one of your people.</font>

840
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,070
<font size="20">of course, you would defend her.</font>

841
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,070
<font size="20">Kids don't lie.</font>

842
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:41,900
<font size="20">Enough talking.</font>

843
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:46,510
<font size="20">Use your fists then.</font>

844
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,110
<font size="20">Madam Hua,</font>

845
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,420
<font size="20">let me walk you to your room.</font>

846
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:01,860
<font size="20">Huilan,</font>

847
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,110
<font size="20">keep your dog under leash.</font>

848
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,820
<font size="20">My precious cricket</font>

849
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:15,900
<font size="20">is dead.</font>

850
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,260
<font size="20">The clouds have dispersed.</font>

851
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,550
<font size="20">So many stars in the sky.</font>

852
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,780
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

853
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,380
<font size="20">People are born naive and innocent,
just like the sky itself.</font>

854
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,420
<font size="20">Zhi.</font>

855
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,190
<font size="20">Why did you climb up and unfurl the sail</font>

856
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,260
<font size="20">today?</font>

857
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:57,630
<font size="20">Because none of them wanted to.</font>

858
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,900
<font size="20">Since I can climb trees,</font>

859
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:00,990
<font size="20">I figured climbing this
wouldn't be hard.</font>

860
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,590
<font size="20">So</font>

861
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,150
<font size="20">why wouldn't the boatmen climb?</font>

862
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,070
<font size="20">Is it because they can't?</font>

863
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,220
<font size="20">They are struggling</font>

864
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
<font size="20">in the wind and rain,</font>

865
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,780
<font size="20">each man is watching out for his own.</font>

866
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:16,950
<font size="20">But if no one unfurl the sail,</font>

867
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,820
<font size="20">the boat might capsize.</font>

868
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,740
<font size="20">Or it won't.</font>

869
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,510
<font size="20">But if someone climbs up the mast</font>

870
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,740
<font size="20">and fall into the sea by accident,</font>

871
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,190
<font size="20">or gets struck by lightning.</font>

872
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,380
<font size="20">Then he will be dead.</font>

873
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,780
<font size="20">With such considerations,</font>

874
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,190
<font size="20">no one is willing to risk</font>

875
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,110
<font size="20">for the sake of others.</font>

876
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,950
<font size="20">Zhi.</font>

877
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:43,670
<font size="20">You have had a pure heart
since you were little.</font>

878
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,630
<font size="20">Being fearless</font>

879
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,780
<font size="20">can be a good thing sometimes.</font>

880
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,110
<font size="20">But it depends</font>

881
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,740
<font size="20">under certain circumstances.</font>

882
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,670
<font size="20">If something is beyond your power,</font>

883
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,380
<font size="20">you don't have to do it.</font>

884
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,670
<font size="20">One should know what to do,</font>

885
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,900
<font size="20">and what not to do.</font>

886
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,510
<font size="20">Grandpa.</font>

887
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,150
<font size="20">You lost me.</font>

888
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,550
<font size="20">Take the sail thing today as an example.</font>

889
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,190
<font size="20">You're good at climbing trees,</font>

890
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:07,820
<font size="20">so you climbed up the mast
without a second thought.</font>

891
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,550
<font size="20">You went out to sea for the first time,</font>

892
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,550
<font size="20">you knew nothing about
what would happen.</font>

893
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,470
<font size="20">If something bad happend,</font>

894
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,510
<font size="20">it would break my heart.</font>

895
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,590
<font size="20">And what if you got scared halfway?</font>

896
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,780
<font size="20">You regreted it?</font>

897
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,470
<font size="20">How would you be able to turn back then?</font>

898
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:25,900
<font size="20">Zhi.</font>

899
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,780
<font size="20">You are still young,</font>

900
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,900
<font size="20">you have a long time ahead of you.</font>

901
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,190
<font size="20">No matter what decisions
you are gonna make,</font>

902
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,420
<font size="20">you should always think twice about</font>

903
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,820
<font size="20">what and why</font>

904
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,380
<font size="20">you do that.</font>

905
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,510
<font size="20">Only when you make good judgement</font>

906
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,380
<font size="20">can you make your life
better and better.</font>

907
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,340
<font size="20">What if</font>

908
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,070
<font size="20">you've got a second chance</font>

909
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,150
<font size="20">to choose climbing up that mast.</font>

910
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,950
<font size="20">Will you?</font>

911
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,990
<font size="20">Of course.</font>

912
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,950
<font size="20">Because you are on the boat.</font>

913
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,420
<font size="20">Zhi.</font>

914
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,670
<font size="20">Will you blame me?</font>

915
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,340
<font size="20">You've been traveling all over with me</font>

916
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,550
<font size="20">at such a young age,</font>

917
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,700
<font size="20">going through all kinds of hardships.</font>

918
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,070
<font size="20">What's not good about that?</font>

919
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:10,110
<font size="20">I want to be with you forever.</font>

920
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,470
<font size="20">Travel all over
and be a well-read person.</font>

921
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,860
<font size="20">What a pity, Zhi.</font>

922
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,550
<font size="20">You're a girl.</font>

923
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,630
<font size="20">In a few more years,</font>

924
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,670
<font size="20">you can't disguise as my little page.</font>

926
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,380
<font size="20">Is that the North Star?</font>

927
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,820
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

928
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,260
<font size="20">Yesterday, I saw someone</font>

929
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,260
<font size="20">holding up a wooden board</font>

930
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,380
<font size="20">and watching the stars through it.</font>

931
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,220
<font size="20">That's a sextant.</font>

935
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:43,670

reach your destination.</font>
