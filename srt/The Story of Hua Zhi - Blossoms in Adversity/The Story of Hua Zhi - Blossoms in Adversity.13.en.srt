00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,620
always stays in his academy.

191
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,980
I just don't understand

192
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,180
what exactly have you done

193
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,260
to pull this off?

194
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:34,980
Nothing special.

195
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,340
I just posted a notice

196
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,220
that said the Hua Family
wanted a family teacher.

197
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,380
You have to seal the letter carefully
more than ever

198
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,940
to such a famous Confucian scholar
like that, right?

199
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,900
Zhi.

200
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,420
Master Mu

201
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,980
was invited by Mr. Shen.

202
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,340
It's a pity that you can't have him
as your husband,

203
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,060
but we should still be grateful

204
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,500
for what he did for us.

205
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,220
Such a pity.

206
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,140
He's such a good man.

207
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,980
Even better than Uncle Pingyang?

208
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,060
I mean it.

209
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,780
You should at least
send him your thanks.

210
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,060
Aunt Wu,

211
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,820
it's best for him

212
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,900
that I keep my distance from him.

213
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,300
I heard

214
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,700
Master will be having classes
in a few days.

215
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,380
Duo can also learn how to read by then.

216
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,860
Duo, are you happy about that?

217
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,260
I can read,

218
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,580
but I've never been to school before,

219
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,860
nor met a teacher.

220
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,900
Why didn't we get to
have such a good opportunity

221
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,140
to learn things when we were little?

222
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,020
I was so envious

223
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,740
to see those boys

224
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,060
going to school every day.

225
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,500
I remember

226
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,700
Ling even cried over this.

227
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,220
Ling studies everything

228
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,140
all by herself.

229
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,740
She can paint and write poems

230
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,820
better than those students

231
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,900
who study in the academy.

232
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,300
If back in the day,

233
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,580
she could have attended an academy...

234
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,340
Mother, let's stop here.

235
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,580
I don't want to go at all.

236
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,660
If everything is so great

237
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,700
about going to the academy,

238
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,140
why Bolin still doesn't want to go?

239
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,020
Wow, you figured it all out.

240
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,260
Do you know

241
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,540
what that teacher looks like?

242
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,820
They say

243
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,860
he's an old man

244
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,540
with a very long beard.

245
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,980
I won't go anyway.

246
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,740
Watch your tone.

247
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,700
I also know

248
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,380
we will hire a master of martial arts

249
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,060
since the family teacher is settled.

250
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,820
To teach whom?

251
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,580
Let's make it clear.

252
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,260
I'm not learning.

253
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,540
Silly girl.

254
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,500
You have to learn.

255
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,980
In case

256
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,220
we will run into some villains

257
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,140
like those from Zihuang Residence.

258
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,340
That would be amazing.

259
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,940
I'll be the first to sign up.

260
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,940
Rong thinks

261
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,260
that the master of martial arts

262
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,140
must be tall and handsome.

263
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,060
Hua Qin.

264
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,060
You are so annoying.

265
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,700
Alright, stop making a fuss.

266
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,140
Let's get to work.

267
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,500
Or we can't afford to buy flowers
to wear for the Dragon Boat Festival.

268
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,820
Go back and sit down.

269
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Look at my fancy work.

270
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,290
[Hua Mansion]

271
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,260
Brother.

272
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,940
Have you been having fun these days?

273
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,460
Zhi is too busy,

274
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,580
she's got no time for me.

275
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,540
Why is she so busy?

276
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,860
She's looking for the five teachers.
[*five and martial arts sound the same]

277
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,620
What are the five teachers?

278
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,820
Duo told me.

279
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,500
The five teachers

280
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,660
mean the teachers who can fight.

281
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,980
I asked her what are the six teachers.

282
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,020
She couldn't answer.

283
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Did she find those teachers then?

284
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,260
Brother.

285
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,260
You're highly skilled.

286
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,420
You can be the five teachers.

287
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,140
Then I can see you

288
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,260
every day.

289
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,860
She is just a little girl.

290
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,140
Forget that.

291
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,940
What are you doing here?

292
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,500
Isn't Master Mu having a class?

293
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,700
I... I...

294
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,620
God watches over the people

295
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,100
to see if they do things
by following the moral principle.

296
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,860
Some people live long
while others don't.

297
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,460
Go inside.

298
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,020
To see if they do things
by following moral principles.

299
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,380
Some people live long
while others don't.

300
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,900
One will lose life because of himself
if he doesn't follow moral principles,

301
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:18,900
Look at this.

302
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,580
Impressive, isn't it?

303
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,860
Wuhu.

304
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,780
Look at this.

305
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,780
I'll do it.

306
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,380
Who's talking?

307
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,540
Master.

308
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,740
It's...

309
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,340
It's the birds outside chirping.

310
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,140
Speak up.

311
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,340
Master, the birds outside are chirping.

312
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,620
The birds are calling, aren't they?

313
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,380
It seems we need to find

314
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,540
a younger teacher.

315
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,980
Studying is inherently tedious.

316
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,260
It won't make any difference.

317
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,380
I differ.

318
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,020
When I was young,

319
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,260
my Grandfather taught me to read,

320
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,380
and I didn't find it boring at all.

321
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:15,980
Okay.

322
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,140
I will keep an extra eye on them anyway

323
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
in case they don't behave in class.

324
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,500
Tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival.

325
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,940
Do you want to come here to celebrate it

326
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,660
and spend some time with Shaoyao?

327
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,500
I...

328
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,660
It's okay if you don't have time.

329
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,900
We're here with her anyway.

330
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:35,900
Thank you.

331
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,580
Your son?

332
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,660
Yes.

333
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,300
My son

334
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,340
has been skilled in martial arts
from a young age.

335
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,740
Moreover, you all know him.

336
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,860
If you ask me,

337
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,700
Lady Zhi.

338
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,140
You don't have to look for anyone else.

339
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,420
Jizong is a perfect fit

340
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,660
to be your master of martial arts.

341
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,540
Since he's the guardian,

342
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,140
I'm afraid he won't have spare time
for a side job.

343
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,260
I'll consider it.

344
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,340
There's one more thing

345
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,820
I want to ask you about.

346
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,460
Go on.

347
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,700
During this time,

348
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,780
you sell your pastry
at major restaurants

349
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,420
and earn quite a lot of money.

350
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,380
The Dragon Boat Festival is coming.

351
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,180
We are all short of money
to provide for the family.

352
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,100
My fellow guardians

353
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,460
complain about patrolling day and night.

354
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,940
And the monthly allowance
isn't good enough.

355
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,180
They

356
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,260
are a bunch of bulky muscle men.

357
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,060
If they don't want to do their job

358
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,180
and quit,

359
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,460
So?

360
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,900
So?

361
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,380
There are all women and children

362
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,100
in the manor.

363
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,220
If someone gets hurt,

364
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,380
that won't be good.

365
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,340
How much do you want to increase?

366
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,380
Double it for this time.

367
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,420
This time?

368
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,180
It's getting cold.

369
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,740
It's not easy for them to stay outside.

370
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,380
And they also have to
guard the gate at night,

371
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,900
in case thieves break in.

372
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,220
Be careful with the candles,

373
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,580
if a fire breaks out,

374
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
that would also be bad.

375
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,580
Guardian Li, you are quite considerate.

376
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm just doing my job

377
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,780
as a guardian.

378
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,140
Moreover,

379
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,460
we will also need you

380
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,220
to cover the cost

381
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,060
of our winter coats and charcoal.

382
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,420
Fine, I'm okay with that.

383
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,300
You can leave.

384
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,300
Thank you so much, Lady Zhi.

385
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,460
Please be careful.

386
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,180
Is it settled?

387
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,580
Is it done?

388
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,620
It didn't go well.

389
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm afraid we'll have to
find a new employer.

390
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,100
She didn't give an inch.

391
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,540
No wonder her father didn't like her.

392
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,420
She deserves that.

393
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,020
Does she have

394
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,700
any better options

395
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,340
than us?

396
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,380
Young Lady.

397
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,940
What is that Li Gui here for?

398
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,820
He wants to secure the position
for his son,

399
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,100
and let him
be our master of martial arts.

400
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,580
Did you agree?

401
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,060
Any leads on that thing

402
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,860
I asked you

403
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,620
to ask around before?

404
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,780
I've asked about it privately.

405
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:34,940
Li Gui's subordinate guardians

406
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,860
only get 30 percent

407
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,220
of the monthly allowance

408
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,140
we paid them.

409
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,180
Li Gui and his son

410
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,220
have been pocketing the money.

411
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,540
They all have quite a few complaints.

412
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,700
But there are rules
in this line of work,

413
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,420
they can't easily break them.

414
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,060
I also heard

415
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,860
that Li Gui's been acting defiantly.

416
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,140
He bullies those pushovers.

417
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,620
Madam Wu and Fudong

418
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,020
all had been there.

419
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,860
In the old days,

420
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,300
he was well-behaved

421
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,780
even though
he could be snobbish sometimes.

422
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,980
Who knows he becomes such a thug

423
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,900
within such a short time.

424
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,820
But in the past,

425
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,020
the house was not full of women only

426
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,020
like now.

427
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,380
Young Lady.

428
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,620
I don't know if this is appropriate

429
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,540
for me to ask this.

430
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,180
Since the guardians
are under the control of Li Gui,

431
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,220
then why don't you

432
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,020
just

433
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:15,700
kick them out?

434
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,780
You said it yourself,
there are rules to the trade.

435
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,300
Those men

436
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,700
are subordinates of Li Gui.

437
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,340
If Li Gui is driven away,

438
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,380
do we keep them here?

439
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,140
If we keep them here,

440
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
who has the power to handle them

441
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,180
since we're just women?

442
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,380
If they were kicked out

443
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,300
and had no income,

444
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,020
they might put up a fight for that,

445
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,900
but we have no strength to fight back.

446
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,020
The other day, they came here

447
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,300
with all the weapons.

448
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,700
I knew they wanted us
to hire them back again.

449
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,540
If I hadn't agreed that day,

450
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,860
they'd have done something bad to us.

451
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,780
So what do we do then, Young Lady?

452
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,020
We must hire
a master of martial arts quickly.

453
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,140
Someone with good character
and great martial skills.

454
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,500
He needs to be
an intimidating presence to these men.

455
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,300
Hire him first

456
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,780
in the name of master of martial arts.

457
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,540
When the right time comes,

458
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,340
replace Li Gui and his son
before they know it.

459
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,940
Right.

460
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,660
I'll go check on my Grandmother.

461
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,100
Young Lady, you haven't eaten...

462
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,180
Grandmother.

463
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,740
Zhi.

464
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,860
You've come at just the right time.

465
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,020
I have bad eyesight.

466
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,940
It's challenging for me
to read these letters.

467
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,020
Read it for me, dear.

468
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,140
Okay.

469
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,660
Shuqi,

470
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,100
How are you doing recently?

471
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,580
It's been a long time
since I saw you last time.

472
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,220
I miss you every single day.

473
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,740
I am disturbed by tedious affairs,

474
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,020
but I always long for
the old times in the peaceful cottage.

475
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,860
We napped on a bamboo bed

476
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,020
and cast the books into the sky.

477
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,740
We played the zither
and created poems together.

478
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,420
We burned incense and brewed tea

479
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,900
with peace in mind,

480
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,260
and stayed away from the worldly things.

481
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,220
All the vivid memories
were like just happened yesterday.

482
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,380
Time flies,
and now we're distant from each other.

483
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,180
my longing for you is beyond words.
Take care.

484
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,660
Grandmother.

485
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,740
Was this letter written

486
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,420
by an old friend?

487
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,860
All the letters here

488
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,580
are written by the same person.

489
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,780
We've exchanged letters for forty years.

490
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,420
This is just a small part of them.

491
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,900
If all were brought here,

492
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,660
even a cabinet could not hold them.

493
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,860
Now that we have settled down,

494
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,900
you can invite this Grandma

495
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,020
to come over.

496
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,540
Does she live far away?

497
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
Read two more for me.

498
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,420
I'm happy hearing what she said to me,

499
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,740
and it eases my headache.

500
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,780
I received your letter yesterday,
it brought me great comfort.

501
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,140
I had a few drinks and I got tipsy.

502
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,180
You need to find the right time
to get drunk for your purpose.

503
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,620
I fanned myself sitting
by the waterside,

504
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,820
looked up to the sky,
and saw the clouds scudded in the sky.

505
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,260
What else can it be

506
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,660
to make one happier?

507
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,940
After my hangover,
it suddenly occurred to me

508
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,220
that you once recited
Yang Chengzhai's poem.

509
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,500
A pot of clear snow water
broods the chill of spring.

510
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,580
Honey dripped on plum blossoms,
adorned with dew for a meal

511
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,380
It was hot during the time.

512
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,660
There was no snow or plum blossoms.

513
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,460
So half-jokingly, we made a pact.

514
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,940
When the Winter Solstice comes,

515
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
we gather snow water together

516
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,020
and brew it with fresh plum blossoms.

517
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,100
You said that

518
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,060
compared to brewing tea with snow,

519
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,860
the flavor would be much better.

520
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,020
Mr. Zhong.

521
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,220
Are you sprinkling realgar?

522
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,300
Wear mine.

523
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,900
Mine is prettier.

524
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,020
Wear my flower.

525
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,940
Wear mine.

526
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,420
Stop it, wear mine.

527
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Come here. kids.

528
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,860
Everyone, come here.

529
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,820
Stop running around.

530
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,500
You'll have to wear jasmine flowers
in a moment.

531
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,460
Come here.

532
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,100
Here.

533
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,340
I wish you to be healthy.

534
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,940
I wish you to be healthy.

535
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,020
I wish you to be healthy.

536
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,100
Come on.

537
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,100
Look at this flower.

538
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,100
Who made this?

539
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,580
I made this.

540
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,140
I didn't get the size quite right.

541
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,380
It turned out a bit too large.

542
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,820
I see this one is quite outstanding

543
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,140
among all these flowers.

544
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,260
Only you can carry it off well.

545
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,100
Let you put it on your head.

546
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,460
Looks great.

547
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,140
Grandmother.

548
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,020
I also want to put a flower on you.

549
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,820
You see?

550
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,020
You all tease me for fun,

551
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,420
right?

552
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,940
You look amazing.

553
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,700
Beautiful.

554
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,980
Madam Hua, Madams.

555
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,300
Fudong.

556
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,380
What delicious food

557
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,020
have you made this time?

558
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,060
This is baicaotou
people will eat for the Festival.

559
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,740
I cut apricots, plums, perilla,
and ginger into shreds,

560
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,060
mixed them with aromatic herbs

561
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,460
added salt to them, and got them dried.

562
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,300
I also made some wine lees with honey.

563
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,900
I will bring some to you, Madam Hua.

564
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,420
Fudong, you're getting better at it.

565
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,140
Such a talented kid at making food.

566
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,740
Then please make some more

567
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,700
and bring it

568
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,380
to Jing and Xian.

569
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,900
They both like it.

570
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:53,900
Will do.

571
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,660
Did Lady Zhi have her breakfast?

572
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,180
She is busy running around
for all kinds of stuff

573
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,860
and hasn't stopped for a rest yet.

574
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,220
She has many places to go

575
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,380
to send out Baicaotou.

576
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,100
And she also set up sheds
to distribute porridge.

577
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,300
She has gone out
to check on the sheds again.

578
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,500
Miss Zhi must be so tired.

579
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,020
Madam Hua,

580
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,420
I came up with the porridge idea.

581
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,820
I thought we had gotten through

582
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,220
the hardest times,

583
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,340
and live a better life now.

584
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,100
Today is a festival.

585
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,100
We should do some good deeds
for the poor.

586
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
It could also accumulate virtues
for our ancestors.

587
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,220
Well done.

588
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,540
Since it is a good deed,

589
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
don't let Lady Zhi do it alone,

590
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,340
you all should go and lend a hand.

591
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:41,300
Take all the children with you.

592
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,900
Teach them to be kind to others.

593
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,780
Yes.

594
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,220
We two brothers

595
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,660
haven't seen each other
for ten years, right?

596
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,420
You're always busy with state affairs,

597
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,780
and working all day and all night.

598
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,980
I dare not disturb you
without anything important.

599
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,660
We're brothers.

600
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,660
don't say anything like that.

601
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,220
You are even nicer to people
that you're not related to than to me.

602
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,660
Imperial brother.

603
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,860
If an outsider exceeds his bounds,

604
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,980
it would be impolite.

605
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,140
But you and I

606
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,900
have been brothers
from the first day we were born.

607
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,580
If I still do not understand the rules,

608
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,180
then I would not be excused.

609
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,020
The son of Lord Ling has arrived.

610
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,060
Greetings to Your Majesty.

611
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,140
Alright, please have a sea.

612
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,740
Yanxi.

613
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,540
The dishes have all gone cold.

614
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,740
Why are you sitting so far away from me?

615
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,860
Come over, sit by me.

616
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,780
Leave your seat.

617
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,780
Father, please forgive me.
I didn't know.

618
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,660
It's Dragon Boat Festival today,

619
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,740
don't bring up any displeasure.

620
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,940
Are you trying to get under my skin

621
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,900
on purpose?

622
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,180
Xi.

623
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,060
Today is a festival for family reunions.

624
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,580
Sit here.

625
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,100
Keep me and your mother company.

626
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,700
What are you doing recently?

627
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,180
We hardly see you all day.

628
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,460
Finally, we can get together today.

629
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,420
Hurry up and come over here,

630
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,340
pour us some wine.

631
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,220
I have just come all the way
riding a horse.

632
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,420
I'm covered in dust now

633
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,860
and didn't have time
to change my clothes.

634
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,700
I won't sit by you then.

635
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,140
I'll be sitting there.

636
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,220
You are smart.

637
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,580
Find yourself a spot
where can be seated alone.

638
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,580
You can join me

639
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,660
if you want

640
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,060
and keep me company.

641
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:45,860
No, thanks.

642
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,300
I'm afraid you will get dust on me.

643
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,260
Brother, you're getting better

644
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,460
at making jokes.

645
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,340
Yanxi.

646
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,300
You arrived so late today.

647
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,460
You'll be punished.

648
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,860
Your punishment is to pour wine for me.

649
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,420
Yan Xi.

650
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,660
These dishes

651
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,380
are what you've loved since childhood.

652
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,700
Eat more later.

653
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

654
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,900
Sit down.

655
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,220
Imperial brother, you shouldn't have.

656
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,540
You see,

657
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,820
each of your sons here

658
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,420
is talented and distinguished.

659
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,140
They can serve you all day

660
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,100
at your side.

661
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,340
As for me,

662
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,100
he is my only son.

663
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,340
Now,

664
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,420
he can't even pour wine for me as a son.

665
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,460
My sons here

666
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,820
are no equivalence of

667
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,900
Yanxi alone.

668
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,020
If there's anything

669
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,100
I envy about you,

670
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,940
it's that you have a good son.

671
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,220
I remember

672
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,940
the Emperor Emeritus

673
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,780
said the same thing.

674
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,020
Your Majesty.

675
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,220
Xi's achievements today

676
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,300
are all thanks to your teaching

677
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,580
and upbringing.

678
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,020
It's not entirely so.

679
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,140
Lady Zhou, I know that

680
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,100
you're a beautiful and capable woman.

681
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,420
I suppose

682
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,420
Yanxi has learned a lot from you
since he was little.

683
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,700
Right, Yanxi?

684
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,220
Imperial uncle.

685
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,900
I was young at the time,

686
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,140
I don't quite remember.

687
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,020
Bring some hot dishes here.

688
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,580
You are such good people.

689
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,500
Yes, good people.

690
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,020
Thank you.

691
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:04,660
Thank you.

692
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,700
Thank you.

693
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,580
That's so generous of you.

694
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,140
The porridge smells really good.

695
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,300
I could smell it from afar.

696
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,060
Young Lady.

697
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,380
Madam Zhu asked me to deliver

698
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,260
the multicolored string to you.

699
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,220
Hua Ling,

700
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,020
come.

701
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:18,740
Shaoyao,

702
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,620
come here.

703
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,020
Show me your hands.

704
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,020
Here.

705
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,940
Why did you tie this string on me?

706
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,300
You don't know?

707
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,660
Wearing multicolored string
can ward off evil spirits on this day.

708
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,220
Give me one more, please.

709
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,060
Okay.

710
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,860
Here you go, Young Lady.

711
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,100
Where is Xi?

712
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,340
Why doesn't Xi come home?

713
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:46,940
Don't worry about him.

714
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,620
He's quite comfortable

715
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,660
staying in the imperial palace.

716
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,420
He wishes he doesn't have to

717
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,260
go back home forever.

718
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,180
Changqing.

719
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:58,740
Yes.

720
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,700
Go prepare some wine and dishes.

721
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,180
I want to have a drink with Yanxi.

722
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,900
Yes.

723
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,260
Yanxi,

724
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,940
Don't take it to heart.

725
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,420
about what happened just now.

726
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,780
Your father and I have been like this
since we were young.

727
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,020
We bicker.

728
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,580
I understand.

729
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,580
It's just that

730
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,380
I'm kind of upset today.

731
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,140
For this Dragon Boat Festival
family banquet,

732
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,220
I invited the empress dowager
to come several days ago,

733
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,820
but she told me

734
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,420
that she has been
feeling unwell recently

735
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,260
and refused to even show her face.

736
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,740
Has the imperial physician
made a diagnosis?

737
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,020
She lied to me.

738
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,940
It's because she still resents me

739
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,220
for what happened to the Hua Family.

740
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,220
I heard that those women
of the Hua Family

741
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,940
have all moved back to the capital.

742
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,820
It made a stir

743
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,940
in the capital.

744
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,180
I've also heard about it

745
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,460
In the first half of the year,

746
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,500
They have been living

747
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,900
in the manor outside the capital.

748
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,540
and someone they managed
to live by themselves.

749
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,660
Imperial uncle.

750
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,620
That manor was a royal reward,

751
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,020
so I didn't confiscate it.

752
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,140
I'm not blaming you for anything.

753
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,740
That manor

754
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,500
is a reward from the empress dowager

755
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,780
to Madam Hua of the Hua Family.

756
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,100
They two

757
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,220
have been close since their youth.

758
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,100
I dismissed Hua Yizheng and his son
from their positions

759
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
and exiled them to the Northern Land,

760
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,420
who would dare to raise an objection?

761
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,820
I didn't know her informants

762
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,940
were so well-informed

763
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,500
and acted out so fast.

764
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,140
Then those women could survive this.

765
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,620
Yanxi.

766
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
Do you know

767
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,060
that secret letters are always sent out

768
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,780
from the empress dowager's
Fengxiang Palace?

769
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,620
From last winter to this day,

770
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,020
there have been seven letters
sent out in total.

771
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,660
I dare not investigate

772
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,860
the matters of the forbidden palace.

773
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:33,620
It doesn't matter.

774
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,860
I want you to look into it,

775
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,460
and do whatever you have to.

776
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,180
Feel free to ask around

777
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,940
in my Chenglu Palace.

778
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,260
or her Fengxiang Palace.

779
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,500
Will do.

780
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,220
Yanxi, do a thorough investigation.

781
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,260
Find out what's going on

782
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,780
between the empress dowager
and the Hua Family.

783
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,300
Yes.

784
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,460
I regard her as my mother,

785
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,620
but I don't think

786
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,860
the feelings are mutual.

787
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,500
Yanxi.

788
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,660
Put everything else aside for now.

789
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,820
Prioritize this matter.

790
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,180
I need to know

791
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,260
what the empress dowager intends to do
with her letters.

792
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
You are the only one

793
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,340
that I can entrust this to.

794
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,740
In such a vast imperial city,

795
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,500
do you truly have someone you trust?

796
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,340
Sir.

797
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,780
It's beyond my knowledge.

798
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,700
Well,

799
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,500
getting words out of a woman's mouth

800
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,420
is harder than

801
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,260
retrieving gold from a river.

802
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,460
And that page thing

803
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,580
you asked me to look into before?

804
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:49,820
Hasn't had any news until now.

805
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,020
And now we even have to investigate

806
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,300
that noble lady.

807
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,580
We must do it either way.

808
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
If we let the other people handle it,

809
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,380
then we won't know

810
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,380
what it will lead to.

811
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,980
Sir, look.

812
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,300
Isn't that Lady Zhi?

813
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,380
Are there plain clothes prepared
in the carriage?

814
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,460
Yes.

815
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,580
You finally came.

816
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,940
Shaoyao has been waiting for you
all day.

817
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:31,820
She was exhausted,

818
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,060
so I let her sleep.

819
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,460
It's my bad.

820
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,700
I can't bring her with me.

821
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,820
Shaoyao is lucky to be the few

822
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,820
in the world that

823
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,780
is happy and free.

824
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,140
Have you eaten anything?

825
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,660
It's home-cooked.

826
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,540
Fresh and hot.

827
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,300
Thanks.

828
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,460
I can take you home.

829
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:08,780
Don't bother.

830
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,140
In one shichen,
[*one shichen equals two hours]

831
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,380
I will distribute all the porridge.

832
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,660
Mr. Zhong will come to pick me up then.

833
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,220
Go back home.

834
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,460
Wait a moment.

835
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,780
A multicolored string.

836
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,020
It can ward off evil and keep you safe.

837
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,860
Let me help you put it on.

838
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:49,940
You can go.

839
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,900
Brother, you're highly skilled.

840
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,100
You can be the five teachers.

841
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,780
Then I can see you

842
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
every day.

843
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,340
It's a long time ago
and I was a busy man.

844
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,660
I have been

845
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,180
running around these years

846
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,020
and child servants came and went.

847
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,180
They're scattered all over the world.

848
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,500
I really don't know

849
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,500
which one are you referring to.

850
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,500
Your master of martial arts?

851
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,140
Did you find one?

852
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,460
It's even harder than

853
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,780
finding a family teacher.

854
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,740
I've tried the sleeve arrows

855
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,660
that you gave me several times,

856
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,580
but I always missed the target.

857
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,460
After I find a master of martial arts,

858
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,740
I will let him teach me.

859
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:25,940
Am I a fit?

860
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,220
You're so brazen.

861
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,420
Do you want a compliment?

862
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,660
I said before

863
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,180
if there's anything I could help with,

864
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,220
just ask away.

865
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,780
Now I see

866
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,900
you didn't take it seriously at all.

867
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,620
Then if you happen to know

868
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,660
any masters of martial arts,

869
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,260
could you recommend them to me?

870
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,820
I'd like to apply
to be your master of martial arts.

871
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,180
Stop joking.

872
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,500
If you're short on money,

873
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,300
you don't have to pay

874
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,100
Shaoyao's living expenses for now.

875
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,500
You give up that much money

876
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,820
just because you don't want me
to apply for the position?

877
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,620
It's not like that.

878
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,020
What I mean is

879
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,540
if you really mean it,

880
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,300
and want this job...

881
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:09,900
What?

882
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,020
That would be great.

883
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,300
I'm just a normal guy

884
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,220
born into a normal family.

885
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,660
It totally suits me

886
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,500
to be your family's
master of martial arts.

887
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,100
I always have a feeling

888
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,740
that you were not born

889
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:21,740
to be a person busied with toiling,

890
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,260
and what's on your mind

891
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,860
is nothing about normal folk's concerns.

892
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,700
Are there any other conditions

893
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,580
to get this job?

894
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,820
Just tell me.

895
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:30,820
No need/

896
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,020
You can start tomorrow.

897
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:32,620
Good.

898
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,300
From now on,

899
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,700
I am at your disposal.

900
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,140
What now?

901
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,580
Change your mind?

902
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,740
Am I being too cruel?

903
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,580
You haven't had a proper rest

904
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,660
since day one I met you.

905
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,140
You know that, huh?

906
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,900
After what happened to your family,

907
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,660
have you rested properly even for a day?

908
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,220
I'm afraid we all

909
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,340
are meant to live a busy life.

910
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,660
Destined to live a life of toil.

911
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,980
This place

912
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,180
used to be a small workshop.

913
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,420
For stockpiling goods.

914
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,420
It's a bit shabby now,

915
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,180
but I'll make a refurnishment later.

916
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,860
It's fine.

917
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
When I was in the army,

918
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,700
the training ground
was just a wasteland.

919
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,860
The grass was even taller than a person.

920
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,260
This way leads to the academy.

921
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,540
That way leads to the inner courtyard.

922
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,820
It's not that large here,

923
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,300
but we've got everything we need.

924
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,420
Perhaps living here

925
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,220
will be more convenient
than living outside the city.

926
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,100
Yes, indeed.

927
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,180
I've heard

928
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,940
your family's manor outside the city

929
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:42,980
was bestowed by the royal family.

930
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,340
Yes.

931
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,900
It was bestowed by the empress dowager.

932
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:46,780
Empress dowager?

933
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,180
I didn't know you were related.

934
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,340
Maybe it goes way back.

935
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,900
Since I can remember things,

936
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,860
I've never heard that
the empress dowager

937
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,980
had any relations with my family,

938
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,780
let alone offering any protection.

939
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,620
This house is not large.

940
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,460
Feel free to look around.

941
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,740
I'll go prepare a room for you.

942
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:02,380
Once it's ready,

943
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,980
you can make do for the night.

944
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,260
Don't bother.

945
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,980
I'll come to teach the children
during the day

946
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,340
and go back for the night.

947
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,900
You'll need a place to rest.

948
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,940
So please don't turn me down.

949
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:11,980
The is not a big house.

950
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,020
You can look around

951
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,020
and get to know the place.

952
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,580
I've also told them about you.

953
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,980
You're here to teach them martial arts,

954
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,140
so please be comfortable.

955
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,220
Alright.

956
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,420
Who is she?

957
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,460
Young Lady said there's been
a shortage of hands recently.

958
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,500
I hired her as our worker

959
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,380
from outside.

960
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,100
She used to do hard labor,
carrying fruit.

961
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:45,980
But that job

962
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,220
was too hard for a girl.

963
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,780
So I bring her here to help.

964
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,180
What's your name?

965
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,300
I... My surname is Zhang.

966
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,420
I asked for your first name.

967
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,340
Not your surname.

968
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,620
Are you stupid?

969
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,540
Country girls don't have first names.

970
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,420
Right.

971
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,660
Before I met the Young Lady,

972
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,540
I didn't have one either.

973
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,860
I am Baoxia.

974
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:12,220
Nice to... meet... you.

975
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,620
Where did this little hen come from?

976
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,740
She clucks like a hen.

977
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,980
She's new.

978
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,140
Be nice.

979
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,980
I am being nice.

980
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:22,220
Let's go.

981
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,620
I'll take you to our room.

982
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,420
Look at that idle fellow.

983
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,780
Ignore him, just go.

984
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,420
Yingchun,

985
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,620
I've cleaned out a room

986
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,860
next to the academy.

987
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,180
But I'm really not

988
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,380
good at this kind of stuff.

989
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,460
Help me check the room

990
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
and see if there's anything else
that is needed.

991
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,140
Okay.

992
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,660
We have a new master again?

993
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,060
Yes.

994
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,060
They've been short of hands
in the kitchen recently.

995
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,620
I've hired a few girls from outside

996
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,580
to help us out in the manor.

997
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,420
I won't give them
anything important to do.

998
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,020
They'll just be responsible
for the needlework and laundry.

999
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,020
They are all honest and upright girls.

1000
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,380
They're a bit clumsy,

1001
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,540
but I can teach them.

1002
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,420
I'll handle them, Young Lady.

1003
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,060
Young Lady.

1004
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,660
Why are you looking at me like that?

1005
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,820
Yingchun,

1006
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,500
you're getting the hang

1007
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,860
of what you are doing.

1008
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,260
It's been quite a few months after all.

1009
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,460
If I still can't get it right,

1010
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,780
you should send me away, Young Lady.

1011
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,460
It's not right.

1012
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,620
If the one who is doing this job

1013
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,900
is Baoxia or Fudong,

1014
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,540
they can't manage it
because they're too fussy.

1015
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,740
In the coming days,

1016
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,220
you will have to
manage more and more maids,

1017
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,340
and that means
you will be as busy as a bee.

1018
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,700
I'm not afraid of being busy.

1019
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,220
Young Lady,
you are the brain of this family.

1020
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,140
And I,

1021
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,500
I'll be your executor

1022
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,500
carrying out everything you need.

1023
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,260
I almost forgot.

1024
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,700
Go prepare some food.

1025
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,100
Let's send it over to Mr. Gu.

1026
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,420
Mr. Gu.

1027
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,340
This gentleman is quite an eye candy.

1028
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:50,660
So handsome!

1029
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,460
So handsome!

1030
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,100
This place should be

1031
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,340
where Madam Hua lives.

1032
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,180
Don't get too serious.

1033
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,620
Forgive me, bro.

1034
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,820
You are hired
as the master of martial arts,

1035
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,180
so I thought
you must have got something.

1036
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,100
How about a match?

1037
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,180
Watch your attitude.

1038
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,460
It might cost your job.

1039
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,660
It's not up to you

1040
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,420
whether I can keep my job or not.

1041
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,780
My father is the chief of the guardians.

1042
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,740
The safety of this entire family

1043
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,180
relies on my father and me.

1044
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,620
Is that so?

1045
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,580
Sorry for being rude.

1046
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,580
Cut it out.
Do you want to do this or not?

1047
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,300
Li Jizong, what are you doing?

1048
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,380
Let go of him.

1049
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:52,780
Lady Zhi,

1050
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,860
I heard you've hired

1051
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,580
a master of martial arts.

1052
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,020
So I've come here

1053
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,220
to spar with him.

1054
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,660
It is his day one today,

1055
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,700
and I have matters to discuss with him.

1056
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,980
He has no time to spar with you.

1057
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:02,980
Alright then.

1058
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,540
Next time.

1059
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:07,900
Are you alright?

1060
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,020
Did he hurt you?

1061
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,180
Don't worry,

1062
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,660
he won't be staying
in this family for long.

1063
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,500
What happened?

1064
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:19,220
Nothing.

1065
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,100
It's just that

1066
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,020
it's the first time

1067
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:23,860
someone talks to me like that.

1068
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,540
He's just a scoundrel.

1069
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,300
No matter what he says,

1070
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,220
don't take it seriously.

1071
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,620
I mean you.

1072
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,340
Ever since I was little,

1073
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,300
they've always been pushing me

1074
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,220
to do difficult and dangerous things.

1075
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,660
But this is the first time

1076
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,860
someone steps up for me

1077
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,540
and asks me if I've been wronged.

1078
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:45,580
Let's go.

1079
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,220
I've brought some pastry and soup.

1080
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,780
I am better than you.

1081
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,860
At least Grandfather loves me.

1082
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,940
Although the Hua Family
has come down in the world,

1083
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,660
you and Shaoyao

1084
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,780
can see this place as your second home.

1085
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,020
If someone bullies you

1086
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,660
ever again,

1087
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,460
don't be afraid to speak up.

1088
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,660
Just tell me.

1089
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,660
I won't let you

1090
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,340
be treated unfairly anymore.

1091
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,540
Why should I tell you?

1092
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,060
Are you going to beat him up

1093
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:15,900
and vent my anger?

1094
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,740
There's always a way.

1095
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,380
If we can't get physical,
we can outsmart them.

1096
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,780
If the Hua Family somehow is related
to the empress dowager,

1097
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,500
I'm afraid His Majesty

1098
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,340
won't let them off.

1099
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,100
What did the commander

1100
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,180
tell you?

1101
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,500
We've found leads.

1102
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,380
The incense money and letters

1103
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,140
have all been sent to Shanhua Temple.

1104
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,700
Ms. Su

1105
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,860
goes there to offer incense

1106
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,020
every half-month,

1107
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,940
and then she retrieves the letters.

1108
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,860
The Hua Family

1109
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,340
has everything to do with this.

1110
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,100
The commander said

1111
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,300
to investigate thoroughly,

1112
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,020
he needed to be away for a while

1113
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,420
and to infiltrate the Hua Family.

1114
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,420
You know what?

1115
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,100
We are not able to know

1116
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,780
how long he'll be gone

1117
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,740
for the undercover.

1118
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,300
His martial skills are remarkable.

1119
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,020
Rest assured.

1120
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,900
Next door to us

1121
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,180
is the residence of Lady Zhi
if I remember it right.

1122
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,420
We're separated by just a wall.

1123
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,900
I saw her pass by

1124
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,060
this morning.

1125
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,540
She is so young,

1126
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,500
how can you tell

1127
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,540
she can manage such a big family?

1128
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,780
How is everyone doing

1129
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,700
with your work?

1130
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,460
It's done.

1131
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,620
Go take a rest.

1132
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,500
Yes.

1133
