[Episode 17]

25
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,970
The great fire at Lord Ling's Mansion
that year

26
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,540
was witnessed by someone
from the Hua Family.

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,650
I went there

28
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,340
to find clues.

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:47,970
Yanxi,

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,460
with me,

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,780
you have always been so honest.

32
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,460
Uncle,

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,530
there's nothing I can't tell you about.

34
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,580
Go on, do what you need to do.

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,100
Uncle,

36
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,460
about those letters,

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,900
may I put them back
without letting anyone know?

38
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,420
In case the Hua Family get suspicious.

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,130
Alright.

40
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,060
Changqing.

41
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,130
Yes.

42
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,810
Returned as they were.

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,130
Not a single letter missing.

44
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,340
How did you manage that?

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,530
Since these letters
are of no consequence,

46
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,210
then aside from the Empress Dowager
and Madam Hua,

47
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,170
to others,

48
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,130
they hold no value.

49
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,660
I got permission

50
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,460
and then brought them back.

51
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,530
You...

52
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,420
Are you angry?

53
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,970
The last time you were angry with me

54
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:43,660
was when you found out

55
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,690
that I am Shaoyao's brother.

56
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,250
When you get angry,

57
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,100
do you aways stay silent?

58
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,970
You work for the Security Bureau.

59
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,220
Why do you care
whether I'm angry or not?

60
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,690
You're my employer.
I'm hoping you'll cool down soon

61
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,300
and continue hiring me.

62
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,690
Now that you've returned,

63
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,460
I want to ask you something.

64
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,460
Go ahead.

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,810
Did you offend

66
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,970
your leader in the Security Bureau?

67
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,300
Why were you sent here

68
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,140
to do this task?

69
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,300
This task has no extra incomes

70
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,050
nor merits.

71
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,140
I came voluntarily

72
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,860
because of Shaoyao

73
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,660
and you.

74
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,770
So you're doing this for money.

75
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,220
If it were for money,

76
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,250
I could support Shaoyao,

77
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,100
and I could also support...

78
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,530
You could support me?

79
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,460
Hua Zhi,

80
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,530
I'm not doing this for money.

81
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,580
I have to stay in the Security Bureau.

82
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,380
Then what are you doing it for?

83
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,890
Is there a reason you can't say?

84
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,810
Because the person I serve

85
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,330
has shown me great kindness.

86
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,050
He's the one closest to me.

87
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,970
Then, when this is over,

88
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,650
will you leave?

89
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,650
Or, will you be able to stay?

90
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,580
Do you want me to stay?

91
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,770
Actually, I came here this time

92
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,330
to look into an old case

93
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,420
regarding Lord Ling's Mansion.

94
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,370
One year, during the Lantern Festival,

95
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,930
Master Hua went there to bid farewell.

96
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,580
Consort Zhou passed away.

97
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,770
There was a young page
by Master Hua's side.

98
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,260
Do you know

99
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,370
where is that young page now?

100
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,050
My grandfather never had

101
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,050
a young page with him.

102
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,170
You were too young back then.

103
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,650
It's normal that you don't remember.

104
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,980
The one by my grandfather's side

105
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,020
had always been me.

106
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,460
It was you?

107
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,890
That year, I followed my grandfather

108
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,930
to Lord Ling's Mansion.

109
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,020
We happened to witness that big fire.

110
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,930
It was you!

111
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,460
Wipe it off.

112
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,980
Your snot's on your shirt.

113
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
I came with Master Hua.

114
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,090
He was ordered to leave the capital.

115
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,740
So I'm leaving as well.

116
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,140
What's wrong?

117
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,820
The night before the fire,

118
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,540
a nanny went to visit Her Highness.

119
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,170
Then she took you out.

120
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,210
Do you remember what she looked like?

121
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,370
This place is close to the garden.

122
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,700
You can still make it in time
to enjoy the fireworks.

123
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,860
Ms. Chen,

124
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:12,930
you know the way.

125
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,370
Just take her to the garden in passing.

126
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,090
Yes, Your Highness.

127
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,260
That night, I did see a nanny.

128
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,370
But it's been too many years.

129
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,890
I don't quite remember her face.

130
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,090
She looked

131
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,330
nothing special.

132
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,260
If I remember anything,

133
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,210
I will definitely tell you.

134
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,330
If you are going to leave,

135
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,930
make sure to tell me in advance.

136
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,300
Do you still trust me?

137
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,090
Do you still want me to stay?

138
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,740
Without you,
who'll be managing those guardians?

139
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,260
And who'll give the kids lessons?

140
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,980
But I am from the Security Bureau.

141
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,370
Aren't you afraid of me?

142
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,170
Why should we be?

143
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,140
If someone else was watching us,

144
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,530
things might get even worse.

145
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,020
I'll return the letter to Grandmother.

146
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,620
Hua Zhi.

147
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:09,620
Thank you.

148
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,090
How dare you lie to me?

149
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,890
I clearly told you to go away.

150
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,140
I did walk away.

151
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,820
This is already far enough.

152
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,850
Even if I reached out my arms,

153
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,620
I still couldn't wipe your tears.

154
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,380
I want

155
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,090
to take another look at her.

156
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,460
But I dare not to.

157
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,380
It's alright.

158
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,820
I'll keep you company.

159
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:15,820
You...

160
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,940
Aren't you scared?

161
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,410
I'm very brave.

162
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:21,650
Push hard.

163
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,970
Mother!

164
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,460
Mother...

165
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,140
What are you guys doing?

166
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,060
Didn't you say we're no longer friends?

167
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,180
Good friends
don't hold overnight grudges.

168
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,410
Exactly.

169
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,020
When we fought each other,

170
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,940
I didn't hear you say
we were "good friends".

171
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,580
Don't say that.

172
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,290
All this time, we're the only ones

173
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,180
hanging out with you.

174
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,140
Besides us,

175
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,530
you have no other friends, do you?

176
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,180
Yeah.

177
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,410
Mr. Shen,

178
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,090
you got beaten as well?

179
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,580
I guess it was the Hua Family.

180
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,650
That's awful.

181
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,210
We must go to the Deqing House

182
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,060
and get some wine to calm your nerves.

183
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,020
I heard there's

184
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,530
a Tocharian troupe that newly came.

185
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,820
Let's go, Mr. Shen.

186
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,580
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

187
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,530
Oh my, Mr. Shen.

188
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,180

What's the saltpeter for?

362
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,300
I had rented

363
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,300
a workshop for making saltpeter,

364
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,370
so when the weather got hotter,

365
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,010
we'll have some ice

366
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,010
to make iced desserts.

367
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,820
But these past few days,

368
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,660
I have been really busy

369
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,660
and haven't been able
to take care of it.

370
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,850
Then this happened.

371
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,250
Saltpeter is flammable.

372
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,940
You must be extremely careful
in the workshop.

373
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,370
I will ask Yingchun and others

374
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,420
to give more warnings.

375
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,780
Those workers are actually
very hardworking.

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,610
but they seemed to be covered in frost.

378
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,900
And I saw with my own eyes,

379
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,610
on those pitch-black tiles,

380
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,700
a layer of frost had formed.

381
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,700
It must be the lingering spirit
of Her Highness

382
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,130
manifesting herself!

383
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,460
Saltpeter.

384
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,300
What about it?

385
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,850
The reason why that fire was so big

386
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,250
was because of the saltpeter.

387
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,820
That was why after the rain,

388
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,060
there were traces like frost

389
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
left on the ruins.

390
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,730
Where are you going?

391
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,250
I'll explain when I'm back.

392
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,210
Commander, how can I help you?

393
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,330
I need you to look into something.

394
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,580
There are many manors
under Lord Ling's name.

395
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,250
I remember that one of them

396
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,210
was skilled in making lanterns.

397
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,060
And the mountain nearby
was rich in saltpeter.

398
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,370
Every year,
the fireworks and firecrackers,

399
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,090
as well as the lanterns
in Lord Ling's Mansion

400
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,660
were all tributes from them.

401
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,250
I'll take care of it right away.

402
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,700
Over the past decade,

403
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,940
the nannies who have
worked in Lord Ling's Mansion

404
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,580
have all been thoroughly investigated.

405
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,850
Yet I never thought

406
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,970
during the Lantern Festival,

407
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,130
the ones who might appear in the mansion

408
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,460
were not only the maids who work there,

409
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,580
but also people from the manors
who bring gifts.

410
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,370
You can't pay the rent again?

411
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:39,460
If you can't afford

412
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,250
this year's rent,

413
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,060
you can forget about farming.

414
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,180
Just pay back what you owe me first,

415
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,780
then take your kids and wife

416
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,970
and get the heck back!

417
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,970
Yes, Madam.

418
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,730
I'll definitely give you the money.

419
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,180
I'll will!

420
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,010
Ms. Chen.

421
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
You are?

422
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,850
What are you doing?

423
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,130
What are you doing?

424
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,370
[Hua Mansion]

425
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,700
Rat!

426
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,900
How dare you run off!

427
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,060
Try run away now!

428
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,090
Try!

429
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,420
You think once you run back
to your hometown,

430
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,610
I could never catch you?

431
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,250
Madam.

432
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,580
Madam, I'm sorry!

433
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,700
I made a huge mistake!

434
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,300
Madam!

435
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:19,970
Shut up!

436
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,820
You've still got the nerve
to call me Madam?

437
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,460
You backstabbing rat!

438
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,130
Madam,

439
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,010
please,

440
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,420
forgive me this one time!

441
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,970
I was bewitched.

442
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,540
With so much money

443
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,250
passing through my hands every day,

444
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,850
I was being stupid!

445
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,700
Madam!

446
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,940
You spent the Hua Family's money
in brothels.

447
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,700
In just a short month,

448
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,780
you squandered hundreds of guan!

449
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,010
That was

450
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,900
my Boyu's life-saving money!

451
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,330
You and your mistress

452
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,730
better give me back my money!

453
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,820
Or by tomorrow morning,

454
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,130
I will get you two arrested!

455
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,460
And I'll write down

456
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,300
what you've done

457
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,460
and post it in the ancestral hall!

458
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,730
Even if you die,

459
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,300
you'd still be too ashamed
to be buried in the ancestral grave!

460
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,660
Madam, I'm sorry!

461
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,300
Please forgive me!

462
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:52,970
Drag him out and beat him!

463
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,820
After that,

464
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
take him to Liushui Street

465
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,730
and get the money back from his woman.

466
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,580
Madam!

467
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,370
Madam!

468
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,210
I'm sorry!

469
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,540
Please forgive me just this once.

470
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,850
Madam!

471
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,330
Madam,

472
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,700
where are you going?

473
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,250
It's midnight already!

474
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,660
You should get some sleep.

475
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,250
How can I possibly sleep?

476
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,610
There's still a buttload of accounts

477
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
to be sorted out!

478
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,060
If I don't get it done,

479
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,420
how would I know exactly how much money
did that rat

480
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,970
steal from me?

481
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,540
It's going to take a few days

482
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,540
to get everything clear.

483
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,900
Madam!

484
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,570
How come there's someone here
at this hour?

485
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,530
What are you doing here?

486
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:47,490
I...

487
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:48,460
I...

488
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,460
[Ledger]

489
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,420
Xia Ming's accounts?

490
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,010
Did Zhi ask you to do this?

491
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:56,970
No.

492
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:57,940
It... It was me.

493
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:00,380
I came here myself.

494
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,810
Earlier today,

495
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,100
I saw you crying in the courtyard.

496
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,460
You've taught me.

497
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,860
So I thought

498
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,730
I should help you with the accounts.

499
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,180
Working all night

500
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,860
and this is all you've done?

501
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,010
Your hands

502
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,490
are truly clumsier than chicken feet!

503
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,250
Have you seen clearly?

504
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,660
From now on,

505
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,940
if you make mistakes again

506
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,730
or get anything wrong,

507
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,620
you'll get a beating!

508
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:54,970
Are you scared?

509
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,420
If you're scared,
don't pursue this line of work.

510
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,290
Do you think I was born

511
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,620
knowing how to use an abacus?

512
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,100
I learned it through beatings too.

513
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,210
When I was little,

514
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,700
one mistake would earn me ten lashes.

515
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,730
In the deep winter,

516
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,460
my hands

517
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,490
were covered in wounds.

518
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,530
They wouldn't even heal!

519
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,970
The day you stop being beaten

520
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
will be the day you've become skilled.

521
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,700
Now sit down

522
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,730
and help me with the accounts!

523
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,140
Madam,

524
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,810
please have some renshen soup
before you start working.

525
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,620
There's no rush.

526
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,050
Please just take a rest.

527
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,290
Today might be my last day.

528
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,210
I have thought it through.

529
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,340
When I made sure the accounts
are tallied correctly,

530
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,570
I'll give them all

531
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,570
back to Zhi.

532
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,180
Does she not want you
to manage the accounts anymore?

533
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,620
After making such a big mistake,

534
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,180
how can I still do it?

535
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,380
I'm not going to wait until

536
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,210
she asks me to leave.

537
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,010
Never mind.

538
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,900
You all should go to bed.

539
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,140
The day has already dawned.

540
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:18,860
Off you go.

541
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,620
Yes.

542
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,460
Aunt Xia,

543
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,180
you haven't slept all night?

544
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,100
I'm used to staying up.

545
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,290
It's fine.

546
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,050
Nianqiu

547
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,530
stayed up all night too.

548
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,340
She just went back to sleep.

549
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,380
Zhi,

550
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,530
I'm sorry.

551
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,250
It was all my fault.

552
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,810
I was being stupid.

553
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,620
If only I had known this would happen,

554
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,810
I would not have managed the ledger.

555
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,010
If I had left it all to you,

556
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,970
there wouldn't have been

557
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,180
such a huge trouble.

558
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,730
Whomever you entrust it to,

559
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,250
they can't ensure
there wouldn't be a mistake.

560
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,050
You have a business background.

561
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,210
You surely understand that
better than I do.

562
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,460
Doing business,

563
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,100
the easiest thing is to lose money.

564
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,010
You can't read minds.

565
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,730
It's inevitable to misjudge people.

566
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,700
You don't blame me?

567
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,970
You were right about one thing.

568
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,970
Every extra person adds more strength.

569
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,010
In the future,

570
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,700
our family business

571
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,900
will only grow larger and larger.

572
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,140
Relying on just you and me

573
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,140
won't be enough.

574
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
Even if you didn't try to hire someone,

575
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,900
I would.

576
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,380
Madam Xia, we need you

577
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,050
to be in charge
of the entire accounting department.

578
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,010
You'll be leading the rest of us.

579
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:52,860
Thank you.

580
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:56,250
Thank you!

581
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,730
It's alright.

582
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,570
Thank you.

583
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,180
Who are you people?

584
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,380
What do you want me for?

585
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,530
Old hag,

586
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,970
this is the Security Bureau.

587
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,210
You know that, right?

588
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,180
Many have come to this place,

589
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,210
but those who could leave

590
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,460
were few.

591
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,900
Ms. Chen,

592
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,180
you used to live in the Chen Village,

593
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,420
making a living by selling saltpeter

594
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,770
and making lanterns.

595
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,460
Later you made a fortune,

596
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,140
moved away with your whole family

597
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,970
and became a landlady.

598
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,050
I am just a countrywoman.

599
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,660
I don't know anything!

600
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,940
I won't waste words with you.

601
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,660
Ms. Chen, you have only one son

602
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,210
named Chen Darui, right?

603
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,180
When I asked you a question,
you shall answer it.

604
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,180
If you can't remember the answer,

605
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,420
I'll bring your son here

606
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,660
and cut off his flesh

607
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,340
slice by slice.

608
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,620
Perhaps then you'll remember.

609
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,660
I'll talk!

610
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,180
I'll tell you everything!

611
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,140
At the Lantern Festival
in the ninth year of Chengtian,

612
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,620
that fire in Lord Ling's Mansion,

613
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,940
how exactly did it happen?

614
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,900
Tell me every detail

615
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,770
and make it clear.

616
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:16,340
They made me do it!

617
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,530
They made me!

618
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Your Highness,

619
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,570
these are the freshly made lanterns

620
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:30,530
from our manor this year.

621
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,250
Today's the Lantern Festival.

622
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,660
I specially presented them to you.

623
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Has His Highness seen them?

624
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,900
They have been sent
to both His Highness and Consort Xiao.

625
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,140
His Highness said

626
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:40,660
that you must be bored living alone,

627
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,010
so he specifically asked me
to bring more lanterns here

628
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,100
to add to the festivity.

629
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,730
Thank you.

630
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,010
Here are some money
and pastries for you.

631
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,010
You can take them all.

632
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,290
It's a festival today.

633
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,210
You should go home early

634
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,050
and be with your family.

635
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

636
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,140
Come on.

637
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,140
Little Mister,

638
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,970
where are you heading to?

639
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,770
Where is this place?

640
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,770
I want to go to the garden
to watch the lanterns

641
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:18,940
and the fireworks.

642
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,380
I saw there're many lanterns here,

643
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,420
so I came in.

644
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,770
But I don't think this is the garden.

645
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:24,810
It's alright.

646
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,180
This place is very close to the garden.

647
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,570
You'll make it in time
to enjoy the fireworks.

648
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:28,700
Ms. Chen,

649
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,730
you know the way.

650
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,180
Just take her to the garden in passing.

651
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:32,900
Yes, Your Highness.

652
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,730
Those lanterns,

653
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,970
you did something to them, didn't you?

654
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,340
Inside those lanterns

655
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,250
were saltpeter and charcoal.

656
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,700
The candles were mixed
with tranquilizing incense.

657
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,660
Once lit,

658
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,490
it would make people drowsy.

659
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,970
When the candle burned down to the fuse,

660
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,010
the lantern would explode.

661
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,380
Wherever it exploded

662
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,050
was where it would burn.

663
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:17,290
The water is coming!

664
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,010
Your Highness,

665
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:18,660
the fire is too big in there!

666
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,460
You can't go in!

667
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,050
Your Highness!

668
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:20,970
Rou!

669
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,940
You can't get in, Your Highness!

670
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,140
Your Highness,

671
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,570
you can't go in there!

672
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,340
Your Highness!

673
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,050
Don't go in there!

674
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,940
Rou!

675
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,770
Those at the back, hurry up!

676
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,460
Water!

677
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,050
Rou!

678
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,210
I have done something wrong.

679
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,810
Today, I'll pay with my life.

680
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,530
I have no complaints.

681
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,050
But my son

682
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,530
is innocent.

683
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,100
Ms. Chen,

684
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,010
you truly love your son.

685
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,900
Have you ever thought

686
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,730
that the one you killed
was also a mother?

687
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,490
Her daughter was still in her arms.

688
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,100
You had no grudge against her.

689
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,660
Who made you do it?

690
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,420
I cannot tell you that.

691
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,210
If I do, Darui will die!

692
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:14,810
Give me the name.

693
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,010
I'll make sure he's safe.

694
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,900
Xi, you're back.

695
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,210
Let's go.

696
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,860
[Imperial Government Office]

697
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
I foresaw this long ago.

698
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,340
Sooner or later, this day will come.

699
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,810
I have been waiting for this day

700
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,460
for so long.

701
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,620
That nanny said

702
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,380
you threatened her with her son's life

703
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,250
and forced her to make
those saltpeter lanterns.

704
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,010
Xi,

705
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,460
do you hate me?

706
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:16,770
All these years,

707
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,860
you treated me and Shaoyao
as your own children.

708
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,660
And you refuse
to have any children of your own.

709
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,250
In the years I spent on the border,

710
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,860
you took care of Shaoyao for me

711
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,940
and took her to get treatment.

712
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,010
Indeed, I see you and Shaoyao

713
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,420
as my own children.

714
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:37,460
But...

715
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,460
You murdered

716
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:39,420
our mother!

717
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,380
That's not the same thing.

718
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,180
You might not believe this,

719
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,210
but I don't hate your mother.

720
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,340
Sometimes, I even

721
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
miss her a lot.

722
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,010
When the fire started,

723
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:55,050
I regretted it immediately.

724
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,660
I rushed into the fire to save her.

725
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,460
But the fire was too big.

726
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,380
Rou pushed Shaoyao to me.

727
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,530
She told me to take her and run.

728
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,620
When I picked up Shaoyao

729
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,620
and started running,

730
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,900
that pillar came crashing down.

731
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,420
I raised a hand
trying to protect myself,

732
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,250
but then the pillar fell onto me.

733
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,380
I remembered the kindness
Rou had shown me.

734
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,460
Ever since I entered the mansion,

735
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,900
she'd give me

736
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,250
everything I liked.

737
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,860
She was like my sister.

738
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,900
She gifted me jewelry, hairpins, skirts,

739
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,620
scrolls and paintings.

740
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,140
Even this hairpin.

741
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,100
A gift from her.

742
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,970
I've been wearing it the whole time.

743
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,210
I don't want to take it off.

744
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,420
But sadly,

745
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,050
we married the same man.

746
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,860
She was married in an official ceremony,

747
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,770
whereas I

748
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,700
was carried in quietly in a sedan chair

749
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,180
through the side door.

750
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:21,380
It was all because my father

751
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,940
wanted to
ingratiate himself with Lord Ling.

752
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,970
Back then, everyone said

753
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,810
Lord Ling might become the crown prince.

754
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,730
The following year,

755
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,660
His Majesty ascended to the throne.

756
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,570
For my father, my marriage really was

757
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,290
a bad deal.

758
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,570
Yet I

759
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,770
truly fell in love with Lord Ling.

760
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,940
Even so,

761
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,770
Rou never blamed me.

762
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,290
She was still so nice to me.

763
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,700
She shouldn't have died.

764
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,620
Someone like her

765
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,860
should have lived in peace all her life

766
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,490
with longevity.

767
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,140
It was all because of her father

768
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,620
and elder brother.

769
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,770
Why did they have to rebel?

770
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,620
Having such a consort

771
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,140
whose father and brother tried to rebel

772
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:25,180
and whose family was exterminated,

773
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,490
Lord Ling

774
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,970
would get in deep trouble.

775
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,700
As long as she remained his consort,

776
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,380
he would be restless,

777
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,530
tossing and turning at night.

778
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,530
Although he stayed away from the court

779
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,050
and retreated deep into the mountains,

780
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,180
His Majesty wouldn't give him peace.

781
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,290
He has always been tender-hearted.

782
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,380
He wouldn't divorce Rou,

783
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,660
let alone killing her.

784
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,730
So...

785
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,100
I decided to do it for him.

786
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,490
As long as she's dead,

787
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,420
he would be safe.

788
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,180
Anyway,

789
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,210
Rou didn't even like him.

790
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,340
She didn't care

791
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,140
for a joint burial with him after death.

792
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,340
Then let me have it.

793
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,810
Let me be his consort.

794
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:22,660
Let me be with him

795
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,570
to share the same quilt in life

796
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,770
and the same grave in death.

797
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,140
I failed Rou

798
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,420
and you and Shaoyao.

799
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,010
In this life,

800
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,290
I have also let Lord Ling down.

801
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,730
I cannot grow old with him anymore.

802
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,210
Xi,

803
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,940
kill me.

804
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,530
You saved Shaoyao's life.

805
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,210
I'll spare your life in return.

806
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,290
But in the rest of your life,

807
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,140
you're not leaving this place again.

808
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,340
Why did my brother leave so suddenly?

809
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,140
When will he come back?

810
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Your brother must have gone

811
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,050
to take care of something.

812
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,660
He'll return once he's done.

813
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,700
When I passed by earlier,

814
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,250
I think I saw that little fool.

815
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,100
What are you hiding from?

816
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,700
He doesn't want to see me.

817
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,210
He even told me to leave last time.

818
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,530
You didn't see her clearly, did you?

819
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,050
How come I didn't see her?

820
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,340
Madam,

821
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,380
the lady is here.

822
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,250
Xian is here again?

823
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:35,860
Come on,

824
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,180
let's go greet her.

825
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,570
Not Madam Xian.

826
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,290
It's...

827
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,380
Madam Jing.

828
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,700
She headed straight

829
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,340
for Madam Hua's room.

830
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,490
I didn't sleep all night.

831
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,290
I'm seeing stars now.

832
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,290
Huilan, Yingzhen,

833
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,570
you two should go without me.

834
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,810
I really can't walk anymore.

835
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
How strange!

836
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:58,730
Jin'e,

837
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,530
I've never seen you afraid of anyone.

838
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,100
How come as soon as Hua Jing arrives,

839
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,530
you start feeling dizzy

840
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,620
and pretend to be sick?

841
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,530
I've never been afraid of anyone!

842
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,210
Hua Jing is nothing to me.

843
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,180
She's just like

844
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,530
a toad landing on my foot,

845
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,420
disgusting.

846
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,250
In my opinion,

847
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,490
neither of you should go.

848
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:17,810
Let's cover our ears

849
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,660
and pretend to know nothing.

850
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,940
Out of sight,

851
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,140
out of mind.

852
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,210
Mother.

853
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,050
Look

854
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,140
what I've brought you!

855
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,570
You can come here without a gift.

856
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,620
You shouldn't have wasted the money.

857
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,490
Mother,

858
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,620
[Hua Jing, the eldest daughter]
I can still afford

859
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,530
to buy you a gift.

860
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,620
Please try

861
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,340
the tea.

862
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,690
Chengzu asked a friend

863
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,530
to bring it back from Jianzhou

864
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,690
specially for you.

865
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,570
This is from him?

866
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,170
How has he been treating you lately?

867
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,420
With so many people
and so much going on in his family,

868
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,300
he is bound to be crabby.

869
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,940
But he has been good to me.

870
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,900
It's just...

871
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,010
I'm thinking

872
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,650
that I'm getting old now.

873
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,090
Over the years, I have only

874
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:11,940
given Chengzu one son.

875
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,260
It's time to find him

876
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,300
a young and caring concubine

877
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
who can take care of him

878
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,300
and also share some of my burdens.

879
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,260
Perhaps it will please him

880
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,050
and he'll be less crabby.

881
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,260
Aren't there enough concubines
in his household already?

882
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:27,970
None of those can be trusted.

883
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,010
They're not on my side.

884
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,650
Mother,

885
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,340
I would like to ask you

886
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,490
for one person.

887
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:38,380
No.

888
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,690
Mother,

889
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:43,090
I haven't even mentioned the name yet.

890
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:45,820
I don't want

891
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:46,820
any of those maids by your side.

892
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,170
I want Fudong.

893
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:50,490
I heard she has
excellent cooking skills.

894
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,460
A few days ago,

895
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,130
Chengzu saw her in the shop.

896
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,970
He said she looks good

897
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,170
and works efficiently.

898
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,380
I'm thinking,

899
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,780
if...

900
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,900
Forget about it.

901
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,420
Mother,

902
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,690
why are you rejecting so firmly?

903
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,900
She's just a maid.

904
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,010
She's Zhi's maid.

905
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,300
Mother,

906
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,740
I thought it was something serious.

907
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,900
You

908
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,420
are still in good health.

909
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,690
Everything in this household

910
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,420
is under your control.

911
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,050
Just give Fudong

912
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,820
to me.

913
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,340
So Chengzu will be pleased.

914
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,460
That way,

915
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,900
your daughter's future life

916
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,010
may be a bit better.

917
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,820
Mother...

918
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,460
You actually thought

919
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,050
of letting your niece's maid

920
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,900
be your husband's concubine.

921
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,740
So ridiculous.

922
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,740
Can't believe you even thought of that.

923
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,650
She is just a maid!

924
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
We bought her with a dozen guan

925
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,490
and I found that expensive.

926
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,650
I can't believe
you won't let me have her!

927
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,490
After all is said and done,

928
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,340
it seems that you only like Zhi now.

929
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,530
As for me, your daughter,

930
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,650
you don't care about me at all!

931
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,530
If I don't care about you,

932
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,940
how come

933
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,340
I never missed a letter from you?

934
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,010
The money I saved,

935
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,300
who did it all go to?

936
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,050
How much could there possibly be?

937
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,900
I still get beaten by Chengzu.

938
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,380
I came all the way here

939
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,570
to ask you for a maid.

940
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,570
But you're unwilling to give me one.

941
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,170
And you said you care about me?

942
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,260
Maybe today,

943
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,940
you want me to get back

944
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,780
and endure another harsh beating!

945
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,740
She's breaking my heart.

946
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,010
Madam Jing,

947
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,340
please don't say that.

948
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,170
Madam Hua is deeply concerned about you.

949
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,130
Remembering your frail health
since childhood,

950
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,170
she's always extra caring for you...

951
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,740
You should stop talking!

952
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,570
For whom have I suffered?

953
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,260
Was it not for the Hua Family?

954
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,340
If we hadn't lost power,

955
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,650
could I have been bullied

956
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,690
by the entire Song Family?

957
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,380
Now, I'm living

958
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,460
like a walking dead!

959
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,970
Has the Hua Family brought you down?

960
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,530
From childhood,
you lacked nothing in food or clothes

961
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,610
and enjoyed the family's honor.

962
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,130
So now, you should
suffer the hardship for the family!

963
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,490
When we were suffering,

964
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,740
did we ever trouble her?

965
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,460
Did I not tell the others

966
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,010
to leave her alone?

967
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:03,970
Yes, you did.

968
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,300
We've only been back for a short while.

969
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:09,610
And now you're here

970
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,050
asking for both money and people.

971
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,130
Mother,

972
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,130
you're so cruel!

973
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,970
You made it sound like

974
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,010
that I'm an awful person!

975
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,170
Never mind.

976
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,260
I'll go back to the Song Family now.

977
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,130
Even if they beat me to death,

978
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,260
I'd deserve it.

979
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,460
Leave!

980
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,220
Madam, please calm down!

981
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,170
Madam.

982
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,740
Madam,

983
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,860
please, don't get agitated.

984
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,820
How did I give birth to such a person?

985
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,740
Madam...

986
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,970
Why is Madam Jing here?

987
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,820
Aunt Jing.

988
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,260
An unmarried girl is indeed precious.

989
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:08,860
Even the maids by her side
have become treasure.

990
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,940
I, who am married off,

991
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,650
have become nothing.

992
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,340
Aunt, why did you say that?

993
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,050
I wonder

994
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,690
how long you can remain in glory.

995
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,130
Madam Jing,

996
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,900
how has Lady Zhi offended you

997
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,900
to make you say such unpleasant words?

998
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,090
Do you have the right to speak here?

999
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,490
Didn't your lady teach you

1000
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,420
what manners are?

1001
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,130
We value reason.

1002
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,420
You can't hit her.

1003
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,530
What was that nonsense?

1004
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:55,610
Aunt Wu.

1005
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,130
Shaoyao,

1006
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,090
you've come back just in time.

1007
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,860
Go and cheer up Madam Hua.

1008
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,610
Madam Jing paid us a visit,

1009
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,170
and now Madam Hua has stopped eating.

1010
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,490
I'll go right now.

1011
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,050
I will go have a look too.

1012
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,300
Zhi, you better not go.

1013
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,740
Speaking of which,

1014
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,690
what happened today is related to you.

1015
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,530
Me?

1016
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,530
Madam...

1017
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,170
You used to be

1018
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,380
so nice to Madam Jing.

1019
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,570
Everything was fine when she lived here.

1020
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,940
How come
after marring into the Song Family,

1021
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:24,570
she became like a different person?

1022
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,860
Ever since

1023
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,940
our family faced troubles,

1024
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,530
she has become like this.

1025
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,780
Since she was young,

1026
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,420
I cherished and protected her
as much as I could.

1027
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,300
Unlike the others, she was spoiled.

1028
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,050
The Song Family
doesn't have a high status.

1029
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,740
But she insisted on this marriage.

1030
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,740
I was thinking

1031
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,610
that with an extremely rich dowry

1032
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,260
and for the sake of our social status,

1033
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,570
her husband
wouldn't dare to mistreat her.

1034
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,090
Perhaps,

1035
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,650
life hasn't been easy for her either.

1036
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,690
Maybe,

1037
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,940
what happened to our family

1038
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,220
has affected her.

1039
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,220
At the Song's,

1040
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,820
in front of all her sisters-in-laws
and the elders,

1041
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,820
maybe she feels unconfident,

1042
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,090
so she came up

1043
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,260
with an idea like that.

1044
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,050
But she was just asking for trouble.

1045
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,530
If Fudong really became
Song Chengzu's concubine,

1046
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,010
he would only

1047
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,490
treat Jing worse.

1048
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,170
Grandmother.

1049
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,860
Shaoyao is here.

1050
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,860
Grandmother,

1051
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,740
I brought you

1052
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,130
freshly roasted sugar-coated chestnuts.

1053
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:28,340
They're still warm.

1054
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:29,690
Be careful. They're hot!

1055
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,460
I'll peel them for you.

1056
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,740
I've learned a new way.

1057
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,650
Be careful!

1058
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:47,820
Delicious.

1059
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,050
Very sweet.

1060
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:49,820
Delicious.

1061
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,610
You try some too.

1062
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:52,650
This is the best kind...

1063
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:54,820
Madam Jing

1064
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,220
truly doesn't care about others.

1065
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,780
With both of her and
her husband's temperaments,

1066
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,420
if Fudong really becomes a concubine,

1067
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,650
they'd probably

1068
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,860
skin her alive!

1069
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:05,940
Fudong?

1070
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,220
Young Lady,

1071
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:10,610
I've heard it all.

1072
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,300
Let alone being a concubine
of Song Chengzu,

1073
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,170
even if it's his legitimate wife,

1074
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,490
I wouldn't take on the role.
