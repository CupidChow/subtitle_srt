00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,390
<font size="20">that was owned by foreign merchants.</font>

153
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,630
<font size="20">About a dozen shopkeepers</font>

154
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,830
<font size="20">said that</font>

155
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,720
<font size="20">before they entered Daqing,</font>

156
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,600
<font size="20">someone asked them</font>

157
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,920
<font size="20">to bring things
into the Imperial Capital.</font>

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,240
<font size="20">But soon after,
Haoyue came and bought those things.</font>

159
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,480
<font size="20">What did she buy?</font>

160
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,390
<font size="20">Most were ritual implements.</font>

161
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,070
<font size="20">Their shapes were somewhat peculiar,</font>

162
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,560
<font size="20">but none of them
were of real practical use.</font>

163
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,950
<font size="20">She also bought more than a dozen types
of Western Regions' medicinal herbs.</font>

164
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,750
<font size="20">Physician Zhang has looked
into the herbs,</font>

165
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,830
<font size="20">but none of them had a particular use.</font>

166
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,270
<font size="20">Except for one thing.</font>

167
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,680
<font size="20">Some strange red powder.</font>

168
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,680
<font size="20">Don't know what it is used for.</font>

169
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,510
<font size="20">Physician Zhang couldn't recognize it,</font>

170
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,870
<font size="20">so I had a death row inmate try it.</font>

171
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,270
<font size="20">Nothing happened to him.</font>

172
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,720
<font size="20">Take this</font>

173
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,320
<font size="20">and go to a person.</font>

174
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:44,750
<font size="20">They won't come back.</font>

175
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,630
<font size="20">They will come back.</font>

176
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,150
<font size="20">They won't come back.</font>

177
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,120
<font size="20">They won't come back.</font>

178
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,120
<font size="20">They will come back.</font>

179
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,550
<font size="20">Well, what happened</font>

180
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,550
<font size="20">to her?</font>

181
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,720
<font size="20">They won't come back.</font>

182
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,840
<font size="20">She has been like this</font>

183
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,750
<font size="20">since what happened to
Young Lady and Mr. Yan that day.</font>

184
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,910
<font size="20">As soon as night falls,</font>

185
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,440
<font size="20">she will ask the moon</font>

186
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,510
<font size="20">when Yanxi and Zhi</font>

187
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,750
<font size="20">will come back.</font>

188
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,000
<font size="20">And in the daytime,</font>

189
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,390
<font size="20">she just stands there,</font>

190
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,750
<font size="20">not eating or sleeping.</font>

191
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,030
<font size="20">They will come back.</font>

192
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,320
<font size="20">Let's go.</font>

193
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,080
<font size="20">They won't come back.</font>

194
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,670
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

195
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,200
<font size="20">Your brother sent me.</font>

196
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,360
<font size="20">Really?</font>

197
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,120
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

198
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:24,910
<font size="20">He said</font>

199
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,270
<font size="20">Shaoyao was the smartest.</font>

200
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,630
<font size="20">When it comes to
rare and peculiar medicines,</font>

201
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,670
<font size="20">you are the only one
who can recognize them.</font>

202
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,720
<font size="20">Take a look at this.</font>

203
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,150
<font size="20">This medicine,</font>

204
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,670
<font size="20">I can't recognize it, either.</font>

205
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,080
<font size="20">If I can recognize it,</font>

206
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,960
<font size="20">does it mean I could help Yanxi and Zhi?</font>

207
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:50,960
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

208
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,200
<font size="20">If you can recognize this medicine,</font>

209
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,240
<font size="20">perhaps your brother and Miss Zhi</font>

210
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,030
<font size="20">can come back.</font>

211
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,320
<font size="20">I see.</font>

212
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,510
<font size="20">Don't leave.</font>

213
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,200
<font size="20">I'll go back to Lord Ling's Mansion
and check the medicine books.</font>

214
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,240
<font size="20">Why did you lie to her?</font>

215
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,960
<font size="20">It wasn't lying.</font>

216
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,480
<font size="20">I was just giving her some hope.</font>

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,150
<font size="20">She can hold onto that.</font>

218
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,120
<font size="20">Well...</font>

219
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
<font size="20">Don't feel so sad.</font>

220
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
<font size="20">I... I've asked around.</font>

221
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,030
<font size="20">Miss Zhi is doing quite well
in the Palace.</font>

222
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,790
<font size="20">Don't cry.</font>

223
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,440
<font size="20">Haoyue has been secluding herself
to refine pills these past few days.</font>

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
<font size="20">What ingredients is she using?</font>

225
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,030
<font size="20">And what kind of pills is she refining?</font>

226
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,510
<font size="20">It's last night's
astronomical observation record.</font>

227
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,720
<font size="20">Ms. Haining asked you
to transcribe it into the report,</font>

228
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,200
<font size="20">so I can present it to Master Haoyue.</font>

229
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,200
<font size="20">Wait a moment.</font>

230
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,480
<font size="20">There's a mistake here.</font>

231
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,630
<font size="20">Where is it?</font>

232
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,080
<font size="20">On the day of Yisi,</font>

233
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,000
<font size="20">two moons appeared at the same time
in the southwest.</font>

234
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,200
<font size="20">Yesterday was the fourth day
of the lunar month.</font>

235
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,870
<font size="20">After sunset,
the new moon rose from the southwest.</font>

236
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,390
<font size="20">The appearance of two moons</font>

237
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,270
<font size="20">must have been an illusion</font>

238
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,670
<font size="20">caused by the blurry clouds.</font>

239
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,390
<font size="20">If you present such a report,</font>

240
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,910
<font size="20">Master Haoyue considers the change
as an inauspicious portent,</font>

241
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,120
<font size="20">and chaos is caused,</font>

242
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,840
<font size="20">there will be serious consequences.</font>

243
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,030
<font size="20">When you transcribe it,</font>

244
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,030
<font size="20">remember to make a correction.</font>

245
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,670
<font size="20">Thank you so much for mentioning this.</font>

246
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,320
<font size="20">[Astronomical Observation Record]</font>

247
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,120
<font size="20">Why was the appearance of two moons</font>

248
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,240
<font size="20">not recorded in the report?</font>

249
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,320
<font size="20">The transcriber Miss Zhi said</font>

250
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,960
<font size="20">the moon didn't change last night.</font>

251
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,200
<font size="20">It was just an illusion
caused by blurry clouds.</font>

252
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,000
<font size="20">She thought it might cause you trouble</font>

253
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,150
<font size="20">if His Majesty noticed that.</font>

254
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
<font size="20">That was why she didn't record it.</font>

255
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,200
<font size="20">Why did she know about astronomy?</font>

256
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,960
<font size="20">Your eyes must become tired now.</font>

257
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,360
<font size="20">How about</font>

258
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,510
<font size="20">we take a rest for a while?</font>

259
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,960
<font size="20">I can't.</font>

260
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,000
<font size="20">The sooner I find it,</font>

261
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,960
<font size="20">the sooner Yanxi and Zhi</font>

262
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,670
<font size="20">can come back.</font>

263
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:10,440
<font size="20">I miss them so much.</font>

264
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,510
<font size="20">It's you.</font>

265
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,480
<font size="20">It surprised me</font>

266
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,840
<font size="20">that you would have a sleepless night.</font>

267
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,960
<font size="20">You do know how to entertain yourself.</font>

268
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,270
<font size="20">You spotted the mistake on the record.</font>

269
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,910
<font size="20">Was it because you sneaked in here</font>

270
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,480
<font size="20">and observed the stars last night?</font>

271
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,320
<font size="20">I can't predict things like you.</font>

272
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,270
<font size="20">Of course, I saw it with my own eyes.</font>

273
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,000
<font size="20">This armillary sphere is identical</font>

274
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,790
<font size="20">to the one in the Seven Stars Mansion.</font>

275
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,200
<font size="20">It must have been made</font>

276
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,270
<font size="20">based on Mr. Mengxi's design.</font>

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,960
<font size="20">You know about Mr. Mengxi?</font>

278
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,390
<font size="20">Should I not know?</font>

279
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,750
<font size="20">He measured the pole star
with an armillary sphere,</font>

280
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,030
<font size="20">and after observation
for over three months,</font>

281
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,870
<font size="20">he drew hundreds of star maps.</font>

282
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,150
<font size="20">I've read all of his notes.</font>

283
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,080
<font size="20">You can read star maps?</font>

284
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,600
<font size="20">No wonder in the daytime,</font>

285
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,320
<font size="20">you noticed the mistake on the record.</font>

286
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,750
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

287
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
<font size="20">There are 1460 stars</font>

288
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,720
<font size="20">on the star map of Su Song.</font>

289
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,510
<font size="20">I remember them all.</font>

290
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,510
<font size="20">You memorize them by rote.</font>

291
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,630
<font size="20">Aren't you tired?</font>

292
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,030
<font size="20">I am interested in it,</font>

293
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,320
<font size="20">so I am willing to learn.</font>

294
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,510
<font size="20">How could it be tiring?</font>

295
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,840
<font size="20">It's just a pity</font>

296
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,390
<font size="20">that I can't travel far and wide
like they do,</font>

297
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,120
<font size="20">chasing the stars and watching the moon.</font>

298
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,030
<font size="20">What about you?</font>

299
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,200
<font size="20">Why are you so proficient
in celestial events?</font>

300
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,150
<font size="20">I was not like you,</font>

301
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,240
<font size="20">who could only learn from books.</font>

302
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,510
<font size="20">Ever since I was a child,</font>

303
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,750
<font size="20">I learned to use
the Star-Orienting Board</font>

304
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,750
<font size="20">from my parents.</font>

305
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,510
<font size="20">During the day, I would observe the sky.</font>

306
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,870
<font size="20">At night, I would observe the moon.</font>

307
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,870
<font size="20">I have seen so many times</font>

308
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,200
<font size="20">when the sea met the sky.</font>

309
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,960
<font size="20">Gradually, I had a grasp on it.</font>

310
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
<font size="20">You've been out to sea?</font>

311
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,030
<font size="20">I grew up on sailing boats.</font>

312
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:23,440
<font size="20">I know everything</font>

313
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,480
<font size="20">about the sky.</font>

314
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,390
<font size="20">When I was young,</font>

315
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,480
<font size="20">I took a ship once</font>

316
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,670
<font size="20">with my grandfather to Qiongzhou.</font>

317
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,000
<font size="20">And I saw the waves at sea.</font>

318
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,480
<font size="20">It was so splendid
that it took my breath away.</font>

319
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,790
<font size="20">The seas in the south</font>

320
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,790
<font size="20">can be considered splendid?</font>

321
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,480
<font size="20">You really should see</font>

322
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,550
<font size="20">the icy sea of my hometown.</font>

323
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,030
<font size="20">The sea is frozen over thousands of li</font>

324
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,030
<font size="20">and meets with the sky.</font>

325
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,000
<font size="20">When the waves rise,</font>

326
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,870
<font size="20">even the most solid ice
would break apart.</font>

327
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,790
<font size="20">It seems like the sky and the earth
are shattered into pieces.</font>

328
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,840
<font size="20">When the sun goes down,</font>

329
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,150
<font size="20">the sky and the earth are crystal clear</font>

330
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,670
<font size="20">and it looks like a crystal world.</font>

331
00:15:59,200 --> 00:15:59,870
<font size="20">Unfortunately,</font>

332
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,630
<font size="20">I don't get to see it anymore.</font>

333
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,390
<font size="20">The icy sea?</font>

334
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,910
<font size="20">Ice sea only exists on the land
where is extremely cold.</font>

335
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,550
<font size="20">You come from the northern land.</font>

336
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,960
<font size="20">Shut up.</font>

337
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,670
<font size="20">Mind your words.</font>

338
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,790
<font size="20">You are already</font>

339
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,510
<font size="20">miserable enough now.</font>

340
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,320
<font size="20">You'd better mind your own business.</font>

341
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,150
<font size="20">You are now a hostage.</font>

342

346
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,630
<font size="20">or his spy, right?</font>

347
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,960
<font size="20">It's a lunar corona.</font>

<font size="20">To pray for rain,</font>

357

00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,440
<font size="20">Shaoyao, where are you?</font>

461
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,270
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

462
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,000
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

463
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,400
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

464
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,960
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

465
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,070
<font size="20">Are you alright?</font>

466
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,270
<font size="20">Why didn't you run outside?</font>

467
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,750
<font size="20">I... I'm scared...</font>

468
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,350
<font size="20">Come on, I'll get you out of here.</font>

469
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,070
<font size="20">Shaoyao, go!</font>

470
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,000
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

471
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,640
<font size="20">Get out of here!</font>

472
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,440
<font size="20">Get out of here!</font>

473
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,790
<font size="20">Get out of here!</font>

474
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,960
<font size="20">Get out of here!</font>

475
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,590
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

476
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,160
<font size="20">Get out of here!</font>

477
00:27:52,550 --> 00:28:03,400
<font size="20">Mother!</font>

478
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,750
<font size="20">Shen Huan.</font>

479
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,000
<font size="20">I couldn't save my mother in that fire,</font>

480
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,310
<font size="20">but now,</font>

481
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,030
<font size="20">I can save you.</font>

482
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,270
<font size="20">Is there anyone still inside?</font>

483
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,110
<font size="20">- Yes.
- Yes.</font>

484
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,000
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

485
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,510
<font size="20">I was so useless.</font>

486
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,270
<font size="20">I wanted to play the hero</font>

487
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,160
<font size="20">and go in there to save you.</font>

488
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,750
<font size="20">- No.
- But...</font>

489
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,680
<font size="20">You were incredibly brave</font>

490
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,310
<font size="20">and amazing.</font>

491
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,750
<font size="20">The fire was so huge,</font>

492
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,240
<font size="20">but you rushed in to save me</font>

493
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,070
<font size="20">without hesitation.</font>

494
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,680
<font size="20">I'm glad you said that.</font>

495
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:14,790
<font size="20">Shen Huan.</font>

496
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,070
<font size="20">I've always thought</font>

497
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,030
<font size="20">that I was terrified of fire</font>

498
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,830
<font size="20">because it took my mother away.</font>

499
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,680
<font size="20">All these years,</font>

500
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,720
<font size="20">I couldn't even bear to look at it.</font>

501
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:28,920
<font size="20">But</font>

502
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,720
<font size="20">just now</font>

503
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,880
<font size="20">when you were lying on the ground</font>

504
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,070
<font size="20">covered in fire,</font>

505
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,070
<font size="20">I thought</font>

506
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,680
<font size="20">the most terrifying thing</font>

507
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,200
<font size="20">was that you would also disappear.</font>

508
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,750
<font size="20">My affection for you</font>

509
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,160
<font size="20">overcame my fear.</font>

510
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,590
<font size="20">I seemed to have gotten over a hurdle</font>

511
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,240
<font size="20">and over a mountain.</font>

512
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,790
<font size="20">You like me?</font>

513
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,160
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

514
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,270
<font size="20">I like you so much.</font>

515
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,550
<font size="20">I...</font>

516
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,440
<font size="20">I am all dizzy now.</font>

517
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,440
<font size="20">You'd better not lie to me.</font>

518
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,590
<font size="20">I mean every word of it.</font>

519
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,440
<font size="20">Love story.</font>

520
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,350
<font size="20">Stop it.</font>

521
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,200
<font size="20">Where should we go now?</font>

522
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,160
<font size="20">Go back to the Security Bureau?</font>

523
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,240
<font size="20">We can't.</font>

524
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,790
<font size="20">His Majesty has already sent men</font>

525
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,640
<font size="20">to spy on the Bureau.</font>

526
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,790
<font size="20">Let's go to the Hua Mansion.</font>

527
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,790
<font size="20">Giddy up.</font>

528
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,310
<font size="20">Illuminate one's bright virtues</font>

529
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,750
<font size="20">and cultivate the populace.</font>

530
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,680
<font size="20">Jian.</font>

531
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,000
<font size="20">Why are you reciting like this?</font>

532
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,880
<font size="20">Yanxi told me</font>

533
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,510
<font size="20">that I wouldn't feel sleepy this way</font>

534
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,240
<font size="20">and also could strengthen my body.</font>

535
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,720
<font size="20">Good.</font>

536
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,310
<font size="20">Hurry.</font>

537
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,920
<font size="20">What happened?</font>

538
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,510
<font size="20">Close the door.</font>

539
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:18,920
<font size="20">Close the door.</font>

540
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,270
<font size="20">What happened really?</font>

541
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,270
<font size="20">Come on.</font>

542
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,070
<font size="20">Get them settled.</font>

543
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,750
<font size="20">The three of them</font>

544
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:24,680
<font size="20">are out of strength.</font>

545
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,270
<font size="20">Go.</font>

546
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,110
<font size="20">Well,</font>

547
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,070
<font size="20">Miss Shaoyao.</font>

548
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,590
<font size="20">What happened?</font>

549
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,830
<font size="20">Did you set the house on fire</font>

550
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,960
<font size="20">when making medicine?</font>

551
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,680
<font size="20">No.</font>

552
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,350
<font size="20">When I was making medicine,</font>

553
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,400
<font size="20">I was knocked out by someone.</font>

554
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,200
<font size="20">And then,</font>

555
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,240
<font size="20">I woke up in the fire.</font>

556
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,400
<font size="20">That powder</font>

557
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,480
<font size="20">is from red stones,</font>

558
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,350
<font size="20">which is non-toxic.</font>

559
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,110
<font size="20">But</font>

560
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
<font size="20">after being calcined with realgar,</font>

561
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,550
<font size="20">it would turn into
highly toxic green stones.</font>

562
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,510
<font size="20">Highly toxic?</font>

563
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,480
<font size="20">Today is the Longevity Festival.</font>

564
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,270
<font size="20">His Majesty has prepared a banquet
in the Palace.</font>

565
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,880
<font size="20">This is bad.</font>

566
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,960
<font size="20">The medicinal powder is from the Palace?</font>

567
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,920
<font size="20">Then you must hurry there
to report this.</font>

568
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,000
<font size="20">We are just nobodies,</font>

569
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,270
<font size="20">so we don't have the opportunity
to meet His Majesty.</font>

570
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,160
<font size="20">But...</font>

571
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,920
<font size="20">The Commander is still locked up
in the Shen Pavilion.</font>

572
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,510
<font size="20">I mean...</font>

573
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,960
<font size="20">What should we do?</font>

574
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,640
<font size="20">What about the Empress Dowager?</font>

575
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,680
<font size="20">Can you get to meet her?</font>

576
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,270
<font size="20">She is in the Shanhua Temple.</font>

577
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,510
<font size="20">It is heavily guarded there.</font>

578
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,640
<font size="20">We can't get in.</font>

579
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,070
<font size="20">I'll go with you.</font>

580
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,240
<font size="20">Grandmother</font>

581
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,590
<font size="20">knows who I am.</font>

582
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,550
<font size="20">Jian,</font>

583
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,640
<font size="20">don't be afraid.</font>

584
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:35,350
<font size="20">I'll go with you.</font>

585
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,350
<font size="20">I will go with you
to see your grandmother.</font>

586
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,720
<font size="20">I'll come along too.</font>

587
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,640
<font size="20">You need to rest.</font>

588
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,720
<font size="20">Go now.</font>

589
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,510
<font size="20">I'll take care of Huan.</font>

590
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,680
<font size="20">Let's go, Shaoyao.</font>

591
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,310
<font size="20">Let's go.</font>

592
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,000
<font size="20">Come on.</font>

593
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,400
<font size="20">Father.</font>

594
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,670
<font size="20">The wind is getting stronger.</font>

595
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,840
<font size="20">Please keep warm.</font>

596
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,710
<font size="20">I am not cold.</font>

597
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,230
<font size="20">I am glad that you concern me.</font>

598
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,590
<font size="20">Father.</font>

599
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,590
<font size="20">I will toast to you.</font>

600
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,480
<font size="20">Changqing.</font>

601
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,630
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

602
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,800
<font size="20">How is Yanxi doing?</font>

603
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,030
<font size="20">Your Majesty.</font>

604
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:56,840
<font size="20">How about</font>

605
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,440
<font size="20">I bring him here to keep you company?</font>

606
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,480
<font size="20">Do you want him</font>

607
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:02,670
<font size="20">to cause a scene again</font>

608
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:03,440
<font size="20">at my Longevity Festival?</font>

609
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,920
<font size="20">Let him reflect</font>

610
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,960
<font size="20">in the Shen Pavilion.</font>

611
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,000
<font size="20">As you command.</font>

612
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,630
<font size="20">Stop there! Who are you?</font>

613
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,360
<font size="20">Chen Qing and Zheng Hu
from the Security Bureau.</font>

614
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:27,960
<font size="20">We want to see the Empress Dowager.</font>

615
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
<font size="20">The Empress Dowager is on a retreat now.</font>

616
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,550
<font size="20">She cannot be disturbed</font>

617
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,360
<font size="20">by anyone.</font>

618
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,630
<font size="20">If you do want to see her,</font>

619
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:34,070
<font size="20">let the Commander come in person.</font>

620
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,480
<font size="20">I recognize you.</font>

621
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,550
<font size="20">You used to serve at Gongchen Gate,</font>

622
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,190
<font size="20">didn't you?</font>

623
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,190
<font size="20">I am Gu Yanzhao, the Sixth Prince.</font>

624
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,590
<font size="20">I'm here to send greetings
to my grandmother.</font>

625
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,070
<font size="20">Greetings, Your Highness.</font>

626
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,110
<font size="20">- Greetings, Empress Dowager.
- Greetings, Grandmother.</font>

627
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,800
<font size="20">Zhao.</font>

628
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:07,400
<font size="20">Zhao.</font>

629
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,440
<font size="20">How could you...?</font>

630
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,630
<font size="20">You are still alive.</font>

631
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,670
<font size="20">Grandmother.</font>

632
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,590
<font size="20">I will explain to you later</font>

633
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,510
<font size="20">about what happened.</font>

634
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,230
<font size="20">This lady here has something important</font>

635
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,190
<font size="20">to tell you.</font>

636
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,320
<font size="20">Empress Dowager.</font>

637
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,590
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

638
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,230
<font size="20">Shaoyao.</font>

639
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,510
<font size="20">Child.</font>

640
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,440
<font size="20">You...</font>

641
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,320
<font size="20">Child.</font>

642
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,280
<font size="20">You...</font>

643
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,230
<font size="20">You're Shaoyao, aren't you?</font>

644
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,710
<font size="20">How do you recognize me?</font>

645
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,280
<font size="20">When your mother was still alive,</font>

646
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,030
<font size="20">I had seen you and your mother.</font>

647
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,510
<font size="20">You look just like your mother.</font>

648
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,190
<font size="20">You look like her so much!</font>

649
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:47,920
<font size="20">Child.</font>

650
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,480
<font size="20">Tell me.</font>

651
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,710
<font size="20">What has happened?</font>

652
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,510
<font size="20">His Majesty has set a banquet
in the Palace,</font>

653
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:53,670
<font size="20">but...</font>

654
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,150
<font size="20">The Dubhe Envoy has arrived.</font>

655
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,000
<font size="20">Your Majesty.</font>

656
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,670
<font size="20">The auspicious time is approaching.</font>

657
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,190
<font size="20">You shall begin.</font>

658
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,440
<font size="20">The auspicious time has arrived.</font>

659
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,070
<font size="20">Begin.</font>

660
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,320
<font size="20">Heaven creates the mountains and rivers</font>

661
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,070
<font size="20">to stabilize all quarters.</font>

662
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,150
<font size="20">It bestows food upon the people</font>

663
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,000
<font size="20">with rain and sunshine.</font>

664
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,000
<font size="20">The deities provide for the people.</font>

665
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,920
<font size="20">The officials serve the Emperor.</font>

666
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,920
<font size="20">The officials attend to
agriculture and sericulture.</font>

667
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,800
<font size="20">The deities
control the rain and the sunshine.</font>

668
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,840
<font size="20">Heaven creates the mountains and rivers</font>

669
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,590
<font size="20">to stabilize all quarters.</font>

670
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,070
<font size="20">May the Emperor long live.</font>

671
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,710
<font size="20">May the Emperor long live.</font>

672
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,360
<font size="20">May the Emperor long live.</font>

673
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,400
<font size="20">May the Emperor long live.</font>

674
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,190
<font size="20">You two can make haste.</font>

675
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,030
<font size="20">Take my decree and hurry.</font>

676
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:03,880
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

677
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:07,320
<font size="20">Get the carriage ready.</font>

678
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,230
<font size="20">I am going back to the Palace.</font>

679
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,000
<font size="20">You looked dumbfounded.</font>

680
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,550
<font size="20">Are you wondering</font>

681
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,280
<font size="20">why those fire caltrops of yours</font>

682
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,670
<font size="20">have all lost their effectiveness?</font>

683
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,320
<font size="20">You've known all along?</font>

684
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,880
<font size="20">Daqing is my realm.</font>

685
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,150
<font size="20">There's nothing</font>

686
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,230
<font size="20">that can be hidden from me.</font>

687
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,000
<font size="20">You have filled the inside</font>

688
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,150
<font size="20">with saltpeter, sulfur</font>

689
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,110
<font size="20">iron filings, and fire caltrops.</font>

690
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,360
<font size="20">Once ignited,</font>

691
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,800
<font size="20">it will burst into flames.</font>

692
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,920
<font size="20">The power can pierce the skin
and penetrate the armor,</font>

693
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,880
<font size="20">not to mention the flesh and blood.</font>

694
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,150
<font size="20">Even the war chariots</font>

695
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,280
<font size="20">aren't strong enough to withstand them.</font>

696
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,550
<font size="20">Back then,</font>

697
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,070
<font size="20">we had a war with the Zhao Empire.</font>

698
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,360
<font size="20">In the battle by Kushui River,</font>

699
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,920
<font size="20">they used fire caltrops against us</font>

700
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,800
<font size="20">and caused heavy casualties.</font>

701
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,670
<font size="20">Over half my soldiers died.</font>

702
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,670
<font size="20">No matter how many years pass,</font>

703
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,800
<font size="20">I will not forget these fire caltrops.</font>

704
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,440
<font size="20">Under the pretext
of alchemical practices,</font>

705
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,110
<font size="20">you brought these materials blatantly</font>

706
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,150
<font size="20">into the Palace</font>

707
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,760
<font size="20">and made gunpowder.</font>

708
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,360
<font size="20">Even if the Security Bureau</font>

709
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,280
<font size="20">hasn't removed your fire caltrops,</font>

710
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,880
<font size="20">I would never allow you</font>

711
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,510
<font size="20">to ignite it tonight.</font>

712
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:16,190
<font size="20">He knew the Security Bureau Guards</font>

713
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,070
<font size="20">had removed the gunpowder.</font>

714
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,090
<font size="20">♪Not a patch of land is wasted♪</font>

715

719

<font size="20">♪But the taste is of spring♪</font>

720
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:08,690
<font size="20">♪Ah, in the early spring,
we pick the tea leaves♪</font>

721
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:16,180
<font size="20">♪Ah, let's enjoy
the abundant spring together♪</font>
