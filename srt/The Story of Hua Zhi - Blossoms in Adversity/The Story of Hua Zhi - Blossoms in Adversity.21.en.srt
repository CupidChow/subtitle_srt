It's so late.
How come you're not resting?

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,080
I'll go check the front gate

208
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,390
and make sure it's locked properly.

209
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,120
After that, I'll go to bed.

haven't caused us any trouble
these past few days.

But I actually

215
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,670
feel uneasy about it.

219
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,550
that her lips even turned pale.

220
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,150
Now, well,

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,600
passed away because of them.

223
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,550
If they try to give us more trouble,

224
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,240
I'm afraid

225
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,840
Zhi may not be able

226
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,870
to withstand it.

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,440
please help us.

Why don't you

230
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,200
silence them too?

231
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,440
Alright, this is enough.

232
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,870
I'm just worried

233
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,240
that they'll bring more disasters
to our family.

how big of a grudge must it be

If I were you,

343
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,480
I would only

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,320
be even crueler than you.

345
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,240
How so?

346
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,000
Those stories of the Gu Family,

00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,480
whether it's known

348
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,150
or unknown to people,

349
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,000
which one wasn't more twisted than this?

350
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,480
The imperial house

351
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,440
looks resplendent on the outside,

352
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,440
but on the inside,
it's built upon corpses.

353
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,390
So, what you've done

354
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,630
is nothing to me.

355
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,960
My grandfather killed two of his sons.

356
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,080
My uncle killed three of his brothers.

357

My father

358
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,960
killed my mother.

359
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,150
I carry such blood in my veins.

360
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,000

at the Lantern Festival that year

took away my mother.

364
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,080

365
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,840
Because of that fire,

366
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,000
she became intellectually challenged.

367
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,480
How ludicrous.

368
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,960
It was him who turned Shaoyao into this,

369
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,870
yet he is ashamed of her now.

370
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,600
Actually, sometimes,

371
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,550
I envy you.

372
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,750
Though your family is noisy,

373
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,440
it's also lively.

374
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,000
You have a real family.

375
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,630
Unlike those from the imperial palace...

376
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,600
Well, it's better not to mention them.

377
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Shaoyao has already taken this place

378
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,790
as her own home.

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,080
If you like,

380
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,870
you can consider here your home as well.

381
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,910
From now on, wherever you are

382
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,150
will be my home.

383
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
Are you free tonight?

384
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,440
Let's go for a walk.

385
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,080
Anytime.

386
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,200
How about now?

387
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,510
Not just yet.

388
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,630
I still have

389
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,870
something important to do.

390
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,550
Do you really think

391
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,840
that I don't hate her?

392
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,440
I hate her too.

393
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,270
She and that shopkeeper

394
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,440
committed such an awful deed.

395
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,550
Who doesn't know about it?

396
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,000
We can't just gloss over it.

397
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:12,750
Speaking of which,

398
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,480
she's actually from my quarters!

399
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,070
Talking about this

400
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,400
is meaningless now.

401
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,310
With such an incident happening,

402
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,640
if Father and our husbands

403
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,030
were home,

404
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,310
according to the rule,

405
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,030
they would have her beaten to death

406
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,200
or at least sell her off.

407
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,750
Exactly!

408
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,440
If not,

409
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
with the way these concubines behave,

410
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,200
considering the large number of maids
in the house,

411
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,750
they could pull

412
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,550
off all sorts of things.

413
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,000
If that's the case,

414
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,480
what rules do we still have
in this family?

415
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,030
Madam.

416
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,070
Ms. Qin and us

417
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,000
are different.

418
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,270
Yes, indeed.

419
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,160
She was never intelligent

420
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,590
and always acted rashly.

421
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,720
Otherwise...

422
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Let's all stop talking about it.

423
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,400
If we hadn't driven her out
at the beginning,

424
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,830
this mess would not have happened.

425
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,070
So it was my fault?

426
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:00,880
Huilan,

427
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,200
I certainly didn't say that.

428
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,270
You didn't say that out loud.

429
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,920
But that's what you meant.

430
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,270
Aunties,

431
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,070
I have something to say.

432
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,830
Yingchun,

433
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,030
get everyone here.

434
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:23,830
Alright.

435
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
About Ms. Qin,

436
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,590
I believe after hearing

437
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,510
what Hua Jing claimed,

438
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,070
you all have some questions.

439
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,960
Therefore, in this household,

440
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,030
there are rumors everywhere.

441
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,480
Today, as everyone is present,

442
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,720
I think

443
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,200
we should just talk openly.

444
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,920
Every word of mine will be true.

445
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,720
You can also

446
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,110
confront Ms. Qin face to face.

447
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,750
Zhi,

448
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,440
please don't do this.

449
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:50,960
Zhi,

450
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,830
you're a young lady.

451
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,960
You shouldn't
be talking about such things.

452
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,110
So, the cause of this incident

453
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,510
was the fact

454
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,550
that Hua Jing tried to take Fudong away
but failed.

455
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
She harbored resentment towards me.

456
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,070
She colluded

457
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,480
with that animal, Yang,

458
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,830
and set Ms. Qin up.

459
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,110
Ms. Qin was threatened by both of them.

460
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,480
They made her sneak into my room

461
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,680
to take one personal belonging of mine,

462
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,790
so they could destroy me.

463
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,790
However, Ms. Qin
is too kind-hearted to do that.

464
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,270
When she was in my room,

465
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,880
she could have stolen my thing

466
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,270
to protect herself,

467
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,550
but she didn't.

468
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,400
Speaking of which,

469
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,790
I owe Ms. Qin a favor.

470
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Zhi,

471
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,790
don't say this.

472
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,720
Back then, Liang sold Boyu out.

473
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,270
But was it Boyu's fault?

474
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,030
When we moved to Zihuang Residence,

475
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,030
so many people

476
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,350
ran away with our belongings.

477
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,240
Was that our fault?

478
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,830
Back in this mansion,

479
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,480
Li Gui bullied everyone

480
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,000
and you paid money for peace.

481
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,350
Was that our fault?

482
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,550
The young ladies' lives do matter,

483
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,310
but are the lives of married women
not important at all?

484
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,550
The maids are pitiful indeed,

485
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,070
but aren't the concubines
pitiful as well?

486
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,480
I mean,

487
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,550
as women,

488
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,720
why can't we
treat each other with kindness?

489
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,640
Do we have

490
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,590
to let her die?

491
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,270
What should we do then?

492
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,640
We can't

493
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,310
keep her here, can we?

494
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,640
Yingchun.

Today, in the presence of all of you,

497
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,160
I, head of the Hua Family,

498
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,110
will divorce Ms. Qin
on behalf of Uncle Pingyan.

499
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,350
From now on,

500
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,200
Ms. Qin

501
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,640
will no longer
be Uncle Pingyan's concubine.

502
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,510
Take this.

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,310
Qin Ergui?

Who is Qin Ergui?

507
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Isn't Qin Ergui

508
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,160
your maiden name?

509
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,200
You've been a concubine for so long

510
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,200
that you've even
forgotten your own name.

511
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,920
The lady is calling you!

512
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,070
Although you are
no longer a concubine of our family,

513
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,200
you are still the mother

514
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,310
of Hua Qin and Boli.

515
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,000
You and all of us here

516
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,070
have moved from the mansion

and then back here together.

519
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,160
Together, we have been

520
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,030
through so much.

521
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,590
To say that we endured hardship
and faced life and death together

522
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,350
won't be exaggerated.

523
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,030
In this world,

524
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,510
if you want to find someone
closer to you than us,

525
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,590
I'm afraid you can't.

526

Currently,
the family business is short-handed.

527
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,920
I would like to ask you to stay

528
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,030
and help manage the shop.

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,030
You will no longer receive an allowance,

530
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,070
but there'll be a monthly salary
and dividends.

531
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,480
Even though you are no longer

532
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,510
Uncle Pingyan's concubine,

533
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,830
you are still a part of the Hua Family.

from now on,

Zhi, how come

548
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,590
you didn't discuss this with me?

549
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,790
She was with me

550
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,270
and now she's suddenly yours.

552
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,310
I was wrong.

in the future.

Thank you.

563
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,920
You don't have to thank me.

with Boli.

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,960
Whatever my mother and I do,
it's useless.

569
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,510
This whole thing

570
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,480
is up to Madam Qi.

571
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,590
If you had listened to me earlier
and moved here,

572
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,000
all this wouldn't have happened.

573
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,030
Don't you agree?

574
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,000
Madam,

575
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,830
please stop making fun of me.

576
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,000
See,

577
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,000
you can directly

578
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,160
consume my horse.

579
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,000
I want to go back to my reading.

580
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,160
You can teach Bolin.

581
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,960
What's wrong with you?

582
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,640
Why the long face?

583
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,240
Can you tell me

584
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,590
if someone has two mothers,

585
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,680
what should they do?

586
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,880
Two mothers?

587
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,310
That would be great!

588
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,310
But

589
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,000
they are both unhappy because of me.

590
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,240
I don't know what to do.

591
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,400
Well,

592
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,160
you should make them happy.

593
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,030
And then everything will be fine.

594
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,640
Let me tell you this...

595
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:11,920
Shaoyao,

596
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,200
have you seen Boli?

597
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,350
How come once the class is over,

598
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,480
he's disappeared?

599
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:17,920
He went shopping.

600
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,440
Okay.

601
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,720
Aunt Qi.

602
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,920
Zhi's mother

603
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,030
is also Bolin's mother,

604
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,030
and Duo's mother

605
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,510
is also Ling's mother,

606
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,790
and you are Boli's mother,

607
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,310
right?

608
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:32,750
Yes.

609
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,200
Boli said

610
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,400
he has two mothers. Is that true?

611
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,200
He was talking nonsense.

612
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,680
Children speak without thinking.

613
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,160
Don't believe him.

614
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,400
So he lied to me.

615
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,400
I was saying

616
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,960
that I'm so envious of him.

617
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,880
What's there to be envious of?

618
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,270
Dou and Bolin often tell me

619
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,000
about what their mothers said to them,

620
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,400
the food their mothers gave them,

621
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,720
and the things
their mothers bought them.

622
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,960
Their mothers treat them so well.

623
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,510
So, if Boli has two mothers,

624
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,510
isn't that even better?

625
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,510
Unlike me. I don't even have a mother.

626
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:36,920
Boli.

627
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,480
Stop right there.

628
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,200
Madam Qi.

629
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,640
Where are you going?

630
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,750
Didn't you hear Boli talking to you?

631
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,310
I just happened to run into him.

632
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,440
You should take him back to study.

633
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,110
Boli.

634
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,200
What were you trying to say?

635
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,790
I've been helping out at the shop.

636
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,830
I bought this with the money I earned.

637
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,640
I want

638
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,200
to give it to you.

639
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,400
What is this?

640
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,480
Mother,

641
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,480
this is a chicken feather brush
I made myself.

642
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,960
Bolin

643
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,750
helped me

644
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,680
pluck feathers from our rooster.

645
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,070
Then I made this from those feathers.

646
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,790
I read about this type of brush

647
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,720
in the penmanship book

648
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,720
written by Wang Xizhi.

649
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,590
This...

650
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,920
You made it for me?

651
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,590
Silly child.

652
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,030
You're already busy with study.

653
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,960
You shouldn't have wasted time

654
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,270
making this for me.

655
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,240
Mother,

656
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,510
your writing is beautiful.

657
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,960
You should write more.

658
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:20,750
In the future,

659
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,400
I will study hard,

660
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,200
so you don't have to worry about me
all the time.

661
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:31,880
Good.

662
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,440
Good.

663
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,200
Good boy.

664
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,030
Hold it for me.

665
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,160
It was a gift from the child.

666
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,480
Why don't you wear it?

667
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,070
I...

668
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,400
It's really beautiful.

669
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,350
All these years,

670
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,310
I've been working very hard

671
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,680
to raise Boli.

672
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,310
From now on,

673
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,400
you will do exactly the same.

674
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,350
I will.

675
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,750
I will!

676
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,030
Go ahead.

677
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:25,720
You're all here.

678
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,830
Yanxi.

679
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,920
We are playing elephant chess.

680
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,270
You can play this?

681
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,200
A friend gave it to me.

682
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,400
He has no one to play with,

683
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,270
so he taught me.

684
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,440
A friend?

685
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,240
Zhi, it's your turn.

686
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:43,750
This...

687
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,640
Shaoyao is amazing.

688
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,270
Indeed.

689
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,960
That was a great move.

690
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,400
Zhi, you let me win on purpose.

691
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,070
You guys always protect me,

692
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,510
just like you take care of Duo

693
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,160
and the other kids.

694
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,750
But you don't have to do that
when we're playing games.

695
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,110
I'm sorry.

696
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,400
It's alright.

697
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,110
Zhi, I know you're busy.

698
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,480
I'll play with someone else.

699
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,270
I got you again, didn't I?

700
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,070
Who's outwitting who?

701
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,030
Sorry,

702
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,110
I made the wrong move just now.

703
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,480
A wrong move.

704
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,110
Stop.

705
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,000
Are you taking back the move?

706
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,750
Last time, it was you
who said cheating isn't allowed.

707
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,590
Why are you looking at me

708
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,070
like that?

709
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,200
If I want to play elephant chess again,

710
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,270
can I come back to you?

711
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,590
What do you need me for?

712
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,000
Don't you have anyone else to play with?

713
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,960
Playing with you is different.

714
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,070
You are just different.

715
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,310
How am I different?

716
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,030
So am I the only one with free time?

717
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,240
You're very smart

718
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,790
and very interesting.

719
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,720
You know everything.

720
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,440
Next time,

721
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,680
teach me everything you know.

722
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,350
Then I'll play with you.

723
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,790
Alright.

724
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,480
But let's make it clear,

725
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,160
if you lose, don't cry.

726
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,510
I wonder

727
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,750
who will end up crying later.

728
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,310
You're doomed. I'm telling you.

729
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:46,720
I've never strolled down the street
with someone like this,

730
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,440
not for any reason,

731
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,550
just wandering

732
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,480
and shopping.

733
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
Then I'll do it with you
as much as you want.

734
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,920
Have you

735
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,830
been into someone before?

736
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,960
Yes, when I was a teenager.

737
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,110
Now, I've found her.

738
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,750
Why ask this all of a sudden?

739
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,350
I never

740
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,550
fell for anyone before.

741
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,400
The day when you came back
to the yard to find me,

742
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,790
I was thinking

743
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,790
that I must cherish this affection.

744
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,440

to reason with him,

874
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,800
but that rat

875
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,190
hid from me.

876
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,480
They said
he went to some kind of poetry party.

877
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,400
The house was left in a terrible mess.

878
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,880
Since you've been there,

879
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,590
why didn't you
bring Auntie Hua Xian home?

880
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,230
Don't get me started.

881
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,400
I'm so pissed.

882
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,440
Xian is such a spineless girl!

883
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,230
I asked her to come home with me,

884
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,230
yet she flatly refused.

885
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,190
She said

886
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,480
that family matters
should not be made public.

887
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,630
She believes she shouldn't return here

888
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,760
to spend the night
without a good reason.

889
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,800
Because if this gets out,

890
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,510
Sui'an would be ashamed.

891
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,670
That's not wrong, though.

892
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,280
As a married woman,

893
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,480
she can't always

894
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,630
stay at her parents' home.

895
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,630
Even if

896
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,440
we can look after her for a few days,

897
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,590
she would need to go back eventually.

898
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,320
That was what she said too.

899
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,280
She could hide here temporarily,

900
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:44,190
but once she goes back,

901
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,440
that heartless man

902
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,150
would beat her to half-death again.

903
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:47,800
I was so angry!

904
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,440
I was even

905
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,510
going to force her back.

906
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,320
But

907
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,670
she threatened me with her life.

908
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,510
She said

909
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,550
that if I pressure her further,

910
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,840
she would just kill herself!

911
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:56,960
She also said

912
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,480
she was already too ashamed to live.

913
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,800
Sui'an tried so hard to persuade her,
but she wouldn't listen.

914
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,760
As for me,

915
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,280
I was so angry that I almost passed out!

916
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:06,360
If Auntie Hua Xian

917
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,480
refused to come home,

918
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,110
no matter what you do,

919
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,030
you couldn't possibly bring her back.

920
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,510
About this,

921
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,880
we need a long-term plan.

922
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,840
Why is being a woman

923
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,840
so hard?

924
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,320
What can be done about it anyway?

925
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,230
She married such a man.

926
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
That is her fate.

927
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,840
But speaking of which,

928
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,920
back then,

929
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,190
Mother approved

930
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
of their marriage.

931
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,920
He seemed refined and cultured

932
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
like a gentleman.

933
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,760
I can't believe
he turned out to be such a scoundrel.

934
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,880
But what can we do about it?

935
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,670
She married him already,

936
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,070
so she has to endure him.

937
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,440
That's wrong.

938
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,070
I don't think

939
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,110
this is Auntie Hua Xian's fate.

940
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,280
I don't even believe in fate.

941
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:44,190
Zhi,

942
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,230
do you have any idea?

943
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,110
When a man can't bear his wife,

944
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,030
he can divorce her.

945
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:50,190
So when a woman can't bear her husband,

946
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,030
she can also divorce him.

947
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,760
Zhi,

948
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,030
what are you talking about?

949
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:55,920
How could women

950
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,110
divorce their husbands?

951
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,230
If she can't do that,
then let it be an uncontested divorce.

952
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,000
According to the Daqing Law,

953
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,150
there is indeed a provision
for a mutual divorce.

954
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:03,960
And it's not specified

955
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,190
that only a man can initiate it.

956
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,480
A mutual divorce?

957
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,150
Are you saying

958
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,510
she can leave the Yang Family

959
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,920
and move back here?

960
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:11,960
Yes.

961
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,400
Well,

962
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,510
it doesn't have to come this far,
does it?

963
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,230
Aunt Xia, what other ideas

964
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,190
do you have?

965
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,110
I think

966
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,110
we should let Mr. Yan beat him

967
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,070
until he begs for mercy.

968
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,400
So he'll know

969
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,480
that we do have men

970
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,480
to back us up.

971
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,550
Yes, I also want to beat him up.

972
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,920
The harder, the better.

973
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,960
But then what?

974
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,110
We simply forget about it?

975
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,110
The only solution is
to help Auntie Hua Xian and Sui'an

976
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:33,920
leave that place

977
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,840
and come back here.

978
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,000
Leaving that house of nightmares

979
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:36,920
is the most important thing.

980
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,150
That is nonsense.

981
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
The Yang Mansion is the home

982
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,400
of your aunt and Sui'an.

983
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,320
Our place

984
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,920
is just her parents' home.

985
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,670
That's a place
where they are treated like animals.

986
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
And you call it home?

987
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,000
But you can't
make her leave just like that, can you?

988
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,510
How

989
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,000
would your aunt

990
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,230
live the rest of her life?

991
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,760
Are we going to watch Xian

992
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,070
be kicked out of that house

993
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,320
and become a joke?

994
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,360
I'd rather tear down ten temples

995
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,320
than destroy one marriage.

996
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,150
Zhi,

997
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,440
don't you

998
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,550
say that nonsense again.

999
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,670
Don't ever

1000
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,400
bring up the divorce again.

1001
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,480
Of course, she needs a divorce.

1002
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,480
I knew you would say so.

1003
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,800
How did you know?

1004
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,110
I just knew.

1005
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,550
You surely would think the same as me.

1006
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,920
You said

1007
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,360
that your aunt is afraid

1008
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,320
of affecting her son's future.

1009
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,480
But if your cousin

1010
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,800
still has a shred of humanity,

1011
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,360
he would not want his mother

1012
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,510
to stay by such a monster's side.

1013
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,280
Not even for an instant.

1014
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:40,710
My cousin wants her

1015
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,710
to come here and hide for a while.

1016
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,280
But I haven't talked to him

1017
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,190
about the divorce yet.

1018
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
I don't know what he'll think about it.

1019
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:47,550
Hua Zhi,

1020
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,590
you have met my mother.

1021
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,070
Yes.

1022
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:52,710
We have met once.

1023
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,070
She was very kind to me.

1024
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,230
If I could choose,

1025
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,480
I'd wish she never married my father.

1026
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,030
Even if that means

1027
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,960
I wouldn't exist.

1028
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:00,960
Things would have been much better

1029
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,190
if she hadn't married my father.

1030
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:03,880
Hua Zhi,

1031
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,440
I am a son too.

1032
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,030
To me,

1033
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,150
nothing is as important

1034
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,280
as my mother's safety and happiness.

1035
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,440
I think Sui'an thinks the same way.

1036
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,000
Try this.

1037
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,000
This is salty porridge.

1038
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:17,800
It's not sweet at all.

1039
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,400
Alright.

1040
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,360
Zhi,

1041
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,110
where are you going?

1042
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,230
I'm making another trip
to the Yang Mansion.

1043
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:32,880
I'll be back soon.

1044
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,030
Are you really going to persuade Xian

1045
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:35,800
to get a mutual divorce?

1046
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,110
I have to.

1047
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:38,920
I disapprove.

1048
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,630
If you want to go, go by yourself.

1049
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,360
Zhi,

1050
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,400
this is immoral.

1051
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,190
It doesn't matter.

1052
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,630
I'll just go by myself.
