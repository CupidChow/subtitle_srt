00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,390
My headache is getting worse.

189
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,910
I can't stand it anymore.

190
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,750
Well,

191
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,550
see our guests out properly.

192
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,120
Yes.

193
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,840
Miss, come and take a look.

194
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,150
These are our new arrivals.

195
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,320
Madam Zhou!

196
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,200
Madam Zhou!

197
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,080
Madam Zhou?

198
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,080
Madam Zhou!

199
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,960
Madam Zhou!

200
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,390
Wait.

201
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,510
She has to go to the temple
to pay respect.

202
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,960
We'll invite you for tea another day.

203
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,720
You're lying.

204
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,840
You've been avoiding us.

205
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,870
Will you ever invite us for tea?

206
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,960
Just a few days ago,
they were so close to you

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,910
as if you were sisters.

208
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,750
But now,

209
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,750
one has kicked us out

210
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,080
while the other acted like
we were some jinxes.

211
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,030
Seriously?

212
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,840
Let's go take a look on the street.

213
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,200
In Jinyang, they're not

214
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,200
the only business people.

215
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,080
These shrimps are good.

216
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,120
Baoxia,

217
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,270
we can buy some of these.

218
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,960
Indeed.

219
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,270
Sir,

220
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,750
how much is this dried shrimp?

221
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,440
Miss, you have good eyes.

222
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,000
These are top-grade dried goods.

223
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,720
Look at the size of these.

224
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,080
Where else could you find them?

225
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,910
Miss, do you want...

226
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,600
Are you Miss Hua?

227
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,150
Do you know me?

228
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,270
Miss,

229
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,270
you are a major customer.

230
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,510
Our humble shop

231
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,630
truly cannot serve you.

232
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,270
Perhaps you should

233
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,870
try other stores.

234
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,150
You!

235
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:47,670
Baoxia.

236
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,320
Go ask around.

237
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,000
I got it.

238
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,480
I told the shopkeeper

239
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,840
that I'm Madam Chen's new maid.

240
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,510
Only then did I learn

241
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,870
that a place called Seven Stars Mansion

242
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,320
has spread the word
to all the merchants in town

243
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,510
and forbidden them
from doing business with us.

244
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,790
We just got here

245
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,910
and we've offended
the local tyrant already.

246
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,750
Young Lady,

247
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,670
maybe we should ask Mr. Jiang

248
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,440
for help.

249
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
His family is quite influential.

250
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,320
Regardless of whom you've offended,

251
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,320
he should be able
to solve the problem, right?

252
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,080
No.

253
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,550
The Jiang Family holds official duties.

254
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,840
We can't cause trouble for them.

255
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,360
That would put Rong
in a difficult position.

256
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,270
Don't let anyone else know about this.

257
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,320
What can be done then?

258
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,720
We can't return to the Imperial Capital
with an empty ship, can we?

259
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,720
Miss Hua.

260
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,750
There's a young man outside.

261
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,840
He brought Miss Hua this

262
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,480
and said it was from a friend of hers.

263
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,600
Look!

264
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,060
[Wealth Deity Yue
consecrated Master Haoyue]

265
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,360
[to deceive the common people
and gather wealth]

266
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,390
So that's how it is.

267
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,510
Wealth Deity Yue?

268
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,000
Who sent this note?

269
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,870
And who is this Wealth Deity?

270
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,120
Yesterday,

271
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,320
I upset that Master Haoyue.

272
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,630
She is a valued guest of Yue,

273
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,840
the owner of the Seven Stars Mansion.

274
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,600
The Seven Stars Mansion

275
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,510
is a major business body in the city.

276
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,480
How come they're fooled

277
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,200
by a swindler?

278
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,510
They're not fooled by her.

279
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,030
They're partners.

280
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,960
They play tricks

281
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,240
and make up stories.

282
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,910
I think that's smart, actually.

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
It's all a bunch of deceitful schemes.

284
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,150
And you actually praised them?

285
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,200
Trying eagerly to do business with him

286
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,360
won't get us any advantage.

287
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,320
We need to make this Wealth Deity

288
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,720
come to trade with us.

289
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,550
Easy for you to say, Lady Zhi.

290
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,600
But they are about

291
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,840
to kick us out of Jinyang City.

292
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,720
Have you heard it?

293
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,360
The other day at the dock,

294
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,630
they caught a big fish

295
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,120
with a note in its mouth.

296
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,080
What does the note say?

297
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,480
I think it was, "Three days sunny,
two days windy.

298
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,750
Penglai arrives at Jinyang."

299
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,000
The following days
were all sunny indeed,

300
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,550
and then there were big waves
for two days in a row.

301
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,000
Fishing boats couldn't go out to sea!

302
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,240
Do you guys know?

303
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,080
A few days ago at Qingfeng Pavilion,

304
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,200
there was a puff of white smoke,

305
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,440
and then, Penglai the immortal
appeared out of nowhere.

306
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,670
These days,

307
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,550
people have been queueing up

308
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,120
for her divination.

309
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,550
She's

310
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,550
not a swindler, is she?

311
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,000
She is a real immortal!

312
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,750
She doesn't charge anything
and only predicts the weather.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,510
We already

314
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,720
have Master Haoyue.

315
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,790
But why can't there be

316
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,550
a Master Penglai as well?

317
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,150
You're right.

318
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,200
Let's go take a look.

319
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:26,910
- Bill, please.
- Let's go.

320
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,630
Let's go.

321
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:28,600
Please.

322
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,240
- Please.
- Please.

323
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,600
Penglai arrives at Jinyang.

324
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,150
Three days sunny, two days windy.

325
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,720
Penglai arrives at Jinyang.

326
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,670
Three days sunny, two days windy.

327
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,320
Master Penglai?

328
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,550
Commander,

329
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,960
I saw it with my own eyes.

330
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,150
Miss Hua was sitting there,

331
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,390
putting on her big show.

332
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,080
Qingfeng Pavilion is now

333
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,790
filled with people.

334
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,670
It took me great effort to get in.

335
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:01,840
I wonder

336
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:02,720
what her plan is.

337
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,240
Jinyang people

338
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,360
firmly believe in Haoyue.

339
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,870
If someone mimicked her,

340
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
they would believe it as well.

341
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,270
Haoyue has been
deceiving people for years.

342
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,510
Yet it ended up benefiting Hua Zhi.

343
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,320
So, Miss Hua is simply

344
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,720
taking advantage of her?

345
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,480
Did you try to make an appointment

346
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,550
with Wealth Deity Yue?

347
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,550
Yes.

348
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,720
He completely ignored us.

349
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,480
Meeting with him is even

350
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,750
harder than meeting with an official.

351
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,030
I'm not surprised.

352
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,720
He is the richest man in town,

353
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,480
while we

354
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,670
are just some outsiders

355
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:30,600
with unclear backgrounds.

356
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:31,960
Commander,

357
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,200
if you wish to see him in person,

358
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,550
I'm afraid we may have to
resort to force.

359
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,750
If we alert the enemy,

360
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,030
it's hard to say whether we'll catch

361
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:40,360
the real deal.

362
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,440
But, Commander,

363
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,440
this Wealth Deity Yue

364
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,670
rarely shows up.

365
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,550
And there are few in Jinyang

366
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,480
who have seen him in person.

367
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,630
Do we keep waiting, or...

368
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,000
No.

369
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,360
Let's

370
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,840
pay a visit to Master Penglai.

371
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,550
Miss Hua?

372
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,960
Let's also make

373
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,790
a move

374
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,480
to take advantage.

375
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,400
Madam.

376
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,110
Rong,

377
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,030
what's wrong?

378
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,350
Rong,

379
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,000
did you overeat behind my back again?

380
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,110
How come you got so sick?

381
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,240
I did not.

382
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,790
Quickly get the physician!

383
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,200
The physician just left.

384
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,590
Why call him back?

385
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,960
Silly,

386
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,640
you're going to be a father.

387
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,400
Really?

388
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,790
Rong, you...

389
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,350
I missed this month's menstrual period.

390
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,440
And I often felt sick.

391
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,510
So, I suspected I might be pregnant.

392
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,200
But I worried that maybe
I was wrong and didn't want

393
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,240
to disappoint your parents,

394
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,440
so I went ahead and called

395
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,480
for a skillful physician to check on me.

396
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,200
Silly you.

397
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,110
I called you silly,

398
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,160
and you really are.

399
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,310
It's just a tiny baby.

400
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
You don't need to get so worried.

401
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,070
This is our child.

402
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,350
How can I not treasure it?

403
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,550
Rong,

404
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,640
ever since I first saw you,

405
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,160
I thought to myself

406
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,110
that the person I want to
spend my life with

407
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,680
is actually so lovely.

408
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,790
I told myself that if I'm lucky enough

409
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,590
to marry you,

410
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,030
then in this life of mine,

411
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,240
you'll be the only one by my side.

412
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,880
And we'll have children.

413
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,920
Fate has truly been kind to me.

414
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,790
Your words are sweet indeed.

415
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,590
Are you hungry?

416
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,160
I want the sour snacks from Tang's.

417
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,270
Then I'll have someone get it for you.

418
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,640
I want you to go with me.

419
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,920
It's only good if it's made fresh.

420
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,070
You want to go shopping

421
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,440
when you just got pregnant?

422
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,480
But I want the snacks now.

423
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,200
Just go with me, Zhengzhi.

424
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,110
You, oh you.

425
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:12,790
So sour!

426
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,440
Isn't it delicious?

427
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,110
I want that!

428
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,160
Back at home,

429
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
I used to help my family sell them.

430
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,880
Then wait here.

431
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:21,680
I'll get it for you.

432
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,200
Mr. Yan!

433
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,640
I've long heard
you were married off to Jinyang,

434
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,920
but never thought
I would actually meet you.

435
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,640
Zhi is also in Jinyang.

436
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,480
Did you know?

437
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,310
We

438
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,920
didn't come here together.

439
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,960
I thought...

440
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,070
Mr. Yan.

441
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,070
How great it was in the old days.

442
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,880
Zhi has never

443
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,000
smiled so happily before.

444
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,110
Can't you two...

445
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,510
That's truly such a pity.

446
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,510
Rong,

447
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,720
who's this?

448
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,510
This is my husband, Jiang Zhengzhi.

449
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,400
This is Mr. Yan,
a teacher from my family's academy.

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,160
He's a friend of Zhi.

451
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,350
Mr. Yan.

452
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,480
Miss Rong,

453
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:20,590
I still have work to attend to.

454
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,920
I'll take my leave now.

455
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,160
We'll talk some other day.

456
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,640
What's the matter, Rong?

457
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,070
When we get back, you must not

458
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,350
bring him up in front of Zhi,

459
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,310
in case it makes her sad.

460
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,880
Alright, I'll keep that in mind.

461
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,070
Let's go.

462
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,870
[Qingfeng Pavilion]

463
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,270
- Make way.
- Be quiet.

464
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,310
- Step aside.
- Quiet down.

465
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,400
I've long heard of your name.

466
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,070
Today, I came especially to pay a visit.

467
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,440
It's Mr. Yan.

468
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,750
My honored guest, how can I help you?

469
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,960
I am Lu.

470
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,030
My family runs a fur business.

471
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,880
I heard that Mr. Yue
from the Seven Stars Mansion

472
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,110
sincerely sponsored a diviner

473
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,640
and thus earned a great fortune,

474
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,030
so I wish to follow his example

475
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,110
and sincerely sponsor you.

476
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,920
Is that so?

477
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,550
How do you intend to do that?

478
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,400
Since he has the Seven Stars Mansion,

479
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,830
then I will build

480
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,030
an Eight Winds Mansion in Jinyang.

481
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,160
Eight Winds Mansion?

482
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,960
I believe with your skills,

483
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,070
the Eight Winds Mansion

484
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,110
will certainly
rival the Seven Stars Mansion

485
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,070
within three years.

486
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,310
I present you
three hundred taels of gold.

487
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,110
Please take a look.

488
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,750
Three hundred taels?

489
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,000
Bring it in for a look.

490
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,480
Come on!

491
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,510
Hurry.

492
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,270
Come on.

493
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,590
Stop looking.

494
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,440
Stop looking.

495
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,270
Step back!

496
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,750
Let me have a look!

497
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,590
Since Mr. Lu has made
such a generous offer,

498
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,110
I will humbly accept it.

499
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,310
Do you want to meet
with Wealth Deity Yue as well?

500
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,270
You certainly know how to hitch a ride.

501
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,920
This is really official business.

502
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,510
Please lend a helping hand.

503
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,440
In this case,

504
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,640
Master Penglai,

505
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,590
how about we head home
for a detailed discussion?

506
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,590
Then let's go.

507
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,070
Make way.

508
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,750
Step aside!

509
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,440
Step aside!

510
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,880
Step aside.

511
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,440
Step aside.

512
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,480
I have no idea.

513
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,200
What's going on?

514
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,400
Why did they just leave like that?

515
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,070
Mr. Lu!

516
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,750
Mr. Lu!

517
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,160
Miss Hua, please wait!

518
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,920
Mr. Zeng, I've been
looking for you for days.

519
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,590
And now you've come to me.

520
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,720
Miss Hua, it's not that I have been

521
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,920
intentionally hiding from you.

522
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,070
It's just...

523
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,070
It's just that I have

524
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,270
left the city for a few days

525
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,400
and just got back.

526
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,440
It's alright.

527
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,440
In Jinyang,

528
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,440
you have to prioritize

529
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,350
your own business.

530
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,640
I wonder what kind of business

531
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,030
made you run

532
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,750
in such haste.

533
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,030
Mr. Lu,

534
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,680
please stop making fun of me.

535
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,640
Sorry

536
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,880
for neglecting you earlier.

537
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,160
But today,

538
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,880
you two must do me the honor.

539
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,920
[An Invitation from Wealth Deity Yue]

540
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,440
Wealth Deity Yue?

541
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,720
[I'd like to invite Mr. Lu to have a drink
at the Seven Stars Mansion.]

542
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,550
This is

543
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,510
really not easy to get.

544
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,590
Let's speak frankly.

545
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,480
This is Wealth Deity Yue's golden card.

546
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,270
Throughout the whole Jinyang City,

547
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,680
those who have seen it

548
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,000
can be counted on one hand.

549
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,440
So today,

550
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,240
you two must

551
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:57,920
seize this opportunity.

552
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,110
Perhaps

553
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,830
from now on,

554
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,920
everything will go well

555
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,350
and you two will make a fortune.

556
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,270
Baoxia.

557
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,270
You can head back.

558
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,960
This really is quite a coincidence.

559
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
You two

560
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,400
are both from the Imperial Capital.

561
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,510
I was thinking

562
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,310
that I should set a feast someday

563
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,030
to introduce you to each other.

564
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,270
But in the end,

565
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,440
before I could

566
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,000
have the chance to throw the feast,

567
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,110
you two have already met.

568
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,920
Mr. Zeng, you're right.

569
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,750
In the vast Imperial Capital,

570
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,350
two strangers

571
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,160
won't encounter each other

572
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,240
so easily.

573
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,480
So, it's all fate.

574
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,000
Fate, indeed.

575
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,960
Please

576
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,960
come with me.

577
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,640
Please.

578
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,810
[Seven Stars Mansion]

579
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,960
Miss Hua,

580
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,400
how do you like

581
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,790
Jinyang's Seven Stars Mansion

582
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,350
compared

583
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,640
with your

584
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,680
Zhiming Restaurant?

585
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,880
Zhiming Restaurant
is just a small tavern.

586
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,960
It's nothing like here.

587
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,960
This Seven Stars Mansion

588
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,750
doesn't look like a merchant's dwelling.

589
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,590
What does it look like then?

590
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,750
It's secluded and stern,

591
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,830
like a small palace in Jinyang.

592
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,790
Mr. Lu, stop joking.

593
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,550
Alright,

594
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,480
Wealth Deity Yue

595
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,590
is already upstairs

596
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,270
waiting for you two.

597
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,590
It's just

598
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,550
I'm afraid these two gentlemen

599
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,830
will have to...

600
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,720
You guys head back.

601
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,400
Please.

602
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,590
I can only take you this far.

603
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,880
I wasn't invited today,

604
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,920
so I cannot enter.

605
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,920
Miss Hua is a lady.

606
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,550
So she can enter first.

607
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,590
As for Mr. Lu,

608
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,030
you'll have to stay here

609
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,270
and wait for a moment.

610
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,880
Since we came together,

611
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,590
why can't we enter together as well?

612
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,640
Perhaps, the business

613
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,750
that Miss Hua wants to talk about

614
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,440
will interest me as well.

615
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,680
But Mr. Lu...

616
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,590
No...

617
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,310
Wait...

618
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,070
You...

619
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,550
It's a forecasting instrument,
activated by water

620
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,880
and rotated by mercury.

621
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,200
Placed in a secret chamber,

622
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,350
it corresponds
with the movement of nature.

623
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,640
It's a celestial globe.

624
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,510
Miss Hua.

625
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,790
You recognize this thing?

626
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,350
Mr. Yue,

627
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,750
I've heard a lot about you.

628
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,350
This move that you two made

629
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,350
truly gave me a headache.

630
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,590
Mr. Yue,

631
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,640
it seems I have misjudged

632
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,680
Master Haoyue.

633
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,550
I thought she was just talking nonsense

634
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,440
and deceiving the people.

635
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,310
I never expected it was you

636
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,480
who's been running everything here.

637
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,750
It turns out

638
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:01,880
that the prophecy is false

639
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,070
but the information is true.

640
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,750
Miss Hua,

641
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,720
you're a smart person.

642
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,440
These instruments are indeed special.

643
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,750
I wonder where you got them.

644
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,110
Easy.

645
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,200
As long as you have money,

646
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,350
you can get these easily.

647
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
Getting instruments is easy,

648
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,350
but mastering them is not.

649
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,920
So, I guess Haoyue

650
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,960
is just a cover of yours.

651
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,830
Whatever you tell her,

652
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,550
she then tells it to the common people.

653
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,750
Exactly.

654
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,880
With this observatory, one can observe

655
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,310
the phenomena of the sky and sea.

656
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,070
This doesn't really count as deception.

657
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,030
Miss Hua,

658
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,830
what exactly

659
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,880
brought you here to Jinyang?

660
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,750
You have been honest with me,

661
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,110
so I won't beat around the bush.

662
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,550
I came here for business.

663
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,240
I'm seeking
long-term business relationships.

664
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920
You are the big boss of Jinyang.

665
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,720
For every deal that is made here,

666
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,590
you must have a share of it.

667
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,790
Since it's beneficial for both of us,

668
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,510
why not bury the hatchet?

669
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,720
Are you really here just for business?

670
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,440
During the past few days I spent here,

671
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,830
I almost got my deals.

672
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,110
If I hadn't offended Master Haoyue,

673
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,720
I'd have already set sail for home.

674
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:17,920
If you don't believe me,

675
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,400
just ask any shop owner in town.

676
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,550
So

677
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,960
it was my fault.

678
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,160
You came all the way here,

679
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,480
yet I made things so difficult for you.

680
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,270
I shall offer you an apology.

681
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,110
Mr. Yue,

682
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,270
I don't need your apology.

683
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,750
I just need my goods.

684
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,640
That's easy.

685
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,920
As long as you have my golden card,

686
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,240
you can purchase anything
from any shop downtown.

687
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,880
You'll get the best goods
at favorable prices

688
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,160
and there'll be laborers
helping you with the loading.

689
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,200
And after that,

690
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,830
Miss Hua,

691
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,160
when you're no longer mad

692
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
and have made your money,

693
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,510
you can stop

694
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,110
playing a divine lady.

695
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,270
I really don't want Jinyang

696
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,240
to have another

697
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,640
Seven Stars Mansion.

698
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,720
I'll keep your kindness

699
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,750
in mind.

700
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,160
Mr. Lu,

701
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,110
what brought you

702
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,240
here to Jinyang?

703
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,830
Mr. Yue, you live in Jinyang

704
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:11,920
and are well-informed.

705
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,480
So I've come to ask

706
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,270
if you have heard this ballad.

707
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,160
When the ruler is unjust,

708
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,480
the nature turns ominous.

709
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,640
Three years with no rain,

710
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,920
the crops withering in the fields.

711
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,070
Miss Hua,

712
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
I've promised

713
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,000
to give you all you asked for.

714
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,440
You shall go back to your business.

715
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,270
Be careful.

716
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,700
[Seven Stars Mansion]

717
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,510
Judging by the furnishings
and the scent,

718
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,750
the owner of this place

719
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,070
should be a woman.

720
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,640
Haoyue is not your cover.

721
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:36,680
On the contrary,

722
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,200
you are hers.

723
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,400
Drop the act

724
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,310
and get your master out.

725
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,160
Such a clever young man.

726
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,440
Miss Hua, you can rest assured.

727
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,200
I will replenish the items

728
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,440
on the list for you right now.

729
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,270
Once the goods are ready,

730
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,240
I'll send someone

731
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,680
to deliver them to the cargo ship.

732
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,480
Thank you.

733
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,550
You're very welcome.

734
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,680
I just saw you

735
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,270
exchanging glances with Miss Hua.

736
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,680
I guess

737
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,000
you two know each other.

738
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,790
Did she truly come here for business?

739
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,640
The reason why she came to Jinyang

740
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:38,790
has nothing to do with me.

741
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,160
As for why I came here,

742
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,270
I assume you already know.

743
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,830
I was wondering

744
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
how come the assassin I sent after her

745
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,920
had gone

746
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
completely missing.

747
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,070
She couldn't possibly pull that off.

748
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,160
I thought

749
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,400
you were just a spy

750
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,550
sent by the Court.

751
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:04,590
But now,

752
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,750
seeing you in person,

753
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,880
I figure

754
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,510
