[Episode 12]

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,970
I'm just worried that
you might not be able to

26
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,360
find the right people for the job,

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,280
so I even brought you

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,120
my son.

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,930
His father owes it to the Hua family.

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,640
He should be helping you.

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,770
You've found the men I need alredy?

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,530
Fifteen men,

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,010
all former servants

34
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,970
who worked here before.

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,600
They came all the way here.

36
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,690
Please don't look down on us!

37
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,970
Look down on them?

38
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,130
Fifteen men blocking the doorway.

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,530
They're clearly trying to force me

40
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,170
to hire them.

41
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,240
If you are willing to help us,

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,730
my entire family will be grateful.

43
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,920
But let me make it clear beforehand,

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,770
we're no longer the same as before.

45
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,530
We've been cutting budget on everything.

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,880
So I'm afraid that your payment

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,000
can only be half of what it used to be.

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:20,960
Hua Zhi,

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,530
As long as
you're willing to take me back,

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,000
I have no reason to say no at all.

51
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,130
Besides,

52
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,320
the Hua family

53
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,530
is renowned for being nice to servents,

54
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,000
and you are such a good person.

55
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,320
A lower payment doesn't change anything.

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,170
Alright.

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,600
As our guard,

58
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,530
regarding your responsbilities,

59
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,090
I believe you're clear about everything.

60
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:41,930
Hua Zhi,

61
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,090
allow me to boast a little.

62
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,290
I, Li Gui, am born to do this.

63
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,930
I know what I should do.

64
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,960
Tell them to pack things up.

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,930
Don't frighten the others.

66
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,370
Let Madam Xia take a look at them.

67
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,170
Alright.

68
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,930
Thank you, Hua Zhi.

This is Ms. Qin's dressing table.

70
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,290
Why is it here?

71
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,120
Are you blind?

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,010
Madam Xia!

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,760
Madam Xia, I'm here.

74
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,040
I'll remove it right away.

75
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,450
I've been calling you for ages.

76
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,840
The room next door is quite clean.

77
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,450
Go have a look.

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,600
Madam Xia,

79
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,680
I want...

80
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,290
I...

81
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,120
Don't hum like a mosquito!

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,040
Just say what you want to say!

83
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,730
I want to move to the west wing
across the way.

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,930
I'm here to ask for your permission.

85
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,960
Why is that?

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,240
Well, you and Ling

87
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,170
and Duo don't just live here,

88
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,170
you also need to work here, right?

89
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,720
Everyday,

90
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,120
people come here to report expenses
or collect tokens,

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,650
so many of them!

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,240
Before,

93
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,890
your office was huge.

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,240
I know we're not rich anymore,

95
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,240
but you should at leave have a room.

96
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,370
I feel bad to take up the space.

97
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,840
You think I don't know

98
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,330
what you really want?

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,000
I suggest you

100
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,370
to give up as soon as you can.

101
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,370
It's not that I don't want you to go.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,090
Go and take a look at the west wing.

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,530
Yingzhen's two kids,

104
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,890
Ms. Qiu,

105
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,210
and Rong and Qin as well,

106
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,930
along with Huilan's boy,

107
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,530
and there's a bunch of maids.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,770
Where will you live?

109
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,960
There is a room.

110
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,490
It's a woodshed,

111
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,770
small but

112
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,240
quiet!

113
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,280
The others don't want it
because it's too sunny.

114
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,120
I have rheumatism.

115
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,440
It's the perfect place for me.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,280
Is everything ready?

117
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,400
Go ask her.

118
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,610
If she says yes,

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,370
I'll let you go.

120
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,330
Hua Zhi,

121
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,930
I want to move to the west wing.

122
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,000
I just want the smallest room.

123
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,090
You mean the one opposite

124
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,960
the room of Aunt Qi and Boli?

125
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,530
Yes.

126
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,810
I like that room.

127
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,160
Then you can have it.

128
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,770
Thank you, Hua Zhi!

129
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,370
Thank you, madam.

130
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,890

Thank you, madam.

132
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,490
Thank you, Hua Zhi!

133
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,370
Hua Zhi,

134
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,720
you really don't understand, do you?

135
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,160
Mother,

136
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,530
where should I put these?

137
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,530
Put them in the cabinet over there.

138
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,450
Sir,

139
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,840
We captured a total of sixteen rebels
this time.

140
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,770
They set seven meeting spots
both inside and outside the capital.

141
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,920
As spies from the Zhao Empire,

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,600
they bribed Zhang Shenqing
form the Foreign Ministry

143
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,690
and Wang Fu from
Imperial Office Bureau,

144
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,450
secretly exchanged information.

145
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,160
Eighteen have been executed.

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,890
Go on.

147
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,250
Some of them haven't been dealt with.

148
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,400
Wang Mingli,
the Directorate of Education,

149
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:20,570
gave the mother of Defence Minister Chen

150
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,690
a golden Buddha statue,

151
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,720
and three one-foot-long
crystal ruyi scepters.

152
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,250
Also, there were eighteen

153
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,570
red-gold dragon bracelets,

154
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,400
becaues Defence Minister Chen

155
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,690
has seventeen concubines

156
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,480
and a wife.

157
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:32,600
Bring them in for questioning.

158
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,010
Alright.

159
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,090
Who wrote this?

160
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:34,960
Hou.

161
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,450
The kid doesn't know
how to shorten words.

162
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,280
Go on.

163
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,890
Pang Sanxing of the Armory Bureau
colluded with the enemy,

164
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,130
secretly sold weapons

165
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,130
1,030 pieces in total,

166
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,450
and two hundred military tents.

167
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,840
Without question,

168
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,330
just kill him.

169
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:46,920
Yes, Sir.

170
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,890
Shen Zhongxing, the minister of
the Imperial Treasury,

171
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,890
bought two dancing girls

172
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,600
and sent them to Prince Xian's residence
the other night.

173
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,010
Did he accept them?

174
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,280
No, he did not.

175
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,160
Go on.

176
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,650
The women and children of the Hua family

177
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,650
moved back to the city yesterday.

178
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,770
Sir?

179
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:15,800
He rejected?

180
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,690
Father,

181
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,960
I'll convert it all into gold coins

182
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,040
and give another try.

183
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,570
Prince Xian won't accept your gift

184
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,800
just because you sent it twice.

185
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,400
Grandfather,

186
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,650
Father.

187
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,450
Grandfather, you want to see me?

188
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,360
Shen Qi,

189
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,840
you need to do your grandfather a favor.

190
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,690
Come here.

191
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,160
You're a common citizen.

192
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,770
We can use your name

193
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,250
to send out an invitation,

194
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,690
asking Prince Xian

195
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,920
to come here for tea.

196
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,600
Both your father and I are officials.

197
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,330
It's inappropriate for us
to issue the invitation.

198
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,690
Why do we want Prince Xian here?

199
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,450
You don't understand.

200
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,130
The Hua family has been raided.

201
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,600
That makes everyone in the court
feel unsafe.

202
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,600
Becoming friends with Prince Xian

203
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,360
will bring our family

204
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,770
a bit of protection.

205
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,570
Lord Hua was wronged,

206
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,010
which is known to everyone.

207
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,360
Prince Xian ordered
the Ministry of Justice

208
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,010
to torture Lord Hua for a confession.

209
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,450
Even the prison guards

210
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,330
couldn't bear watching.

211
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,530
Don't you know that?

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,770
What are you talking about?

213
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
What do you suggest we do?

214
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,010
Cut ties with Prince Xian?

215
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,450
At least, we don't have to fawn on him.

216
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,360
You bastard!

217
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,690
You're member of the Shen family.

218
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:35,570
Your food and clothing

219
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,360
are all provided by your grandfather and me.

220
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,480
Every day we live in fear

221
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,400
providing our services at court.

222
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,040
And you act like this has
nothing to do with you.

223
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,040
Shen Qi,

224
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,130
just tell me,

225
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,330
will you write this invitation or not?

226
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,130
Come on.

227
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,450
[Hua Mansion]
Who are you?

228
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,770
Why are you

229
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,690
walking around here?

230
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,480
Li Gui,

231
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,720
this is my friend.

232
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,330
She likes you very much.

233
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,160
When you were together,

234
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,960
I saw her happy.

235
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,650
Because she likes you,

236
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,130
just like I like you.

237
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,210
A modest gift.

238
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,650
Congratulations for moving back.

239
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,890
How kind of you.

240
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,650
I now feel embarrassed to

241
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,530
raise the fee of food and lodging.

242
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:06,840
You weren't

243
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,560
going to ask for a lot, were you?

244
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,250
Shaoyao has been wanting to see you.

245
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,320
Just get in.

246
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,730
I'm impressed.

247
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,970
She's not married yet,

248
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,080
and she's bringing a man
into the house.

249
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,560
Let me carry it.

250
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,160
No need, this is empty.

251
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,080
Still heavy.

252
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,650
You hold this.

253
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,610
Your guard is quite cautious.

254
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,650
He seems like an expert.

255
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,530
You moved back into the city.

256
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,650
Many people know about this.

257
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
They say that you're in business,

258
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,080
making a fortune every day.

259
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,970
Do you know what that sounds like?

260
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,250
A child carrying gold,
walking in the bustling market.

261
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,280
I've already been

262
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,770
looking for some reliable help.

263
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,680
I haven't found the right ones yet.

264
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,400
Anyway, just be careful.

265
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,400
If there's any way I can help,

266
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,560
just let me know.

267
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,680
Don't worry.

268
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,800
Shaoyao

269
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,610
is safe here.

270
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
What I said

271
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,400
is not just about Shaoyao.

272
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,890
What is this?

273
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,490
This is a sleeve-crossbow,

274
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,730
for self-defense.

275
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,320
Thank you.

276
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,040
Brother,

277
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,280
what have you been up to?

278
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,370
I've been working.

279
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,490
I'm free today.

280
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,440
And I'm here to see you.

281
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,400
I haven't seen you since we moved here.

282
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,440
How about tomorrow I take you
to the night market?

283
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,970
Is that okay?

284
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,160
Hua Zhi has been busy.

285
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,770
She can't go.

286
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,370
Poor her. I'll accompany her.

287
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,970
What should we do then?

288
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:42,650
I want

289
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,160
the two of you

290
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,160
go with me together.

291
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,560
You sure are thoughtful.

292
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,680
Alright.

293
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,200
I'll go to the kitchen for some berries.

294
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,490
I have to get back to the stall soon.

295
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,200
Take your time.

296
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,920
Shaoyao,

297
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,560
remember,

298
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,010
don't tell Hua Zhi

299
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,800
about my work.

300
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,400
Did he leave?

301
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:18,560
He just left,

302
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,280
went out with Hua Zhi.

303
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,160
That tall young man was here again?

304
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,320
We had just moved back here,

305
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,890
hnd he followed right after.

306
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,680
He sure came quickly, didn't he?

307
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,440
After all, Shaoyao lives here.

308
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:35,770
What are you laughing at?

309
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,130
I think,

310
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,680
you should be careful.

311
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,970
He said he came to see Shaoyao,

312
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,400
but everytime, he only talked to

313
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
your daughter.

314
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,770
When have you seen

315
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,320
him talking to Ling or Rong?

316
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,490
Isn't that so?

317
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,890
Could it be...

318
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,970
Could it be...

319
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,770
Perhaps you need to make

320
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,490
some larger shoes,

321
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,850
for your daughter to give away.

322
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,180
[Shen Mansion]

323
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,400
Brother,

324
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,280
You're carrying so much stuff.

325
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,080
Where are you going with all that?

326
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,560
Dinner will be ready soon.

327
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,440
You're not runing away, are you?

328
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:27,850
Why?

329
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,650
Where are you heading?

330
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,610
Aren't you afraid that Dad will get mad?

331
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,400
No.

332
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,280
I've found a quiet place

333
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,650
to prepare for next year's
imperial examination.

334
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,080
Without spending the family's money,

335
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,890
I don't have to do things
against my will.

336
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,010
If Father doesn't have to see me,

337
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,080
he won't get angry al the time.

338
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,730
I don't think it's about this

339
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,650
quiet place.

340
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,920
It's all because of

341
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,730
Hua Zhi.

342
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,650
You're just cross with Dad.

343
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,200
Don't run away.

344
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,890
You're the future

345
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,850
of our family.

346
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,800
Unlike me,

347
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,320
who knows nothing
but to spend family-money.

348
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,800
A family like this,

349
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,490
I can't be a part of its future.

350
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,490
That's not right.

351
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,850
Then, when I don't have money,

352
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,890
who'll pay for me?

353
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:11,970
Brother!

354
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,920
Here you go.

355
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,400
Thank you.

356
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,400
Come back for more.

357
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,920
This place is nice,

358
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,280
I've eaten here before.

359
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,040
The one from earlier is ready.

360
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,680
Here, take it.

361
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,400
Alright!

362
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,770
Shen Qi,

363
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,650
where are you going?

364
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,920
I've found a quiet place

365
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,730
to study and prepare for the exam.

366
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,920
Are you moving?

367
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:41,920
Let me help you.

368
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,890
No, no need.

369
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,610
You don't have to, Hua Zhi.

370
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,040
Didn't you say we're friends?

371
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,800
It's fine.

372
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:46,530
Let's go.

373
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,490
I'll do it.

374
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,730
You are that...

375
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,770
This is Yanxi.

376
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,370
After we met at the copper shop,

377
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,440
we ran into each other again.

378
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,440
Right, good to see you.

379
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,130
Are we going or not?

380
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:01,440
Let's go.

381
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,610
Baoxia, take care of the stall.

382
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,730
Let's go.

383
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,850
Come on, get in.

384
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,850
Please have a seat.

385
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,610
I'll go get some water.

386
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,730
Shen Qi,

387
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,490
how can you live here?

388
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,890
Were you deceived?

389
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,770
I know quite a few rental courtyards.

390
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,400
Why not look for another one?

391
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:46,680
No need.

392
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,160
This place is good enough to live in.

393
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,610
I don't want to spend more
of my family's money.

394
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,890
If you need anything

395
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,890
or any help,

396
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,770
be sure to tell me.

397
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,920
Yanxi, thank you.

398
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,440
I really don't know how to repay you.

399
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,970
No need to thank me.

400
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,130
Thank her instead.

401
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,560
After all, you two are friends.

402
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:08,890
Let's go.

403
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,320
Right, let's go.

404
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:15,650
I'll walk you out.

405
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,560
Mr. Shen,

406
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,370
no need to see us out.

407
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,490
Yingchun,

408
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,080
go and buy some clothes,

409
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,800
food, bedding,

410
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
and some fine

411
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,130
brushes, ink, and paper.

412
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,010
Also, get a string of coins.

413
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,850
Send them to the house at the very end

414
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,610
of Zao Shu Alley.

415
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,850
That place is...

416
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,080
Shen Qi lives there.

417
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,560
From now on,
send those to him every month.

418
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,320
Alright.

419
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,130
If he asks...

420
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,010
Tell them it's from Grandmother.

421
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:56,130
You run ahead, I'll follow.

422
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,040
Bolin,

423
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,920
have you finished school?

424
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,730
The teacher has a family emergency,

425
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,970
so he told us to go home.

426
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,080
Please let me go.

427
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,650
What are you doing?

428
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,280
Boli.

429
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,400
You were at this door last night too,

430
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
sneaking around.

431
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,440
I get it.

432
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Are you trying to steal something?

433
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,370
Boli,

434
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,890
how would I steal from you?

435
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,560
I don't believe you.

436
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,160
This is not mine.

437
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,850
I bought this.

438
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,920
I meant no offense.

439
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,160
I just want

440
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,320
you to take it with you to school.

441
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,010
Is that okay?

442
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,890
Whatever brush I want,
my mother will buy it for me.

443
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,250
I don't want yours.

444
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,850
Boli...

445
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,650
You better leave,

446
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,200
or I will call my mother.

447
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,440
I'm leaving.

448
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,170
Alright, tell me,

449
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,210
why did you skip school

450
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,640
and even take Boli with you?

451
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,120
I just don't want to go!

452
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,730
They all laughed at us!

453
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,770
What for?

454
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,730
They said our family
is down on luck, cursed.

455
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,930
They said studying is useless.

456
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,010
The also said

457
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,690
you're a clown girl,

458
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,040
seling little things.

459
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,080
So what?

460
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,170
I can't hear them anyway.

461
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,770
But even the teacher ignored us.

462
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,170
It was really unbearable staying there,

463
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,640
so we left.

464
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,080
How could you skip school?

465
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,490
Who did you learn it from?

466
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,970
Bolin?

467
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,010
I will go find him.

468
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,360
What has it got to do with him?

469
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,010
I just don't want to go to that school.

470
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,360
Boli,

471
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,010
you used to

472
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,280
love studying the most.

473
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,250
Tomorrow, you'll go with Zhong,

474
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,880
okay?

475
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,210
I'm quite fine studying by myself.

476
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,970
Don't you always say

477
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,170
that you want to be like
your grandfather,

478
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,280
and become the top scholar?

479
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,450
Which top scholar

480
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,410
passed the exam by merely

481
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,530
reading books on his own?

482
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,930
Can I really become the top scholar?

483
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,280
Why not?

484
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,530
You'll wear the golden flower
and walk down the Imperial Street,

485
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,320
earn a noble title for your mother!

486
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,840
You've been saying that
since you were little.

487
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,770
Have you forgotten it?

488
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,080
You're lying!

489
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,250
They all said that Bolin and I

490
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,120
are descendants of criminals.

491
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,530
Let alone becoming the top scholar,

492
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,170
we can't even take the exam at all!

493
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,880
Who, who said that?

494
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,800
Who said that?

495
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,770
They all say that.

496
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,410
Once we walked into the classroom,

497
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,170
they all started laughing at us,

498
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,970
saying we have no shame.

499
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,210
Don't believe what they said!

500
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,450
They were all lying!

501
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,360
We've asked the teacher.

502
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,930
Even the teacher said so.

503
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,320
He said that for our whole lives,

504
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:20,690
we can never become the top scholar.

505
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,490
Even if that's true,
you still have to study!

506
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,530
Tomorrow,
you'll go to school with Zhong!

507
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,600
No!

508
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,800
You must go!

509
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,840
You must!

510
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,490
I won't go!

511
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,040
I just won't go!

512
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,640
Then from now on,

513
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,010
don't call me mother anymore.

514
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,490
I don't have a son like you!

515
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,170
Mother?

516
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,040
Shut up!

517
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,970
Mother, don't do this to me...

518
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,320
Boli,

519
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,450
I'm not forcing you.

520
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,210
You're the best kid.

521
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,120
Good boy.

522
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,530
I like you

523
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,770
when you study well at school.

524
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:17,970
You only like

525
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,280
the boy who goes to school.

526
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:19,970
You only like

527
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,770
the boy who studies hard!

528
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,250
Boli,

529
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,770
Boli!

530
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,280
That's not like that!

531
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,560
No,

532
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,640
Boli...

533
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,730
You are what's most important to me.

534
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,930
[Hua Mansion]

535
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,450
What...

536
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,080
What happened?

537
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:49,970
Boli,

538
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:50,560
Boli!

539
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,560
Why is he running away?

540
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,250
Let's go tell the ladies.

541
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:53,880
What should we do?

542
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,930
Hua Zhi,

543
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,210
Hua Zhi!

544
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,280
Help!

545
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,170
What's wrong, Aunt Qi?

546
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,170
Boli ran away!

547
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,360
I couldn't find him anywhere.

548
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,120
What happened?

549
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,250
It was all my fault.

550
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,210
All my fault!

551
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,170
All my fault...

552
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,250
Boli!

553
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,450
- Boli!
- Boli!

554
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:16,770
Madam,

555
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,690
have you seen a boy

556
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:18,280
about this high?

557
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:18,840
No, no.

558
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,770
Boli, where are you?

559
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,970
A boy this tall,

560
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,730
have you seen him?

561
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,640
Boli!

562
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,970
Sir, have you seen a

563
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,880
boy about this tall?

564
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,840
Boli! Boli!

565
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,800
Boli!

566
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,730
I don't want to go to school.

567
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,840
Why do they make me?

568
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,640
Is school really that good?

569
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
I just like to play.

570
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,840
I just don't like going to school.

571
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,120
Where are you, Boli?

572
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,280
Boli!

573
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,360
Boli?

574
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:47,770
Have you seen

575
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:48,600
a child this tall?

576
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,320
No.

577
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,280
Really?

578
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,250
Really not.

579
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,800
Thank you.

580
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,640
Help, help!

581
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,770
Boli?

582
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,170
Is that you?

583
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,120
Ms. Qin!

584
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,120
- Boli!
- Boli!

585
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:29,930
Boli!

586
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,690
He's here! Come on!

587
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,360
Is there anyone who can swim?

588
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,170
Quickly get down and save him!

589
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,040
Let's go!

590
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,320
Boli!

591
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,490
- Madam...
- Mother!

592
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,280
Boli,

593
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,120
are you alright?

594
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,450
Mother.

595
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,360
Are you alright, Boli?

596
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,320
I'm fine.

597
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:53,880
Mother.

598
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,560
It was all my fault.

599
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,730
It was all my fault.

600
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,040
If anything happens to you,

601
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,120
I'll die.

602
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,120
I'll die, Boli.

603
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,280
Boli...

604
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,320
He's fine.

605
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,210
Good, good.

606
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,560
Let me see him.

607
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,450
My child.

608
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,730
- Mother...
- my child...

609
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,250
My child!

610
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,040
Mother.

611
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,800
Shut up!

612
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,970
What are you saying?

613
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,170
Have you lost your mind?

614
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,600
Zhegui,

615
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,560
Let's go!

616
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,690
Madam, Madam!

617
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:49,880
Stop talking,

618
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,880
and help them inside, hurry!

619
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,010
Stop looking at them. Just go!

620
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:54,800
Get back, go.

621
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,600
Hurry up.

622
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,280
Get back, all of you.

623
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,880
Stop looking at them.

624
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,770
My child.

625
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,040
My child.

626
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,600
My child.

627
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,080
My child...

628
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,210
What's the use of murmuring?

629
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,080
We, as concubines,

630
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,970
are simply not destined for better.

631
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,040
My child.

632
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,360
My child.

633
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,600
My child...

634
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,880
Qin,

635
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:03,010
if Mother loves me,

636
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,560
why did she force me to do
what I don't like?

637
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,640
If she doesn’t love me,

638
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,560
why did she cry for me?

639
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,800
Your mother?

640
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,280
The one lying in the woodshed

641
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,320
is your real mother.

642
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,530
Qin, what are you saying?

643
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,530
How could my mother
be in the the woodshed?

644
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,730
Do you know why Ms. Qin

645
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,040
doesn’t live in a proper room,

646
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,170
but stays in the woodshed?

647
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,320
Do you know why she

648
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,690
always looks at you secretly?

649
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,930
Do you know why she

650
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,880
risked her own life to save you,

651
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:32,970
while knowing

652
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:33,840
she can't swim?

653
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,320
Yeah, why?

654
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,730
Because you are her son,

655
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,320
and she is your birth mother.

656
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,250
If that's really the case,

657
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,080
I can't keep her here.

658
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,360
Of course, you can’t!

659
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,690
But, we need to talk to Hua Zhi

660
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,930
and Madam Hua about this.

661
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,690
No!

662
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,410
I know what you’re thinking,

663
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,880
She's from your quarters.

664
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,210
Are you’re still trying to protect her!

665
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,640
Boli is safe and sound now.

666
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,840
She has played a part in that after all.

667
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,080
But now, Boli

668
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,170
knows everything.

669
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,800
He is all I have.

670
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,320
How dare she try to steal my son!

671
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,730
No matter what,

672
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,770
I won't let her get what she wants!

673
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,770
Then tell me

674
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,970
what should we do.

675
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:50,800
Sell her off!

676
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,880
The contract has been burned.

677
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,690
Then just kick her out!

678
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,690
Tell her to go begging on the street!

679
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,730
Whatever!

680
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,170
In any case, we can't

681
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,560
keep her in the family!

682
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:05,560
Alright, alright...

683
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,930
Jin'e,

684
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,360
I, Qi Huilan,

685
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,040
have never asked anyone for anything.

686
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,490
Just for this one thing,

687
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,530
I'm begging you.

688
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,880
You are not me.

689
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,690
You don't know how anxious I am.

690
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,800
I really can't wait,

691
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,490
not even for another second!

692
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,880
Let's do it right now.

693
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,010
Right now!

694
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,690
Huilan...

695
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,690
Hurry up,

696
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,690
pack up some of my clothes

697
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,530
and take them to the door.

698
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,280
Yes.

699
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,210
[Hua Mansion]

700
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,450
Mother!

701
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,770
Mother...

702
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,360
Madam Xia, Madam Qi,

703
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,530
I'm begging you...

704
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:47,970
Get up.

705
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:49,210
Please don't kick my mother out!

706
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,930
Get up.

707
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,970
Madam Xia, Madam Qi...

708
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,600
Mother!

709
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,600
Mother!

710
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,120
Look,

711
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,360
she looks so pitiful.

712
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,410
Please don't throw her out!

713
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Please!

714
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,640
What's going on?

715
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,080
What in the world is going on?

716
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,690
Ms. Qin has broken the rule.

717
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,120
We can't let her stay.

718
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,600
She just saved your son,

719
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,730
snd suffered such injuries.

720
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,170
What great rule did she break

721
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,010
to deserve such punishment?

722
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,770
Hua Zhi,

723
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,770
don't blame me
for showing you no respect.

724
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,690
If you truly want to keep her here,

725
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,770
I will try everything

726
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,730
to kill her!

727
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,730
Hua Zhi,

728
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,320
I'm begging you,

729
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,770
please save my mother!

730
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,010
If she goes out like this,

731
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,280
she'll die!

732
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,410
Hua Zhi,

733
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,210
please!

734
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,210
Please save my mother!

735
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:01,970
Madam Hua,

736
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,690
about this...

737
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,560
I'm afraid you need to say something.

738
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,840
I am in charge of the house now.

739
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,120
Regarding this matter,

740
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,210
I should have the final say.

741
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,800
Then say it.

742
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,530
The Yuexiu Tavern

743
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,800
is now our major client.

744
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,690
The manager over there

745
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,690
has asked me several times

746
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,730
for someone clever.

747
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,730
I think Ms. Qin is the one.

748
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,360
On the 10th, 20th,
and 30th of each month,

749
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,040
she must come back

750
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,410
to report to me in person.

751
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,770
The rest of the time,
she may not return home.

752
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,450
Madam Qi, are you satisfied?

753
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,280
This will work!

754
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:46,010
Since Hua Zhi

755
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,040
has said so,

756
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,730
we, as elders,

757
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,210
should show her some respect, right?

758
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:08,640
Zhong,

759
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:09,930
take her to be settled.

760
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,360
Okay.

761
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,210
Let's go.

762
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,530
Mother.

763
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:21,560
Mother.

764
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,640
Mother...

765
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,660
[Hua Mansion]

766
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,360
Have you checked on Shaoyao?

767
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:47,970
What's the matter?

768
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,250
Who made you

769
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,450
unhappy this time?

770
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,010
Yesterday, Aunt Xia told me

771
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:53,840
about something.

772
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,170
What?

773
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,930
It turns out that Ms. Qin

774
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,040
is Boli's real mother.

775
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,410
Aunt Qi and Uncle Pingyuan
didn't have children,

776
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,730
so they adopted him.

777
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,120
You never knew?

778
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,530
Apart from my youngest sisters,

779
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,490
everyone knows

780
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,040
but me.

781
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,600
You just didn't care.

782
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:14,730
You're right.

783
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
I used to

784
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,450
live in my own world.

785
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:18,640
I didn't feel

786
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,600
so close to them.

787
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,320
I didn't like talking to them.

788
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,840
I knew nothing about their lives.

789
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,040
They were

790
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,210
like strangers to me.

791
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,930
After we lost Hua Mansion,

792
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,120
we supported each other as a family.

793
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,080
It was then I truly got to know them.

794
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,320
No need for self-blame.

795
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,530
Actually, that's how a family is.

796
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,490
Life is short.

797
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,530
There are many related to you by blood,

798
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,450
yet how many of them

799
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,690
can you truly form a connection with?

800
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,170
In that case,

801
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,730
I'm glad I went to
the copper shop that day.

802
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,530
Fortunately,
you didn't leave a step earlier

803
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,450
or later.

804
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,970
Otherwise, we would not have met.

805
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:54,040
No.

806
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,880
I was the one raid the Hua Mansion.

807
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,170
We were destined to meet.

808
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,600
It's just,

809
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,600
I'd be your enemy

810
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,770
whom you hate so much.

811
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,120
Every time after our talk,

812
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,800
I felt much relieved.

813
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,970
Please don't find me bothersome.

814
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,880
The scent of burning
and the smell of decay,

815
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,800
these four seasons, an endless cycle

816
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,930
should harmonizes

817
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,450
the rivers and canals
called Huai and Ji.

818
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,080
These five mountains,

819
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,840
named Mountain Tai, Mountain Hua,

820
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,880
Mountain Song,
Mountain Heng and Mountain Hen,

821
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,490
these five mountains.

822
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,840
Scholar, farmer, artisan, merchant

823
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,120
form the state and its people.
These four classes...

824
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,080
Mother,

825
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,880
I will study hard.

826
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,360
Good boy.

827
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,640
Level, rising, departing, entering,

828
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,490
these four tones should harmonize...

829
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:37,530
Madam Qi.

830
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,450
How can an outsider enter this place?

831
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,600
That's against the rules.

832
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:43,770
Madam Qi,

833
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:44,600
Boli,

834
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,170
my son saved his life.

835
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,640
We owe it all to you then.

836
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:52,840
Madam Qi,

837
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
I carried a basket of berry for Madam Wu

838
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,730
the other day,

839
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,210
and she rewarded us for it!

840
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,690
Thank you.

841
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,930
Please

842
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,840
keep looking after Boli.

843
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:29,880
Sure thing.

844
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:30,730
Madam Qi,

845
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:31,770
see you later.

846
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,290
Grandma,

847
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,450
this paper is so beautiful.

848
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,760
It even has floral prints on it.

849
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,890
The writing is better than mine.

850
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,240
Who wrote it?

851
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,410
An old friend of mine.

852
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,530
Back when I was at your age,

853
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,120
we already knew each other.

854
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,200
That's wonderful.

855
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,370
You have old friends.

856
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:09,600
I...

857
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,560
I haven't been seeing Hua Zhi lately.

858
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:16,530
She doesn't play with me anymore.

859
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,010
What is she busy with?

860
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:21,810
Hua Zhi said

861
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,290
that since the schools outside

862
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,120
don't want our boys,

863
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,490
we should set up our own family school.

864
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,930
These days,

865
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,160
she's traveling around the city,

866
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,600
trying to find a good teacher.

867
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,640
I'm afraid it's going to be hard.

868
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,080
I asked her about it yesterday.

869
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,330
She hadn't found one yet.

870
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:37,080
Hua Zhi

871
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,530
has been working so hard

872
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,120
that she even lost weight!

873
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,120
Madam Hua,

874
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,850
do you think this family school
is necessary?

875
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,680
Judging by how hard she tries,

876
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,680
you should know.

877
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,600
What's between Huilan and Ms. Qin,

878
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,640
the matter of Guard Li,

879
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,930
even the business,

880
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,760
none of those is as important as this.

881
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
I understand.

882
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,680
As the old saying goes,

883
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,160
making money is like
picking up soil with a needle,

884
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,240
and spending it is like
waves crashing against the sand.

885
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,930
If the boys can't go to school,

886
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,040
how would they build their careers?

887
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,720
In that case, no matter how much
money we make,

888
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,640
it won't last.

889
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,290
Without a family school,

890
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,530
the Hua family
would no longer be itself.

893
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:41,720
Hua Zhi,

894
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,290
such a good pay,

895
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,040
how come no teacher wants it?

896
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,760
Scholars, farmers,
artisans and merchants.

897
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,720
We're just too lowly in their eyes.

898
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,530
Then, shall we keep trying tomorrow?

899
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:51,640
Yes, we shall.

900
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:52,810
Aren't there still

901
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,040
two teachers on the list
we haven't visited yet?

902
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:02,240
Hua Zhi, we're home.

903
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,450
Zhong.

904
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,680
Hua Zhi,

905
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,720
Mr. Gu is here.

906
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,530
Your timing is not so good.

907
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,560
Shaoyao is

908
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,930
taking her nap at Grandmother's place.

909
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,330
It's okay.

910
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,080
Are you free right now?

911
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,970
Are you puting me to hard labor?

912
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,560
The weather has warmed up.

913
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:22,560
I want to buy Shaoyao

914
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,530
some fabric for clothes.

915
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,200
But I'm not sure what color to choose.

916
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,370
Help me.

917
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,530
Baoxia, I'll go out for a while.

918
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,160
Alright.

00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,810

00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,680
What color does Shaoyao like?

922
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,530
Before,

923
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,970
she wears whatever was given to her.

924
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,810
If she could choose,

925
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,370
she would probably pick
the light colors.

926
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,760
Why?

927
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,330
Because our mother loved wearing them.

928
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,560
She passed away many years ago.

929
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,890
She must be very beautiful.

930
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,080
That's why Shaoyao is so charming.

931
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,200
Yes.

No need.

Isn't that right?

950
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:42,680
I have

951
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:43,930
very sharp eyes.

952
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:44,720
It fits you perfectly!

953
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,330
Also,

954
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,890
it matches your vibe.

955
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:48,810
Miss,

956
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,240
take another look at this color,

957
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,200
and feel this fabric.

958
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,600
Shaoyao is a bit shorter than me.

959
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:53,370
Madam,

960
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,530
do you have anything

961
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,370
a few inches shorter?

962
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,330
I'll take this one.

963
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,410
All right.

964
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,720
I'll also have some of the fabric

965
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,490
for making a shorter one.

966
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,370
Alrighty!

967
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,560
This gown suits you very well.

968
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,890
He's right.

969
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,200
You're so pretty,

970
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,410
and your body shape is perfect as well.

971
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,930
I really wish I could tailor

972
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,290
hundreds of sets for you!

973
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,810
I want you to wear my clothes

974
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:12,560
every single day!

975
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:13,760
You guys can take a look around.

976
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,290
I'll go pick out the fabrics for you.

977
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:19,160
You'll pay for Shaoyao's cloth.

978
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,760
As for this one,
I'll pay for it myself.

979
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,410
You have been taking care of Shaoyao

980
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,010
for so long.

981
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,680
I need an opportunity to thank you.

982
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,970
That's not the same thing.

983
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,450
If you see it as a debt,

984
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,720
maybe I need to buy you

985
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,530
tens of pieces of cloth?

986
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,290
That's not what I mean.

987
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,680
I won't buy you that many,

988
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,290
but one piece is fine.

989
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,330
Try this?

990
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,290
Oh my, you look good too!

991
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,410
These two gowns

992
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,530
are made from

993
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,160
the same piece of fabric.

994
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,120
Look,

995
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,040
the pattern even matches!

996
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,370
Let me take it.

997
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
This is...

998
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,720
All the knowledgable

999
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,600
teachers in the city

1000
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,680
are on this list.

1001
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,560
I want to hire them

1002
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,410
to teach in my family school.

1003
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,890
Have you already

1004
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,810
crossed a big half of them?

1005
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,720
How did they offend you?

1006
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,200
For the time being,
there are no teachers

1007
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,930
willing to come.

1008
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,240
This notice for hiring teachers

1009
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,080
have been posted

1010
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,160
all over the city.

1011
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,890
But no one comes.

1012
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,010
Don't worry,

1013
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:39,850
there will be a way.

1014
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,560
The way you said it,

1015
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,080
sounds like you're about to
kidnap some of them.

1016
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,720
Don't talk nonsense.

1017
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,680
I am a law-abiding citizen.

1018
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:50,930
My friends...

1019
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,530
Shen, come here!

1020
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,160
Let me read this for you.

1021
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,890
Come, take a seat.

1022
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,290
Because we vowed
to rebuild our clan school,

1023
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,040
we sincerely hire virtuous scholars

1024
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,810
to enlighten the youngsters of our clan,

1025
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,160
enable them to acquire knowledge
and know the world.

1026
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,810
This is a new poem I recently wrote.

1027
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,640
Please take a look.

1028
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,410
The Hua family has prepared everything,

1029
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,930
awaiting respectfully to greet you.

1030
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,330
Everyone, listen to this!

1031
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,080
A house full of women and children
can easily attract gossip.

1032
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,560
Despite the generous pay,

1033
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,010
it is not an ideal place to go anyway.

1034
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,330
Exactly.

1035
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,450
Even if Confucius was alive today,

1036
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,490
in the Hua Family,

1037
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,450
he still wouldn't be able to

1038
00:42:27,530 --> 00:42:28,530
educate anyone well.

1039
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,490
There's no grown man
left in that family.

1040
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,640
What's so funny about that?

1041
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,930
A family without a grown man

1042
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:39,160
is dangerous.

1043
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,330
For instance,

1044
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,330
if you were to teach there,

1045
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,600
you'd be living with
a houseful of young ladies

1046
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:46,970
and charming women.

1047
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,240
For someone as gorgeous as you,

1048
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,490
who knows what kind of rumour
would there be!

1049
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,680
In that case,

1050
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,890
if someone like you

1051
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,560
take a position with the Hua family,

1052
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,240
there'd be even more rumours!

1053
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,040
A gentleman cultivates himself,

1054
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:05,200
corrects his heart within,
presents himself rightly without.

1055
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,760
If one really attracts rumour,

1056
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:09,760
one should reflect on themselves!

1057
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:11,240
We are all scholars.

1058
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,970
How can we say something

1059
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,530
so shameless?

1060
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,640
What are you angry about?

1061
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:17,930
Arguing with me is meaningless.

1062
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:20,120
A decent scholar

1063
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,720
will never go to that house.

1064
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,080
That fact,

1065
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,890
do you not understand at all?
