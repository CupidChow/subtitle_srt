[Episode 31]

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,070
Miss.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Madam.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,040
Which ones are popular?

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,150
Let me see.

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,430
This one.

30
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,710
And this one.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,400
Miss, you seem unfamiliar.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you also live nearby?

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,350
Yes.

34
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,280
My family has just moved in over there.

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,510
Our ladies and madams want
to buy some flower-shaped hairpins

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,590
but haven't found a reliable seller yet.

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,350
Miss.

38
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,560
You don't need to go elsewhere.

39
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,430
In this place,

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,030
everyone knows

41
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,190
I have all styles of hairpins.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,080
Do you often sell hairpins
at this place?

43
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,150
All the ladies and madams here

45
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,080
buy hairpins from me.

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
This is the Sun Family, right?

47
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,280
Yes.

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,470
Then what kind of styles

49
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,750
do the women of this household wear?

50
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,870
You asked the right person.

51
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,910
I often visit their residence.

52

No one

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,120
knows better than I do.

00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,360
Miss.

55
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,470
Let me tell you.

56
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,870
The third concubine

57
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,960
likes this one.

58
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,520
How many concubines are in this family?

59
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,430
Eight in total.

60
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,280
The seventh concubine

61
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,150
likes this one.

62
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,150
So,

63
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
you sent Yingchun

64
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,150
to inquire about Sun Xiang?

65
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,310
If she doesn't see it with her own eyes

66
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,310
or hear it with her own ears,

67
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,430
as an outsider,

68
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,840
whatever I say is not convincing.

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,360
Speaking of smartness,

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,030
Yingchun is not inferior to me.

71
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,870
It's just that
she never had the chance to study,

72
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,360
but she can make her own decisions.

73
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,840
It sounds like

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,430
you're boasting about yourself.

75
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,000
I am.

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Then according to what you've said,

77
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,080
Sun Xiang is a man
who never gets satisfied

78
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,960
and thinks the grass is greener
on the other side.

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,910
And he even wants
to hook up with Miss Qin.

80
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,590
Qin might look

81
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
a bit taciturn,

82
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,680
but she's a sensible person.

83
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:22,870
It's just

84
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,680
that she's not as stubborn

85
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,120
and strong-willed as Yingchun.

86
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,150
If Sun Xiang comes to her again,

87
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,520
I will have a good talk with her.

88
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,590
She will listen.

89
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,470
The kites tangled up together.

90
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Never mind.

91
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,840
Let it be.

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,190
Let them fly away together.

93
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,000
You nobleman!

94
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,120
You don't know a thing

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,190
about the plight of the down-and-out.

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
If we let them go just like that,

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
there will be no kites to fly next time.

98
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,310
Next time...

99
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,280
Next time I'll draw two for you,

100
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,400
as long as you don't mind

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,310
my ugly drawings.

102
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,840
No wonder Uncle Pingyang

103
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,080
likes flying kites.

104
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,310
Your Uncle Pingyang
is an interesting man.

105
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,150
No wonder your Aunt Wu

106
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,280
is so deeply affectionate towards him.

107
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,960
Unlike me, so uninteresting.

108
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,280
I think that's a good thing.

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,630
Being as handsome as you are,

110
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,080
if you are also interesting,

111
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,750
there'd be many girls who fancy you,

112
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,910
I can't compete.

113
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm afraid if I'm too uninteresting,

114
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,000
you won't like me, either.

115
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
Then I want no more

116
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,800
and no less.

117
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,000
Just stay the way you are now.

118
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm the only one to you.

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's enough.

120
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,160
Help me here!

121
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,310
Make way!

122
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,390
Make way!

123
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,920
That's a surprise.

124
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,870
Why not try
to attend the imperial examination?

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,430
My father will certainly help you

126
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,480
with all his might.

127
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,630
Newly arrived nine linked rings!

128
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,800
Take a look!

129
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,270
Tangram puzzles and nine linked rings!

130
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,630
All are newly arrived!

131
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,270
Sachets and chicken feather shuttlecocks.

132
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,000
Nice and fun.

133
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,560
Don't you have anyone else to play with?

134
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,720
Then I'll play with you.

135
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,480
It's fine.

136
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,600
Let's go together.

137
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,270
We can go to many places.

138
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,800
Even more interesting places.

139
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,240
Listen carefully.

140
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,160
My name is Shaoyao.

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,870
Keep up!

142
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:40,830
Your horse is running away!

143
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,480
Your face is covered in wounds.

144
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,390
This is my friend.

145
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,950
Friend?

146
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Friend.

147
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,360
Miss, feel free to take a look.

148
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:01,950
Come and see!

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
Osmanthus wine and lychee wine!

150
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,190
Shaoyao.

151
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,800
Shen Huan!

152
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
Aren't you...

153
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,750
Aren't...

154
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Mister, you forgot something!

155
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,750
Slow down.

156
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,040
Shen Huan.

157
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,390
Haven't you said

158
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,190
that you couldn't come
to hang out with me?

159
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:40,600
Shaoyao.

160
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,510
I have something to tell you.

161
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Okay.

162
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,920
In my heart,

163
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,390
you're different from everyone else.

164
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,630
Those people make friends with me

165
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,190
because of my family

166
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
or my money.

167
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:56,870
And some of them

168
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,070
just hang out with me to kill time.

169
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,560
They are okay
to hang out with anyone else.

170
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,680
Even my parents,

171
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,240
they dote on me

172
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:03,870
only because

173
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:04,800
I am their son.

174
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,270
Just someone for them to dote on.

175
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
But in your eyes,

176
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,480
I am just me.

177
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,560
You are you.

178
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,160
Such a smart

179
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,950
and amazing person.

180
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,190
Shaoyao.

181
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,310
In this world,

182
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,800
you're the only one

183
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,950
who really thinks so.

184
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,240
I am going

185
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,630
to get married soon.

186
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,040
Who are you going to marry?

187
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,070
I can hang out with her.

188
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
She would probably not want that.

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
After I get married,

190
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,560
we can no longer

191
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,510
hang out together.

192
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,120
Then...

193
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,310
Then... Can you not get married?

194
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:54,920
Yes.

195
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,240
I don't want to marry her either.

196
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,830
I...

197
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,360
I...

198
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,390
Shaoyao.

199
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,830
I've been thinking about it
for many days.

200
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,950
I feel that I might feel affection

201
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
for you.

202
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,160
What affection?

203
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,680
Affection!

204
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,920
What kind of affection?

205
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,000
Affection means

206
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,310
that I want to be with you every day.

207
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,430
If you aren't by my side,

208
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,040
I won't know

209
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
how to spend my day.

210
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,510
I feel the same.

211
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,910
So this is affection.

212
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,120
Then I also have affection for you.

213
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,910
Really?

214
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,240
No, no, that's not right.

215
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,550
What I mean is,

216
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,720
you and I,

217
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,120
just the two of us

218
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,000
being together.

219
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,670
Do you mean that too?

220
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,080
Just the two of us?

221
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,320
Well, not really.

222
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,480
I can be together

223
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
with Yanxi and Zhi.

224
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,790
I can also hang out with Duo.

225
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,720
But I don't want Bolin

226
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,120
because he always cheats.

227
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,630
Shaoyao.

228
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,960
We're not talking about the same thing.

229
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,390
How come it is not the same thing?

230
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,360
By being together,

231
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,750
I mean,

232
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,670
you and I,

233
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,720
the two of us being together.

234
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,840
Just the two of us.

235
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,790
No one else.

236
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,670
I...

237
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,000
Aren't we

238
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,320
together now?

239
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,320
That's not what I mean.

240
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,870
I...

241
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,960
Then what exactly do you mean?

242
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Take your time.

243
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,390
Shaoyao.

244
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,960
I think

245
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,120
this is as far as we can go.

246
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,240
Go?

247
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,080
Goodbye.

248
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,550
You already have eight concubines

249
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,630
and you want me to be the ninth?

250
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
You already know?

251
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,960
Your first wife

252
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,200
left two children behind

253
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,510
and you haven't thought of telling me?

254
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,720
That's right.

255
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,840
I have a son and a daughter.

256
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:40,910
But I am impressed

257
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,390
by your talent,

258
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,550
so I would like you

259
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,120
to be the mother to the two children.

260
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,910
There is no fault in that.

261
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,080
As for my eight concubines,

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,630
that's not a big deal.

263
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,440
As long as you please me,

264
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,840
what does it matter

265
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,960
even if I have a harem
filled with concubines?

266
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,840
A woman can have everything
with a man's love.

267
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,240
Miss Yingchun.

268
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,150
You must have heard of it, haven't you?

269
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,270
But if you fail to please me,

270
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,200
even if you are my only concubine,

271
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,550
you will still have a hard life.

272
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,510
Tell me.

273
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,550
Am I right?

274
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:09,870
Yes.

275
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,670
Yes, you're right.

276
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:12,630
So

277
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,600
don't blame me for this, Miss Yingchun.

278
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,670
If it were another man,

279
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,550
he wouldn't tell you

280
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,670
any of this.

281
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,360
You could only find it out

282
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,870
after you become his concubine.

283
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,270
Get out!

284
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,600
Miss Yingchun.

285
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,910
Will you give it

286
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,670
a second thought?

287
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,320
Not in a million years.

288
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,390
Young Lady.

289
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,750
What did he say?

290
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,790
He was lying through his teeth.

291
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,240
I pretended to be a customer

292
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,630
and went to three of his tea shops.

293
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,630
His shops are highly mismanaged

294
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,480
and are running at a severe loss.

295
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,120
I also went to his residence
in the Imperial Capital

296
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,000
and inquired about how things were
in his family.

297
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,270
Young Lady.

298
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,480
Now I know why in the first place
you sent me to look into him.

299
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,750
Thank you.

300
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,750
You finally came to your senses,

301
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,200
Yingchun.

302
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:05,150
Who would do business

303
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,550
with a man like him?

304
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,510
Right.

305
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,150
In his dreams.

306
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Let's go reconcile the accounts.

307
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,360
Alright.

308
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,030
Kick it this way.

309
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,630
This is the imperial garden.

310
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,030
How dare you fool around here?

311
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,550
You've got some nerve.

312
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,000
Please forgive us.

313
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,630
We won't do this again.

314
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,000
Give them back their shuttlecock.

315
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,360
On such a lovely spring day,

316
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,960
if I were their age,

317
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,480
I would do it, too.

318
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,600
Let's go.

319
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,030
Greetings, Grandmother.

320
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,790
Yanxi.

321
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,840
Look at this garden.

322
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,870
What a charming scene

323
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,670
with everything thriving.

324
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,000
Yet within this year,

325
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
I have lost another son

326
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,390
and two grandchildren.

327
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,670
Grandmother.

328
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,360
I hope you won't blame me.

329
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,720
What is there for me to blame you for?

330
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,790
We were born into the royal family,

331
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,390
so we must obey the kismet

332
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,080
and the Emperor's will.

333
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,120
Look at this Imperial Palace.

334
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,960
It is where we live,

335
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,600
but it is not where we belong.

336
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,670
The descendants of your Gu Family

337
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,120
are related to each other by blood.

338
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,550
But that's not what makes a family.

339
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,320
I have nowhere else to go.

340
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,440
But Yanxi,

341
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,390
you are different.

342
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,840
You are 23 this year, aren't you?

343
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,390
It's time to get married.

344
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,080
Be it the Imperial Palace

345
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,240
or Lord Ling's Mansion,

346
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,000
it's bleak everywhere.

347
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,390
Find someone
who can bring you happiness.

348
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,670
What?

349
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,510
You've already found one?

350
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,670
You see right through me, Grandmother.

351
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,840
My mother gave me this as my dowry

352
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,630
when I entered the Palace.

353
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,550
Now I pass it to you.

354
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,630
If you already have a girl
that you like,

355
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,120
give it to her

356
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,670
as a betrothal gift.

357
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
Thank you, Grandmother.

358
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,960
Lady Qin.

359
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,200
What's the matter?

360
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,150
That Mr. Sun.

361
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,840
Lady Zhi won't buy tea from him.

362
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,240
Do you know why?

363
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,840
I never inquire

364
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
about your business matters.

365
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,840
Why should I need to know?

366
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Because he was so full of lies.

367
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,510
He has eight concubines

368
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,240
and two children.

369
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,360
He just wants a woman
who can take good care of his children.

370
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,270
Yingchun.

371
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,910
Thank you for telling me this.

372
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,080
Look. I threw that in.

373
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,750
What are you all doing here?

374
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,960
You are so annoying.

375
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,910
Who upset you?

376
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:06,480
Get lost!

377
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,510
All of you!

378
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,130
[Peach Blossoms
and Green Willows in Spring]

379
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,570
[Peach Blossoms
and Green Willows in Spring]

380
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,480
This little vixen!

381
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,200
They will be out soon, I guess.

382
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,390
Run slower.

383
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,320
Come.

384
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,320
Slow down.

385
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,120
Go that way.

386
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,120
Are you okay?

387
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,960
Don't cry, little boy.

388
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,590
Do you want some pastry?

389
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,280
[Sun Mansion]

390
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,070
Does it taste good?

391
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,070
Yes.

392
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,030
I will buy you more next time.

393
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,680
Okay?

394
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,480
Okay.

395
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,880
Thank you, miss.

396
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,880
Master, she...

397
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,510
Does it taste good, Xin?

398
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,070
Yes.

399
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,000
Miss Qin.

400
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,030
Father.

401
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,550
Mr. Sun.

402
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,680
I have never thought

403
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,790
destiny brought us together again.

404
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,790
You are Xin's father.

405
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,200
You brought him back?

406
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,680
No wonder
I could get along so well with Xin

407
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,270
even though we just met.

408
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,070
He wouldn't stop crying

409
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,200
unless I promised to walk him home.

410
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,550
Xin.

411
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,790
Say thanks to this miss.

412
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,400
Thank you, miss.

413
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,480
Xin is such a good child.

414
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,960
[Reflect Carefully
and Practice Earnestly]

415
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,960
What's that sound?

416
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,790
I don't know.

417
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,880
That tea merchant,

418
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:10,750
Sun Xiang.

419
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,960
He comes to propose a marriage.

420
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
To whom?

421
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,070
I wasn't quite convinced

422
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,590
about what Yingchun said before,

423
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,590
so I had someone ask around.

424
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,110
Everything Yingchun said was true.

425
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,590
Why do you still make this choice?

426
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,030
Qin,

427
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,440
we are no longer

428
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,400
in dire straits now.

429
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,680
You really don't have to marry

430
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,000
a dishonest man like him.

431
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,000
Mother.

432
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,790
You don't have to worry.

433
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,750
I don't care

434
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,270
how many children he has

435
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,640
or how many concubines he has.

436
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,310
After I marry him,

437
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,590
if I can be virtuous

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,960
and take good care of the children,

439
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,110
I'm sure he will treat me well.

440
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,000
Aunt Xia.

441
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,830
Ms. Qin.

442
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,640
I want to have a few words with her.

443
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,110
Zhi.

444
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,240
I know you always

445
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,200
want the best for me.

446
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:11,640
However,

447
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,510
I know what I am doing.

448
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,350
Qin.

449
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,680
If you have any doubts or hesitation

450
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,680
about this marriage,

451
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,680
I will step in

452
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,400
and return all these things.

453
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,790
I won't let him
make things difficult for you.

454
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,680
Zhi, it's nothing like that.

455
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,720
I can't be more sure
about this marriage.

456
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,510
I know that Mr. Sun

457
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,680
might not be such a perfect match.

458
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,960
But...

459
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,510
I'm nowhere near perfect, either.

460
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,110
Even before

461
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,720
our family was raided,

462
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,240
there have never been
any noble descendants

463
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,750
proposed marriage to me.

464
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,550
And now,

465
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,880
we are just a merchant family

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,830
without any court officials.

467
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,270
I am just a concubine's daughter

468
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,640
and inferior to you and Ling.

469
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,030
Qin,

470
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,310
we don't care about
who you are born of in this family.

471
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,160
Do you really want
to marry such a person?

472
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,550
If I don't marry him,

473
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,200
I probably won't have a better choice

474
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,680
in the future.

475
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,350
Zhi.

476
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,960
I am just a normal girl.

477
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:08,680
I am not

478
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,440
as capable and smart as you are.

479
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,270
Speaking of which,

480
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,880
I owe you an apology.

481
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,830
What's to apologize for?

482
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,310
I thought once,

483
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,720
since you called off the engagement
with Mr. Shen Qi,

484
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,880
maybe I could...

485
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,480
He is truly a good man

486
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,510
and the best match
I can ever possibly have.

487
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,720
But

488
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,350
a person like him

489
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,200
won't consider
marrying a person like me.

490
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,310
You are overthinking.

491
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,830
You just haven't been in the right place
at the right time.

492
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,160
Could you just be more patient?

493
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
No.

494
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,160
The madams in our family

495
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,350
didn't even know

496
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,480
what their future husbands looked like

497
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
before they got married.

498
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,830
And I have known

499
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,920
what Sun Xiang looks like.

500
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,830
That's good enough for you?

501
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,270
Yes.

502
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,680
He's neither old nor ugly

503
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,510
and his business is thriving.

504
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,350
Besides, he's willing to marry me
through a proper betrothal process.

505
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,200
I have thought it through

506
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,750
calmly.

507
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,400
Mr. Sun

508
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,830
probably is the best person
I can get to marry.

509
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:13,960
Qin.

510
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,510
You don't have to regard marriage

511
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,960
as the ultimate goal of your life.

512
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,920
Aunt Xian got a divorce
and she turned out fine.

513
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,920
Besides,

514
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,590
we are your family.

515
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,240
You can also rely on us.

516
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,070
Zhi,

517
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,310
I am getting married.

518
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,440
Don't say something
inauspicious like that.

519
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,440
Wish me well.

520
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,880
Now I know what getting married means.

521
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,510
Shen Huan is also getting married.

522
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,350
Where will he be taken
in the bridal sedan chair?

523
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,310
Young Lady.

524
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,200
Several orchardists

525
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,510
have delivered the fruits
to our backyard.

526
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,880
Let's go and take a look.

527
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,920
Let's go.

528
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,160
Have you finished counting?

529
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,510
Just halfway through,

530
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,270
but I forgot everything after I saw you.

531
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,200
Why are you here?

532
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:21,960
I came to figure out

533
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,110
how you would
arrange the wedding affairs.

534
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,000
But I was too busy to catch up.

535
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,350
What do you think?

536
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:27,480
I think

537
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,830
something is not right.

538
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm all ears.

539
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Usually,

540
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,920
the elder sister gets married first

541
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,920
and the younger sister comes later.

542
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
You have such a glib tongue.

543
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:38,720
Hua Zhi.

544
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,960
This is for you.

545
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,720
This must have cost you a lot more

546
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,790
than your monthly allowance for months.

547
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,750
It cost

548
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,110
way more than that.

549
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,790
But I don't care.
I want you for the rest of my life.

550
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,350
Where did you get this from?

551
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,790
It was given by an elder

552
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,550
as a gesture of goodwill.

553
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,110
It's late now.

554
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,880
How could she be so arrogant?

555
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,110
Sister-wives.

556
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,110
You see?

557
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,110
It's been so late.

558
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,590
And she hasn't shown up.

559
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,590
This new madam

560
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,790
is quite something, huh?

561
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,310
The sun's already high in the sky,

562
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
and she hasn't gotten up yet.

563
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,830
Exactly.

564
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,030
Although the Hua Family is no longer
what it used to be,

565
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:44,200
they were once a prestigious family.

566
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,310
How come she is so ill-mannered?

567
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,640
You may not know

568
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,070
that this new madam

569
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,440
is actually born of a concubine.

570
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,270
Is that so?

571
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,960
I thought she was the daughter

572
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,720
of that formidable Madam Xia.

573
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,790
No.

574
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,720
She was born to a concubine
of Madam Xia's husband.

575
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,790
Speaking of that concubine,

576
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,440
she is also a laughingstock herself.

577
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,790
Come on, tell us about it.

578
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,550
Come on, spill it.

579
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,480
This concubine...

580
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,350
Greetings, Madam.

581
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,070
Did I tell you to sit down?

582
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,960
Master has entrusted

583
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,480
your indentured servitudes to me

584
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,240
and I have already reviewed them

585
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,750
early this morning.

586
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,790
That was

587
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,000
why you came here so late.

588
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,110
We wondered

589
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,310
why you

590
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,440
got up late.

591
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,480
From now on, do not interrupt

592
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,960
when I speak.

593
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,270
Yes.

594
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,920
Ms. Zhang.

595
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,960
Ms. Li.

596
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,110
Ms. Xue.

597
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,160
Ms. Hong.

598
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
You

599
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,310
should be Ms. Wang, right?

600
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,590
Frankly speaking,

601
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,640
Master keeps you as his concubines

602
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,750
for the sake of bearing offspring.

603
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,240
Yet you all

604
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,310
failed to live up to expectations.

605
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,750
Only the late Madam

606
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,480
left behind two children.

607
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,720
What about you?

608
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,550
Ms. Hu.

609
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,350
Yes.

610
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,070
You are the master's first concubine.

611
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,880
The only thing
that you should care about

612
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,310
is to bear offspring for the master.

613
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,070
But what you do all day

614
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,000
is gossip about nonsense

615
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,000
with this bunch of yentas.

616
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,310
What's the use of keeping you here?

617
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,550
You're right, Madam.

618
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,830
You're right, Madam.

619
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,110
Let me make it very clear.

620
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,830
If you can't bear children

621
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
or be disobedient,

622
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,880
which upset the master,

623
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,350
I will do what I have to do.

624
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,200
If any of you ever annoy me,

625
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,590
I will sell her

626
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,030
and find the master

627
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,680
new concubines
that are both young and pretty.

628
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,070
Do you think

629
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,350
the master will say no to that?

630
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,680
Madam, please don't sell us.

631
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,310
Madam, please don't sell us.

632
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,510
Master.

633
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,030
Come in and take a seat.

634
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,480
Come on.

635
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,590
This spot is dirty.

636
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,640
Swipe the dust over there.

637
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,680
Quickly.

638
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,790
[Resolve and Purpose]

639
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,350
Yingzhen.

640
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,920
Fudong visited us three days ago

641
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,880
for the first time
after she was married.

642
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,310
Hua Qin is on her way back now.

643
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,640
You should be happy about this.

644
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,200
Why do you sigh?

645
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,070
Huilan.

646
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,550
How would you know the bitterness
in my heart?

647
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,550
You've never raised a daughter.

648
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,960
I am thinking

649
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,200
Zhi and Rong will get married

650
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,920
one day.

651
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,590
You think too much.

652
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,160
Is Hua Qin here?

653
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,110
Madams, it's someone from the Palace.

654
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:23,830
The Palace?

655
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,550
The Palace?

656
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,750
What? What's the matter?

657
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,030
Madams, there's nothing serious.

658
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,240
They say our pastries

659
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,270
are too famous.

660
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,240
Even the Empress Dowager
couldn't stop praising them.

661
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,200
So they want the head of our family

662
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,720
to bring some to the Palace.

663
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,310
That's wonderful!

664
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,640
Rise.

665
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,550
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

666
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,960
The last time I saw you,

667
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,550
you were so heartbroken.

668
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,590
I'm getting old,

669
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,830
so I need to seize the time
and do whatever comes to my mind.

670
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,310
I woke up this morning

671
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,720
and ate the plum cakes
made by the Hua's.

672
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,480
And then I ordered someone
to summon you to the Palace.

673
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,750
But it's already past noon

674
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,960
when we meet each other now.

675
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,640
There are many rules in the Palace.

676
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,070
It's indeed not easy for Miss Hua

677
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,550
to pay a visit here.

678
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,310
Miss Hua.

679
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,550
Come closer.

680
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,550
Did Yanxi give you this bracelet?

681
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,270
Yes.

682
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,110
You must know

683
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,070
his identity.

684
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,680
How nice!

685
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,000
When you are young,

686
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,200
you are just afraid of nothing.

687
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,400
When Wan was young,

688
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,960
she was also full of life and vigor

689
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,720
and did whatever she wanted.

690
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
Back then,

691
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,830
we had a pact

692
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,350
that we would only talk about
romantic themes.

693
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,000
Pretending that

694
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,590
we have never got married,

695
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,240
been other people's wives,

696
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,200
or given birth to children.

697
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
We just pretended

698
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,000
we always stayed at seventeen.

699
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
Therefore,

700
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,240
until her death,

701
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,400
I had never even thought about

702
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,350
meeting her descendants.

703
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,070
You are not surprised at all

704
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,790
after you heard what I said.

705
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,790
You must have

706
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,880
read our letters.

707
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,240
Yes.

708
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,640
When my grandmother was alive,

709
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,880
she would often
have me read the letters.

710
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,750
I have also transcribed those letters.

711
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,750
You are making me blush.

712
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
When your grandmother and I first met,

713
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,510
I was troubled

714
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,000
by marriage affairs.

715
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,000
Lady.

716
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,550
It's not that bad to marry him.

717
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,680
And besides, His Highness...

718
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,070
Don't mention him.

719
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:28,680
Who is there?

720
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,070
Who is coming this way?

721
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,960
What an audacious scoundrel!

722
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,160
Get out!

723
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,200
Don't get mad.

724
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,110
I thought it was empty here.

725
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,070
Who are you?

726
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,240
I am going to hunt outside the city.

727
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,240
Just passing by.

728
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,480
Later,

729
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,440
she stayed with us and wouldn't leave.

730
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,590
We stayed there to hide from the heat.

731
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,720
And for the first time,

732
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,480
I mounted a horse.

733
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,550
Even though at that time

734
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,200
I still didn't dare to take the reins.

735
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,680
Time flew.

736
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,000
I married the late Emperor.

737
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,200
Then I bestowed Zihuang Residence

738
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,750
to Wan.

739
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,000
I see.

740
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,590
Every summer,

741
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,270
my grandmother would live
in the Residence for a while

742
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,830
and she allowed no one to follow.

743
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
While she was alive,

744
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,110
there wasn't a day she didn't miss you.

745
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
But that didn't change anything.

746
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,550
The moment I entered the Palace,

747
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,070
to live freely just

748
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,920
became an empty hope.

749
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,960
I can barely see my family

750
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,750
for the rest of my life,

751
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,790
let alone friends.

752
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,510
As Yanxi's grandmother,

753
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,350
if he can have a girl like you
by his side,

754
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,200
I feel happy for him.

755
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,680
But as the friend of your grandmother,

756
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,350
I must remind you

757
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,310
it will be harder for you

758
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:13,110
in Lord Ling's Mansion.

759
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,030

00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
on that day.

951
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,670
That was different.

952
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
I was the one
whose engagement was called off,

953
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,230
but you were about to get married.

954
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,670
I don't like that Miss Jiang.

955
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,280
How should I put it?

956
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,400
Actually,

957
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,590
when I was engaged,

958
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,360
I didn't know anything about Hua Zhi.

959
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,190
And I didn't know

960
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,480
whether I would like her.

961
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,400
So

962
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,760
perhaps in the future,

963
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,550
you'll come to like Miss Jiang.

964
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,630
You can't be so certain.

965
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,710
You are already emotionally unavailable.

966
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,550
Fine.

967
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,150
I won't ask who she is.

968
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:49,960
Just tell me.

969
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,110
Does she feel the same way?

970
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,480
Even if she doesn't,

971
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,000
does that mean

972
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:55,760
I can ignore my feelings

973
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,030
and marry another person?

974
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,670
For instance,

975
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,630
you still like Hua Zhi,

976
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,920
but if our parents require you

977
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:02,400
to marry someone else,

978
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:03,880
will you do it?
