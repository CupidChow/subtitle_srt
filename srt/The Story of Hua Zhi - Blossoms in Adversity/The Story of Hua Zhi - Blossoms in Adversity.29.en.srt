00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,670
and there're a few rooms
on the second floor.

196
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,150
Given the current situation,

197
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,390
maybe you

198
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,030
and your maids

199
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,750
can stay there temporarily.

200
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,270
Then you can take your time
to look for a new place.

201
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,510
We'll do as you said then, Mr. Bai.

202
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,030
There are still some things
left in the house.

203
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll go get them.

204
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,270
I could use some help.

205
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,670
I've examined
the entire body of His Majesty,

206
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,910
but found nothing.

207
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,510
The needle,

208
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,510
where could it be?

209
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,750
Let me ask you this.

210
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,750
Lord Xian has shown you no favor,

211
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,150
nor has he offered you any reward.

212
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,270
Jixiang,

213
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,150
why did you try
to assassin His Majesty for him?

214
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,270
Why did you commit such a crime
that can get your entire family killed?

215
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:34,030
You're right.

216
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,480
Lord Xian bears me no favor.

217
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,240
But I hold a grudge against the emperor.

218
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,320
I have no family anyway.

219
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,000
I was an orphan.

220
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,750
That year, His Majesty started a draft.

221
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,630
He forcibly conscripted our grains
for horse feed,

222
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,240
which led to the death
of my foster parents.

223
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,960
I got castrated and entered the Palace

224
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,960
just to seek an opportunity.

225
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,120
Lord Xian

226
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,720
granted me this opportunity.

227
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:38,960
Mr. Bai.

228
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,030
Miss Hua.

229
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,750
Is everything fine?

230
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,320
Yes, everything has been settled.

231
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,390
Earlier today,

232
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,360
your maids carried out all those

233
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,390
gold and silver from within the ruins.

234
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,150
The commoners who saw that
were so shocked

235
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,550
that they even called you
"Goddess of Wealth"!

236
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,790
Now you have this restaurant.

237
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,480
In the future,

238
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,600
you'll be making a serious fortune.

239
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,440
Mr. Bai,

240
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,790
I must thank you

241
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,910
for escorting my family today.

242
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,200
You're welcome.

243
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,600
That was nothing.

244
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,750
Who doesn't have a family to care for?

245
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,720
Speaking of which,

246
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,030
I have a favor to ask.

247
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,270
How can I help?

248
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,510
Just like what we said

249
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,790
when we first met here,

250
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,110
be it a contest or a competition,

251
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,720
it was all for making this restaurant

252
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,110
famous in the Imperial Capital

253
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,000
and known to everyone.

254
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:20,880
Indeed.

255
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,000
In this way,

256
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,880
Tangxi Restaurant would become
renowned throughout the capital.

257
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,590
Whoever ends up winning it

258
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,030
can enjoy this fame.

259
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,310
Therefore, Mr. Bai,
I would like to ask you

260
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,590
to run this restaurant together with me.

261
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,240
We combine finances and resources

262
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,270
to complement strengths
and make up for weaknesses.

263
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,350
Fudong will be in charge of the kitchen

264
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,240
and you will hire the head shopkeeper.

265
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,440
Well...

266
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,000
Miss Hua, your help in my hour of need

267
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,350
will forever be remembered!

268
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,640
You're welcome.

269
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,920
Back then,

270
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,880
when we had nothing,

271
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,590
it was you who extended a helping hand

272
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,750
and supported us

273
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,960
with Yunlai Restaurant.

274
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,200
Zhi.

275
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,160
Aunt Xia.

276
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,510
What's the matter?

277
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,200
We wanted to ask you this yesterday.

278
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,750
The others are
too embarrassed to say it.

279
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,590
So they let me be the one.

280
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,590
What is it?

281
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,920
Come here.

282
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,550
Yesterday,

283
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,000
Mr. Bai sent us home, right?

284
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,110
On our way,

285
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,920
we saw

286
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,110
the inspectors from the Security Bureau

287
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,310
arresting and killing people.

288
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,680
The scene was chaotic.

289
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,310
And that leader...

290
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,310
Maybe I saw it wrong,

291
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,880
but he looked like,

292
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:34,830
like...

293
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,790
Mr. Yan?

294
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,400
Just pretend I didn't ask.

295
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,880
I mean,

296
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,750
how could someone as honest as Mr. Yan

297
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,030
serve in the Security Bureau?

298
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,750
He's the Commander
of the Security Bureau.

299
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,790
He, he...

300
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,110
He is...

301
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,550
The...

302
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,790
Aunt Xia,

303
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,400
just pretend you don't know this.

304
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,880
Do not tell my mother and the others.

305
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,310
It would scare them so badly.

306
00:18:59,310 --> 00:18:59,640
Then...

307
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,480
Then you and him...

308
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,830
The two of you...

309
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,790
My mother was right about one thing.

310
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,030
No one can predict the future.

311
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,030
He and I only

312
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,240
have the present.

313
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,110
Gu Yanxi,

314
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,350
it has already been a day and a night.

315
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:30,880
I...

316
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,200
His Majesty arrives!

317
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,750
Your Majesty.

318
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,510
Changqing,

319
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,790
help His Majesty up.

320
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,350
Yes.

321
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,510
So that's how it is!

322
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,590
I always thought it was poison

323
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,960
that put His Majesty in a coma.

324
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,790
But I didn't expect

325
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,830
that someone

326
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,880
inserted a needle
into the skull of His Majesty!

327
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,880
The needle has now been removed.

328
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,110
What will happen to His Majesty?

329
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,350
Uncle?

330
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:28,960
Your Majesty!

331
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,550
Lord Xian,

332
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,920
are you surprised

333
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,960
to see me?

334
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,030
Father,

335
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,400
I made a mistake!

336
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,000
Rise.

337
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,680
Changqing.

338
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,270
Father,

339
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,480
how did we

340
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,880
end up in such a situation?

341
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,680
You still regard me as your father?

342
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,240
And when have you treated me as a son?

343
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,790
In this world,

344
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,110
only you are revered.

345
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,030
The rest of us

346
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,590
are merely bricks and tiles
laying your throne

347
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,920
and dogs and horses
that fight and bite for you.

348
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,400
We are like trivial specks of dust.

349
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,240
Fate destined me

350
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,680
to be born into the royal family.

351
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,960
Even beasts know to lick their calves

352
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:52,240
and wolves protect their young.

353
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,200
But I

354
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,830
was born in the Palace.

355
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,110
For twenty years,
I have been vigilant day and night,

356
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,270
like treading on thin ice.

357
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,790
And what terrifies me the most

358
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,400
is actually my own father.

359
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,960
Isn't what's happening today

360
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,400
the result of your own doing?

361
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,640
Well said!

362
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,000
It was all my own fault.

363
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,350
So be it.

364
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,310
Dying today

365
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,200
is better than endless torment to come.

366
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,000
Yanxi.

367
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,750
Father,

368
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,920
you didn't expect this, did you?

369
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,720
I am already

370
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,350
a captive without any weapon,

371
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,240
yet I still won't let you

372
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,720
do whatever you want to me!

373
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:29,960
I, Gu Yangong,

374
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,200
swear to heaven

375
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,640
that if there is a next life,

376
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,790
I'd rather be born as a pig,
a dog, a bug,

377
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,350
a bandit, or a beggar.

378
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,550
My only wish for every coming life

379
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,790
is to never be born
into the royal family!

380
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:22,920
Your Majesty,

381
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,440
please return.

382
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,640
Yanxi,

383
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,480
there is one more thing
that needs you to do.

384
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,400
Uncle, just give the order.

385
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,000
Though Lord Xian is dead,

386
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,830
this case cannot be closed just yet.

387
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,270
Who instigated him

388
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,920
and who supported him?

389
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,160
And if he succeeded,

390
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,110
who would have benefited from this?

391
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,750
The Security Bureau
must investigate thoroughly.

392
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:02,720
Yes.

393
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,310
Lord Xian's followers

394
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,720
must all be punished severely.

395
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,550
There is no tolerance

396
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,640
for either the royal family members

397
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
or the courtiers.

398
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,400
You don't need to have any reservations.

399
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,680
Just go ahead
and dig out everyone involved.

400
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,640
I will do as commanded.

Now, this entire Daqing Empire

402

Your Majesty, after the serious illness,

404
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,640
are you feeling comfort?

405
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,350
I felt as if I had just slept,

406

to buy hair oil for me.

451
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,790
go check the kitchen for me

452
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,680
to see if they can still
manage the workload.

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,680

you've suddenly become cold.

Is it because of Lord Xian?

461
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,160
They were going after you.

462
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,830
Lord Xian was targeting His Majesty.

463
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,880
You were afraid of implicating me,

464
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,880

would have been unimaginable.

to talk about

491
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680

Jian has

497
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,590
an unusual background.

498

I'm not sure keeping him here

499
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,790
will be a blessing or a curse
for us in the future.

500
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,200
I was thinking

501
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,510
that this family belongs to not only me,

502
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,510
so we should talk about it.

503
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,440
What do you mean by unusual?

504
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,160
Is he

505
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,270
from a wealthy family?

If the word gets out,

509
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,200
I'm afraid there will be
great misfortune.

510
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,830
I wasn't so worried until you said that.

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,720
If this really causes trouble...

00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,110
has barely survived a disaster.

517

If we don't keep him,

522
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,550
what will happen?

523
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,440
He'll never be free.

524
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,550
Perhaps he'll die soon.

525
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,750
Why...

526
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,350
Why? Why is that?

527
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,310
I was wondering

528
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,030
why he acted like a little mouse,

529
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,310
hiding from everyone.

530
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,550
So, what do you think?

531
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,310
Zhi,

532
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,830
I am also a mother now.

533
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,310
He's so little.

534
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,830
If we abandon him,

535
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,200
he will fall back into the lion's den.

536
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,350
I cannot do it.

537
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,240
People often say

538
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,550
that fortune or misfortune
hinges on one's actions.

539
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,590
But who can truly foresee

540
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,000
whether this is fortune or misfortune?

541
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,270
Right now,

542
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,440
if we keep this child,

543
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,000
it will be his good fortune.

544
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,640
Now you are in charge.

545
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,550

Zhi,

549
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,750
will you kick me out?

550
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,680
Do you want to go back to the Palace?

551
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,720
I don't.

552
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,880
Then you'd better think it over.

553
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,240
We don't keep idlers at home.

554
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,310
Tomorrow, I'll take you to the kitchen

555
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,160
and teach you how to help with the work.

556
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,640

Recently, I have been
practicing calligraphy

563

and have gained some insights.

564
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:03,030
Therefore,

Is there any news of the Sixth Prince?

581
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,440
This time, if it weren't for that boy,

582
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,440
I might not have made it.

Yes, there is.

587

Staying in this Palace,

you probably feel stressed sometimes.

591

you brought me pastries
from the Hua Family.

And today you took me here
to their restaurant.

This can't be a coincidence, can it?

In this restaurant,

00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,710
I mean, for such a long time,

- Yes, I can!

That's the Sixth Prince!

What is he doing here?

651
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,280
He ran out of the Palace,

652
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,590
mingled among the young beggars

653
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,590
with nothing to eat or wear.

654

The Hua family happened
to find him and take him in.

655
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,800
Now, they're keeping him here
as an apprentice.

Apprentice?

657
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:01,880

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,400
you even fought me for a room?

765
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,920
Why are you crying now?

766
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,550
All this time,

767
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,400
[Resolve and Purpose]
we've been through so much.

768
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,590
Before we got used to a new home,

769
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
we had to leave

770
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,030
for the next one.

771
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,230
Now, as we finally came back here,

772
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,550
I actually feel so sad.

773
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,110
If Madam Hua was still alive,

774
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,550
seeing this,

775
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,360
how happy she would be.

776
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,550
Yingzhen,

777
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,150
as long as all of us

778
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:36,920
are still together,

779
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,030
wherever we go,

780
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,230
that place is home.

781
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,960
Now we're back home.

782
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,400
Madam Hua will definitely see us

783
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,480
in heaven.

784
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,360
Where is Zhi?

785
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,360
Didn't she come here

786
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,360
one step ahead of us?
