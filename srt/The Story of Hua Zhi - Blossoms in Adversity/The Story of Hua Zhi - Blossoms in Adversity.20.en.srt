00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,580
your nephew Hua Bolin
has come to inform you about this.

191
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,460
My grandmother passed away from illness.

192
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,610
Uncle and Aunt,

193
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,370
your nephew Hua Bolin
has come to inform you about this.

194
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,850
My grandmother passed away from illness.

195
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,850
Uncle and Aunt,

196
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,130
your nephew Hua Bolin
has come to inform you about this.

197
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:46,730
Go out and take a look.

198
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,580
Who is making that noise?

199
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,060
Send them away.

200
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,490
Master.

201
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:49,900
Will do.

202
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,210
Master.

203
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,820
The young master of the Hua Family

204
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,490
is reporting death of his grandmother
at our doorstep.

205
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,490
Master.

206
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,090
Madam Hua was the mother

207
00:11:59,180 --> 00:11:59,900
of Madam Hua Jing,

208
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,330
If the Hua Family

209
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,700
accuses us of being unfilial,

210
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,460
I'm afraid it would affect
our young master's imperial examination.

211
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,090
Why didn't you say so earlier?

212
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,420
That is tricky now.

213
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,900
Uncle and Aunt,

214
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,090
why don't you open the door?

215
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,010
My grandmother passed away from illness.

216
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,250
Your nephew Hua Bolin

217
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,010
[Song Mansion]
has come to inform you about this.

218
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,460
Your nephew Hua Bolin

219
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,210
has come to inform you about this.

220
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,610
[Song Mansion]
Why haven't they come out?

221
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,180
They're coming out.

222
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:32,850
What took them so long?

223
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,970
You're making so much noise

224
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,730
standing in front of my mansion.

225
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,460
How improper!

226
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,730
It's your family's business.

227
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,090
Handle it yourself.

228
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,940
Why did he get back inside so soon?

229
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,580
What are you barking about

230
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,540
in front of my residence?

231
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,300
We have come out.

232
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,300
How can she say something so rude?

233
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,060
Come on, lead the way.

234
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,130
[Hua Mansion]
One bow.

235
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,180
Two bows.

236
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,460
Three bows.

237
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,780
Please express your gratitude.

238
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,210
Zhi.

239
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,210
Auntie Hua Jing is here.

240
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,010
You can leave us, Boli.

241
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,490
I'll go to offer my condolences.

242
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,060
Why are you standing in the way?

243
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:47,940
Move aside.

244
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,820
Auntie Hua Jing, you finally came.

245
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,180
Our house is too small for you,

246
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,610
Mrs. Song.

247
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,580
You can stay outside

248
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
to hold a vigil for Grandmother.

249
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,730
What?

250
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,250
Outside?

251
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,780
I'm following
my grandmother's last wish.

252
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,730
You're not allowed
to step into my home again.

253
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,210
But I cannot stop you

254
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,250
from being a filial daughter.

255
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,970
So you can kneel outside.

256
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,780
It makes no difference.

257
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,090
I won't do it.

258
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,130
I won't do it!

259
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,130
Why wouldn't she let me in?

260
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,300
You can't keep me outside

261
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,180
at her funeral!

262
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,370
On the day you came to ask about Fudong,

263
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,580
you didn't care at all
about my grandmother's feelings

264
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,490
and talked nonsense.

265
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,970
I'm not a heartless person

266
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,130
as you are.

267
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,490
Since you've asked,

268
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,970
I'd give you the answer you want.

269
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,060
People are watching.

270
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,820
Shut your mouth.

271
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,300
Don't you care

272
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,540
about the Hua Family's reputation
anymore?

273
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,130
You wanted to take my maid away

274
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,420
just to ingratiate your husband.

275
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,420
You came again and again
to make a scene,

276
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,580
which infuriated Grandmother
and made her fall ill.

277
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,540
Since you didn't get what you wanted,

278
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,610
you talked in a stream of obscenities,

279
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,900
threw tantrums and acted rudely.

280
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,130
You caused Grandmother to vomit blood
and die.

281
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,420
With everything you did,

282
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,540
you are just a monster.

283
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,580
I told you to kneel here

284
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,730
to hold a vigil for your own mother,

285
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,210
and you should be grateful for that!

286
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,420
Exactly.

287
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,940
She should kneel outside.

288
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,900
She was the reason why her mother died.

289
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,130
Unbelievable.

290
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:06,700
She should feel ashamed.

291
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,300
This is outrageous.

292
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,180
Just unbelievable.

293
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,250
She should kneel outside.

294
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,850
Hua Zhi.

295
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,180
How dare you keep making things up?

296
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,540
I will teach you a lesson!

297
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,210
The evidence is here.

298
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,180
It's from your family's medicine shop.

299
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,010
I'm sure

300
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:21,730
you can recognize it, right?

301
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,250
You used

302
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,700
such filthy drugs to hurt people.

303
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,180
You don't deserve
to be part of the Hua Family.

304
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,610
Do you know that?

305
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,490
Let me tell you.

306
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,700
The Song's Medicine Shop

307
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
was shut down a few days ago.

308
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,900
I heard

309
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,540
that was because of what
she's holding...

310
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:38,940
This Mrs. Song

311
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,300
caused her own mother's death.

312
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,130
She also did

313
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,330
such immoral things.

314
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,660
Yes, she is so shameless.

315
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
There's one thing you also don't know.

316
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,970
She wanted to take a maid
from her parents' home as a concubine

317
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,660
to please her husband.

318
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,210
Despicable!

319
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,060
Shameless!

320
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:13,730
Get out of there.

321
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,820
Get over here!

322
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,540
You're taking
the moral high ground, huh?

323
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,540
Ask her about her secret.

324
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,490
All you talked about
is how nasty the Song Family is.

325
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,420
Some of you are also despicable.

326
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,730
You can ask

327
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,580
Ms. Qin.

328
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,420
What has she done when she was outside?

329
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,370
Take her inside.

330
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,420
Let's go.

331
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:29,730
Tell them.

332
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,090
Tell them yourself!

333
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:32,660
You shameless woman.

334
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,090
She is an adulteress,

335
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,130
do you know that?

336
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,700
Go.

337
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,330
Mother.

338
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,130
Mother.

339
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,660
It was your fault.

340
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,010
It was all your fault.

341
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,250
You were the one who hurt me

342
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,580
and now you're blaming me.

343
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,940
Shut up.

344
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,460
Stop it!

345
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,610
I've taken many beatings in my life,

346
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,010
but you don't get

347
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,850
to lay a hand on me.

348
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,420
You shameless woman.

349
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,580
Who's shameless?

350
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,780
You're the shameless one.

351
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,730
You and that...

352
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,900
I will beat you to death,

353
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,010
you evil woman.

354
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,060
Are you out of your mind?

355
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,300
Stop it!

356
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,420
Mother.

357
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,460
Stop it.

358
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,210
Stop it!

359
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,370
Mother, I'm fine.

360
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,060
How dare you lay a hand on my daughter?

361
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,700
I will kill you!

362
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,660
Stay away from me!

363
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:38,970
Mother.

364
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,180
Stop it!

365
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,370
Go back to your home!

366
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,370
Qin Ergui!

367
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,370
I want you dead!

368
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:14,730
Mother.

369
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,180
Ms. Qin.

370
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,460
Take her back to rest.

371
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,820
Ms. Qin.

372
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:18,940
Come on.

373
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,010
Everyone, hear me out.

374
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,330
You all saw

375
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:30,490
what Mrs. Song did

376
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,780
today.

377
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,130
My family conduct ourselves
with integrity.

378
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,420
We have no guilt in our hearts

379
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,210
and we are fearless
of gossip and rumors.

380
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,210
Hua Jing wanted to
get her husband a concubine

381
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,970
at the expense
of our family's reputation.

382
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,050
Her own mother died

383
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,250
because of her own doing.

384
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,730
Today,

385
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,700
I will clean house for my grandparents

386
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,290
as the head of the family.

387
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,050
I'd like you to be my witnesses.

388
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,290
From today forth,

389
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,940
Hua Jing and her children
will be disowned from the Hua Family.

390
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,490
From now on,

391
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,140
they have nothing to do
with the Hua Family.

392
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,770
- Great.
- Great.

393
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:01,970
Well said.

394
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,810
Your Highness,
your days of confinement are over.

395
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,100
His Majesty is here to see you.

396
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,620
Your Highness.

397
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,530
Rise.

398
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,210
How's your health

399
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,380
during the days of your confinement?

400
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,940
I am well.

401
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,140
Won't you get up yet?

402
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,420
Are you blaming me
for punishing you wrongly?

403
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,380
I dare not.

404
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,970
Yanxi.

405
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,970
If you don't get up now,

406
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,010
then I will make sure
you stay here in the Shen Pavilion

407
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,010
for the rest of your life.

408
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,140
Get up.

409
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,100
Your Highness, please rise.

410
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,490
I've heard

411
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,570
you didn't eat or drink anything
during this period.

412
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,660
You've lost much weight.

413
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,770
Come on, eat something.

414
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,010
Yanxi.

415
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,570
Do you still remember

416
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,290
every time you were unhappy
when you were little,

417
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,180
it was always me who'd cheer you up.

418
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,140
At that time,

419
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,970
you weren't even as tall as this table.

420
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,900
Your mother died young

421
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,210
and you couldn't let go.

422
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,050
That means
you are a kind and filial kid.

423
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,620
Every time you saw those princes

424
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,970
laughing and talking
by their mother's side,

425
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,620
you would be upset and sulky.

426
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,290
I had to give you several chestnut cakes

427
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,700
to cheer you up.

428
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,900
You've grown up now.

429
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,140
I'm afraid

430
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,380
chestnut cakes won't work anymore.

431
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,050
Uncle, I still like chestnut cakes.

432
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,460
I just hope

433
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,050
that you won't

434
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,970
become estranged from me.

435
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,100
This has always been your home.

436
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,490
You are the only one

437
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,900
who often comes to visit me,

438
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,380
dine with me and chat with me.

439
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,250
There's no one else.

440
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,460
I understand.

441
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,050
I have already issued an imperial edict

442
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,460
to give your mother a grand burial

443
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,460
and reward her living relatives.

444
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,530
This could

445
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,490
comfort her spirit in heaven.

446
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,530
Yanxi, keep this in mind.

447
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,810
A son should be filial and obedient
to his father.

448
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,970
This is an unchanged principle.

449
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Go home.

450
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,530
Have a good talk with your father.

451
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,140
As for that matter,

452
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,490
let's turn the page on it.

453
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,860
Even I am willing to back down,

454
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,290
can't you just

455
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,340
make an apology to your father?

456
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,460
Uncle.

457
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,660
You need to listen to me.

458
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,620
Yes.

459
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,050
Changqing.

460
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,490
I'm here.

461
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,290
Do you think Yanxi has been wronged?

462
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,250
I'm afraid His Highness

463
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,770
will not forgive Lord Ling easily.

464
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,570
Lord Ling planned a rebellion that year.

465
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,100
I left it unsaid,

466
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,660
but he actually thought I was not aware.

467
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,660
It's a good thing

468
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,860
that Yanxi has brought up the past.

469
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,770
My brother has to atone for his crime
one way or another.

470
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,970
Besides,

471
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,460
Yanxi was raised by me.

472
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,660
Now he has been wronged,

473
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:50,010
so I shall seek justice for him.

474
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,050
Grandmother.

475
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,490
You left us so suddenly.

476
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
I have no one

477
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,100
to rely on anymore.

478
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,250
You rogue.

479
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,530
This time,

480
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,460
you didn't hide in Yuqing Mountain.

481
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,010
Without that woman nagging by my side

482
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,660
all day long,

483
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,460
what's the difference

484
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,940
between staying in Yuqing Mountain
and my own home?

485
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,250
Yes, indeed.

486
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,530
A few people died here because of you.

487
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,380
Who knows

488
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,420
how many died in that mountain?

489
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,290
You still feel aggrieved

490
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,770
after the confinement, huh?

491
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:21,810
No.

492
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,010
Not at all.

493
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,460
A son must be obedient to his father.

494
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,860
That's a timeless principle.

495
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,050
I shouldn't have defied you

496
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,050
no matter what happened.

497
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
I'm glad you've come to your senses.

498
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,180
Indeed.

499
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,340
Men killed their women
for different reasons,

500
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,100
but it still did not
tarnish their enduring reputation.

501
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,340
I can't help wondering though.

502
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,140
Women have always prided themselves
on bearing sons,

503
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,420
but I rarely heard

504
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,010
their filial sons

505
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,250
would revenge them
by killing their enemies.

506
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,290
You...

507
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,380
That's what you realized

508
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,460
when you reflected in the Shen Pavilion?

509
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:06,810
Father.

510
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,210
Although you didn't have much love

511
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,290
for Mother,

512
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,940
you were married young.

513
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,420
Have you ever thought of her

514
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,940
during the night?

515
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,100
So no, then.

516
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,290
You have already forgotten her,
haven't you?

517
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,490
Your mother had always been beautiful

518
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,730
since I knew her.

519
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,770
My mother was somewhat indifferent,

520
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,970
but Ms. Xiao

521
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,100
was devoted to you wholeheartedly

522
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,140
for over twenty years.

523
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,380
You were her world.

524
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,460
She died in such a miserable way.

525
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,570
Have you ever thought of her?

526
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,660
Enough.

527
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,660
Why did you bring up that viper?

528
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,180
Do you want to get punished again?

529
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
I was silly to remain hope for you.

530
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,140
How could you

531
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,380
ever feel a touch of mercy

532
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,970
and a trace of regret?

533
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,810
You know nothing.

534
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,810
If I

535
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,730
were such a weak and benevolent sort,

536
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,810
would Xiao ever want to be with me

537
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,620
with all her heart?

538
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,860
That's what they call a woman.

539
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,900
A crazy woman.

540
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,210
But in this world,

541
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,380
there are always normal people.

542
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:39,860
Look at you.

543
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,460
You are perfect on the outside,

544
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,180
but who knows

545
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,010
you are full of silly notions inside.

546
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,530
If you

547
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,620
don't respect your father,

548
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,420
then when you get married

549
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,530
and have children,

550
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,900
your women won't look up to you

551
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,860
as their guide of moral conduct.

552
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,380
It's enough for me

553
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,210
if someone I love loves me back.

554
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,420
I don't care about all those principles.

555
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:05,770
You...

556
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,140
I really didn't expect

557
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,970
a man like me

558
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,530
would have such a romantic son.

559
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,210
What's good about being practical
like you?

560
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,570
You are lonely on the top

561
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,460
without your wife and children
by your side,

562
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,940
and all you can embrace is loneliness.

563
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,050
I am indeed

564
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,340
on the top

565
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,860
without a wife and children by my side,

566
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,810
all alone.

567
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,620
You're right.

568
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,660
You're totally right.

569
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,490
But Xi,

570
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,290
don't forget

571
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,700
it's my blood that runs in your veins.

572
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,940
Let me tell you,

573
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,620
there're no romantic in our family.

574
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,970
Generation after generation,

575
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,860
we only raise monsters.

576
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:58,970
Do you really think

577
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,210
that there's a woman in this world

578
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,380
who would love

579
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,050
the Commander of the Security Bureau?

580
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,380
No.

581
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,340
Do you think

582
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,810
a woman would marry into our family

583
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,530
without any extra intentions?

584
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
They wouldn't.

585
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,460
The nobler you are,

586
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,730
the more power
you wield over life and death,

587
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,050
and the less likely anyone is
to love you with all their heart.

588
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,380
You see,

589
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,770
one after another,

590
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,210
those beautiful women

591
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,940
are chosen to enter the forbidden palace

592
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,250
or marry into royal families.

593
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,970
Which one of them ends well?

594
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,530
When I was your age,

595
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,940
I had already seen through it all.

596
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,620
As a man,

597
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,340
you always have
your resentment and desires.

598
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,290
Nobody can live a peaceful life forever.

599
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,900
Look at you now.

600
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,700
You are still so naive

601
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,290
and want to chase something
you can't have.

602
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,860
You were born into this noble family.

603
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,420
you should know that in this life,

604
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,900
power and fame
are what you should chase for!

605
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,460
Sir, you're back finally.

606
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,860
The pastries

607
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,290
that the Huas brought us.

608
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,490
Nothing rare.

609
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:31,730
It's been a few days now.

610
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,140
You'd better not eat them.

611
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,620
Hua Zhi sent them?

612
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,210
Yes.

613
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,530
It's just that some days ago,

614
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,770
Madam Hua passed away.

615
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,210
I guess they didn't feel

616
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,970
like making these honey cakes anymore.

617
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,010
The Madam of the Song Family,
which owns the herbal medicine shop,

618
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,380
is the eldest daughter of Madam Hua.

619
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,050
She has made a scene in the Hua Mansion
several times

620
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,290
and every time she left them no peace.

621
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,050
She infuriated Madam Hua,
which caused her death

622
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,180
the other day.

623
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,700
[Hua Mansion]
Miss Zhi must

624
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,730
be having a hard time lately.

625
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,140
Mr. Yan.

626
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,700
Bolin.

627
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,570
Where's your sister?

628
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,140
She has kept a vigil all night.

629
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,140
We told her to get some sleep

630
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,810
since we were here to take shifts.

631
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,340
Why did you come back?

632
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,380
I have so many things to tell you.

633
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:42,900
Okay.

634
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:44,860
You are too tired.

635
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,340
Take a nap first.

636
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,140
I will tell you everything as it is

637
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,250
after you wake up.

638
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,490
Better not.

639
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,010
I'm afraid that when I wake up,

640
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,570
I'll find it was all just a dream.

641
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,660
Hua Zhi.

642
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,490
So say it now.

643
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,660
I...

644
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,180
Don't know where to start.

645
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,140
Let's start with this.

646
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,530
Is Yan Xi your real name?

647
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,420
Yanxi is my given name.

648
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,660
My surname is Gu.

649
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,420
Gu Yanxi.

650
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,810
You are a member of the royal family.

651
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,250
Then why did you
go to the Security Bureau

652
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,010
to be an inspector?

653
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,100
I am not
an inspector of the Security Bureau.

654
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,730
Then who exactly are you?

655
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,730
I am the son of Lord Ling.

656
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,730
And also

657
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,140
the Commander of the Security Bureau.

658
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,420
Now, only less than ten people

659
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,290
know about this.

660
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,940
Should I feel honored?

661
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,050
What exactly is your purpose

662
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,290
to come to my home?

663
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,380
I told you last time.

664
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,490
It was all true. I didn't lie to you.

665
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,010
You're the son of Lord Ling

666
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,050
and the Commander
of the Security Bureau.

667
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:28,810
So the one who got my family raided

668
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,770
and all my male relatives exiled

669
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,460
was you?

670
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:34,490
It was me.

671
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,180
You are the one who made me get beaten
ten times?

672
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,010
Yes.

673
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,010
And the man

674
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,340
who returned
my grandfather's manuscript?

675
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,010
Take your books and get out of here.

676
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:47,700
Thank you.

677
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,380
And the one

678
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,050
who saved me from the villains?

679
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:00,940
They were all me.

680
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,100
Where have you been

681
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,380
since the day you left?

682
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,620
I defied my father

683
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,380
and was grounded by the Emperor.

684
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,940
Then why did you come back?

685
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,620
I was no longer in confinement
since last night.

686
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,940
I wanted to see you today.

687
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,290
Actually,

688
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,340
you could have just
kept all these from me.

689
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,100
If the Commander of the Security Bureau

690
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,010
wants to hide something,

691
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,810
a mere commoner like me

692
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,290
might never find it out in my lifetime.

693
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,810
But I don't want to keep it from you

694
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,900
even if you will never see me again

695
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,970
or

696
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,660

kicked us when we were down,

703
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,290
bullied us or deceived us.

I know now we've met a long time ago.

732
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,490
Right.

733
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,860
On that very Lantern Festival,

734
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,970
in my mother's yard,

735
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,780
we watched stars together.

736
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,300
Actually, when you asked me

737
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,420
about what happened
at Lord Ling's Mansion,

738
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,130
I kind of knew.

739
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,220
It's just
you looked too different from back then.

740
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,090
I couldn't be sure it was you.

741
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:19,940
That was lucky.

742
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,530
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have had the chance

743
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,570
to be hired by you
and get my monthly allowance.

744
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,170
The day you raided my house,

745
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,530
you clearly saw

746
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,940
I hid my grandfather's manuscripts.

747
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,170
Why didn't you expose me then?

748
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,690
Because you said

749
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,260
the Emperor owns the world.

750
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:36,650
The Emperor owns the world.

751
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,050
What's the point of crying?

752
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,220
And where could I run to?

753
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:42,610
I was ordered by the Emperor indeed.

754
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,570
But I thought

755
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,380
I didn't have to execute the order
to the exact.

756
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,220
There was always wiggle room.

757
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,170
At least when I made the call,

758
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,970
you could have those books.

759
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,940
Your blood dripped

760
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,300
onto Grandfather's manuscripts that day.

761
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,220
From then on,

762
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,420
the Mr. Yan I saw

763
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,420
had this scar on his face.

764
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,340
I got this scar

765
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:05,780
because of His Majesty.

766
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,260
I am willing to leave the northern land,

767
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,170
joined the Security Bureau

768
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,820
and ease the burdens for Your Majesty.

769
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,740
It was not actually him.

770
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,090
I wounded myself.

771
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,530
If Master Hua's manuscripts

772
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,530
had been destroyed like that,

773
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,170
it would be an irretrievable loss

774
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,970
for this and future generations.

775
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:24,860
They were saved because of you.

776
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,260
And also because of you.

777
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:51,650
Yanxi.

778
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,050
Yanxi.

779
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,740
I thought you didn't want me

780
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,610
and Zhi anymore.

781
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:18,300
Come in.

782
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,690
Greetings, Your Highness.

783
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,420
The young lord told me
to deliver some pastries

784
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,780
and send his heartfelt apologies.

785
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,460
My Lord,

786
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,420
these are the pastries

787
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,490
Xi bought for me.

788
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,050
He's been so busy.

789
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,860
Yet he still found time
to bring pastries for us.

790
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,740
Look.

791
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,460
He does realize his mistake?

792
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,740
Your Highness,

793
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,010
you know the young lord is thin-skinned

794
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,460
and too proud to apologize himself.

795
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,820
That's why

796
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,220
I came in his stead.

797
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,610
Where are you from?

798
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,170
The Palace.

799
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,740
What's your name?

800
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,860
My name is Qingxiang.

801
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,170
Come here.

802
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,300
You've come all the way from the Palace.

803
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,900
You must be exhausted.

804
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,530
You can have a pastry.

805
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

806
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,130
Go on.

807
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,340
How does it taste?

808
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,170
Your Highness,

809
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,860
this pastry tastes very nice.

810
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,380
It's the first time
I've eaten anything like this.

811
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,220
Listen.

812
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,530
Take good care of Xi

813
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,420
for me

814
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,220
in the Palace.

815
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:05,780
Will do.

816
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,740
Alright.

817
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,460
Take him down for a reward.

818
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,570
Thank you, Your Highness.

819
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,940
Yes, Your Highness.

820
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,340
Xi.

821
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,170
Don't ride too fast on the road.

822
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,090
Be careful.

823
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,220
Lady Zhi, that's so generous of you.

824
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,860
I'm just an old woman.

825
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,460
I don't need all these things.

826
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:55,050
Grandmother treated you so well
when she was alive.

827
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:56,490
If she were still here,

828
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,170
she would only complain
that I haven't prepared enough.

829
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,220
Ms. Su.

830
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,380
Why don't you stay with us

831
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,010
and live out the years
in the Hua Mansion?

832
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:04,900
Lady Zhi,

833
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,220
I know you mean well for me,

834
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,940
but now that Madam Hua passed away,

835
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,130
there's nothing to hold me here

836
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,090
in the Imperial Capital anymore.

837
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,690
I'm old.

838
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,340
Just let me return to where I came from.

839
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,090
Now that the mourning is over,

840
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,420
I want you to have this.

841
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,090
This is...

842
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,530
Madam Hua

843
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,970
always wore this hairpin.

844
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:30,940
When she was seriously ill,

845
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,300
she gave it to me.

846
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:33,570
But

847
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,530
I am already old,

848
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,780
and it won't look good on me.

849
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,940
So I brought it with me today

850
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,650
to give it to you before I leave.

851
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,010
Thank you.
