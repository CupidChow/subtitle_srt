Aside from worrying about everyone,

62
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,560
she had no regrets.

63
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,150
I can't forgive myself.

111

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,390
who turns a blind eye and a deaf ear

115
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,800
and hides your thoughts
just for the safety of the family,

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,310
my grandmother would
surely be disappointed.

117

118

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,750
I am young,

192
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,080
but I can work too.

193
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,750
I still have to study
from our grandfather.

194
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,360
I never knew

195
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,000
that our grandfather

196
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,720
is better than all home tutors

197
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,550
and teachers in public academies.

198
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,270
I've only learned a little from him.

199
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,030
I want more.

200
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,960
Don't you want to go back to the capital
to see your mother

201
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,910
and Duo?

202
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,270
Zhi, don't worry.

203
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,000
Things I can do at home,

204
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
I can do the same here.

205
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,480
I also believe

206
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,960
that one day,

207
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,750
you will take all of us home.

208
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,120
When that time comes,

209
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,200
I will leave
with our grandfather and the others.

210
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,120
Alright, you made your own decision.

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,870
I'll respect that.

212
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,910
Zhi,

213
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,480
you should hurry back
to warm yourself by the fire.

214
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,630
I still need to go help with the work.

215
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,120
Uncle.

216
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,670
Zhi...

217
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,320
Do you need anything?

218
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,790
I...

219
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,000
It's really too cold here.

220
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,150
You know,

221
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,390
my legs

222
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,150
are always in bad condition.

223
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,790
So, how can I help you?

224
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,200
Just now

225
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,360
I saw you talking to Boyu.

226
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,750
I wasn't listening on purpose, though.

227
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,480
I didn't expect

228
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,240
that you could make so much money

229
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,720
and even managed to redeem someone.

230
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,630
My dear niece,

231
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,480
since you brought so much money,

232
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,480
could you

233
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,960
take me home with you?

234
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,670
I really can't take it anymore.

235
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,320
You know?

236
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,240
Seriously.

237
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,870
You have no idea.

238
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,550
This past half a year,

239
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,000
we've been on the river dam

240
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,670
carrying soil

241
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,120
and breaking stones every day,

242
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,440
living worse than animals.

243
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,360
Do my father and Uncle Pingyang
do the same?

244
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,120
Yes.

245
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,600
But they are strong.

246
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,390
Look at my hands.

247
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,320
It's because you're weak!

248
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,790
Pingyu.

249
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,630
Father is still here.

250
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,320
I, your eldest brother,

251
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,750
am still here.

252
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,030
Boyu, your son, a child,

253
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,630
is also here!

254
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,600
And you want to run away?

255
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,510
What kind of son

256
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,240
and father are you?

257
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,030
Pingyu,

258
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,480
the house is full of women.

259
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,440
There has to be a man
to support them, right?

260
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,150
Besides,

261
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,440
your Aunt Xia is capable indeed,

262
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,150
but she's a woman after all!

263
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,390
Without me,

264
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,480
how will she survive?

265
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,790
Uncle Pingyan, rest assured.

266
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,870
Aunt Xia has to manage the account books

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,030
and look after the children every day.

268
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,320
She has a lot

269
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,000
on her mind.

270
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,240
She has no time for you at the moment.

271
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:33,960
Pingyu.

272
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,870
Pingyu!

273
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,910
Grandfather.

274
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:55,750
Shaoyao.

275
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,440
Take my grandfather's pulse.

276
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,480
I'm okay.

277
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,200
Whose child are you?

278
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,840
She said she's from the Hua Family.

279
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,440
I am.

280
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,200
It's just a cold.

281
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,360
You'll be fine
after three doses of the medicine.

282
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,790
I have medicine in my chest.

283
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,840
Three doses should heal you.

284
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,320
Grandfather,

285
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,750
Shaoyao has been injured.

286
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,630
She looks a bit silly,

287
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,870
but she has the kindest heart.

288
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,120
Zhi, you are wrong.

289
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,240
This child is not silly at all.

290
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,150
Look, her brows are relaxed

291
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,630
and eyes are bright.

292
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,480
Her mind must be clear and bright.

293
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,550
She is a child
blessed with good fortune.

294
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,440
Your journey has been
full of danger and hardship.

295
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,440
I really can't imagine

296
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,360
how young girls like you

297
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,510
got through all this.

298
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,720
My brother escorted us here.

299
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,600
It was neither hard nor dangerous.

300
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,790
Who is your brother?

301
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,600
How come
you haven't introduced him to me?

302
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,120
He's a friend of mine.

303
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,840
We happened
to be travelling the same way.

304
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:01,960
Grandfather,

305
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,630
is this your new book?

306
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,600
May I read it?

307
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,630
You must be tired from the long journey.

308
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,000
Just read a little
and then get some rest.

309
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,510
I've asked them

310
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,480
to prepare a room for you.

311
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,750
The rest of us will sleep here together.

312
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:13,790
It's warmer that way.

313
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,440
Okay.

314
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
I will go and prepare the medicine.

315
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,000
A friend?

316
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:29,840
Chief,

317
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,270
there's no news today.

318
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,120
No one has been intercepted
these past few days.

319
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm afraid the Commander

320
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,600
has already entered the northern camp.

321
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,600
That's Wu Yong's territory,

322
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,870
impenetrable.

323
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,270
We might alert the enemy by probing.

324
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,080
We have to wait here.

325
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,630
Yes.

326
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,200
Wu,

327
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,630
I hope you've been well.

328
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,360
You!

329
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,120
What are you doing back here!

330
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,150
You joined the Security Bureau?

331
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,150
To tell you the truth,

332
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,960
I'm now the Commander
of the Security Bureau.

333
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,440
In such a crappy place,

334
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,870
the only thing important enough
to trouble you, the Commander,

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,790
to come in person,

336
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,630
is probably to investigate me.

337
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,670
We are brothers-in-arms after all.

338
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,030
Admit your own crimes.

339
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,000
On the bed, under the pillow.

340
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,030
What's all this?

341
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,720
Evidence of guilt!

342
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,670
It's all because my Yao

343
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,750
kept saying that the other ladies

344
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,670
all have good jewelries,

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,670
only she had nothing to wear on her hair

346
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,150
and that made her look like a nun.

347
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,120
These were seized from bandits.

348
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,000
I kept them.

349
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,030
Seriously, do you gentlemen
from the imperial city

350
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,200
have nothing better to do at all?

351
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,320
All these officials in the Court,

352
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,150
which ones are really incorruptible?

353
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,790
Why don't you investigate them?

354
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,120
Why come at

355
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,670
us poor soldiers?

356
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,030
Be gentle!

357
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,120
I bought that table myself.

358
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,390
Wu Yong, if you don't tell the truth,

359
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,360
I won't be able to protect you.

360
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,510
Even if you do tell the truth,

361
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,150
I will have to deal with you myself.

362
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,120
What's wrong with you?

363
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,390
What's wrong?

364
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,080
Is such a trivial matter

365
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,150
going to make you chop off my head?

366
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,200
I must have had terrible luck
in this lifetime

367
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
to end up working for your family.

368
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,240
If you're afraid of death,

369
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,200
you shouldn't have colluded
with the people of the Zhao Empire.

370
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,670
Zhao?

371
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,550
What?

372
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,600
What were you talking about?

373
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,030
The military farmland I procured
without permission!

374
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,080
You've appropriated military land too?

375
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,840
Forget it.

376
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Wu,

377
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,720
tell me the truth.

378
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,080
What exactly did you say

379
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,030
to the spy from the Zhao Empire?

380
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,670
I, Wu Yong, swear to the heavens.

381
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,200
If I have any dealings

382
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
with anyone from the Zhao Empire,

383
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,240
I'll no longer be able to be intimate,

384
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,910
and my Yao, Zhi, Hua

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,120
will all be cheating on me!

386
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,080
Shut your mouth!

387
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,270
They caught a spy in the capital

388
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,960
saying that you have teamed up
with the people of the Zhao Empire.

389
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,750
Nonsense!

390
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,510
They can fabricate things
out of nothing.

391
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,120
Either

392
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,630
there's a mole in your place,

393
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:29,910
or

394
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,200
there's a mole in the Imperial Capital.

395
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,790
This is easy.

396
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,510
We have
only a small number of people here.

397
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,200
An investigation will be easy.

398
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,480
So many fish!

399
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,870
Grandfather, look!

400
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,960
There are so many fish here.

401
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm too old to keep up with you.

402
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,920
Gu Yanxi,

403
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,350
why are you following me?

404
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,720
Why aren't you saying anything?

405
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,030
Tell me.

406
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,270
Were you in a dream?

407
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,000
You were talking in your sleep.

408
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,480
What did you want to ask me?

409
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,200
I don't remember.

410
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,720
Have you finished all your work?

411
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,480
I'm getting there.

412
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,160
Don't worry.

413
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:00,790
Thank you.

414
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,830
You're so kind.

415
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,720
Thank you...

416
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,110
You must be Miss Hua.

417
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,640
Yes.

418
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,680
Thank you so much.

419
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,680
My son

420
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
was having a fever for three days.

421
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,480
This morning,

422
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,240
I got a packet of medicine from you,

423
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,310
and after just one dose,

424
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,270
his fever has already gone down!

425
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm glad it's working.
You don't need to thank me.

426
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,070
My friends and I

427
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:20,790
have talked about this.

428
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,030
We can't just take things
from you without repaying.

429
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:22,880
So, how about this?

430
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,480
We'll waive Mr. Hua's labor service

431
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,270
for this year.

432
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,590
It is I who should thank you all!

433
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,440
You're welcome.

434
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:28,920
Thank you...

435
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,400
Then we shall take our leave.

436
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,550
Thank you!

437
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,160
Uncle Pingyang.

438
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,160
It seems the business
is going well in the Imperial Capital.

439
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,310
You've made some extra money.

440
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,480
Those things

441
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,030
aren't worth much
in the Imperial Capital,

442
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,000
but in Sanbai City, they're quite rare.

443
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,790
Look at these people in line.

444
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,480
They are someone's parents

445
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,480
and someone's children,

446
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,400
not knowing when they will go home.

447
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,070
This city is near the top of Mount Kun.

448
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,350
Snow drifts through three seasons here.

449
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,510
And there's no summer.

450
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,720
That's why it's called Sanbai City.

451
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,830
Fortunately, in the remaining season,

452
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,880
the hillsides will be
covered in apricot blossoms.

453
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,310
That scene will be rather pleasant.

454
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,880
Oh, right.

455
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,000
Try this.

456
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,110
What is this?

457
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,480
These are apricots grown here.

458
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,070
They're wild.

459
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,880
I picked a lot

460
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,960
and dried them into apricot snacks.

461
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,640
They're so sweet.

462
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,830
When late spring comes,

463
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,350
the weather starts warming up,

464
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,350
both inside and outside of the city
will be covered in apricot blossoms.

465
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,310
They're like clouds.

466
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,510
When summer arrives,

467
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,550
there will be sweet apricots to eat.

468
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,030
So, it is true.

469
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,030
Of course, it's true!

470
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,160
These were washed and dried

471
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,550
by me one by one.

472
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,400
They're one hundred percent authentic.

473
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,790
About the baby's name,

474
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,000
I've made my decision.

475
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,000
What is it?

476
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,640
Birds flying and fish leaping.

477
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,270
I'll take the character "Yuan".

478
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,680
Does it mean paper kite?

479
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,920
No, the bird. It flies and soars.

480
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,550
I hope that when Yuan grows up,

481
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,160
she'll be as fierce as a bird of prey

482
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,790
and fly far away,

483
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,160
high up in the sky.

484
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,960
Yuan.

485
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,310
What?

486
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Yesterday, when you arrived,

487
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,000
you told us everything

488
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,880
about the recent situation at home.

489
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,750
I even know what book

490
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,310
Boli has been reading recently.

491
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,480
But you didn't mention a word
about yourself.

492
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,240
There's nothing to say.

493
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,000
Don't try to lie to me.

494
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,550
When you were this big,

495
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,400
I've started watching over you.

496
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,830
You can never hide anything from me.

497
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:20,960
Tell me.

498
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,000
Is there someone you like?

499
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:29,790
My goodness.

500
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
Not only is there someone you like,

501
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,270
but this person is also a trouble,
isn't he?

502
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,510
No, no trouble.

503
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,030
Our circumstances
are drastically different,

504
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,720
so we may not end up being together.

505
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,640
What does he say about it?

506
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,110
What do you mean?

507
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,110
Does he know about your circumstances?

508
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,310
What does he think about it?

509
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,240
What's his plan?

510
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,240
It's not like we can change anything.

511
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,960
What can be done?

512
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,000
Why bother telling him?

513
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,070
Zhi,

514
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,160
listen to me.

515
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,350
Communication is important
when it comes to a relationship.

516
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,200
The feelings must be mutual.

517
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,440
You are willing to take risks for him

518
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,240
and face death without regrets.

519
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,070
That's fine.

520
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,790
But he must feel the same way.

521
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,880
Or you will surely be left alone,

522
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,720
ending up with a heart full of pain.

523
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,830
I don't want to take risks

524
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,680
or face death without regrets.

525
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,350
I just want to
live a quiet and stable life with him,

526
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,030
keeping each other company.

527
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,880
Isn't that good?

528
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,240
Of course it's good.

529
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,440
But things don't always go as you wish.

530
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,680
If it really comes to that step,

531
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,070
what would you do

532
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,640
and what would he do?

533
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,480
Alright, Uncle.

534
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,270
If you're free,

535
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,590
go help her give out medicine.

536
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,480
If you refuse to listen to your elders,

537
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,510
you'll suffer losses.

538
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,000
Alright, I'll stop talking.

539
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,000
I have to return to Xiba River

540
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,510
to work.

541
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,590
I'm off.

542
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,310
Father.

543
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,590
Zhi.

544
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,400
Sit down.

545
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,070
I want to apologize to you.

546
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,960
These past few days,

547
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,550
I heard about what happened
back home from Baoxia.

548
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,350
I was being short-sighted.

549
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,830
That day,

550
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,880
I said something terribly wrong.

551
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,510
Father,

552
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,240
you never

553
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,240
admitted your mistakes before.

554
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,750
I was wrong, and that's the truth.

555
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,000
If I don't say these words to you now,

556
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,640
I don't know when I'll have the chance

557
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,640
to tell you next time.

558
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,920
To your mother,

559
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,030
you and Bolin,

560
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,350
I owe too much.

561
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,640
If I'm going to be buried here
just like this...

562
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,510
It won't happen.

563
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,680
We'll all go home.

564
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,270
We have already lost our grandmother.

565
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,960
We can't lose anyone else.

566
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,400
Yes.

567
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,550
We must go home.

568
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,160
Hurry up!

569
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,590
Faster.

570
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:02,550
Hurry up.

571
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,920
You,

572
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,270
you, and you,

573
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,920
come with me.

574
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,000
The overseer wants to see you.

575
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,350
Where are we going?

576
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,550
The northern camp,
where the general lives.

577
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,270
Let's go.

578
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:21,510
Get in one by one.

579
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,400
You,

580
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,110
go first.

581
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,720
General, I hope you well.

582
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,680
What do you do?

583
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,110
I work by the Xiba River

584
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,790
as a stone smasher.

585
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,030
Recently, have you seen any strangers

586
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,270
on the working site?

587
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,240
No.

588
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,510
What about in Sanbai City?

589
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,590
Have you seen anyone
from the north land?

590
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:39,880
No, not either.

591
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,440
Think again before you answer!

592
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,960
General, you want to ask me questions,

593
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,310
but you're not telling the true reason.

594
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,350
I do want to be honest with you.

595
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,070
I just don't know where to start.

596
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,270
Recently, the rebels have been
planning on something.

597
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,440
They've sent spies to spread rumors.

598
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,240
I came specially to look into this.

599
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Are they from the Zhao Empire?

600
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,270
Speak!

601
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,310
How did you know?

602
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,350
There's been a war
with them for so many years.

603
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,400
And this northern land

604
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,000
is only a hundred li away
from the Zhao Empire.

605
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,000
What's important enough for the Court
to send someone here

606
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,310
and make the general restless

607
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,790
could only be the spies
from the Zhao Empire.

608
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:12,790
However,

609
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,680
in Sanbai City,

610
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,830
I truly haven't seen any traces of them.

611
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,110
What is your name?

612
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,480
I am just a convict

613
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,240
from Sanbai City.

614
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,000
My name is not worth mentioning.

615
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,510
General,

616
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,310
this man is called Hua Pingyang.

617
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,590
So he's Hua Zhi's fourth uncle.

618
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,240
The Commander of the Security Bureau.

619
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,750
What is he doing here?

620
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,480
It's just that now,

621
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,830
our circumstances
are drastically different.

622
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,960
We may not end up being together.

623
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,400
It's my friend.

624
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,000
We happened to be travelling
the same way.

625
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,350
Thank you.

626
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,160
Please leave.

627
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,270
Move!

628
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,750
Next.

629
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,480
Next.

630
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,070
Uncle.

631
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,240
Can I help you?

632
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,680
It's getting late.

633
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,720
I'll just be straightforward with you.

634
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,000
Answer my question.

635
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,680
Shaoyao's brother,

636
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,920
the one who escorted you
to the northern land,

637
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,030
who is he?

638
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:43,880
Don't tell me

639
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,270
that he's the Commander
of the Security Bureau.

640
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,240
Uncle,

641
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,000
I don't want to lie to you.

642
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,030
Zhi,

643
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,480
how come...?

644
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,880
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

645
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,640
I saw him today.

646
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,720
I can't forget that mask.

647
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,240
Zhi,

648
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,640
tell me,

649
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,750
the one you said you had feelings for.

650
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,400
Is it him?

651
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,440
I've liked him for a long time.

652
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,030
You should know

653
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,960
what the Security Bureau does.

654
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,350
You must know better than I do

655
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,960
about who he really is.

656
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:24,920
Zhi,

657
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,550
this is your personal business.

658
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,960
I really shouldn't pry.

659
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,750
But this is

660
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,070
way too dangerous.

661
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,350
You need to be aware of your identities.

662
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,510
If one day you're separated,

663
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,070
how will you stay out of trouble?

664
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,200
I never thought to

665
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,000
stay out of trouble.

666
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,440
You!

667
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,070
Uncle,

668
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,310
just like you said,

669
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,750
this is my business.

670
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,030
Please keep it secret for me.

671
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But I won't get the Hua Family

672
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,790
involved in this.

673
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,880
I also don't want my grandfather

674
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,480
and the others to worry.

675
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,310
I can promise you that.

676
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,790
But can you promise me
something as well?

677
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,000
No matter what happens,

678
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,270
think of yourself first

679
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,440
and protect yourself.

680
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,350
You, oh you.

681
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,350
You're going to drive me crazy!

682
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,270
Uncle,

683
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,200
I've grown up.

684
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,590
You should get some rest.

685
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,790
Luckily, you didn't come earlier.

686
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,550
Just now, my Uncle Pingyang was here...

How did you get so cold?

693
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,400
Then help me warm up.

694
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,350

Be quiet and careful.

706

My grandfather and the others
are sleeping outside.

707
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,200
I just want to hold you.

708
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,590
Keep me company for a while.

709
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,160
I'll leave at dawn.

710
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,550
Morning.

711
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,880
Have you had breakfast?

712
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,750
Wu.

713
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,590
Have you ever sought to marry a woman

714
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,880
who's not like your current

715
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,720
Yao or whatever?

716
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,270
What I'm talking about is

717
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,030
a wife you want to share a life with.

718
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,110
I love Yao with my true heart.

719
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,680
I love every one of them...

720
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:23,680
Alright, alright.

721
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,000
I just want to know

722
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,640
if you want to propose to a girl,

723
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,160
when is the best time?

724
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,920
Your Highness,

725
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,750
I'm so surprised.

726
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,830
It's only been a year since you
returned to the Imperial Capital.

727
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,680
Which peerless beauty

728
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,830
has softened

729
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,270
your stoney heart?

730
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,750
About the military land
you acquired without permission...

731
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,830
I'll tell you.

732
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,880
This

733
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,480
isn't something easy.

734
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,200
It requires the right timing, location,
and harmony among people.

735
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,310
As for the timing,

736
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,200
you need to choose a sunny day

737
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,790
or a day when there's a gentle drizzle.

738
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,680
It's all about the atmosphere.

739
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,920
As for the location,

740
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,200
you must go to her place.

741
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,440
If you do it in your place,

742
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,240
she will be on her guard.

743
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,550
The harmony among people
is easy to understand.

744
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,270
You have to do it
when you two are very close

745
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,310
and deeply attracted to each other.

746
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,000
Remember,

747
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,590
don't wait too long.

748
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,880
Never wait until
you start to dislike each other.

749
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,480
Yao and I

750
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,680
have waited too long.

751
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,440
Alright, I got it.

752
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,880
Did you find anything about the spy?

753
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
I've looked through everything,

754
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,480
but there's no clue.

755
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,310
None.

756
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,830
Perhaps that's the answer.

757
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,720
That secret letter

758
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,830
was probably a trap.

759
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,070
Or

760
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,880
it was to lure us away from home.

761
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,200
Wu,

762
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,880
I'll see you next time.

763
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,030
Grandfather,

764
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,790
take the money.

765
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,030
Zhi,

766
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,790
we don't spend money here.

767
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,270
Silly girl,

768
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,790
in Sanbai City,

769
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,830
there's nowhere to spend money.

770
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,000
Take it back with you

771
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,550
and buy some food or cloths
for the family.

772
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
We have enough at home.

773
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,350
How is that the same?

774
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,110
Through your hands,

775
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:10,960
this money you bring home

776
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:11,830
will turn into

777
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,880
a gift from us.

778
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,720
What do you mean by that?

779
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,240
How did it become a gift from you?

780
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,350
Pingyu,

781
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,110
what's that in your hand?

782
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,200
The calligraphy I created
in my free time.

783
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,790
Zhi,

784
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,400
take this back

785
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,750
for Bolin's calligraphy practice.

786
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,400
Okay.

787
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,830
Say sorry to your mother

788
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,830
for me.

789
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,200
All the hardship
she's been suffering at home

790
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,960
was my fault.

791
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:37,790
Father,

792
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,270
my mother never blamed you.

793
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,750
What is Boyu doing here?

794
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,270
Zhi,

795
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
the things my mother sent to me,

796
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,750
I've seen them all.

797
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,830
Apart from those books, brushes,
paper and ink,

798
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,350
I don't want the rest.

799
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,830
They have already been
loaded onto the carriage.

800
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,680
Please take them back home.

801
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,720
And tell my mother

802
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,920
that I will study hard here.

803
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,720
Also tell her to take care of herself.

804
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,030
Then you must learn as much as you can

805
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,790
from our grandfather.

806
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,960
Zhi, it's time to set off, isn't it?

807
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,590
I will see you off.

808
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:47,440
Grandfather,

809
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,880
you should head back.

810
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,160
If you walk any further,

811
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
you'll be out of Sanbai City.

812
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,310
Take care.

813
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,350
I will take all these letters home

814
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,030
and give them to the others.

815
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,270
For the children who can't read,

816
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,510
I will read for them.

817
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,400
I've never believed
in ghosts or spirits in my life.

818
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,640
But this

819
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,920
is a talisman.

820
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,680
I've heard people say

821
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,680
that in the west of Sanbai City,

822
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,200
there is a thousand-year-old
apricot tree.

823
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,790
Under the apricot tree,

824
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,550
layers of fallen apricot blossoms
have turned into red mud.

825
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,000
If you worship the tree
and present wine,

826
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,400
its spirit will guard you.

827
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,750
I asked your Uncle Pingyang

828
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,030
to fetch some of that mud for me.

829
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,310
Please don't laugh at me.

830
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,880
Then, I'll be going.

831
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
Take good care of yourself.

832
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,640
Let's go.

833
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,030
Zhi, don't be sad.

834
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:18,840
Look,

835
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,190
these fabrics

836
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,710
were cut into pieces

837
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,190
and then sewed together

838
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,440
by a needle and a thread.

839
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:28,550
Zhi,

840
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,150
you are that very thread

841
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,880
bringing our family together

842
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
from the south

843
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:36,880
to the north.

844
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,000
Wait for me.

845
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,840
Give me some more time.

846
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,760
One day,

847
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,800
I will come to take you home.

848
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,960
Are you done with work?

849
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,710
There may be trouble
in the Imperial Capital.

850
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,440
Why are you sad?

851
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,880
Your father isn't in Sanbai City.

852
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,630
None of your business!

853
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,510
But

854
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,800
isn't it my place to care about you?

855
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:09,760
Baoxia,

856
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:10,590
What?

857
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,280
Hear, it's clean.

858
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,030
So annoying.

859
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,760
Chief,

860
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:28,710
there's a letter.

861
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,400
[Message from a covert observer
after Hua Zhi and the commander]

862
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,190
It seems the Commander

863
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,190
has not only avoided the trap

864
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,590
but also become aware.

865
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
His journey back

866
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,960
will be our last chance.

867
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,840
What's wrong?

868
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,800
Hua Zhi, think carefully.

869
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,150
Is there something
important on the carriage?

870
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,000
The letters from my family
are all with me.

871
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,000
Apart from the money,

872
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,760
there's nothing important
on the carriage.

873
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,000
What if you can only keep one thing?

874
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,030
I'll keep the letters.

875
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,920
Okay.

876
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,150
Don't be afraid.

877
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,280
Later, when I tell you to go.

878
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:49,880
All you need to do is lashing the horse
and charging forward.

879
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:51,800
What happened?

880
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,230
Get down the horse

881
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,710
and unload the carriage.

882
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,190
Everyone,

883
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,190
we're returning home
with an empty carriage.

884
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,710
There are no goods on the carriage.

885
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,670
These are not Niu Heng and his men.

886
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,280
These

887
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,590
are the clothes

888
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,480
we left Niu Heng and his men.

889
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,320
Please be kind and let us through.

890
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,710
How much money do you have?

891
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:47,960
Take it all out.

892
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,480
Baoxia, the money.

893
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,190
They don't seem like

894
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,960
bandits who prey on their own kind,

895
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,670
nor the ones aiming on the money.

896
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,000
Is that enough?

897
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,710
Alright.

898
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,280
Women, the elderly and children
can leave.

899
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,710
Men stay behind.

900
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,590
Alright.

901
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,960
You go ahead.

902
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,280
We will be right behind you.

903
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,230
Don't delay the journey.

904
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,320
Trust me.

905
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,030
Where are you from?

906
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,630
Those three skilled ones.

907
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Kill them all.

908
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,070
Sir,

909
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,510
they are all experts.

910
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,760
You're indeed a pack of good dogs.

911
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,230
Your master didn't feed you for nothing.

912
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,920
As expected of the Commander
of the Security Bureau.

913
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,710
We have been waiting for you.

914
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,000
I was wondering
how come so many good fighters

915
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,190
are gathered
in this desolate wilderness.

916
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,190
Turns out you're all here for me.

917
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,360
It seems

918
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,710
that some of us will die today.

919
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:22,960
Kill them!

920
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:27,960
Run!

921
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,510
Why are you still here?

922
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:34,360
Run!

923
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,150
Where is Mr. Yan?

924
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:35,880
Those bandits

925
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,710
all know how to use hidden weapons.

926
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,070
They came for Mr. Yan and his group!

927
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,510
They surrounded them
to the point of no escape!

928
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,960
It's like they really hate them
for some reason!

929
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:41,760
What should we do, Zhi?

930
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,590
You all should leave right now.

931
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,230
Zhi!

932
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,880
Lady Zhi!

933
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,510
Zhi! Come back!

934
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,320
Lady Zhi, come back!
