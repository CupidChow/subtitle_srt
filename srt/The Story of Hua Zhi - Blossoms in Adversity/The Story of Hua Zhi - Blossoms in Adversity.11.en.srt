[Episode 11]

25
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,010
Thank you, Your Excellency,

26
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,770
for saving our family
of women and children.

27
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,850
Thank yourself.

28
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,330
Go.

29
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,010
Miss Zhi, Miss Zhi.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,970
Zhi.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,330
Sister, are you alright?

32
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,530
Sister, you're fine, right?

33
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:08,730
Sir.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,240
This person is dead.

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,920
We've lost the clue as well.

36
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,920
Pick a few capable people.

37
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,640
Together with Li Hou and Zheng Hu,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,490
they should take turns
guarding the courtyard.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,170
As to tonight's event,

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,410
don't let it happen again!

41
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,280
Yes.

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,240
What does this mean?

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,490
Should we

44
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,560
act as guards tonight?

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,730
It's due to our Boss'

46
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,130
loved one living here.

47
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,370
Who is it?

48
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,040
Of course, it's his sister.

49
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,730
Boli, don't be afraid.

50
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,730
Sleep it off,
and you'll forget by tomorrow.

51
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,650
Go inside and sleep now.

52
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,600
Take Duo to bed.

53
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
Kids, go inside and sleep.

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
You all go to sleep as well.

55
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,090
Let's go.

56
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:01,650
Go on.

57
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,320
The Security Bureau
always turns up like a bad penny.

58
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:08,760
We have all

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,730
moved here,

60
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,450
and as soon as they arrived,

61
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,290
it's chaos all over again.

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,810
They are into
kicking someone when they are down.

63
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,480
We're the unfortunate ones.

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,480
Who would have thought

65
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,450
that those inspectors, catching bandits,

66
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,370
would actually end up at our house?

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
I think

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,650
This little fool

69
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,450
seems a bit unlucky.

70
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,170
Just as she moved in,

71
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,040
the bandits were coming to us.

72
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,680
So according to Ms. Qin's words,

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,120
it's me who is more unlucky.

74
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,730
I was the one just caught;

75
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,530
It's not Shaoyao.

76
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,400
Security Bureau is catching a person

77
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,400
and it surely involves secrecy.

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,890
All right then.

79
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,370
From now on, no one
is allowed to mention this matter.

80
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,610
Hurry and tidy up, everyone
go back to your rooms to sleep.

81
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,720
I'll escort you back.

82
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,930
You all should go back and rest.

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,210
Should I stay here and sleep with you?

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't worry, go to sleep now.

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,650
Miss Zhi, you should rest early.

86
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:13,930
Let's go.

87
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,400
Mother,

88
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,440
let me do it.

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,890
You know how painful this must be.

90
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,890
It doesn't hurt anymore.

91
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,840
Stop trying to cajole me.

92
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,000
How could it not hurt?

93
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,240
That day, when I was peeling a hawthorn,

94
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,840
I only scraped

95
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,050
a wound as big as a grain of rice,

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,210
and it hurt unbearably.

97
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,490
How could yours not hurt?

98
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,210
Mother, you how to peel hawthorns, huh?

99
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,680
I didn't even know that.

100
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,960
You have done a lot of work
these past few days, haven't you?

101
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Your hands have become rough.

102
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:24,890
Zhi,

103
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,330
I have wronged you.

104
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,050
In the past,

105
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,770
your father did not like you.

106
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,560
Madam Hua

107
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,370
didn't like you either.

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Those aunties

109
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
often talked about you behind your back.

110
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,930
But as your mother,

111
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,440
I never once stood up

112
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,930
to speak for you.

113
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,530
At first,

114
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
I obliviously

115
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,330
gave birth to you.

116
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,330
But over these years,

117
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,570
I have done nothing for you,

118
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,770
nor have I helped you.

119
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,480
Do you particularly resent me?

120
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,400
Mother,

121
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:11,920
today you said

122
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,530
you would give your life for mine.

123
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,250
Of the countless people in the world,

124
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,250
only you would be willing to do so.

125
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,600
This sentence is enough.

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,720
Zhi,

127
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,360
it's me who's been too incompetent,

128
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,450
causing you to suffer.

129
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,840
It's all mother's fault.

130
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,250
Sir,

131
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,650
it's found in his clothes.

132
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,360
Such skills

133
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,690
worth the price.

134
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,600
The people who can afford such a stake

135
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,360
are not many.

136
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,770
Interrogate the one
captured alive thoroughly.

137
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,720
Make sure he doesn't die.

138
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,770
Yes.

139
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,210
Does it hurt?

140
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:26,130
Did you have a nightmare last night?

141
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,400
Tears soaked the pillow.

142
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
What did you
dream about to feel so aggrieved?

143
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,480
What's wrong?

144
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,160
Zhi,

145
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,840
if bad people come again,

146
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,250
I will surely protect you.

147
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,720
Okay.

148
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,960
I mean it.

149
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,480
You have so many people in your family.

150
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,600
You... you can't die.

151
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,210
I have my brother.

152
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,450
And I have you.

153
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,480
And... and my mother.

154
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,090
Mother... she's already dead.

155
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,960
Now I only have my brother and you.

156
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,090
Don't worry.

157
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,480
I know.

158
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,890
You will take good care of me.

159
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,650
Your brother and I

160
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,450
will certainly protect you.

161
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,210
Zhi,

162
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,890
I miss my mother so much.

163
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:27,650
I...

164
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,360
Last night, when I saw

165
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,010
you and your mother,

166
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,570
I just missed her.

167
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,600
But I...

168
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,570
I can't tell my brother. I...

169
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,840
If I tell my brother,
it will make him sad.

170
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,800
Then whenever you miss your mother,

171
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,920
just tell me.

172
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,210
I won't tell your brother.

173
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,570
A female miracle physician?

174
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:55,570
That's right.

175
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,450
This physician lives in seclusion.

176
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,010
Therefore,
her reputation has not spread.

177
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,450
Moreover, she specializes
in treating this type

178
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,400
of complicated heart disease.

179
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,040
I pleaded for a long time,

180
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,090
before she reluctantly agreed

181
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,480
to let Shaoyao stay and recuperate.

182
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,720
I, I'm worried that Shaoyao
won't get used to living there.

183
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,720
Can't she just stay at home?

184
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,330
When it's time to
take medicine and nourish the body,

185
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,130
take her there, okay?

186
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:13,280
Aunt Xiao,

187
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,650
Shaoyao's illness

188
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,720
most forbids rushing around.

189
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,160
I have already decided

190
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,130
to let her
recuperate for half a year first.

191
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,210
Okay.

192
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,210
Then, regarding your father,

193
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,920
I'll go explain.

194
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,090
I really hate those hangers-on.

195
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
They've all crowded into Willow Lane.

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,280
Imitating us by wearing an
animal lantern and selling hawthorns.

197
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,840
Just thinking about it makes me angry.

198
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,330
Baoxia,

199
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
are you asking for a beating?

200
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,040
Be careful not to
splash water on Miss Zhi' neck.

201
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,450
What is there to be angry about?

202
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,360
At the beginning, when I came up with

203
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,570
the method of wearing an animal lantern,

204
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,210
I knew that

205
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,160
they would surely copy it.

206
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,250
These hawthorns can be picked by anyone.

207
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:52,920
Try it more often,

208
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,280
and they can also
learn a bit of the taste.

209
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,570
Shaoyao, give me some paste.

210
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,570
Miss Zhi,

211
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,090
What are you fiddling with again?

212
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,840
You tore up Bolin's "Classic of Mountains and Seas".

213
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,130
Didn't you say before, Miss Zhi,

214
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,920
that books are the most precious and rare?

215
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,530
Exactly.

216
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,280
Yes,

217
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,800
this is not something

218
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:15,890
that anyone can afford.

219
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,770
I will paste it back together.

220
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,160
Shaoyao, come here.

221
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,040
Take a look.

222
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,280
This, it moved, it moved!

223
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,280
Let me see.

224
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,890
The painting really moved!

225
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,280
Let me have a look, too.

226
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,890
Let me take a look.

227
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,160
I want to see it, too.

228
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,560
Miss Zhi,

229
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,920
isn't this just like

230
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:54,530
the carousel or whatever it was called?

231
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,610
Aren't you the smart one.

232
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,200
Miss Zhi, you're really amazing.

233
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,440
However,

234
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,920
Miss Zhi, you still have injuries.

235
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,280
You even don't
feel fatigued when crafting

236
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,770
this wooden box of tricks.

237
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,280
She seldom finds joy in such things.

238
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,800
Ever since she left the mansion,

239
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,320
she hasn't done any

240
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,560
of these strange and unusual gadgets.

241
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,010
Sir,

242
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,040
I've checked it out.

243
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:18,970
These two people

244
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,040
are not from the same group at all.

245
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,040
That is to say,

246
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,130
the employer has hired

247
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,080
two people from the martial world

248
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,320
to have the job done.

249
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,280
This was left by

250
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,080
the one who survived,

251
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,650
and they have never seen

252
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,650
what the employer looks like.

253
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,130
They only communicate by letters.

254
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,370
[Not one of the well-informed
people should be spared]

255
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,010
Dong Da?

256
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,160
Shaoyao?

257
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,250
The people survived
the Lan Garden's fire?

258
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,200
Hawthorns for sale, hawthorns for sale!

259
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,970
Kids, come and have a look!

260
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,770
Haw for sale!

261
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,800
Haw, haw!

262
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,400
Kids, would you like some haw?

263
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,800
Kid, buy some haw, won't you?

264
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,320
Yes or no?

265
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,370
No, thanks.

266
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,890
There's someone
performing magic tricks over there.

267
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,920
Let's go watch together.

268
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,770
Kids, don't go!

269
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,370
What's happening?

270
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,370
There are also
magic tricks on Willow Street now.

271
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,280
Hua's fruits are honest to all.

272
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,530
Buy a string of hawthorns;

273
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,530
pull the box once.

274
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,610
Honest to all, I swear.

275
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,920
Buy a string of hawthorns;

276
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,970
pull the rope once.

277
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,280
Show us, Miss Zhi.

278
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,160
Let's have a look.

279
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,400
♪Not a patch of land is wasted♪

280
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,990
♪No tea plant is left withered♪

281
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,570
♪The sky drops rain, birds eat worms,
and chickens leave manure♪

282
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,530
Though the business is small,

283
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,680
it yields a steady trickle of income,

284
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,610
adding to the daily household expenses.

285
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,400
We finally don't have to
just eat into our savings anymore.

286
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:47,570
♪Ah, in the early spring,
we pick the tea leaves♪

287
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,400
Miss Zhi,

288
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,130
look how much we've earned today.

289
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,040
Come on, count it.

290
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,250
Let me sort it out.

291
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,040
The business isn't bad, huh?

292
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,650
Shaoyao didn't come today.

293
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,080
There's a sick chick at home;

294
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
she's looking after it.

295
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,650
My neck has been
uncomfortable these past few days,

296
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,680
so it can't be exposed to the wind.

297
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,530
If you can't lie,

298
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,200
you'd better not say anything.

299
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,160
I've never asked you about

300
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,200
the scar on your face.

301
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,250
So don't you ask mine either.

302
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,970
Isn't it all because of Shaoyao?

303
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
If Shaoyao hadn't
applied medicine for me,

304
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,490
I might also have a scar.

305
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,010
This minor injury
will heal in a few days.

306
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:22,440
By the way,

307
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,730
I took home the pastry

308
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,680
from Ruihe House that

309
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,400
you gave me that day.

310
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,610
But I feel that

311
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,440
it's not much different

312
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
from what Fudong made.

313
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,320
Why are people

314
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,440
willing to spend hundreds of money

315
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,890
to buy pastries at Ruihe House?

316
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,890
With your neck like this,

317
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,850
you're still
thinking about these things.

318
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,770
I don't think with my neck, do I?

319
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,280
The Imperial Capital
is teeming with the rich

320
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,400
and many just follow the trend.

321
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,040
Regardless of what Ruihe House sells,

322
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,280
they will just buy it.

323
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,130
You are thinking the same way as me.

324
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,130
What?

325
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,730
Is Willow Street
not good enough for you?

326
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,040
If you're not advancing,
you're retreating.

327
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,970
Brother!

328
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,400
Brother, look!

329
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,250
The chick that Grandma taught me to sew.

330
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,610
Grandma?

331
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,080
That one, the one
with the long white hair...

332
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,490
She is my grandmother.

333
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,920
Then, I'll go inside first.

334
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,370
I won't disturb your
conversation with your sibling.

335
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,560
Shaoyao.

336
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:37,920
Shaoyao,

337
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,680
are you happy here?

338
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,680
I want you to be this happy too.

339
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,200
Brother,

340
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
why don't you come over

341
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,130
and live with us?

342
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,320
I'll come to see you
every day from now on.

343
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,770
And to see Zhi too.

344
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,400
She likes you a lot.

345
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
Who told you that?

346
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,920
Every time you two are together,

347
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,250
She becomes very happy.

348
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,490
Because she likes you.

349
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,920
Just like I like you.

350
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,160
She also likes me very much.

351
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:20,920
Shaoyao,

352
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,770
there's something I want to ask you.

353
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,130
In our mansion,

354
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,280
there's a servant named Dong Da.

355
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,490
Do you know him?

356
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,800
He came to see me

357
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,970
and s-spoke to me.

358
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,610
What did he say to you?

359
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,200
A lot of

360
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:35,970
Very strange things.

361
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,400
He said when my mother died,

362
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,560
something about whomsoever came.

363
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,770
So, what did you tell him?

364
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,320
I... I don't know

365
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,250
I,

366
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,250
I... I was very tired, and then,

367
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,040
Then I fell asleep.

368
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,800
And then there was a fire.

369
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,800
He... He couldn't make out...

370
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,280
He couldn't get it out of me,
so he left.

371
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,530
Don't tell anyone about the questions

372
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,320
I asked you today,

373
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,320

377
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,250
These past few days,
they've searched all over downtown

378
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:21,920

about the past?

410
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,080
At that time, Shaoyao was too young

411

to remember anything.

412
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440

and not let anyone
harm her in the slightest.

to Aunt Xia in advance.

lies in the effort she puts into it.

561
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,410
♪Just go♪

562
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,930
Look,

563
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,360
just look.

564
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,450
It's only been three months

565
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,770
and all the little
profit saved up before

566
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,730
has been lost.

567
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,690
Shuixing Pavilion and Fengxiang Pavilion

568
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,360
have both sent
people over several times,

569
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:40,560
saying that our Hua Family

570
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:41,880
cannot favor one over another

571
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,250
and asking us to
supply them with pastries as well,

572
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,880
even if it means paying more.

573
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,280
Hua's only supplies

574
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,040
the three best restaurants
in the Imperial Capital.

575
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,880
They're becoming restless.

576
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,080
Aunt Xia,

577
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:53,490
make an appointment with
their shopkeepers tomorrow

578
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:54,120
to discuss the price.

579
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:55,930
Discuss what price?

580
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,320
They are all

581
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,730
reputable and
well-known large restaurants.

582
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,410
So, they can't be charged

583
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,640
the same price as the street stalls.

584
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:02,770
Alright.

585
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,250
Miss Hua, you need not explain it.

586
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:15,410
I know why

587
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,360
you are here.

588
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:18,730
The three months are up.

589
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:19,970
Let me say it.

590
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,320
Please keep Hua's
pastry supply as usual.

591
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,410
Yunlai Restaurant will pay accordingly.

592
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,450
Mr. Bai,

593
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,930
the price for restaurants

594
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,320
is higher than for ordinary shops.

595
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,560
Ten wen per serving.

596
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,560
What do you think?

597
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,040
Sure.

598
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,880
Go make a signboard.

599
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,730
With ebony and gold lettering,

600
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,360
writing "Hua's Pastries".

601
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,490
120 wen per serving.

602
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,210
That expensive?

603
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,170
Miss Zhi,

604
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,770
you earn money by selling pastries

605
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,770
and your craftsmanship.

606
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:46,730
As for me,

607
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,560
I am selling

608
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,840
the brand value of Yunlai Restaurant.

609
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,170
How it can sell for

610
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,280
depends on my capability

611
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,730
and Yunlai's reputation.

612
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,530
I've learned a lot.

613
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,530
Yunlai can earn this money,

614
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,730
but Hua's honestly
can't earn this money at the moment.

615
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,120
What do you count for?

616
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,880
Ever since consigning
pastries at restaurants,

617
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,640
our earnings have been
far more than from the previous stall.

618
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,490
But relying solely on these restaurants

619
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,970
is ultimately not a long-term plan.

620
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,010
So?

621
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,800
So when enough money has been saved,

622
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:22,730
I want to have the Hua family

623
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,770
own our shop front

624
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,530
and truly establish
a business in the Imperial Capital.

625
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,250
You are experienced and knowledgeable;

626
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,250
why don't you say something?

627
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,690
You must already have

628
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,530
an answer in mind.

629
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,880
So why bother asking me?

630
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,600
Because besides you,

631
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,120
I don't know who else to ask.

632
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,450
Mother and the others don't understand.

633
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,080
Aunt Xia only knows
how to pour cold water.

634
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,120
Then how do you know

635
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,170
that I won't discourage you?

636
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,280
You dare?

637
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,010
If you've really made up your mind,

638
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,040
just go do it.

639
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,320
I believe in you.

640
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:50,640
Brother.

641
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,770
Brother.

642
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,320
Zhi,

643
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,120
Grandma made it for me.

644
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,010
She taught me,

645
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,560
and she also braided my hair for me.

646
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,840
So, did you learn it?

647
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,010
No.

648
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,120
But I'll get it in two days.

649
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,600
Madam Hua, please have a look.

650
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,690
Are these stitches alright?

651
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,320
Much better than
when you just got married.

652
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,840
Still not quite as good as mine, though.

653
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,120
I'm not up to it anymore myself.

654
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:21,930
I can't see well.

655
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:23,930
We don't need you to do it now.

656
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,970
We can do it for you.

657
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,800
Madam Hua,

658
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,320
Zhi took over

659
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,450
a dozen restaurants' businesses,

660
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,410
I'm all muddled from exhaustion.

661
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,080
I can't even keep up with the accounts.

662
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Please review this.

663
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,530
All these hefty coppers we've earned

664
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,010
make all the day's fatigue joyful.

665
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,010
Jin'e,

666
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,930
there are no outsiders here.

667
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,930
Speak to us quietly.

668
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,320
is the profit for this month

669
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,210
more than last month?

670
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,640
It's more by this amount.

671
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,560
That impressive girl!

672
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:58,840
It really deserves

673
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,210
the effort she has put in.

674
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,210
Boli,

675
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,320
Boli.

676
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,840
It's time to get up and wash your face.

677
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,410
Hurry up.

678
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,930
You have to recite your lessons later.

679
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,640
Such a tiny child.

680
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,010
Why be so strict with him?

681
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,010
What's the matter, Bolin?

682
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,930
Do you not want to drink the duck soup?

683
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,360
I don't want to; I won't drink!

684
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,210
If you won't drink, I will.

685
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,360
Give it to me, not to you.

686
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,320
It's not so, you...

687
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,410
If you won't drink,
the rest of us still will.

688
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,280
I raised the ducks.

689
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,360
Why shouldn't I drink the soup?

690
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,690
Give it to me.

691
00:27:58,970 --> 00:27:59,600
I won't give it to you.

692
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:00,970
You give it to me.

693
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,600
Bolin...

694
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,450
I won't give it to you.

695
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:03,320
I can't catch up with you.

696
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,250
You, you give it to me.

697
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,170
If you don't drink,
the rest of us still will.

698
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:07,770
Stop running.

699
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,840
Madam Qi, look at him.

705
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,530
There's something

706
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,770
I've just gotten some clues;

707
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,970
I don't want to
keep everyone in the dark.

708
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,410
Zhi,

709
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,600
Speak up.

710
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,210
Why the secrecy?

711
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,880
We can move back to the downtown.

712
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,600
Really? The downtown? That's great!

713
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,250
That's wonderful!

714
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,930
Where will we move to?

715
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,490
The income from the past half-year

716
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,210
can be used to rent
a house back in the downtown.

717
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,250
Although it can't compare

718
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,250
to the size of our former residence.

719
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,530
It's just enough for us to live in.

720
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,530
Have you found a suitable house?

721
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,690
Yeah, I've found it.

722
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,800
If the money we've saved up

723
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,080
is not used to rent a courtyard,

724
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,530
we could use it to open a shop.

725
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,450
It's just that

726
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,880
if we handle one matter first,

727
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:25,360
another matter

728
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,730
will have to be
delayed for about half a year.

729
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,840
I'm thinking that this money

730
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,210
was earned by our joint effort,

731
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,930
so we must discuss it together.

732
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,280
In my opinion,

733
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,210
it's important to
move back to the downtown quickly.

734
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,690
How can we live out here

735
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
in the wilderness for long?

736
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:41,800
Not to mention other things,

737
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,410
just the villain last time

738
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,410
who broke into our manor
is dangerous enough.

739
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,210
Just think, in the downtown,

740
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,040
such a thing would never happen

741
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,280
Yes, yes.

742
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,120
What Jin'e said is right.

743
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,730
Now when I think about that incident,

744
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,320
my heart still pounds with fear.

745
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,930
Yes, yes.

746
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,880
Madam Xia is making sense.

747
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,640
If it's delayed for another half year,

748
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,770
the beginning of Autumn is upon us.

749
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,010
Then the children and Madam Hua

750
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,170
surely can't suffer the cold.

751
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,080
Dear aunt,

752
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,250
our current cash

753
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,880
can't afford a mansion with
tall walls and deep courtyards.

754
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,080
Well, forget it.

755
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,880
Low walls and small courtyards
can be home, too.

756
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,320
As long as it

757
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,880
has a few more proper rooms than here.

758
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:16,010
And what else?

759
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,170
Hire a few more guards.

760
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,320
That way, we can live in peace.

761
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,210
Yes, indeed.

762
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,970
By that time,

763
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,490
Yuniang's child
will also have been born.

764
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,210
And we'll have a new house to live in.

765
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,800
Good.

766
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,320
Since everyone agrees,

767
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,640
then let's settle on that.

768
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,490
Oh my dear lady,

769
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,930
please don't dawdle.

770
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,280
Hurry up and rent the house.

771
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,120
And quickly employ the guardians, too.

772
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:39,560
I'll go put down the deposit right now.

773
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,930
A choice house won't wait for you.

774
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,210
Don't let the opportunity

775
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,170
slip away!

776
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:44,930
Go, let's go.

777
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,210
You've all been spoiled.

778
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,730
With all this chattering,

779
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,490
I haven't even spoken yet.

780
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,320
Let's move!

781
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:21,880
Come on, be careful.

782
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:22,880
Slow down.

783
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,210
Come.

784
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,360
Come.

785
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,410
Slow down.

786
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,010
Madam Hua,

787
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,530
everything has been arranged.

788
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,600
The new house is beautiful.

789
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,840
How wonderful.

790
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,320
You should instruct them that

791
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,410
once in downtown, keep our voices down.

792
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:38,490
No noisy clamor,

793
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,690
lest we draw envy.

794
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:40,410
Yes.

795
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,840
Aunt Wu, you are too reckless.

796
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,930
You can't do this.

797
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,770
I can't just lie around all day, right?

798
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,490
You and Jin'e came back
after paying the deposit.

799
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,320
Hurry.

800
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,880
There is one thing

801
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,280
I have to apologize to you.

802
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,690
What happened?

803
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,080
I went to redeem
those 17 jars of wine on the way.

804
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,170
But the shopkeeper hemmed and hawed.

805
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,450
He said the wine
had been redeemed already.

806
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,600
No matter how I asked,

807
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,970
hee wouldn't say who did it.

808
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,690
In any case, I was too late.

809
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,560
I have failed to live up to
Uncle Pingyang's good intentions.

810
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,560
So it was just a few jars of wine

811
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,320
that made you utter this long speech.

812
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,770
If your Uncle Pingyang were here,

813
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,120
he would also twist your mouth.

814
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,320
Anyway, when he comes back,

815
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,880
I will return his favor.

816
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,970
Okay.

817
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,210
[Hua Mansion]

818
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,410
The residence is tidy indeed.

819
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
It's just not grand enough;

820
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:20,970
not as good as

821
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,690
the theater stage in our former mansion

822
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,250
You're talking nonsense.

823
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,640
The theater stage wasn't that big.

824
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,600
Right?

825
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,730
Well, forget it.

826
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,930
Nowadays, we don't
fuss over these things anymore.

827
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,490
Madam Hua

828
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,530
should certainly live in the
main room of the eastern courtyard.

829
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:36,600
That room is the largest and brightest.

830
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,010
Zhegui,

831
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,770
go find a room with sunlight

832
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,770
for Boli.

833
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,560
Quickly go.

834
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,730
Chanlu,

835
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,690
You also hurry and get Zhi

836
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,490
a room sorted.

837
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,040
Once you've finished,
come to tidy up mine.

838
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,930
Mother,

839
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:50,600
I want to live in a place

840
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,840
close to the garden

841
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,880
where I can take strolls.

842
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,250
And you, Sister Ling?

843
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,040
I want a room

844
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,080
by the water, a quiet place.

845
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,170
Then let's go.

846
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,210
You all stop.

847
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,600
Zhi,

848
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,010
you choose first.

849
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,490
Yeah, that's right.

850
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,360
You pick a room first.

851
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,970
You have a lot of work to do;

852
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,530
If you can't live comfortably,

853
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,970
you'll have trouble sleeping.

854
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,490
Aunties and sisters,

855
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,280
have you all chosen yet?

856
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,320
Zhi,

857
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:28,410
you don't need to worry about us.

858
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,690
Just pick one as you wish.

859
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,410
Even if you live right above us,

860
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:32,840
we wouldn't have a word of complaint.

861
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,770
Jin'e,

862
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,770
the more you talk,
the less serious you become.

863
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,040
Zhi,

864
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,450
you must take good care of yourself.

865
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,800
Only if you're well

866
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,880
will our family get better and better.

867
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,530
By the way,

868
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:49,120
set aside a room for Zhong separately.

869
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,560
Being of advanced age,

870
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,930
he needs to live comfortably.

871
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,040
We owe him a lot for these days.

872
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:54,970
Yes.

873
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:56,450
Grandma,

874
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,970
what about me? Where do I live?

875
00:34:59,170 --> 00:34:59,730
You

876
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,880
just choose one

877
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,280
besides mine.

878
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,170
So that you

879
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,040
can directly come to my room

880
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,250
when you're free

881
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,800
and chat with me.

882
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:12,560
What about Yuniang?

883
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,690
Pick another

884
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,010
warm, sun-facing room

885
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,970
for Yuniang to live there steadily.

886
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,770
Thank you so much, Madam Hua.

887
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,600
Crowded together with us

888
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,930
for such a long time,

889
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,280
busy and tired,

890
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,210
and having nothing decent to eat,

891
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,450
really pitiful,

892
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,450
yet she is without a word of complaint.

893
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,120
Now that days are better again,

894
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,080
why do you mention this, Madam Hua?

895
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,170
Looking back,

896
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,690
when all of us crammed under one roof

897
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,600
and slept for so long,

898
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,930
it was quite cozy.

899
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,250
If Yu

900
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,770
still misses that way of living,

901
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,800
it is not a big deal.

902
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,720
Let's visit the
Zihuang Residence next year

903
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,600
during the summer retreat.

904
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,760
Then next year we'll send a carriage

905
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,930
to take Jin'e there alone.

906
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,930
I think it's feasible.

907
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,490
I certainly don't want to go.

908
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,930
Let Yu go, let her go.

909
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,490
Hurry up and clean the room.

910
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:04,930
Let's go.

911
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,930
Go, let's go.

912
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,600
Go.

913
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,760
Grandfather, wait for me.

914
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,810
Once these cabinets are filled,

915
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,560
we can all be reunited.

916
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,080
Grandmother,

917
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,810
why haven't you gone to rest?

918
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,290
I can't sleep.

919
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:04,760
At this age,

920
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
whenever something comes to mind,

921
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,970
I must say it immediately.

922
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,410
Otherwise, I might forget it.

923
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,850
Do you feel

924
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,330
that our family's hardest days

925
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,120
are already behind us?

926
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,600
When people

927
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,490
in the most desperate times,

928
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,680
they can set aside

929
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,330
all grievances.

930
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Yet once they've
eaten well, dressed well,

931
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
and are well housed,

932
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,330
all manner of issues

933
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,330
come out again.

934
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,890
So it goes to say that

935
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,450
going downstream

936
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,640
is not necessarily easier than
going up against the current.

937
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:40,450
From now on,

938
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,970
our toughest days begin.

939
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,890
From here on,

940
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,330
you will have to work even harder.

941
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,600
But I don't find it hard.

942
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,890
Before, staying in the mansion,

943
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,120
I always felt listless and bored.

944
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:55,490
That's because life

945
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
was not being lived by oneself

946
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,810
and was out of control.

947
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,080
Now, although there are
concerns with everything

948
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,890
and every matter
must be managed by myself,

949
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,040
I actually find it intriguing every day,

950
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,290
full of enthusiasm.

951
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,410
Just take care of things one by one;

952
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,720
everything can always be completed.

953
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,970
With so many matters,

954
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,160
what do you plan to do first?

955
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,370
I'm thinking that

956
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,010
now that we've moved back to downtown,

957
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,640
I want to send Bolin and Boli

958
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,600
to continue their studies.

959
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,640
I've visited the best private school;

960
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,970
we should let them try it out first.

961
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,930
But why is this matter?

962
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,450
If we lose the house,
we can buy another.

963
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,200
If we lose money, we can earn it back.

964
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,810
These are all material possessions.

965
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,290
But the Hu family's
tradition and culture,

966
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,560
must be carried forward.

967
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,410
These cannot be bought with money.

968
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,720
Bolin and Boli must
not stop their studies.

969
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,970
And I cannot allow them

970
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,010
to have their studies end with me.

971
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,640
As to these forty-three people,

972
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,160
I wonder how they're

973
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,410
all getting along now.

974
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,530
[Sanbai City]

975
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,010
Cakes, freshly baked cakes!

976
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,200
Take a look quickly!

977
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,240
Father,

978
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:16,890
I've bought some dry food.

979
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:18,290
Have one.

980
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,680
I'm not hungry, you eat it.

981
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,080
Father,

982
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,600
I never knew

983
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,680
that you had this skill.

984
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,560
You youngsters

985
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,200
have never experienced poverty.

986
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,330
When I was the age of Pingyang,

987
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,120
I'd go to the village school
to eavesdrop during the day;

988
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,640
and at night, I'd help
make hemp ropes at home.

989
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,040
After filling a basket,

990
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,290
I'd carry it to downtown to sell.

991
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:44,890
With the money from the sale,

992
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:45,890
I would buy a few

993
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,560
hot cakes to bring back.

994
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,450
That was after I met your mother.

995
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,120
Once,

996
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,970
she invited me to go out of
downtown to enjoy the spring.

997
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,160
Inside her handkerchief,

998
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,290
she had brought two cakes.

999
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,600
It was then that I knew that

1000
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,640
the cakes that rich people eat

1001
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,160
were stuffed with mutton inside.

1002
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,810
She looked at my silly appearance

1003
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,810
and laughed for a long time.

1004
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,410
I wonder how

1005
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,200
they are doing now.

1006
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,160
Father,

1007
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,450
you should stop worrying about them.

1008
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,720
With mother and Zhi there,

1009
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,080
they must be living better than us.

1010
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,490
At least their windows aren't drafty

1011
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,010
Big brother,

1012
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,600
throw me a cake, will you?

1013
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,450
I'm hungry.

1014
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,330
Want to eat, huh?

1015
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,450
Go buy it yourself.

1016
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,370
Big brother,

1017
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,720
I've been busy all day.

1018
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:38,680
Quick, come on.

1019
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:39,530
Big son.

1020
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,530
Come on, take it.

1021
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,640
Take it slow, okay?

1022
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,290
What are they doing?

1023
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:57,890
What's up?

1024
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,600
I don't know.

1025
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,810
This is...

1026
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,410
The Hua family.

1027
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,490
The Hua family is so impressive;

1028
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,760
they come back so soon.

1029
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,370
All the ladies in this house

1030
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,490
guarding this shiny silver,

1031
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,040
can they keep it secure?

1032
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,200
I doubt it.

1033
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:15,490
All of you, get lost.

1034
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,640
Is this the place for you to gossip?

1035
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,450
Scram, move aside!

1036
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,720
Get lost quickly, go!

1037
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,490
Scram!

1038
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,850
Move aside, move!

1039
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,010
Move it, quick!

1040
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,450
Hurry up and scram!

1041
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,120
Mr. Zhong.

1042
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,010
Mr. Zhong.

1043
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:27,810
This...

1044
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,290
Mr. Zhong.

1045
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,010
Are you saying

1046
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,450
Li Gui, the old guardian?

1047
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,370
I remember that he ran away

1048
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,160
the day of the seizure.

1049
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,240
It is him.

1050
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,810
He saw us move back to downtown,

1051
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,970
so he came running back himself.

1052
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,810
I have wronged you, Miss Zhi.

1053
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,490
I've wronged the Hua family.

1054
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,490
I did want to come back that day,

1055
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,330
but I saw our residence was already sealed,

1056
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,810
and I didn't know where you and Madam

1057
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,720
had gone.

1058
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,850
With my wife lying ill in bed,

1059
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
my little daughter still young,

1060
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,120
and my only son

1061
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,040
in the countryside
serving my old father,

1062
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,200
I really am...

1063
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,640
really...

1064
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,370
Please get up.

1065
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,450
It is human nature to
seek advantage and shun harm;

1066
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,410
I understand.

1067
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:13,080
Miss Zhi, you really are magnanimous,

1068
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,640
I am but a rough fellow.

1069
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,720
I speak bluntly,

1070
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,370
Miss Zhi, please don't get angry.

1071
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,560
This imperial capital

1072
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,370
is not a peaceful place.

1073
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,040
You could amass such a

1074
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
flourishing family
business in short time,

1075
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,530
as is known to all.

1076
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,330
The village neighbors are all watching.

1077
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,040
Just those boxes and cage

1078
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,720
would take many trips to move them in.

1079
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,040
As soon as I heard

1080
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,530
that Madam Xia was recruiting guardians,

1081
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,720
I immediately called back

1082
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,720
all of them.

1083
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,970
They are all former

1084
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:38,850
servants of the mansion.

1085
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,450
If you require it,

1086
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,160
we are willing to be at your disposal.

1087
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:46,040
You want to come back
as a guardian, right?

1088
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:47,760
Yes.

1089
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,080
The Hua family has
just entered downtown,

1090
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,970
and it is precisely
the time you need guardians.

1091
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:53,680
I am just afraid that you might not

1092
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,080
find the right candidates immediately,

1093
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,080
so I've brought over my son

1094
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,850
as well.

1095
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,600
His father owes a debt
of gratitude to the Hua family,

1096
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,370
and he also wants to contribute.

1097
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,330
You have even found all the people, huh?

1098
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,290
Fifteen strong men.

1099
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,680
They are all former

1100
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,560
servants of the mansion.

1101
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,330
That's why I've come from afar.

1102
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,600
Miss Zhi, please do not disdain us.
