It's not that easy.

184

That's correct.

185

00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,430
to the State Finance Commissioner

190
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,600
and Minister Zheng,

191
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,550
as well as Defender-in-Chief Wang.

192
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,790
Go and meet with them all.

193
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,670
No.

194
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,510
As the saying goes,

195
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,080
a stitch in time saves nine.

196
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,200
Better early than late.

197
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,550
Don't wait till tomorrow.

198
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,750
Go today and see what happens.

199
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,000
Understood.

200
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,840
Good to see you, Mr. Shen.

201
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,240
Mr. Jiang?

202
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,480
Mr. Jiang,

203
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,360
You...

204
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,960
Why are you here?

205
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,150
I've come to return

206
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,600
your betrothal gifts.

207
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,550
Your parents and sister

208
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,630
must be very angry now, right?

209
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,150
I am truly too embarrassed to see you.

210
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,270
Mr. Shen,

211
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,960
you've already
given your heart to another.

212
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,240
Why didn't you tell us?

213
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,750
How did you know?

214
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,960
You made such a scene.

215
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,670
Even my sister has figured it out.

216
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,910
Mr. Shen,

217
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,840
you didn't have to do that.

218
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,360
If I had said

219
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,600
that I'm already
in love with someone else

220
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,320
and that I don't want
to marry your sister,

221
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,440
your sister would definitely

222
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,000
feel embarrassed, wouldn't she?

223
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,320
Also, if the word gets out,

224
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,270
your family will be disgraced.

225
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,360
So I decided

226
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,750
to let your parents

227
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,150
think that I am just

228
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,510
a hopeless loser.

229
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,510
In this case,
after your family rejected me,

230
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,440
I'd be the only one who got disgraced.

231
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,600
To my surprise,

232
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,240
you turn out to be
such a thoughtful man.

233
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,870
Sadly, my sister doesn't have a chance
to marry you.

234
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,440
But in fact,

235
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,120
the one I love

236
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,960
might not marry me either.

237
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,320
She is not the same

238
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,390
as the other girls.

239
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,550
Perhaps,

240
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,390
we can only be good friends.

241
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,390
Then why did you...

242
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,510
I cannot go

243
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,150
against my true feelings
and get married.

244
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,270
Moreover,

245
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,030
Miss Jiang is innocent.

246
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,390
I cannot ruin her life.

247
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,480
Mr. Shen,

248
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,480
no matter what happens
between our families,

249
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,960
you and I will always be friends.

250
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,150
As long as you don't disdain me.

251
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,270
Careful.

252
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,240
Don't blame my curiosity.

253
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,390
Mr. Shen,

254
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,600
which family is the miss you love from?

255
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,480
She...

256
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
She has no family.

257
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,790
She just lodges with the Hua Family.

258
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,030
The Hua Family?

259
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,510
The one running Zhiming Restaurant.

260
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,720
Then does she know
that your betrothal was called...

261
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,840
No, I mean,

262
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,000
does she know you were betrothed?

263
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,120
Perhaps at this very moment,

264
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,630
she is at home feeling heartbroken.

265
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,910
You're right!

266
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,120
She must be extremely sad!

267
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,150
I must go find her.

268
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,750
No, I can't.

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,600
Now my family

270
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,270
will surely not allow me to leave.

271
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,390
Mr. Shen,

272
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,270
are you able to stand up now?

273
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,240
You can hide in my carriage.

274
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,790
Shaoyao!

275
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,840
You...

276
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,120
What happened to you?

277
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,670
What's going on?

278
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,200
Why do you always get hurt?

279
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,360
Who knows?

280
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
Perhaps even heaven knows

281
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,840
that with you here,

282
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,910
I can take a few hits without dying.

283
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,510
Shaoyao,

284
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,150
I have something

285
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,390
very important to tell you.

286
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,120
What is it?

287
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:39,550
I don't have to get married anymore.

288
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,870
No need to get married?

289
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,720
Really?

290
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,720
That's great!

291
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,840
You don't have to...

292
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,600
Shen Huan.

293
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,870
Earlier you told me

294
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,390
that you have affection for me.

295
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,120
I've thought about it.

296
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,360
You're not like the others.

297
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,670
My brother and Zhi,

298
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,630
when spending time with me,

299
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,360
always try so hard to protect me

300
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,150
and indulge me.

301
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,240
Like, like...

302
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,670
Like the teacup

303
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,600
on Zhi's table.

304
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,510
Baoxia cherishes it so much

305
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,000
that she won't even
allow anyone else to touch it.

306
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,870
But then I met you.

307
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,720
You bullied me from the start.

308
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,670
Only you

309
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,790
don't look at me differently.

310
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,870
We can do bold things together.

311
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,440

Little cutie!

Stay still.

335
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,670
Don't move.

336
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,600
I can't let you run around.

337
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,870
Sorry.

338
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,320
I mistook you for Mr. Zheng.

339
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,440
Is Mr. Zheng

340
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,080
the one you fancy, miss?

341
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,200
No, he's not.

342
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,870
He's just a teacher

343
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,080
in our family academy.

344
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,840
Even if it were Master Mu,

345
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,670
I would still jest in the same manner.

346
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,440
And who is Master Mu?

347
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,240
Master Mu's hair and beard

348
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,390
have both turned grey.

349
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Mister, please don't fabricate tales.

350
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,480
I certainly don't fancy him.

351
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,030
May I ask who your father is?

352
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,080
My father is Hua Pingyu.

353
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
Mister, what about you?

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,630
Are you also here to be a teacher?

355
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,600
I am here visiting with a friend.

356
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,080
I would like to take my leave now.

357
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,790
But I can't find the way out.

358
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,600
Our courtyard is large.

359
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,840
It's only your first visit,

360
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,600
so I'm not surprised that you got lost.

361
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,550
Could I trouble you, miss,
to show me the way out?

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,030
My name is Jiang Zhengzhi.

363
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm Hua Rong.

364
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,270
No.

365
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,630
Qin once said

366
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,840
that I shouldn't
let others know my maiden name.

367
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,150
Miss, rest assured.

368
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,790
I did not hear it clearly.

369
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,910
Are you angry?

370
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Don't you want to leave?

371
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,960
Then hurry up and follow me.

372
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,400
If you have the audacity,

373
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,070
don't come home
for the rest of your lives!

374
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,480
One ran away,

375
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,830
and the other did the same.

376
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,480
I'm so angry!

377
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,550
Earlier, your father asked you to visit

378
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,510
the State Finance Commissioner
and the others.

379
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,000
Any news from them?

380
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,110
Don't even mention it.

381
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,640
Those old foxes in the capital

382
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
are far craftier than Jiang.

383
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,070
They have probably heard of something

384
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,680
and they weren't even willing to see me.

385
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,240
The Security Bureau

386
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,550
has already turned Lord Xian's Mansion

387
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,920
upside down.

388
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,350
People associated with him

389
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,240
will sooner or later be listed.

390
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,640
But now it's uncertain

391
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,920
if that list

392
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,200
was delivered to His Majesty

393
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,590
and if our names

394
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,550
are on it.

395
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,240
What...

396
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,030
Hope our names are not on the list.

397
00:17:58,790 --> 00:17:59,270
Sir,

398
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,640
how much is this?

399
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,960
Miss, you have quite discerning eyes!

400
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,550
This is Huizhou craftsmanship,

401
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,640
made of beech wood.

402
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:06,960
That won't do, then.

403
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,110
The building of our Zhiming Restaurant
is quite old.

404
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,310
If this was placed on the second floor,

405
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm afraid the floor would collapse.

406
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,350
It's for Zhiming Restaurant?

407
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,310
Then you must be the owner,

408
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,270
Miss Hua!

409
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,640
I've long heard of you!

410
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,310
This set isn't what you're looking for.

411
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,720
I've acquired a new set.

412
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Come, let me show you.

413
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,480
This is the set.

414
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,270
Check this craftsmanship.

415
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,400
These carvings are all freshly engraved.

416
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,680
They're made of brand new poplar wood,

417
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,310
perfect for placing
on the second floor for guests.

418
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,830
Are these all newly made?

419
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,880
Of course!

420
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,350
Mister,

421
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,240
this is a canopy bed from Jinling.

422
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:42,400
Look at these carvings

423
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,750
and these inscriptions.

424
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,480
What do you think?

425
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,680
No matter how many beds you will see,

426
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,070
this is definitely the best.

427
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,400
I'm not bragging,

428
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,480
but in the Imperial Capital,
it is only available in our shop.

429
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,590
The other shops cannot afford it.

430
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,640
It's too expensive.

431
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,350
What are you looking at this for?

432
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,830
I've heard about it long ago.

433
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,640
The dowry of a girl
from the Imperial Capital

434
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,200
must include a carved bed
to be considered decent.

435
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,200
Then I should buy one myself.

436
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,550
You're treating me like a stranger now.

437
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,830
If I brought this home,

438
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,270
they would laugh at me again.

439
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,160
You can do as you did the last time.

440
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,640
What did you say last time?

441
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,720
Again?

442
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
They are not fools.

443
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,480
Mr. Jiang,

444
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,000
please watch your step.

445
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,750
Shen Huan

446
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,030
has indeed been staying here recently

447
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,960
recovering from injuries.

448
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,880
I don't know what happened,

449
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,550
but he got beaten up by someone

450
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,830
so badly.

451
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,270
I mean, poor man.

452
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:37,110
It was painful even to look at him.

453
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,110
I am sorry.

454
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,960
I need to go to the bathroom.

455
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,270
I'll go find him myself later.

456
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,200
You go with Mr. Zhong first.

457
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,400
Okay, then.

458
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,070
You, follow me.

459
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,160
You again?

460
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,750
Miss.

461
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,590
You, the one who got lost.

462
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,750
Why are you here again?

463
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:06,960
I...

464
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,160
I've come to visit a friend.

465
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,960
Who is your friend?

466
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,880
Miss, please don't misunderstand.

467
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,400
I didn't mean you.

468
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,880
I meant Shen Huan.

469
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,830
Do you have anything else to say?

470
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,640
I...

471
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,790
I...

472
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,550
Then go to your friend.

473
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,510
Miss, please wait.

474
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,790
Recently,

475
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,270
I heard that on Zhou Bridge,

476
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,830
there's this honey slush

477
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,830
that I have yet to try.

478
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,310
Have you tried it, miss?

479
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,350
Everyone, be careful.

480
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,400
Yes, Madam.

481
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,400
Don't leave anything behind.

482
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,920
Yes.

483
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,270
Dear, where did Zhengzhi go?

484
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,240
Why hasn't he returned yet?

485
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,030
These days,

486
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,160
Yi hasn't been in a good mood.

487
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,480
She went to bed early.

488
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,680
As for Zhengzhi, well...

489
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,030
You didn't notice it before?

490
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,830
What's wrong?

491
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,200
These past few days,

492
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,240
when has he ever stayed home peacefully?

493
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,920
He's been outside all day,

494
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,030
acting so mysteriously.

495
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,720
I have no idea what he's up to.

496
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
I hope he's not with

497
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
any indecent friends.

498
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,200
Father, Mother.

499
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,750
What is...?

500
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,750
Zhengzhi,

501
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,790
you're finally back.

502
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,110
Go to your room

503
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,750
and check your belongings.

504
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,550
See if they're all packed well.

505
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,350
Why are you so surprised?

506
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
We're returning to Jinyang tomorrow.

507
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,400
I've told you before.

508
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,830
You just didn't listen.

509
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,790
What's wrong again?

510
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,590
Father, Mother,

511
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,750
I can't just leave like this.

512
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,680
I've fallen for someone.

513
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,480
I need your support, Father.

514
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,400
So many betrothal gifts!

515
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,920
Are these from the Jiang Family,

516
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,160
the Transport Commissioner
of the Six Routes?

517
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,680
Yes.

518
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,750
Rong is truly fortunate.

519
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,680
I just wonder how old

520
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,310
is this young man from the Jiang Family.

521
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,640
Eighteen.

522
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,880
I really didn't expect

523
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,720
that my Rong
would have such good fortune.

524
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,110
How come he suddenly
offers betrothal gifts to Rong?

525
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,000
Rong is still young.

526
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,240
I don't know

527
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,240
if she's willing to accept this.

528
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,240
That family has an honorable background,

529
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,960
and the man is young.

530
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,310
Why wouldn't Rong accept it?

531
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,350
However,

532
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,440
earlier I heard that the betrothal

533
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:46,590
between the daughter of Mr. Jiang

534
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,790
and the second son of Mr. Shen

535
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,030
was called off unpleasantly.

536
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,350
We don't know

537
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,240
what exactly happened.

538
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,640
Jin'e, rest assured.

539
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,960
This has nothing to do

540
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,640
with the son of Mr. Jiang.

541
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,400
I'll explain it to you later.

542
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,640
Okay.

543
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,350
This whole thing is quite strange.

544
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,350
We still need to ask Rong

545
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,270
for her own opinion.

546
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,680
Marriage is a major affair.

547
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,400
The elders should make the decision.

548
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,510
We ask the girl?

549
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,510
Zhi, what do you need me for?

550
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So many chests!

551
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,000
What are all these?

552
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,030
Rong,

553
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,750
someone proposed to you.

554
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,640
These are all your betrothal gifts.

555
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,270
Betrothal gifts?

556
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,160
What betrothal gifts?

557
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,030
Who sent these betrothal gifts?

558
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,920
Mother, I don't want to get married!

559
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,350
I want to stay with you.

560
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,030
They're from the Jiang Family
from Jinyang.

561
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,310
The Jiang Family?

562
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,000
Jiang Zhengzhi?

563
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,200
Do you know him?

564
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,680

was about how to unite the emperor

the questions in past years

691
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,700
were all set by Hua Yizheng.

Regarding that person,

693
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,100

Your Majesty,

695
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,700
Hua Yizheng is learned and eloquent,

696
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,620
yet he was quite
conceited about his talents.

697
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,900
In order to be known
as a forthright official,

698
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,940
he even tried to tarnish
your great reputation.

700
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,660
and to reflect upon myself.

Your Majesty,

702
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660

In my point of view,

704
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,500
it was indeed Hua Yizheng's own fault.

705
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,580

His Majesty's questions,

711
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,660
he must have also been on the edge
between life and death

712
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,740
like this.

713
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,100
Your Majesty,

714
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,380
I dare not to answer your question
dishonestly.

715
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,380
I believe

716
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,860
that among all the courtiers,

718
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,420

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,660
I have heard

721
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,420
that back when you were
in the Imperial Academy,

722
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,300
your integrity was already known

723
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,940
among the Hanlin scholars.

724
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,860
So today,

725
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,220
are you emulating Hua Yizheng?

726
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,420
Your Majesty,

727
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,580
I don't want
to seek fame and reputation.

728
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,020
For ten years,

729
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,540
I studied Confucian classics,
delved into the path of the sage,

730
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,620
all to assist Your Majesty

731
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,660
in governing and promoting civilization.

732
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,820
Throughout history, loyal ministers

733
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,820
have always placed their sovereigns
in an immaculate position.

734
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,060
It is only because of this,

735
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,980
I am constantly filled with anxiety

736
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,940
because of Master Hua's misfortune.

737
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,980
I truly hope Your Majesty can avoid
public criticism.

738
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,900
Then what do you think

739
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,540
I should do?

740
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,420
Master Hua is honest and righteous.

741
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,420
Despite opposing the royal will,

742
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,580
he served the empire

743
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,860
rather than personal interests.

744
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,180
I pray Your Majesty will

745
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,620
acknowledge his loyalty

746
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,700
and pardon his breach of etiquette.

747
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,700
Shen Qi,

748
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,580
you and the granddaughter of Hua Yizheng

749
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,260
were betrothed, right?

750
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,260
Your Majesty,

751
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,940
the betrothal has already been annulled.

752
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,580
Then you are indeed very faithful.

753
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,140
Your Majesty,

754
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,220
since the betrothal has been annulled,

755
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,500
there is no longer any connection
between the two families.

756
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,940
What I have said

757
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,780
has nothing to do with that.

758
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,180
Come here, Shen Qi.

759
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:56,900
Take a few steps closer

760
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,700
and let me take a look at you.

761
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,540
Has anyone ever told you

762
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,260
that you are not
like Shen Zhongxing at all?

763
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,780
Your Majesty, I do not understand.

764
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
We already have a bed,

765
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,380
but we need to buy a few more chests.

766
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,300
Let me see what else we are missing.

767
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,180
[Purchasing list]
What is this?

768
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,340
The wedding is so important for us.

769
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,180
Of course we must prepare well.

770
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,140
You've become
even more annoying than before.

771
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,260
Apart from these,

772
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,220
I have to get you some betrothal gifts.

773
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,140
I certainly can't offer less
than the Shen Family did, right?

774
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,060
What's the matter?

775
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,540
Do you know that

776
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,740
the Shen Family...

777
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,460
Commander,

778
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,940
you're urgently summoned by His Majesty.

779
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,540
Since the list

780
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,620
has long been prepared,

781
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,700
why didn't you hand it to me earlier?

782
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,140
The matter involves accusations
of treason, implicating many.

783
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,340
I have yet to untangle

784
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,180
the relationships involved,

785
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,620
so I feared it may lead
to wrongful convictions.

786
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,780
Your Majesty, I earnestly request you

787
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,020
to grant me some more time,

788
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,860
so I can thoroughly examine the case.

789
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,700
You think

790
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,260
I didn't give you enough time,

791
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,060
right?

792
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
How come I feel

793
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,700
that you have quite a lot of time?

794
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,100
[Shen Zhongxing and his son]

795
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,500
Uncle.

796
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,260
Shen Zhongxing and his son

797
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,140
are just accustomed

798
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,860
to sucking up to the superior
and stepping on the inferior.

799
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,300
They flattered whoever was in power.

800
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,620
Those they have fawned over

801
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,100
are not limited to just Gu Yangong.

802
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,340
They are merely petty men.

803
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,700
To consider them
as part of Gu Yangong's faction,

804
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,220
I feel

805
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,740
that would be somewhat unjust.

806
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,180
Yanxi.

807
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,220
Just now was the first time

808
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,100
you attempted to deceive me.

809
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,540
What a pity.

810
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,740
The Shen Family is accused
of being in league with rebels

811
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,500
with the punishment
extending to the entire clan.

812
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,060
Their property will be confiscated,

813
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,460
men will be imprisoned,

814
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,860
and women and children
will be sold into servitude.

815
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,780
Do you have anything else to say?

816
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:30,900
No.

817
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,500
Very good.

818
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,740
Then go and deal with it.

819
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,060
Yes.

820
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,900
Changqing.

821
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,220
Yes.

822
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,780
Last time when I went
to the Fengxiang Palace,

823
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,620
I didn't seem to take this path.

824
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:09,940
She has gone to the Palace?

825
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,020
Yes, indeed.

826
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,660
Just like that time
with the Empress Dowager,

827
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,300
a eunuch came
to deliver a verbal decree,

828
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,380
asking Lady Zhi to bring some pastries

829
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,260
into the Palace.

830
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,700
His Majesty arrives.

831
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,940
I did not summon Zhi today.

832
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,380
Grandmother,
I will accompany you another day.

833
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,220
Wait.

834
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:53,980
This is urgent.

835
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,580
Yanxi, you are muddled.

836
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,500
If you go to her right now,

837
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,020
this will only further prove

838
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,020
how important she is to you.

839
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
You should think about it.

840
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,460
How will your uncle treat her?

841
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,300
I've heard that the Hua's pastries

842
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,780
have become famous throughout
the Imperial Capital

843
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,180
and that even the Empress Dowager
has taken a liking to them.

844
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,260
You are very clever.

845
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,140
You've even brought your business

846
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,500
to my Imperial Palace.

847
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,500
Your Majesty,

848
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,380
the Hua Family has only
women and children left.

849
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,220
We're making pastries
merely to scrape by.

850
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,020
Receiving the Empress Dowager's favor

851
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,940
was an unexpected honor

852
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,620
and a great fortune.

853
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,140
What the Empress Dowager dotes on

854
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,740
is not your pastry

855
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,700
but someone related to you.

856
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,220
Yanxi is her most beloved grandchild.

857
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,820
Your Majesty, I dare not to deceive you.

858
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,220
The young lord and I
do share true affection.

859
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,060
Stand up.

860
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,980
Open the food box
and show what's inside to me.

861
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:54,140
The sprouting of affection
between a girl and a boy

862
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,580
is very normal.

863
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,060
It doesn't matter.

864
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,660
No need to be concerned about it.

865
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,260
I too was once young

866
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,620
and privately committed

867
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,860
to the daughter of a general.

868
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,180
Do you know what happened afterward?

869
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,940
No.

870
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,060
Later,

871
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,700
I ascended to the throne

872
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,300
and brought her into the Palace
according to our agreement.

873
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,620
It is just that her father

874
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,860
did not know how to retreat in time

875
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,500
and actually had the audacity
to speak nonsense before me.

876
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,660
I then annihilated her entire family.

877
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,940
She ultimately took her own life
in the Palace.

878
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,300
Hua Zhi,

879
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,940
you are too young

880
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,780
to understand

881
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,940
that the temperament
of those born in the royal family

882
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,860
is different from
that of ordinary people.

883
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,220
For supreme power,

884
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,740
there is nothing

885
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,420
that they cannot sacrifice.

886
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,340
Of course,

887
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,660
I also know

888
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,780
that since Yanxi returned
from the northern land,

889
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,340
his days have been hard.

890
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,780
Occasionally trying some sweets

891
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,660
to relieve tiredness

892
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,260
is not necessarily a bad idea.

893
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,660
You should be more considerate to him.

894
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,620
After all, if he lives comfortably,

895
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,740
he'll work for me more efficiently.

896
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,020
Alright, go home.

897
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,860
Your Majesty,

898
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,980
I am a sinner from the Hua Family.

899
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,540
Keeping me by Yanxi's side,

900
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,140
aren't you worried, Your Majesty?

901
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,820
Sinner?

902
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,020
Have I blamed you?

903
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,820
Your grandfather

904
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,060
and your father

905
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,740
are both too arrogant.

906
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,100
But neither they

907
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:39,820
nor you

908
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:40,980
are of any significance

909
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,780
in my eyes.

910
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,620
Yes,

911
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,900
no significance.

912
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,140
The word "no significance" from you

913
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,140
can be a devastating disaster

914
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,620
to the others.

915
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,380
Not just my grandfather and me.

916
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,100
Be it the Hua Family,
the Wang Family, or the Li Family,

917
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,100
to you,

918
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,060
they are all of no significance.

919
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,340
What a girl.

920
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,420
Sharp and clear-sighted.

921
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,300
No wonder Yanxi

922
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,980
is attracted to you.

923
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,500
As such a smart girl,

924
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,820
you should be able to understand

925
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,780
that you being with Yanxi

926
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,900
will only harm him.

927
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
You and the eldest son
of the Shen Family

928
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,540
are friends.

929
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,900
Am I right?

930
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,660
Do you know

931
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,340
why I value Yanxi so much

932
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,300
and why I entrusted the Security Bureau

933
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,580
to him?

934
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,860
It is because

935
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,460
he is utterly loyal to me.

936
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,140
Also because
he can handle matters impartially.

937
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,460
He has no connection
with the Shen Family,

938
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,540
but today he pleaded for them.

939
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,660
That was because of you.

940
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,940
He tried to shield the Shen Family
for your sake.

941
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,940
So you shouldn't blame me.

942
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,020
Do you know that originally,
the crimes of the Shen Family

943
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,860
wouldn't have led
to the confiscation of their properties?

944
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,620
Confiscation?

945
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,420
You didn't know it?

946
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,740
I can tell you this.

947
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,660
The Shen Family's situation
is just the beginning.

948
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,300
No interference shall be allowed

949
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,340
in Yanxi's loyalty to me.

950
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,820
Anything that interferes
with his loyalty

951
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,700
will be considered insignificant to me.

952
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,700
Now, do you understand?

953
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,580
If yes, you may leave.

954
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,500
The pastries you made
are indeed delicious.

955
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,500
Next time when you send some to
the Empress Dowager,

956
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,420
remember to send me some as well.

957
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,820
If I have time,

958
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,980
I will tell you

959
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,700
about Yanxi's childhood.

960
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,420
Follow them.

961
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:13,900
My lady,

962
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:14,740
it seems like
the Security Bureau is going

963
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,620
to raid someone's residence.

964
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:16,940
Are we really following them?

965
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,580
Yes.

966
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,100
Madam!

967
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:22,780
Search this place!

968
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,700
Something terrible has happened!

969
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,180
Madam, Madam Shen!

970
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,500
Madam Shen!

971
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,300
Search!

972
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,780
Stop right there!

973
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,420
Don't run!

974
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,620
Stop right there!

975
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,820
- Here.
- Don't move!

976
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,300
My house is
a third-rank official residence

977
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,340
and my grandson just got second place
in the imperial examination.

978
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,380
You...

979
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,340
How dare you do this to us!

980
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,740
The minister of the Court
of the Imperial Treasury,

981
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,660
Shen Zhongxing, has been
imprisoned for his crimes,

982
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,940
implicating the entire clan.

983
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,060
The Security Bureau is ordered
to confiscate the family properties

984
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,620
and sell all the women and children
from his family.

985
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,980
Take them away!

986
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,540
Let go of me!

987
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,940
Squat down properly.

988
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,740
Don't move.

989
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:40,820
Don't move!

990
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:41,980
Stay put!

991
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,020
They really should
investigate them thoroughly.

992
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,940
Investigate them carefully.

993
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,820
