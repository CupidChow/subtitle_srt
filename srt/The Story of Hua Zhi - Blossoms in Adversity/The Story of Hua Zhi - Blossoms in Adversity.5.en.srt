00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,910
What do you think of Zhi?

191
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,670
Madam,

192
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,750
I can't see through her,

193
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,270
so I'd rather not say.

194
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,990
But the way

195
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:46,990
she deals with things

196
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,670
is just like that
of Master Hua when he was young.

197
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,790
She takes after you even more.

198
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:54,190
She's just as stubborn as Master Hua,

199
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,150
and anything good about her
takes after me.

200
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,430
You're right about that.

201
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,720
[Plum Blossom Numerology]

202
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:04,910
Shaoyao.

203
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,590
Shaoyao.

204
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,510
I bought you a lot of fun things.

205
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,150
Look.

206
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,990
There're more.

207
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,590
Shaoyao.

208
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,950
Or if there's anything

209
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,670
you want,

210
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,270
I can buy it for you.

211
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,990
Did I scare you?

212
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,230
Did you make this?

213
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,950
Shaoyao.

214
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,550
How do I use it?

215
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,710
Can you teach me?

216
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,150
Silly man.

Ouchie, ouchie, go away.

Pain will fly away.

219
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,990
How is Madam Hua doing?

220
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,190
She went through a lot these days.

221
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,670
I'm afraid she needs some times to heal.

222
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,710
She's been coughing a lot today.

223
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,150
Bring the soup to her first.

00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,070

225
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,510
Come here.

226
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,470
This is for Boli.

227
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,630
Mother.

228
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,950
I don't want to drink that.

229
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,950
Boli, good boy.

230
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,390
Have some porridge first.

231
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,590
Tomorrow...

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,110
There will be nice food tomorrow.

00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,910
Why do you lie to him?

234
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,910
We don't have money for that.

235
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,190
I'm speaking to my son.

236
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,390
Mind your own business.

237
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,230
Boli, we can have the porridge
in our room.

238
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,230
Slow down.

239
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,990
Zhi.

240
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,550
Be careful.

241
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,430
Don't get your hand hurt.

242
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,030
Be careful.

244
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,510
Speaking of which,

245
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,790
the Shen Family

246
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:03,750
agreed to the marriage
of Shen Qi with Zhi.

247
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,150
And until now,

248
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,270
they haven't sent anyone

249
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,270
to call off the engagement.

250
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,230
I'm thinking

251
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,030
it can't be worse for us anyway.

252
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,270
For Zhi's sake,

253
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,390
if we try to

254
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,190
go to them for help...

255
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,030
Madam Xia, forget it.

256
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,390
We can't count on them now.

257
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,990
Fine.

258
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,870
You just won't listen, huh?

259
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,790
Anyway,

260
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,870
we will run out of food

261
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,630
within no time.

262
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,310
You always are a lone wolf.

263
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:26,910
You can just see us

264
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,030
starve to death.

265
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,830
Wake up.

266
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,950
We're on our own now.

267
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,830
We were a noble family in the past,

268
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,750
of course the Shen family
wanted to be in-laws with our family.

269
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,950
But now look

270
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,070
where we end up.

271
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,510
Nobody wants to be dragged into this.

272
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,230
Do you want to raise the family

273
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,550
by letting the girls get married?

274
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,350
Even if a princess is to marry,

275
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,590
she will not bring along

276
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,470
her aunts or nephews.

277
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,430
Jin'e.

278
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,270
Are you okay?

279
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,790
I'm fine, Jin'e.

280
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,830
Yuniang,

281
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,030
there're few choices left for us

282
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,830
after all that happened.

283
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,430
Hua Zhi is too proud

284
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,830
to ask for help.

285
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:14,990
And now

286
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,550
we two have to do whatever it takes

287
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,430
for this family.

288
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,310
I've thought it through.

289
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,990
Now there's only one way out.

290
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,750
Our parents both

291
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,630
live in the Capital.

292
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,030
If we don't ask them for help,

293
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,470
we can't even survive tomorrow.

294
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,030
Madam Hua

295
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,110
wouldn't agree to this for sure.

296
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,910
But now she is

297
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,910
lying in bed

298
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,830
without any extra energy.

299
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,270
We had no other choices.

300
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,950
I'm afraid this is the only way.

301
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,590
Zhi.

302
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,670
I know

303
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,670
you don't like this.

304
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,710
But I really don't know

305
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,990
who else can I turn to as my company?

306
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,910
No worries.

307
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,510
We can just hang around

308
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,590
in the downtown today.

309
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,910
It's the first time

310
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,950
that I walk on my feet

311
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,030
on the way to my parent's home.

312
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,470
In the past,

313
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,590
my mother treated me
like a little princess.

314
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,030
Even when it came to footbinding,

315
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,910
she couldn't bear to wrap them tightly.

316
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,630
And she didn't want those nursemaids

317
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,430
to bind my feet,

318
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,350
so she did that herself in tears.

319
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,270
She cried even louder than me.

320
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,870
And my father.

321
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,270
He always pulled on a long face,

322
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,870
so my brothers

323
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,710
were afraid of him.

324
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,390
I was the only kid

325
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,990
who could sit on his lap

326
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,150
and pluck his beard,

327
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,470
and he never got angry.

328
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,070
When I left for my wedding,

329
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,750
they wanted me to be respected
in your family,

330
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,710
so the amount of my dowry
was quite eye-catching.

331
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,750
The length of the procession
carrying the trousseau

332
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,510
was even longer than this whole street.

333
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,630
Zhi.

334
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,470
Tell me.

335
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,910
Where do I start

336
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,110
to ask for their help?

337
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,030
Everybody knows about
what happened to our family.

338
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,110
They will certainly be aware of that

339
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,190
even though you don't speak up.

340
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,990
Well,

341
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,590
how much money should I ask for?

342
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,190
If I ask for too little money,

343
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,670
I'm afraid they'd feel bad

344
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,990
and worry about my condition.

345
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,790
Aunt Wu.

346
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,590
Let's just go back.

347
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,070
Why?

348
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,750
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

349
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,510
No.

350
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,150
We can't go back

351
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,350
with empty hands.

352
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,070
You know better than anyone

353
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,270
what Jin'e is like.

354
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:28,910
How about this?

355
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,150
I'll just ask for 50 guan.

356
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,790
Use the money

357
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,950
for the monthly allowance first

358
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,950
to make them complain less.

359
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,590
The meal expenses

360
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,950
and the costs of Madam Hua's medicine

361
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,590
can also be covered.

362
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,350
We still need charcoal.

363
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,310
Duo cried during their sleep

364
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,190
because it was freezing cold.

365
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,270
I heard that.

366
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,830
Boli woke up in the middle of the night

367
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,550
also because of the cold.

368
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,950
We're here.

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,830
It's me.

00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,590
Can you hear me?

381
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,190
Open the door.

382
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:46,990
Father, mother.

383
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,190
Open the door, please.

384
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,950
Yu.

385
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,750
Mother.

386
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,630
Yu.

387
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,590
You...

388
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,350
You'd better leave.

389
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,470
Mother.

390
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,590
What did you say?

391
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,270
Your father

392
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,430
is an official.

393
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,550
And

394
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,870
your brothers...

395
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,510
Yu.

396
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,790
Go home.

397
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,190
When things calm down,

398
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,870
I'll talk to your father

399
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,270
and see what we can do for you.

400
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,270
Thank you, mother.

401
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,430
Yu.

402
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,150
Are you still there?

403
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,710
Tell me if you need anything.

404
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,270
I...

405
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,070
I will get you everything you need,

406
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,310
and I'll figure out

407
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,310
how to send things to you

408
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,230
after a while.

409
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,640
[Xia Mansion]

410
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,830
Did you bring it?

411
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,470
Madam.

412
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,510
How do I look?

413
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,930
[Xia Mansion]

414
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,350
Who is it?

415
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,150
It's

416
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,110
Madam Xia from the Hua Mansion.

417
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,190
It's me, Jin'e.

418
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,150
Go tell my parents.

419
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,070
Let's go.

420
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,950
We should head back.

421
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,630
Jin'e.

422
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,030
My Jin'e, you finally come back.

423
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,830
Mother.

424
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,670
Father.

425
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,710
Come on in.

426
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,110
Come on.

427
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,230
Move.

428
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,710
Aunt Wu.

429
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,910
You must feel unwell

430
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,750
with an empty stomach for so long.

431
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,670
Come, sit down.

432
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,390
I'll get you some water.

433
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,990
Zhi, don't.

434
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,750
It's not my stomach.

435
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,310
What's wrong then?

436
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,750
Why didn't you tell me?

437
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:26,870
Does Uncle Pingyang know?

438
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,750
It is still in the early months
of pregnancy.

439
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,590
And considering

440
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,870
the current situation of our family,

441
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,350
I think it's not the right timing.

442
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,670
Zhi.

443
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,710
People say

444
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,990
having something sour would help.

445
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,830
Try it.

446
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,990
You're a smart girl.

447
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,990
Haven't you heard about

448
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,470
the story
of the bitter plums by the road?

449
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,710
These haws are already out of season.

450
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:05,790
If they were tasty,

451
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,350
none would be left for us.

452
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,830
These are called hawthorn fruits.

453
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,710
Their trunks grow the fastest.

454
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,510
The villagers all chop them down
for firewood.

455
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,830
And its fruits can be used as medicine.

456
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,030
Have a taste.

457
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,510
See.

458
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,110
The fruits are not suitable for me.

459
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,350
Have a try.

460
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,550
It might help.

461
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,950
It's really delicious.

462
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,790
Is that so?

463
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,950
So sour.

464
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,790
You'd better spit it out.

465
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,230
These haws are so sour.

466
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,710
Only I can enjoy it.

467
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,750
Enjoy more.

468
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:47,870
I'll get you some later.

469
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,750
Don't run, you thieves!

470
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,550
How dare you steal my fruits?

471
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:54,270
The ones who stole my fruits

472
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:56,630
are bound to be punished.

473
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,750
I'm just a lonely old woman

474
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,750
and this is all I have.

475
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,150
A load of firewood

476
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,230
is worth five wen.

477
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:05,910
A whole basket of haws

478
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,830
is only worth three wen.

479
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,030
And it takes me four hours
to go to the downtown and sell them.

480
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,870
How dare you steal my fruits?

481
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,190
You are heartless.

482
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,270
I'm sorry, madam.

483
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,790
We thought they were wild berries.

484
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,510
Madam.

485
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,950
I'm pregnant.

486
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,710
Take my earrings.

487
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,750
We don't have food at home

488
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,710
and I've got a loss of appetite.

489
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,550
So she picked some fruits for me.

490
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,750
We'll leave now.

491
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,390
You're pregnant?

492
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,750
Wait.

493
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,790
Here.

494
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:44,990
Take it.

495
00:21:59,070 --> 00:21:59,830
Zhi.

496
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,390
Why is life so hard?

497
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,550
Take the money back to them.

498
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,190
Mother,

499
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,710
you and Father make me do this?

500
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,190
You're asking me to give the money
to people from the Hua Family,

501
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,910
leave Duo and Ling,

502
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,110
and live in solitude.

503
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,430
Jin'e.

504
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,230
They're so young and cute.

505
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,270
We also feel bad about this.

506
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,030
After all, they're related
to the Hua Family.

507
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,310
You can go out there

508
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,710
and ask around.

509
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,070
Nobody wants to have anything to do
with the Hua Family.

510
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,190
Then why did you

511
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,510
let me in?

512
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,910
Just kick me out.

513
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:46,790
Jin'e.

514
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,230
Please take our advice.

515
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,590
Your father has pulled so many strings

516
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,070
to have you back.

517
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,750
He's taking risks

518
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,790
in letting you step in here.

519
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,550
Your father is just

520
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,550
a little merchant
in the Imperial Capital.

521
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,230
Mother.

522
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,350
How can I

523
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,430
just care for myself?

524
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:12,350
Besides,

525
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,990
maybe there's still hope

526
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,190
for Boyu.

527
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,270
Don't have any false hopes.

528
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,470
Your husband

529
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,190
is beyond hope of survival.

530
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,510
I have already found you a litigator.

531
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,550
You will make a clean break

532
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,150
with the Hua Family soon.

533
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,150
I will take care of you
for the rest of your life.

534
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,350
But

535
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,310
if you want to bring your children

536
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,470
to live here,

537
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,230
I will not allow that.

538
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,110
Jin'e.

539
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,110
My darling.

540
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,830
Just say yes.

541
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,430
How can I

542
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,710
watch you live a life

543
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,830
so miserably?

544
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,390
Mother.

545
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,790
You're right.

546
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,230
But Duo and Ling

547
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,150
are also my darlings.

548
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,230
Father.

549
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,190
Mother.

550
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,590
I'm afraid

551
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,110
we have disagreements.

552
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,030
From now on,

553
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,430
I won't set foot in here anymore.

554
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,190
Jin'e.

555
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,390
Madam.

556
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,150
Don't be upset.

557
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,230
They love you more than anyone else,

558
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,070
but they have their concerns.

559
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,390
Of course.

560
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,550
They have their concerns.

561
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,510
Who doesn't?

562
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,270
I can just say yes

563
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,870
and beg for their mercy.

564
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,710
If it were in the past

565
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,270
when I was not married,

566
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,670
as long as I could

567
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,190
stay by their side,

568
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,030
I would say yes

569
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,910
to anything.

570
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,430
But now,

571
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,790
I am a mother myself,

572
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,190
so I cannot step back

573
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,070
and I must protect them.

574
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:39,710
I was just surprised

575
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,710
that they didn't

576
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,030
see my children as their family.

577
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:00,550
Madam.

578
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,310
Madam.

579
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,070
You fool.

580
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,470
That is made of copper.

581
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,910
Nothing expensive.

582
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:33,630
Let's go.

583
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,230
Let's go buy some persimmons.

584
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:35,990
Madam.

585
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,990
Take it.

586
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,030
Duo loves persimmons.

587
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,070
Let's go.

588
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,710
I've bought them.

589
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,710
Don't worry.

590
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,550
I went to every single bookstore

591
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,430
across the city.

592
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,430
All the medical books that I can find

593
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,030
are here.

594
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,790
How much do they cost?

595
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,910
It's nothing.

596
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,310
You don't have to pay me back.

597
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,670
Either you tell me

598
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,630
about the cost,

599
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,150
or you can practice at the martial camp
three days in a row

600
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,870
under my supervision.

601
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,190
Thirty guan,
eight hundred and fifty-two wen.

602
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,670
Sir.

603
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,190
Okay.

604
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,870
I'll pay you back
after I receive my salary.

605
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,830
You don't have to.

606
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:10,870
Okay, I will accept it.

607
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,030
Sir.

608
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,990
The scar on your face seems

609
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,910
to have faded.

610
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,070
Good girl.

611
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,910
Shaoyao.

612
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,550
Another bowl, alright?

613
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,950
How can you get better
if you don't drink the decoction?

614
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,270
See? If you drink it,

615
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,870
you can have honey plums.

616
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,150
No.

617
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,390
No.

618
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,110
No!

619
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:48,950
Please.

620
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,310
- You will get better this way.
- Hurry.

621
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,910
Drink it.

622
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,390
Shaoyao.

623
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,030
Shaoyao.

624
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,790
Are you okay?

625
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,070
Shaoyao.

626
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,790
Are you okay?

627
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,030
Give me the decoction.

628
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,550
Come on, good girl.

629
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,310
Drink it and you'll get better.

630
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,030
Come on.

631
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,750
Just one sip.

632
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,630
Take another sip.

633
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,990
It's okay, be good.

634
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,510
It's all right.

635
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,790
It's okay.

636
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,430
She said she didn't want to drink that.

637
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,430
Are you deaf?

638
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,670
Xi.

639
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:28,950
It's for her own good.

640
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,390
If she doesn't try this decoction...

641
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,270
So, all these years

642
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,870
this is how you've been treated her.

643
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,670
If she has to suffer like this

644
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,790
just because of her mental retardation,

645
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,710
I think it might be better

646
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,630
for her to stay that way

647
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,310
for a lifetime.

648
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,190
She is your sister.

649
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,670
You're in a more rightful position

650
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,470
to make the decision for her.

651
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,790
Go to the accounting room
and pay one guan to the physician.

652
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,670
Send him off.

653
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:51,630
Yes.

654
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,950
Thank you, Your Highness.

655
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:57,830
Xi.

656
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,270
Now that you are here,

657
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,910
spend some time with her.

658
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,830
I will not bother you.

659
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:17,590
It's cold on the ground.

660
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,950
Go back to your room.

661
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,270
Don't move.

662
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,910
I will carry you back.

663
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,590
Is that alright?

664
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,470
Let me get your medicine.

665
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,670
Hold on tight.

666
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,470
Yanxi.

667
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:13,110
Where have you been all these years?

668
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,750
You've grown so tall.

669
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,950
Those medicines are useless for me.

670
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,570
I'm well aware of that.

671
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,010
You are proficient in medicine

672
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,890
and you know about your sickness,

673
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,010
right?

674
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:01,730
No.

675
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,050
It's nothing like that, Yanxi.

676
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,610
I'm not sick.

677
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:06,690
I am...

678
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,170
I am scared.

679
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,730
What are you scared of?

680
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,650
I'm scared

681
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,610
that if I've grown up,

682
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,450
I won't remember Mother anymore.

683
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,450
If I don't remember her,

684
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,970
then no one will

685
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,490
in this world.

686
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,490
Silly girl.

687
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,410
I remember Mother as well.

688
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,650
And I haven't forgotten her
for even a day.

689
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,450
I heard you drove away the new physician

690
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,570
I had hired.

691
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,250
She has to take the bitterness
for her own recovery.

692
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,450
It's what she has to go through

693
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,530
to stay healthy one day.

694
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,850
There's no other way.

695
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,170
She's suffered for ten years.

696
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,610
Must she suffer
for the rest of her life?

697
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,210
Or what?

698
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,010
She can't keep living her life

699
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,170
like a madwoman

700
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,850
for the rest of her life.

701
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:23,850
Shaoyao is not mad.

702
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,610
Would a father

703
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,050
harm his own daughter?

704
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,530
Have you ever

705
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,850
seen her as your daughter?

706
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,170
Staying by your side,

707
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,370
even an animal can live a merrier life

708
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,130
than she does.

709
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,450
You only see her

710
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,690
as a disgrace to this family,

711
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,050
an embarrassing burden
that can only be hidden away.

712
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,170
And what about you?

713
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,770
When have you ever

714
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,250
considered me as your father?

715
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,130
Deep down, that man from Chenglu Palace

716
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,410
is your only father?

717
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,010
I will deal with

718
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,730
Shaoyao's illness.

719
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,690
I've heard it clearly

720
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,010
someone cries every night

721
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,210
in Consort Zhou's mansion.

722
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:19,810
There's more.

723
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,570
Keep it between us.

724
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,490
When I passed by that place
yesterday morning,

725
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,130
I saw that the cracks between the tiles

726
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,530
were oozing blood.

727
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:27,330
I've heard

728
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,010
that Consort Zhou

729
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,210
was holding that girl from West Garden
in her arms

730
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,450
when she immolated herself.

731
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,010
Is that an omen that occurred

732
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,250
because she didn't get

733
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,090
what she wanted?

734
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,330
It's been ten years. Can you...

735
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,290
Your Highness.

736
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:11,850
Mother.

737
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,410
Mother.

738
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,490
Do you have something to say?

739
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:33,770
Shaoyao.

740
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:50,250
Mother.

741
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,330
No.

742
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:55,770
Mother.

743
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:03,250
Xi.

744
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,850
It's me.

745
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,800
Ms. Xiao, what brings you here?

746
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,640
I came to see you.

747
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,520
I just heard you calling out
for your mother.

748
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,600
Xi.

749
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,720
Whatever you were dreaming about,

750
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,240
there's no need to hide it.

751
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,320
Did you dream of your mother?

752
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,720
You can say it.

753
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,800
You still miss her

754
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,960
and you still can't let go.

755
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,440
How can I let go?

756
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,240
It's been so many years since then,

757
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,000
and I still often think of her.

758
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,280
If only I could have been closer to her

759
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,400
back then,

760
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,240
if only on that night

761
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
I had been by her side,

762
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,120
perhaps all of this

773
