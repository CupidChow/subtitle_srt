She was here just after class ended.

She took a turn in the yard

what to feel about this kid.

136
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,040
He was born into the royal family,

137

138
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,750
It wasn't long before his mother died.

139

He's cried throughout the night

142
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,920

154
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,680
would never speak of him.

Why would I?

156
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,510
They said

the Sixth Prince
bumped into that lunatic one

158
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,630
and got frightened.

159
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,950
He had a fever for several days,

160
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,870
and with a lack of food and clothing
in the cold palace,

161

so he ended up like this.

162

164
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,720
His Majesty got even angrier,

165

so he didn't want him

166

Are you afraid of me?

we met each other today.

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,750
I have seen you before.

176
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,070
There's a scent of blood

177
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,430
on you.

178
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,950
You can speak?

179
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,430
But today,

180
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,560
there's no scent of blood on me.

182
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,950

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,120
I will have people

190
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
send the Sixth Prince
back to the cold palace.

191
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,950
I won't let him kneel any longer.

192
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,630
His Majesty won't ask.

193
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,800
Appreciate it.

194
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,000
It's hard for me
to see him like this too.

195
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Your Highness, let's go.

196
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,870
He's dead?

197
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,030
He bit a poison pill
and committed suicide on the spot,

198
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,670
and his corpse was taken away
by the Security Bureau Guards.

199
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:40,630
Good.

200
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,200
He was a brave man.

201
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,390
Take some money

202
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,910
and reward it to his family.

203
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,670
Yes.

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,120
According to the usual way
the Security Bureau deals with things,

205
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,120
the Commander of the Security Bureau

206
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,030
will definitely handle it in person

207
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,200
when it comes to such a matter

208
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,840
that the General
colluded with the remnants.

209
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,550
I think it won't be long

210
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,030
before they leave the capital.

211
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,630
Listen.

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,720
You bring some capable men

213
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,150
and investigate along the way.

214
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,440
If you encounter any men

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,120
who are in a hurry on the way,

216
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,440
no matter how many people you see,

217
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,840
kill them all,

218
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,320
especially those
with great martial skills.

219
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,870
We need to play safe.

220
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,840
I think

221
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,000
among those men,

222
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,120
there must be
the Commander of the Security Bureau.

223
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,870
Yes.

224
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,360
If anyone who appears to be
the Commander of the Security Bureau,

225
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,630
bring their bodies back to the Palace

226
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,550
after you kill them.

227
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,910
I want to examine the body myself.

228
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
Don't worry.

229
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,550
Even if you fail to kill him,

230
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,720
I won't blame you.

231
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,750
Just make sure to sketch his face

232
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,960
and immediately

233
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,000
send it back to me.

234
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,910
Yes.

235
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,390
Go.

236
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,750
I heard Zhi has already

237
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,840
obtained the travel rescript

238
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,840
and has also

239
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,480
hired the armed escorts
traveling to the northern land a lot.

240
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,670
Now,

241
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,150
except for the clothing,

242
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,630
everything else is ready.

243
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,870
Are we hiding money again this time?

244
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,670
Of course, we won't.

245
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,240
We can hide Madam Xia inside instead.

246
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,550
Making fun of me?

247
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,750
I'm coming in there.

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,390
Come on.

249
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,790
Come on, hide me inside.

250
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,480
Young Lady,

251
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,790
what are you doing?

252
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm afraid I may sew it incorrectly,

253
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
so I'm making marks first.

254
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,000
Help me have a look.

255
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,550
Young Lady, you started
doing needlework?

256
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,670
Who are you sewing this small pad for?

257
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,390
It's so thick.

258
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,000
This is a cotton robe.

259
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,510
Forget it, I'm not doing this.

260
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,670
Young Lady.

261
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,200
Madams have made so many cotton robes

262
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,600
that piled up like a little mountain.

263
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,720
You don't need to sew it.

264
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,630
And your sewing skills...

265
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,440
No. I've got a new company.

266
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,630
Mr. Yan is also going.

267
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,960
Mr. Yan is also going?

268
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,790
Who are you?

269
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,080
I am here for Shaoyao.

270
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,200
Wait here.

271
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,630
I will ask for you.

272
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,390
Fudong.

273
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,870
He says he's here for Shaoyao.

274
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Do you recognize him?

275
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Mr. Zhong.

276
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,670
Don't let him in.

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
He is just a hoodlum.

278
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:52,270
You little brat.

279
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,080
You have some nerve coming here.

280
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,720
Beat him up.

281
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,150
I...

282
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,670
Mr. Zhong.

283
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,870
He is my friend.

284
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,120
Friend?

285
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,960
Friend.

286
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,840
This is the place where I live now.

287
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,200
The sunlight here is very good,

288
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,910
so it's suitable for drying my herbs.

289
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,030
In this place,

290
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
you can see many houses.

291
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,360
Look at that...

292
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,000
The dried toads
that you asked me for last time.

293
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,720
This...

294
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,960
Where did you buy this?

295
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,510
It can cure carbuncles
after being burned into ashes.

296
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,390
The medicine is so rare.

297
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Where would I even go to buy it?

298
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,670
I didn't have much to do these days,

299
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,790
so I went to the river levee

300
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,910
and dug in the mud holes.

301
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,080
I've been digging for several days

302
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,150
and only got this much.

303
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Half of the toads ran away.

304
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,440
The left ones,

305
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,840
I dried them with a tea stove

306
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,840
and brought them to you immediately.

307
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,600
You know how to catch toads?

308
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,510
I didn't even know

309
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,550
where they lived.

310
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,630
It's nothing.

311
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,390
I can also catch snakes.

312
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,360
Do you want some?

313
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,240
Take me with you and teach me how

314
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,670
when you go there next time.

315
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,270
Sure.

316
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,150
No problem.

317
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,550
Well...

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,630
Don't come and look for me.

319
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,270
After tomorrow,

320
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,200
I'm going with Zhi and Yanxi

321
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,320
to a place that is far, far away.

322
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,120
I've begged them for a long time.

323
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,080
And finally,

324
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,120
they agreed to take me with them.

325
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
Where are you going?

326
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,790
So...

327
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,750
Will you ever come back?

328
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,670
I don't know about the exact location.

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
Anyway, it's going to take a long time.

330
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,600
Let's dig for snakes together

331
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,960
when I come back.

332
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,390
I'll wait.

333
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,270
A shooting star.

334
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:53,910
Is it?

335
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,720
Zhi said

336
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,910
you could make a wish when you saw it.

337
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,320
Make a wish?

338
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,200
For what?

339
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,440
I hope

340
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,200
I can be smarter,

341
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,270
but I don't need

342
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,120
to be as smart as Zhi.

343
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,750
Just...

344
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,910
as smart as you.

345
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,390
How do you know that you...

346
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,480
Did anyone say

347
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,440
that you're not smart?

348
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,510
I know I'm not.

349
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,550
I'm not foolish.

350
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,630
They are always very careful around me.

351
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,910
I know all of that.

352
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,790
Then I will make the same wish for you.

353
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,630
If we both make the same wish,

354
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,150
it might be easier to come true.

Aunt Xia.

373
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,000
Zhi.

374
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,630
I've been thinking

375
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,910
there wouldn't be many supplies
in the northern land,

376
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,790
and Boyu is still young,

377
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,630
so I didn't notice

378
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,360
I somehow prepared so many things.

379
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,960
I understand, won't be a problem.

380
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,240
Just move these things a little

381
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,030
and there will be room for it.

382
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,750
Did you all hear that?

383
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,720
Place all the items properly.

384
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,480
Don't delay Zhi's journey.

385
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,000
- Sure.
- Sure.

386
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,600
Aunt Xia.

387
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,670
Yingchun and Fudong

388
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,630
are both capable.

389
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,480
Nianqiu is trained by you.

390
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,440
They will stay to assist you.

391
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,750
Starting today,

392
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,000
you need to take care of the family
for a while.

393
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,120
Just rest assured.

394
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I promise you.

395
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,360
When you come back,

396
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
everything at home

397
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
will be just as perfect
as when you left.

398
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,960
Zhi.

399
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:04,910
Mother.

400
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,790
Zhi.

401
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,910
Be careful on the road.

402
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,630
It doesn't matter
if the money or the other stuff

403
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,480
was taken.

404
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,670
I only want you to be safe.

405
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,000
You...

406
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,360
Zhi hasn't even started the journey yet,

407
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,510
and you're already
saying something unauspicious.

408
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,510
Zhi can take care of herself.

409
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,360
Besides, we have spent a lot of money

410
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,270
hiring armed escorts.

411
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,550
Mr. Zhong is also going.

412
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,510
Oh, right.

413
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,840
Mr. Yan is going along too.

414
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,910
It can't be safer.

415
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,150
Mother, don't worry.

416
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,270
If all goes well,

417
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,550
I can return home within three months.

418
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,910
Yuniang,

419
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,240
what are you doing here?

420
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,360
And holding the kid.

421
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,030
I brought her here

422
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,440
to see Zhi off.

423
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,080
I have already
placed the portrait in the carriage,

424
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,480
and also the kite.

425
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,750
I will give it to Uncle Pingyang,

426
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,150
so he can fly it to amuse himself.

427
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,870
Take her back to rest.

428
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,960
Why has Mr. Yan still not arrived yet?

429
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,670
Sir.

430
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,510
You are
her household master of martial arts.

431
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,670
I...

432
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,390
Everyone knows me.

433
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:02,910
You can put it this way.

434
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,240
You are of lackey

435
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,720
of the Security Bureau.

436
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,160
Hua Zhi is leaving the capital,

437
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,880
so you need to follow and supervise her.

438
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,550
Sir.

439
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,960
Listen to yourself.

440
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,110
If I really say that,

441
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,750
they won't treat me well

442
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,960
on this long long journey.

443
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:14,920
Commander.

444
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,920
What about me then?

445
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,110
You are my manservant,

446
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,070
which means
you're at the bottom of the food chain.

447
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:22,640
Hou.

448
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,480
Don't you ever

449
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,550
spill the beans.

450
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:25,830
Don't call him "Commander".

451
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,590
Call him Mr. Yan.

452
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:27,480
Fine.

453
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,110
Alright.

454
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,270
I'll go first.

455
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,830
And you guys?

456
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,110
You can come over
when we're about to leave.

457
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,400
You are not likable people anyway.

458
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,110
Yanxi.

459
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,920
You're here.

460
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,440
You're here.

461
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,920
Now we have the armed escorts

462
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,720
and the caravan,

463
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,110
but the journey heading north
is fraught with unforeseen hardship.

464
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,510
To transport
such a large sum of ransom money

465
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,640
safely to the north

466
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,790
is no easy task.

467
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,880
I know.

468
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,310
So we'll disguise ourselves as merchants

469
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,640
heading north to do business.

470
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,680
Guess

471
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,640
where we've hidden the money?

472
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,720
We've exchanged it all into gold bars

473
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,310
and concealed them in a scattered way
under the bottom of the carriage.

474
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,960
Why are you here?

475
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,680
Well...

476
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,000
I...

477
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,920
We're going to the northern land,

478
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,070
and the Security Bureau Guards
are following,

479
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:30,640
right?

480
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,400
Yes.

481
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,590
Thank you for your help
that day at the Yang Mansion.

482
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:36,830
Don't mention it.

483
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,480
You can come along.

484
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,030
But mind your own business.

485
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,590
Right.

486
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,440
He is coming too.

487
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,680
This is my manservant.

488
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,400
My attendant.

489
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,640
Hello, ladies.

490
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,640
How old are you?

491
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,880
Miss.

492
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,270
I am 18 this year.

493
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,240
Then you should sit in the carriage.

494
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,110
Baoxia,

495
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,350
go get him a thick coat.

496
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,110
Let's go.

497
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,830
Follow me.

498
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,350
What...

499
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,350
Why?

500
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,270
What about me?

501
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,440
You're not 18.

502
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,550
You don't need that.

503
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,400
I...

504
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,030
Zhi.

505
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,590
The sun is high now.

506
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,270
Let's go.

507
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,240
Be careful on the road.

508
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,070
Be careful on the road.

509
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,720
Take care.

510
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,590
Have a smooth journey.

511
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,750
Lady Zhi, be careful.

512
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,070
Lady Zhi, be careful on the road.

513
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,830
Be careful on the road.

514
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,270
Zhi has never been going out this far

515
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,830
all by herself.

516
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,590
She is not alone this time.

517
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,750
Mr. Yan is with her.

518
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,550
Don't worry.

519
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,310
Right.

520
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,480
Mr. Yan

521
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,960
is indeed a martial arts master.

522
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
When we get there,
let's go have fun together.

523
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,440
You'll find out when we get there.

524
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,550
Zhi.

525
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,830
I'll go after her.

526
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,680
Young Lady.

527
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,310
Young Lady, slow down.

528
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,510
Only when I take this step forward,

529
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,000
can I walk towards a broader path,

530
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,070
and faster, and smoother.

531
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,350
Perhaps then

532
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,550
I can achieve true freedom.

533
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,930
♪A lone sail sways♪

534
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,560
♪A flower blooms alone

535
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,400
Let's race.

536
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,240
Let's see
who gets to the opposite hillside first.

537
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,200
Okay!

538
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,400
Perhaps one day,

539
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,790
even without Grandfather leading me,

540
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,480
I can still travel far and wide

541
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,510
and explore the world.

542
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,210
♪Smoothing out the surging waves♪

00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,420

Gu Yanxi.

546
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,400
Thank you for teaching me
to ride a horse.

547
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,550
All of a sudden?

548
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,030
Today, when I was riding on the horse

549
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,510
and leading everyone out
for the first time,

550
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,350
I suddenly felt

551
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,350
that I could run faster and farther.

552
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,640
I've never

553
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,790
had this feeling before.

554
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,880
What feeling?

555
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,440
Probably the feeling of freedom.

556
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,000
Seeing her so happy,

557
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:07,240
I actually

558
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,400
feel the same joy.

559
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,960
Now I know people's feelings

560
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,590
can indeed resonate like this.

561
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,550
How far can we go

562
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,000
by the end of the day?

563
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,480
At the speed of the caravan,

564
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,110
by dusk today,

565
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,440
we can reach a lake

566
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,200
dozens of li away.

567
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,830
It's still daylight,

568
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,350
but it's our first day of the journey,

569
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,240
so we need to rest early

570
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,310
for the next day.

571
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,240
Then how long will it take
to get to the northern land?

572
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,030
Perhaps ten days if we are fast.

573
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,310
It's also possible to take over 20 days.

574
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,310
Are you scared?

575
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,480
No.

576
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,200
It's been so long

577
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,350
since I've seen
what the northern land looks like.

578
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:01,750
Take this.

579
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,110
Zhi.

580
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,960
Why was the road that Mr. Yan led today

581
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,920
so difficult to walk?

582
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,440
I'm going to catch fish.

583
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:07,920
Go...

584
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,550
You...

585
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,110
You need to add some small firewood.

586
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,830
Can you do it or not?

587
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,480
We must continue our journey.

588
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,880
We're trying our best, Mr. Zhong.

589
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,880
Fish here.

590
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,200
Fish?

591
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,920
Where?

592
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,680
Take it.

593
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,070
Mr. Yan.

594
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,070
Mr. Yan.

595
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,750
Zhi

596
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,920
only listens to you.

597
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,480
Please go tell her

598
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:35,880
we need to hurry on our way.

599
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,640
Okay.

600
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,680
Don't take a stick.

601
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,440
Where are the fish?

602
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,720
I...

603
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll go have a look too.

604
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,000
You go.

605
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,830
I...

606
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,440
Where are the fish?

607
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,030
Here.

608
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,830
Yanxi, over there.

609
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,590
Here?

610
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,070
What are you doing?

611
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,070
Were there any suspicious people

612
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,110
on the paths today?

613
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,790
There was a lone man,

614
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,070
and a group of three people together.

615
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,350
We've killed them all.

616
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,960
None of them are skilled fighters.

617
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,960
They were killed so easily?

618
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,790
Then they can't be
the Security Bureau Guards.

619
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,790
Anybody else?

620
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,350
No.

621
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,160
A caravan of merchants
passed on the main road.

622
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
The person in charge is a woman.

623
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,350
And those armed escorts
were our acquaintances.

624
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,680
Keep going tomorrow.

625
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,440
Stay alert.

626
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Do not misjudge.

627
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:34,920
- Yes.
- Yes.

628
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,000
My last fish-catching

629
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,960
in the wild

630
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,160
was still with Grandfather.

631
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,920
Now it feels like a lifetime ago.

632
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,240
A year ago

633
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,310
when I went south
to return to the capital,

634
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,510
I also passed here.

635
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,880
But then I was alone.

636
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,510
I was so anxious

637
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,920
inside

638
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,400
because I didn't know
what was waiting for me.

639
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,680
But I was so lucky

640
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,030
that I met you
once I entered the capital.

641
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,400
I also have never thought
I would meet someone like you.

642
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,720
And what surprised me more

643
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,200
was that one day
we would travel together.

644
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
That's what love is like.

645
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,110
It's like

646
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,160
walking onto a single plank bridge
with your eyes closed.

647
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,270
You are fully aware
that the slightest misstep

648
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,720
would cost your life,

649
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,830
and there would be no going back.

650
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,750
But if I hadn't said that to him

651
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,160
and taken a step forward,

652
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,720
I would surely regret it
in this lifetime.

653
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,590
Gu Yanxi.

654
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,110
I have been truly happy

655
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,350
during this time.

656
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,350
Although I could only enjoy my joy alone

657
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,550
without them knowing.

658
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,510
Every time I've seen you,

659
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,070
I would often think

660
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,920
how long I can be this happy.

661
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,440
You don't have to answer me right now.

662
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,750
I don't know the answer, either.

663
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,750
Let's just keep going forward together.

664
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,510
It's still a long way to Mount Kun.

665
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,440
There's also a great distance

666
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,920
to the Sanbai City.

667
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,400
Okay.

668
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,440
No matter what happens in the future,

669
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,720
at least on this journey,

670
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,240
we were together.

671
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,200
Look.

672
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,750
There's a halo around the moon.

673
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,030
There will be strong wind tomorrow.

674
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,960
The wind is so strong.

675
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,030
You should go back inside the carriage.

676
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,880
Don't catch a cold.

677
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,880
If you can ride, so can I.

678
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,720
Your clothes are thin.

679
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,720
Put this on.

680
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:20,400
This is yours.

681
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,350
Are you going to
go back inside the carriage?

682
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,160
We haven't even reached Mount Kun yet.

683
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,720
The further north we go,
the stronger the wind and snow are.

684
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:25,960
I'm used to it.

685
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,510
Don't be stubborn. Put this on.

686
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,480
This coat is both thick and heavy.

687
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,270
I don't want to wear it.

688
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,680
But I have an idea,

689
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,880

What's the situation?

731
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,070
There's a valley ahead.

732
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,240
We need to be more careful.

733
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,790
What do you think would happen

734
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,200
if there's a battle in the valley ahead?

735
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,680
It can be guarded by one person

736
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,680
since it is a perfect defensive spot,

737
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,510
but it also will set yourself
an easy target

738
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,790
if someone wants to take you out.

739
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,510
Exactly.

740
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,310
We are close to Mount Kun.

741
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,480
There are many bandits.

742
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,750
We need to be careful.

743
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,310
What should we do

744
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,920
if we really encounter bandits?

745
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,790
If the money doesn't work,

746
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
then we have to let the fists talk.

747
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,400
Go back in the carriage.

748
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,440
A person who is in charge

749
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,880
doesn't clear the way
out in the cold wind.

750
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,400
Even bandits wouldn't believe it.

751
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,160
Sir.

752
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,960

753
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,240
leave the toll and the bundle.

754
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,720
Or you won't get out of here alive.

755
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,640
Misters.

756
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,000
Our family is going north
to visit relatives.

757
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,510
We aren't carrying much money.

758
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,110
Please have mercy on us,

759
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,240
and allow us to pass.

760
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,920
I don't believe you.

761
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,240
Brothers.

762
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,680
Search the carriage.

763
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,720
And search them.

764
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,640
Go.

765
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:13,680
- Come on.
- Come on.

766
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,750
There are all women on the carriage.

767
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,440
I've got the money.

768
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,550
Please search me.

769
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,200
- Big brother.
- Big brother.

770
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:32,920
Big brother.

771
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,440
Don't come over.

772
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,750
Let go of him.

773
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,640
Tell them to move the tree

774
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,640
and make way.

775
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,400
You...

776
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,270
If you have the guts,

777
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,640
chop my head off.

778
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,400
A pig's head is still worth a little.

779
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,750
Your head isn't worth anything.

780
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,960
Why would I chop it off?

781
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,030
Pig's head?

782
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,830
If you don't pay up today,

783
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,030
unless you kill us all,

784
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,160
or don't you ever

785
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,350
think about passing.

786
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,590
What now?

787
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,720
Do you really think

788
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,590
we can't fight our way through?

789
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,110
Easy, mister.

790
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,270
His words don't count.

791
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,310
I am the one in charge.

792
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,350
Those men in minks with swords
are not in charge,

793
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,720
but you are?

794
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,920
Have quite the nerve.

795
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:15,920
Madam.

796
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,200
We'll heed all your commands.

797
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,000
You are really in charge?

798
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:22,720
Then,

799
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,510
who is he?

800
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,070
He's not a nobody.

801
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,830
He's my matrilocal husband.

802
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,480
That's right, my wife.

803
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,830
What an absurd world!

804
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,350
Mister, how shall we address you?

805
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,480
I'm afraid you will be scared to death.

806
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,110
I am Niu Heng

807
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,160
at the Mount Bandao.

808
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,640
Mr. Mount.

809
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,920
It's Niu.

810
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,350
Mr. Niu.

811
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,960
Then let's make a deal.

812
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,270
We're not going north

813
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,510
to do business.

814
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,110
And I don't want you

815
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,960
to come here for nothing.

816
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,920
I'll offer five guan

817
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,110
for you to buy some wine.

818
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,030
What do you think?

819
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:56,510
Ten guan.

820
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,750
Not one less.

821
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,480
Six guan.

822
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,400
That's really all I have.

823
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,480
Then... Eight guan.

824
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,240
Deal.

825
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,030
Baoxia.

826
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,240
Take it.

827
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,000
She really gave us money.

828
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,680
Yeah.

829
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,350
Eight guan.

830
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,440
We have money now.

831
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,400
Great.

832
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,880
Unload the three packs of excess stuff

833
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,720
and give them
to Mr. Niu and his brothers.

834
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,640
What...

835
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,550
Miss.

836
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,200
It's just an unpopulated land

837
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,830
if you go further north.

838
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,480
You...

839
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,790
Who are you going to sell to

840
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,240
with a cartful of winter clothes?

841
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,720
We're not going to do business.

842
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,000
We're going to visit relatives.

843
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,110
These winter clothes

844
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,790
were all sewed by my family members.

845
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:39,640
That's all.

846
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,310
Take it.

847
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,110
- Take it.
- Take it.

848
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,400
But how come

849
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,750
a young woman like you go there alone?

850
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,440
What about the men

851
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,240
in your family?

852
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,000
They're all in the northern land.

853
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,550
Go further north,

854
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
and you'll reach Sanbai City.

855
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,720
A place of exile.

856
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,790
We all have a tough life.

857
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,920
We're doing this

858
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,200
because we have no choice.

859
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,510
We're just a bunch of orphans.

860
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,720
Otherwise,

861
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,960
who would want to

862
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,110
do such unscrupulous things?

863
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,280
Are those carbuncles?

864
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,070
This is an ointment
made from dried toad.

865
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,280
Apply it to your face
and it will heal you.

866
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,550
Here, take it.

867
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,670
If those carbuncles aren't treated,
they will fester.

868
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,000
Say thank you.

869
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,230
Thank you.

870
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,550
Give me the flag.

871
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,190
Miss.

872
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,510
Hang this flag
on the front of the carriage.

873
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,150
No one will trouble you again

874
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,960
along the way

875
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,480
from here to Sanbai City.

876
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,070
Appreciate it.

877
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,070
You really impressed me, Miss.

878
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,110
If I weren't an outlaw here,

879
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,110
I would certainly

880
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,280
become sworn siblings with you.

881
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,320
Mr. Niu.

882
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,800
If you don't want to be bandits,

883
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,030
are you willing to

884
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,840
make an honest living?

885
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,960
Really?

886
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,960
- Really?
- Can we?

887
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,510
Take your time and think about it.

888
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,360
We will pass by here again
on the way back to the city.

889
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,280
If you do want to by then,

890
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
return to the south with me,

891
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,280
and we can
start an honest business together.

892
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,480
Times are tough.

893
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,960
We should support each other even more.

894
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:21,920
Deal.

895
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,920
I will wait for you here.

896
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,710
When you get back here,

897
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,920
I will prepare lambs and good wine.

898
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,590
The journey ahead is long.

899
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,630
Hurry along now.

900
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:32,840
Okay.

901
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,000
See you around.

902
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,480
Let me do it.

903
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,480
Here.

904
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,150
Does it hurt?

905
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,150
No.

906
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,000
We will reach Sanbai City by tomorrow.

907
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,590
Your grandfather has inspected
the northern barracks before.

908
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,710
Really?

909
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,920
Do you want to see him?

910
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,280
Do you want me to see him?

911
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,280
I need to go to the government office.

912
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,920
Let's part ways for today.

913
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,760
I will come for you when you return.

914
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,880
I'm sorry.

915
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,190
It's alright.

916
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,480
It's your family reunion.

917
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,920
You should be happy to see each other.

918
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,510
If Master Hua

919
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,400
sees you bring me along,

920
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,480
I'm afraid he might be very upset.

921
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
A small compensation.

922
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,920
I hope no matter
where we go in the future,

923
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,480
we will never be apart again.

924
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,800
Shaoyao,

925
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,230
I'll be away for a few days.

926
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,110
Stay with Zhi and be a good girl

927
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,150
for the next few days,

928
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,190
okay?

929
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,710
Where has Mr. Yan gone?

930
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,920
Yanxi said a friend came to visit,

931
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,110
and he'll come back for me
in a few days.

932
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,110
These are for Zhi.

933
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,510
Those two Security Bureau Guards

934
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,360
have also disappeared.

935
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
They couldn't have taken your brother,

936
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,440
could they?

937
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,760
Yanxi is more formidable than them.

938
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,740
[Sanbai City]

939
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,630
Let them through.

940
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,920
Hello.

941
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,590
Where are you from?

942
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,030
We're from the Imperial Capital.

943
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,230
What brings you here?

944
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,440
We are from the Hua Family
and we're here to visit relatives.

945
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,550
Welcome.

946
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,480
Did you hear that?

947
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,400
The Hua Family came to visit relatives
in Sanbai City!

948
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,630
The Hua Family came to visit relatives!

949
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,510
Hurry, tell them!

950
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,400
Visiting relatives!

951
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,630
The Hua Family
came to visit relatives in Sanbai City!

952
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,110
Move faster!

953
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,710
Hurry.

954
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,760
- Quickly.
- Be careful!

955
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,150
Faster. Quickly,

956
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,280
Quickly.

957
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:49,920
I'm coming.

958
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,190
I'm coming.

959
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,190
What took you so long?

960
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,400
Tell you what?

961
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,000
On our way here,

962
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,070
a young lady

963
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,400
was leading quite a large caravan

964
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,280
to visit relatives here.

965
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,280
They say it's the...

966
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:01,320
The Hua Family.

967
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,360
That has nothing

968
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,150
to do with you.

969
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,230
I know.

970
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,190
Come on.

971
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,630
What are you looking at?

972
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,510
It's Zhi.

973
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,230
- Hurry up.
- Come here.

974
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,230
Get to work quickly.

975
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,800
What are you dawdling for?

976
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,670
Get out of the way.

977
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:14,960
Get to work!

978
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,110
My niece has come to see me.

979
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,880
You can't leave. You'll be fined.

980
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,070
I'll pay tomorrow.

981
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,510
You...

982
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,710
Make way!

983
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,840
Make way!

984
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,670
Zhi.

985
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,880
Zhi.

986
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,760
Zhi.

987
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:43,800
Uncle Pingyang.

988
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,000
Get up.

989
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,550
It's your uncle.

990
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,550
I never bathed in the past half year.

991
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,630
Nobody cares anyway.

992
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,440
This is my niece.

993
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,840
The girl of our Hua Family.

994
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,630
My niece.

995
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,360
Good.

996
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,360
Uncle Pingyang.

997
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,150
Baoxia is here too.

998
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,150
Who is this girl?

999
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,670
I'm also from the Hua Family.

1000
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,480
Zhi.

1001
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,670
How is Yuniang doing?

1002
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,110
See for yourself.

1003
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,550
Doesn't look like her?

1004
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:38,630
I did hire

1005
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,630
a very expensive painter for that.

1006
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,480
This...

1007
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,400
This...

1008
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:51,550
This...

1009
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,760
It's Aunt Wu

1010
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,110
and your daughter.

1011
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,960
Daughter?

1012
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,320
When...

1013
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,550
When did this happen?

1014
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,000
Aunt Wu was already pregnant

1015
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:04,230
before our home got raided.

1016
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,320
But she was afraid to worry you,

1017
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,960
so she didn't tell you.

1018
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,150
I started the journey

1019
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,960
after the kid
reached the age of one month.

1020
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,110
Aunt Wu is still waiting for you

1021
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,400
to name the baby.

1022
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,070
Yuniang has borne a daughter for me.

1023
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,550
I have a daughter now.

1024
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,510
I have a daughter now.

1025
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,400
Congratulations!

1026
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Congratulations!

1027
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,760
What a large caravan!

1028
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,000
They brought so many things.

1029
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:36,880
They say

1030
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,510
it's the Hua Family
that came to visit relatives.

1031
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,190
The person in charge is a girl.

1032
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,110
Is that so?

1033
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,360
Let's go and have a look.

1034
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,880
Go.

1035
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,030
Father, please lie down.

1036
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,400
It's cold outside.

1037
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Did you hear that?

1038
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,440
Zhi is here.

1039
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,230
Father.

1040
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,190
Don't take it seriously.

1041
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,280
Rumor goes around in here.

1042
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,550
It's all nonsense.

1043
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,590
It's freezing cold out there.

1044
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,230
How could anyone come here?

1045
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:59,800
I just know.

1046
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,070
Hurry up.

1047
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,230
Bring me a clean robe.

1048
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,320
Quickly.

1049
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:05,800
Hurry.
