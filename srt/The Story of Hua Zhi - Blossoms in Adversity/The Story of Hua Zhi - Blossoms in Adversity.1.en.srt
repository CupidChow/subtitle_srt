Hurry up.

190
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,040
[Madam Zhu Yingzhen of the Hua Family]
[Madam Qi Huilan of the Hua Family]

191
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,270
I can't even breathe.

192
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,230
Let's go out for some fresh air.

193
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,150
Yingzhen,

194
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,430
Madam Hua will be here any minute.

195
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,030
It's better not to go far.

196
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,750
Yuniang,

197
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,150
are you feeling hot too?

198
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,310
Yes, a little.

199
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,790
Zhe Gui,

200
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,350
open the window.

201
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,590
Didn't you hear the ladies?

202
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,390
Yes.

203
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,670
Open it now!

204
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,110
This is nice.

205
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,630
It's best to have a breeze
sitting in front of a brazier.

206
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,230
It was so hot just now,

207
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,590
felt like sitting in an oven.

208
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,950
Now is much better.

209
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,470
Madam Lin is here.

210
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,470
Let me see your cricket.

211
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,950
No.

212
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,990
Let me see your cricket.

213
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,710
Stop running!

214
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,830
All flustered.

215
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,670
If you trip and hurt your face,

216
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,510
you can forget about
taking the imperial exam.

217
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,710
Go, go and play.

218
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,510
[Lin Wan, wife of Lord Hua]

219
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,230
Madam,

220
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,630
don't worry about them.

221
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,910
These naughty kids.

222
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,670
a fall will help them grow.

223
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,590
Are the ones from the imperial palace
here yet?

224
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,910
Not yet.

225
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,430
I'm afraid we'll have to wait

226
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,390
until night for the couplets to arrive.

227
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,230
I'm sorry that you have to

228
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,950
keep waiting along with us.

229
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,910
I'm old. I don't need much sleep.

230
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,070
It's okay.

231
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,950
You are so

232
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,510
energetic.

233
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,190
We can't compete with you.

234
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,150
Thank you for the compliment.

235
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,870
This year,

236
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,630
two of your sons

237
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,110
have been promoted by His Majesty.

238
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,630
So I, your daughter-in-law,

239
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,510
hired a great troupe

240
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,990
that has performed for His Majesty.

241
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,870
People're waiting in line to hire them.

242
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,750
It's for the New Year.

243
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:04,990
Come and have a look!

244
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,110
[Bronze Ware]

245
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:16,750
Zhi!

246
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,990
We're here.

247
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,390
Zhong.

248
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,510
The copper crow I ordered the other day,

249
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,750
please get it for me,

250
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,950
then hand this to the coppersmith,

251
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,590
ask him to cast it.

252
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,070
Alright.

253
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,870
If he has any question,

254
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,710
come to me immediately.

255
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,030
This is the deposit.

256
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,470
Alrighty.

257
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,190
We're ordered to search this place.

258
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,590
Everyone freeze!

259
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,830
You all need to answer questions.

260
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:43,390
You,

261
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,430
freeze!

262
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,510
You two, come here.

263
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,230
Sir, what are you doing?

264
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,790
Sir,

265
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,030
Sir,

266
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,790
Get away!

267
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,390
Sir, what are you doing, Sir?

268
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,510
Where are you going?

269
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,230
They're patrol officers.

270
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,550
I think they're searching,

271
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,870
maybe for a thief.

272
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,230
That's not right.

273
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,750
Look, there's another one
at the end of the queue.

274
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,230
Come here.

275
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,310
You've got the wrong guy!

276
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:08,790
Let's go.

277
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:09,950
You, this way,

278
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,230
come over here.

279
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:13,870
I haven't done anything...

280
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,950
Who's that?

281
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,390
How come he's not doing anything?

282
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,830
He's an inspector from
the Seven Constellations Bureau.

283
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,470
Behave yourselves!

284
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,230
Get everything clear!

285
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,150
Get everything clear!

286
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,310
When I was a child, once I cry,

287
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,910
Mom would say

288
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,390
"The inspectors are coming"!

289
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,390
Now I have truly seen one for myself.

290
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,750
They usually don't show themselves,

291
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,030
only work for the royal family.

292
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,470
Don't our lord

293
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,750
and his sons

294
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,790
all work for

295
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,710
the royal family?

296
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,150
Please let me go!

297
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,670
You,

298
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,110
go.

299
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,670
My cabbage!

300
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,950
There were two loads of them!

301
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,910
Oh my goodness!

302
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,750
I’d rather die!

303
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,270
My cabbage!

304
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,750
Here, take this money,

305
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,830
and go home.

306
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,950
Your kindness will be rewarded.

307
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,630
It'll be rewarded!

308
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,800
[Shen Qi,
the eldest grandson of the Shen Family]

309
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,390
Be gentle, you guys.

310
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,750
Be gentle, this...

311
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,510
Where did this drawing come from?

312
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,270
That old man who just left.

313
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,030
Stop him!

314
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,750
Go!

315
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,150
Get off!

316
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,470
Sir,

317
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,310
It's my lord's daughter
inside the carriage.

318
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,310
She hasn't got married yet.

319
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,670
It's inappropriate for her
to show herself.

320
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,030
Old man,

321
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,230
take a good look at this.

322
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,510
Even the princesses

323
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,750
and all the other noble ladies

324
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,710
would have to cooperate.

325
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,470
Guards!

326
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,990
Yes!

327
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,590
Can someone please tell me

328
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,630
among the 537 articles
in the criminal law,

329
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,070
which specific one have I violated

330
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,590
that made you march through the street

331
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,350
to get me?

332
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,750
In all my years of service,

333
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,430
this is the first time I'm hearing

334
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,830
of someone daring to argue
with the Seven Constellations Bureau

335
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,070
about the law.

336
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,270
So it's a Seven Constellations Bureau
business.

337
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,190
I've heard that the Censor, Lord Hua,

338
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,270
has presented three reports this month

339
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,830
complaining about you guys.

340
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,270
From the look of things today,

341
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,750
you're well-deserved.

342
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,110
How did you know that?

343
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:23,950
This is ridiculous.

344
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,510
Who are you

345
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,590
to criticize court affairs!

346
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,110
Did you draw this?

347
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,310
Passing such bizarre items in secret,

348
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,390
seems like you're plotting something,

349
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,870
or even attempting to rebel!

350
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,110
You could've asked me about it.

351
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,430
But instead, you charged me.

352
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,470
So ridiculous.

353
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,470
Get off the carriage, now.

354
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,470
I will be asking questions.

355
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,390
Alright.

356
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,110
Stop, don't do that!

357
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,310
I am Shen Qi.

358
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,190
Madam, do not be afraid.

359
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,430
I'll reason with him.

360
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,350
You actually have the audacity to

361
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,710
force an unmarried girl

362
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,190
show her face in public.

363
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,150
Where did this young man come from?

364
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,550
He's likely to get in trouble.

365
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,550
Sir, please stand back.

366
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,830
I am innocent.

367
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,950
I'm not afraid to confront them.

368
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,670
Absolutely not.

369
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,150
I just heard you talk about the laws

370
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,710
that were unknown to me.

371
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,030
I am deeply impressed.

372
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,230
As a man,

373
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,310
If I can't protect a defenceless woman,

374
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,110
I'd rather die.

375
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,910
I was wondering who you are.

376
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,550
So you're from the Financial Department,

377
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,550
and the Shen family.

378
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,550
Exactly.

379
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,310
Hua Zhi,

380
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,110
It's Shen Qi.
The eldest son of the Shen family!

381
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,750
No wonder this voice

382
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,590
sounds so familiar.

383
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:28,150
Is he the one who's going to

384
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,230
bring us betrothal gifts tomorrow?

385
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,430
Since you're Mr. Shen,

386
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,470
I must treat you with respect.

387
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,230
Guards,

388
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,910
throw this Mr. Shen here

389
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:37,990
out.

390
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,270
Yes!

391
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,230
Let's go.

392
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,150
Let me go!

393
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,430
Let me go!

394
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,870
Under the Emperor's ruling,

395
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,030
Is there no justice at all?

396
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,710
Below the royal family,

397
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,430
the Seven Constellations Bureau
is the justice

398
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,870
and the law.

399
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,030
Such a disgrace to the society!

400
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,070
Today,

401
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,830
unless you step over

402
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,390
my dead body,

403
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,630
or I'll never

404
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,150
let you humiliate this lady!

405
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,670
Who are you?

406
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,710
So, it's a bronze crow, huh?

407
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,390
How does he know?

408
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,390
What is this?

409
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,030
Just an instrument.

410
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,510
It measures the wind direction,

411
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,470
and predicts the weather.

412
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,030
Where is this bronze crow?

413
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,910
You're lying!

414
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,750
Here it is, the bronze crow.

415
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,910
You look

416
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,350
not like a soldier nor a hunter.

417
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,710
You're not from the capital, are you?

418
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,630
I indeed am from the capital.

419
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,630
I've been in the military for years.

420
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,030
Now I'm on my way to visit my family.

421
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,630
A soldier?

422
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,910
Where's your certification?

423
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,390
I‘m a registered soldier,

424
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,710
but I don't have any certification.

425
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,710
You're quite calm.

426
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,630
Alright,

427
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,710
they don't seem involved in a rebellion,

428
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,950
but you do.

429
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,830
Guards,

430
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,470
search him!

431
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,390
- Okay.
- Okay.

432
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,030
The blade is sharp.

433
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,750
Sir, be careful.

434
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,190
Take him back for interrogation.

435
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,830
- Yes.
- Yes.

436
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,390
Stop!

437
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,790
What crime has he committed?

438
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,150
Why are you taking him away?

439
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,430
Mister Shen,

440
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,510
listen carefully.

441
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,790
There're people
forging weapons privately,

442
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,950
suspected to be spies from Zhao Empire.

443
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,670
His Majesty ordered us to search
for them.

444
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,430
This man's background is unclear,

445
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,390
and is carrying a sharp blade.

446
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,630
Are you going to vouch for him?

447
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,590
To my surprise,

448
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,630
now it's the turn
of the Seven-Star Bureau

449
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,550
to run amuck in the Imperial Capital.

450
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,830
Take him!

451
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:41,750
Let's go.

452
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,110
I'll vouch for him!

453
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,830
I will come with you.

454
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,190
No need for a big fuss.

455
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:01,830
Do you know what kind of place

456
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:02,710
the Seven-Star Bureau is?

457
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,790
No matter how strong you are,

458
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,950
you'll get tortured
and even die in there.

459
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,230
Mister, I see a frostbite on your hand.

460
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,670
I guess you're from
the north of Mountain Kun,

461
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,470
a land of extreme cold.

462
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,470
Smart.

463
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,150
You have calluses on your thumbs

464
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,030
and scars on your shank's mouths.

465
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,070
These are the proof
of pulling reins and drawing bows,

466
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,030
left by your habits as a soldier.

467
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,390
I think you are definitely

468
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,150
good at both archery and riding.

469
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,190
You flattered me.

470
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,710
People from the Zhao Empire

471
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,990
usually pull the bow string
with three fingers.

472
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,830
Their scars are different from yours.

473
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,790
The vest he's wearing

474
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,910
is made from red bear hide.

475
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,150
The Zhao people revere bears
as sacred beasts,

476
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,710
and would never skin them for clothes.

477
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,510
All these can prove

478
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,870
that he's from the Northern Land
of Daqing

479
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,030
instead of the Zhao Empire.

480
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,470
That makes sense.

481
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,790
That makes sense.

482
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,630
We must not wrong this righteous man.

483
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,110
If you kill an innocent

484
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,390
to get the credit,

485
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,270
tomorrow,

486
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,590
someone might file another
complaint against you.

487
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:52,510
This is ridiculous.

488
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,150
You...

489
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,190
Who the heck are you?

490
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,390
She is

491
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,950
the legitimate granddaughter
of Minister Hua,

492
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,230
the eldest daughter of Secretary Hua,

493
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,990
a lady from a true noble family.

494
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,150
How dare you even...

495
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,190
Ask about her name.

496
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:16,430
Oh my!

497
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,230
You see,

498
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,510
this is a huge misunderstanding.

499
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,750
You're from the Hua Family!

500
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,470
No wonder you have such discerning eyes.

501
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,110
Yes.

502
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,750
I'm such a fool.

503
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,830
So, will you still arrest this man?

504
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,350
Please, Miss Hua,

505
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,510
such a nobody

506
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,590
is not worthy of that.

507
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,750
Oh,

508
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,470
I still have works to do.

509
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,830
There are several streets to search.

510
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,870
I'll just take my leave.

511
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,150
You should get back on the carriage.

512
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,670
Don't let people keep staring at you.

513
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,590
Let's go.

514
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,590
Move, quickly.

515
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,190
Come on!

516
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,590
Make way!

517
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,030
Thank you.

518
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,830
It is I who should thank you.

519
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:06,430
Hua...

520
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,630
She is the eldest daughter
of the Hua Family?

521
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,870
Mister Shen,

522
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,550
Miss Zhi asked me to thank you.

523
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,270
It's terribly cold.
You should hurry back.

524
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,110
Miss Zhi,

525
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,990
what do you think

526
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,710
of Mister Shen?

527
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,390
He is indeed a person of honesty.

528
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,350
As long as you like him.

529
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,070
Mr. Zhong, faster.

530
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:57,990
Mister, why aren't you riding the horse?

531
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,870
This horse is old.

532
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,310
It has accompanied me
from the north to the south.

533
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,910
I rushed back this time.

534
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,590
It got injured on the way.

535
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,190
Walking like this is easier for it.

536
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,710
On your way back here,

537
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,350
did you cross Mount Tuotuo

538
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,430
and the Kushui River?

539
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,070
At this time,

540
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,070
the river must be a brilliant blue.

541
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,310
Even if you passed by hurriedly,

542
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,910
you won't forget about it.

543
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,150
The Kushui River has been dry for years.

544
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,270
People from the Northern Land

545
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,190
barely know about it now.

546
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,670
Crossing the river like you said,

547
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,190
that was something years ago.

548
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:27,510
Yes.

549
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,870
Miss, you're supposed to stay home.

550
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,910
How do you know so much
about the Northern Land?

551
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,350
I'm not born to hide behind the door.

552
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:36,790
I shall take my leave.

553
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,030
Miss Zhi,

554
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,510
have you truly seen

555
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,790
the frozen river where
the carriages cross?

556
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,630
I mean, in here,

557
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,630
even the leaves in winter

558
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,750
are still green.

559
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,510
It's warm here,

560
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,430
because we're located in the southeast.

561
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:57,470
If you go north past the river,

562
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,670
you'll see the river water freeze.

563
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,270
And if you go west, there'll be deserts,

564
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,670
snowing, with no one there.

565
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,510
Since I returned to the capital

566
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,390
four years ago,

567
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,150
I've never seen snowfall again.

568
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,190
Wow, amazing!

569
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,030
[Hua Bolin, eldest son of the first-born son of the Hua Family]
Awesome.

570
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,070
[Hua Boyu, eldest son of the third son of the Hua Family]
I want to be an acrobat too.

571
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,830
Silly child.

572
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,670
If it weren't for the extreme poverty,

573
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,750
who would want their kids
to be acrobats?

574
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,270
Boli's Mom,

575
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,110
why be so strict

576
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,270
with him?

577
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,910
He's not allowed to watch the show

578
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,030
nor to play.

579
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:52,710
Even the maidservants

580
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,310
are plain-looking.

581
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,150
Are you expecting to raise a sage?

582
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,590
You don't understand.

583
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,710
There is a difference between
the noble and the lowly.

584
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,590
Our Boli

585
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,230
must stay far away from these people.

586
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,750
I don't want him

587
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,430
to marry

588
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,990
a lowly girl in the future.

589
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,070
Father,

590
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,990
this coat is worn out.

591
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,710
Let's pick a new one.

592
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,190
It'll last a few more years.

593
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,230
Father, all these years,

594
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,550
you've been on trips as a Censor.
There are things you don't know.

595
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,270
At New Year, all the officials' families
in the capital

596
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,390
hire troupes.

597
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,750
You never changed your old accent,

598
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,310
but you've learned a lot

599
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,270
the extravagant habits here.

600
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,750
We only get to celebrate

601
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,750
[Hua Pingyu, eldest son of the Hua Family]
during these few days.

602
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,390
We didn't spend too much money.

603
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:01,590
Apart from my little brother,

604
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,710
the three of us

605
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,110
are now serving in official posts.

606
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:05,790
Father,

607
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,590
we don't need to be too frugal.

608
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,510
There's another thing.

609
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,790
These couple of days,

610
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,510
were there any gifts sent to us?

611
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,870
I strictly followed what you taught me.

612
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,470
Whether in the court or the city,

613
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,270
no matter the gifts were pricy or not,

614
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,230
and under whatever names,

615
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:23,750
I rejected them all.

616
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,230
None of them was sent here.

617
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,310
Only the tenancy agreements from
our estates have been brought in.

618
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,510
And your students,

619
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,630
Yu Zhengyao and Chen Zhi,

620
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,950
have sent cards.

621
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,510
I have told them

622
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,950
to only send cards.

623
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,830
The eldest son of the Shen Family
hasn't sent a card yet.

624
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,630
Perhaps tomorrow,

625
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,550
he'll send it along with Zhi's
betrothal gifts.

626
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,630
Father.

627
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,350
It's getting dark.

628
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,630
His Majesty summoned us at this hour,

629
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,110
could it be about the matter
of naming an heir?

630
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,630
It's said when His Majesty was young,

631
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,270
he often discussed state affairs
with the officials at night.

632
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,110
Today is different.

633
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,510
Where are your brothers?

634
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,030
The carriage is ready.

635
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:04,830
They

636
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,790
are waiting at the door.

637
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:06,830
Alright.

638
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,350
Madam,

639
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,590
it's the Preliminary Eve.

640
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,230
Tomorrow the Shen Family will
come to set the betrothal.

641
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,750
It will be another bustling day.

642
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,110
Yinzhu,

643
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,670
get the box for the betrothal letters

644
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,870
and bring it here.

645
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:33,630
Yes.

646
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,270
No need.

647
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,950
As long as you made sure they're ready.

648
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,790
It's Hua Zhi’s betrothal

649
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,310
and her auntie has been
doing all the hard work.

650
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,990
Thank you.

651
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,110
If there's anything I can help...

652
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,470
What can you do?

653
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,070
You're bad at talking

654
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,550
and weak.

655
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,470
You can't even command the servants.

656
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,070
You're not helping at all.

657
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,150
Yingzhen

658
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,950
leads a life of leisure.

659
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,430
She doesn't worry about anything.

660
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:04,590
Unlike me,

661
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,070
doing all the hard work,

662
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,830
prestigious on the outside,
suffering on the inside.

663
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,310
One child after another.

664
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,470
Looking after these kids

665
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,510
is endless.

666
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,870
Hua Zhi is like her mother,

667
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,830
naturally blessed.

668
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,550
In this house full of girls,

669
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,750
she's the eldest one,

670
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,990
[Hua Ling, eldest daughter of the third son of the Hua Family]
so she got the best of everything.

671
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,680
[Hua Qin, daughter
of the third son's concubine]

672
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,790
[Hua Rong, daughter of the eldest son's concubine]
The Shen family, for example,

673
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,870
we have been close with them
for generations.

674
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,110
They worked so hard

675
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,510
raising Shen Qi into a great man.

676
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,910
And now he's gonna be Hua Zhi's husband.

677
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,870
Isn't she blessed?

678
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,310
Ling is talented,

679
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,670
Qin is skilled in embroidery,

680
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,910
and Rong has a charming face,

681
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,590
but all those are useless!

682
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,190
Indeed.

683
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,430
I heard

684
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,150
Miss Ling's poetry

685
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,590
is well-known in the city.

686
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,590
Those scholars,

687
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,870
after reading her work,

688
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,190
[Concubine Qin, concubine of the third son]
are all immensely impressed.

689
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,830
Who cares about men's compliments?

690
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,630
That's why I said Zhi is blessed.

691
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,710
If born into an ordinary family,

692
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,430
a girl like her,

693
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,550
who knows nothing about
cooking and needlework,

694
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,470
would probably

695
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,950
be difficult to get married off.

696
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:11,230
But we're the Hua Family. We're noble.

697
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,670
I'm worried after she gets married,

698
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,110
she might suffer hardship.

699
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:25,950
Madam Hua,

700
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,950
don't worry.

701
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,830
You see,

702
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,390
when your fourth daughter-in-law

703
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,790
first came here,

704
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:31,430
wasn't she

705
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,750
incapable of all the housework?

706
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,790
Now, she can do anything.

707
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,110
Except for

708
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,550
giving her husband a son.

709
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,510
Madam Hua,

710
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,990
I'll surely guide Zhi well.

711
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,670
Stop placating me with nice words.

712
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,550
If you could guide her,

713
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:46,910
how would she turn out

714
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,150
to be like this?

715
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:53,830
Where is she?

716
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,070
I saw her at the west side gate
this afternoon.

717
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:57,950
She went out.

718
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:04,830
When she comes back,

719
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,310
tell her to come see me.

720
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,670
Yes.

721
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,550
Minister Hua.

722
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,070
Minister Shen.

723
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:20,670
Minister Shen.

724
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:22,630
Minister Shen.

725
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,790
Why the panic?

726
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:24,790
Minister Hua,

727
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,590
[Shen Zhongxing, minister of the Financial Department]
we should both be careful tonight.

728
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,910
I hear His Majesty is furious.

729
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,950
He's summoned not only all the officials

730
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,870
but also the princes.

731
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,470
Furthermore, there's a rumor,

732
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,590
even Prince Ling's heir from the north

733
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,510
has been secretly called to the capital.

734
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,950
That man is the late emperor's grandson.

735
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,270
It seems

736
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,790
something big is happening tonight.

737
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:53,740
[Hall of Supreme Harmony]

738
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,070
Your Highness.

739
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,190
[Gu Yanxi, son of Prince Ling]

740
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,710
His Majesty is waiting for you
at the Chenglu Palace.

741
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,030
Your Majesty,

742
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,150
the prince has arrived.

743
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,590
Uncle.

744
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,950
[Gu Chengtao, emperor of Daqing]
Yanxi.

745
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,510
You've grown taller than me.

746
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,870
There's something

747
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,150
I want you to know about.

748
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,990
Tonight, all ministers are
summoned to the palace

749
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,190
for two matters.

750
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,150
One,

751
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,350
to name an heir,

752
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,510
and two,

753
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,510
the case handling by
the Seven-Star Bureau

754
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,990
regarding illegal weapon-forging.

755
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,590
The year isn't over yet,

756
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,350
and the letters you sent to suggest me
to name an heir

757
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,030
almost collapsed my desk.

758
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,070
It seems that Prince Xian

759
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,510
is quite popular,

760
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:10,870
and Prince Hui is not far behind.

761
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,470
I have no idea about this.

762
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,510
[Gu Yanrui, Prince Hui]
I don't intend to fight with my brother.

763
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,110
I implore Your Majesty
to discern clearly.

764
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,110
[Gu Yangong, Prince Xian]
What do you mean?

765
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,550
The selection of the crown prince

766
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:23,670
is entirely a matter
of His Majesty's consideration.

767
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,790
It has nothing to do
with our intentions.

768
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,830
So, how do you think

769
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,710
naming an heir and the weapon case

770
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,910
are related？

771
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,590
I will thoroughly investigate this case

772
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:43,750
to set Your Majesty's mind at ease

773
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,950
and to reassure the court.

774
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,790
What is the Seven-Star Bureau for?

775
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,150
I don't need a prince
to investigate the case.

776
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,390
You two may step aside now.

777
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,830
It is rather strange, though.

778
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,830
Minister Hua has always been outspoken.

779
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,830
He often directly point out my errors.

780
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,470
How come about this weapon case,

781
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,990
you have not written a word to me?

782
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:10,470
Could it be

783
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,590
that the whole world is wrong?

784
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,710
Is there really something
that even Minister Hua

785
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,430
dares not speak of?

786
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,430
Regardless of whether
the two matters are related,

787
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,990
you only trust the Seven-Star Bureau.

788
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,510
Whether Prince Xian

789
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,230
or Prince Hui is named your heir,

790
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,230
you simply consider it

791
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,310
a private affair.

792
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,870
So, my advice

793
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,590
makes no difference.

794
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,710
I established the Seven-Star Bureau.

795
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,910
Shouldn't I trust it?

796
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,350
Prince Xian and Prince Hui

797
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,670
are my sons.

798
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,830
Is this not a private affair?

799
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,630
What time is it?

800
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,070
It has just passed the hour of Xu.

801
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,950
The couplet bestowed by the Emperor
has not yet arrived.

802
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,270
That's not what I asked about.

803
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,550
Has the lord gone to the palace?

804
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,270
Don't worry.

805
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,590
He used to

806
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,230
stay overnight in the palace.

807
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,390
Yinzhu,

808
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,550
bring the warmed bird's nest soup

809
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,590
to Madam Lin.

810
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:28,670
My eyelid keeps twitching.

811
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,390
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

812
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:33,950
My father misspoke.

813
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,910
Please forgive his rashness,

814
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,070
and see his loyalty.

815
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,590
Shut up.

816
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,270
Incompetent coward.

817
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:41,910
Compared to your father,

818
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,150
you fall far short.

819
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:45,910
Minister Hua,

820
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,190
go on.

821
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,550
The Seven Constellations Bureau
disregards the national laws,

822
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,470
indulges in private executions
and arbitrary killings,

823
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,470
causing panic throughout
the court and the country.

824
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,510
The common people are
trembling with fear.

825
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,150
The position of the Crown Prince

826
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,590
remains unsettled for too long.

827
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,630
The princes are in constant conflict,

828
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,710
and the officials ganged up,

829
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:04,190
each serving their own master.

830
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,590
Your Majesty, please think of the state,

831
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,910
and the common people.

832
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,390
Please eradicate corruption and pests,

833
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,390
and to choose
the Crown Prince decisively.

834
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,950
The world as the master,

835
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:16,030
the sovereign as the guest.

836
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,550
What the sovereign manages

837
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:18,990
is indeed the world itself.

838
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,030
How can one foster an ulcer
to trouble the whole world,

839
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,630
to regard worldly affairs as one's
personal business?

840
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:26,910
Hua Yizheng!

841
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,670
Your Majesty asked me to speak.

842
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,190
I dared not to.

843
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,270
And as I've started,

844
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,030
I needed to finish.

845
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,990
It seems there's truly

846
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,030
no word that you, Hua Yizheng,

847
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,390
dare not to say.

848
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:53,830
Hua Yizheng!

849
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,190
do you know

850
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,830
I have tolerated you for years?

851
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,550
Relying on what is called
your stubborn integrity,

852
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,230
you incited scholars from all over

853
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,550
to accept you as the leader.

854
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,190
But you forgot

855
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,590
that the Gu family runs Dayqing Empire,

856
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,350
not the Hua Family!

857
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,750
Today, I shall fulfil your wish.

858
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,030
Your entire clan shall
be stripped of their positions,

859
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,950
and your family will
be exiled to the north,

860
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,670
never to be employed again.

861
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,510
Your Majesty,

862
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,470
Your Majesty,

863
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,710
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

864
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:31,030
Your Majesty, please rethink about it!

865
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,950
I

866
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,790
will follow this decree.

867
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,710
Your Majesty, please show mercy!

868
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,710
Your Majesty,

869
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,630
Your Majesty, please show mercy!

870
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,670
Your Majesty,

871
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,630
Your Majesty, please show mercy!

872
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,470
Hua Yuzheng is old now.

873
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,190
He's incorrigibly obstinate.

874
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,310
Fortunately, there is a loyal minister

875
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,070
who can speak the truth to me.

876
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,070
Do you know

877
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,550
who I am talking about?

878
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,070
He knows each one of you

879
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,270
very well.

880
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,070
In the fourth year of the Chengtian era,

881
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,590
and the ninth year, the eleventh year,

882
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,510
five prime ministers, one after another,

883
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,110
were imprisoned and
had their properties confiscated.

884
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,350
In the seventeenth year,

885
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,990
Prince Qi plotted treason

886
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,430
and was demoted to a commoner.

887
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,230
Those, were all his achievements.

888
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:30,070
Today,

889
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,230
I will let you meet him.

890
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,310
Changqing,

891
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:35,550
summon

892
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,510
Qi Ruhai from
the Seven Constellations Bureau.

893
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,350
I

894
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,110
Qi Ruhai, head of
the Seven Constellations Bureau

895
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,310
Is there a result for the weapon case?

896
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,030
I have found

897
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,510
the mastermind behind it

898
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,990
is none other than Prince Ling's heir,

899
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,790
Gu Yanxi.
