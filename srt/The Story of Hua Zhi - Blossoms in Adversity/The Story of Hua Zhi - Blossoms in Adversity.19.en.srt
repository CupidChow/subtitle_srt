[Episode 19]

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,780
What's the matter, Lady Zhi?

26
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,860
Baoxia heard wrong. Everything is fine.

27
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,050
You all, leave us.

28
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,810
Close the door.

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,260
Okay, as long as everything is fine.

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,490
If you need anything, let us know.

31
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,650
Everyone, you can leave.

32
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,580
Zhi,

33
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,420
why didn't you have them

34
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,740
report me to the officials?

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,620
Ms. Qin,

36
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,850
now in this room,

37
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:07,850
there are only the three of us.

38
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,740
If you're in any kind of trouble,

39
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,340
just tell me.

40
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,700
We'll figure out a solution together.

41
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,850
I'm not in any trouble.

42
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,100
It's just that I have done

43
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,780
something unconscionable.

44
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,700
It was my own fault.

45
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:27,890
Baoxia,

46
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,100
help her up.

47
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,700
What do you think
they are talking about?

48
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,130
I guess that Ms. Qin

49
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,100
is begging Lady Zhi

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,860
to have her move back in.

51
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,860
What else could it be?

52
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,100
It's not that.

53
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,020
At first,

54
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,610
I heard Baoxia yelled.

55
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,530
Could it be that Ms. Qin

56
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,770
has stolen something?

57
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,530
Steal? What could she possibly steal?

58
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,020
What is there to steal?

59
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:57,970
Ms. Qin,

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,250
the idea of stealing the undergarment

61
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,410
can't possibly be from you.

62
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,660
Who taught you that?

63
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,970
It was Madam Hua Jing.

64
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,610
Madam Hua Jing?

65
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,100
What does it have to do with her?

66
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,020
I'm telling you,

67
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,740
if you try to slander others,

68
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,970
I'll truly report you to the officials!

69
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,860
Let her finish.

70
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,530
She said

71
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,220
that if I could give your undergarment

72
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,300
to her,

73
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,690
you would become the adulterer.

74
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,580
An adulterer?

75
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,020
Don't let anyone hear you!

76
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,410
What could she possibly steal?

77
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,050
Yeah, what is there to steal?

78
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,530
I have no idea.

79
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,300
What are you looking at?

80
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,050
Don't you have any work to do?

81
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,970
Get back to work!

82
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,740
What you said is rather peculiar.

83
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:56,700
What do you mean

84
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,170
by that?

85
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,700
Who is that adulterer
you were talking about?

86
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,650
Me, it was me!

87
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,370
Ms. Qin,

88
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,770
just tell me the whole story

89
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,050
in details.

90
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,090
If I can help you with it,

91
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,260
I will help you.

92
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,020
But if you still try to hide something,

93
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,740
then whatever it is,
you'll be suffering on your own.

94
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,980
Think carefully.

95
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,170
I'll tell you everything.

96
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,090
Zhi,

97
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,490
everything

98
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,420
was my fault.

99
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,860
I shouldn't have done that, Zhi!

100
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,490
So that's how it is.

101
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:39,770
She actually came up

102
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,210
with such a malicious plan to harm me.

103
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,300
Young Lady

104
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,890
is still unmarried.

105
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,580
If she really

106
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,050
fell into the trap
set by Madam Hua Jing and you,

107
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,770
how would she live
for the rest of her life?

108
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,090
You would kill her!

109
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:50,820
I can't let you get away with this.

110
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,700
I am now taking you to Madam Hua.

111
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,490
You'll explain everything to her!

112
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,140
Baoxia.

113
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:54,980
Come with me to see Madam Hua!

114
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,050
Come on, move!

115
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,890
No, I can't!

116
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,650
I'm taking you to Madam Hua!

117
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,490
You'll see Madam Hua

118
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,170
and explain everything to her!

119
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,140
No, I can't!

120
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,580
I can't!

121
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,980
Zhi.

122
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,260
Madam Hua Jing said

123
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,650
that if I can't hand the undergarment

124
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,170
to Mr. Yang,

125
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,540
she'll have everyone know about this.

126
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,300
It's going to ruin my life!

127
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,050
Either way, my life is ruined.

128
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,210
Why do you have to make me

129
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,330
humiliate myself in front of Madam Hua?

130
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,820
Besides,

131
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,890
the kids are still here.

132
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,540
Stop crying.

133
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,170
We'll figure out a way.

134
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,260
What can we possibly do?

135
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,420
I think I know...

136
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:50,890
Baoxia, stop her!

137
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,580
Mother.

138
00:05:59,140 --> 00:05:59,890
Mother!

139
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,330
Mother!

140
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,820
Mother!

141
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,620
Get a rope!

142
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,970
Help!

143
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,770
Someone, help! Save my mother!

144
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,770
Mother!

145
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,180
Mother!

Mother!

147

Mother!

148
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,140
Mother, how could you do that?

149
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,770
You...

150
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,730
You did

151
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,210
such a shameful thing!

152
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,330
How are we

153
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,970
going to face the others? Mother!

154
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,180
Qin,

155
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,090
I've failed you.

156
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,180
You'll be at peace once I'm dead.

157
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,020
You've even given up on your dignity.

158
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,090
You've brought shame on yourself!

159
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,330
And now you're afraid of being alive?

160
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,820
You'd have nothing to worry about
when you're dead.

161
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,260
But what about Boli and me?

162
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,890
How are we going to live?

163
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,970
Mother!

164
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,180
Mother!

165
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,330
Mother, please don't die!

166
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,700
Boli?

167
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,730
I don't want you to die, Mother!

168
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,530
What did you call me?

169
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,970
Mother, please don't die!

170
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,140
I don't want you to die!

171
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,330
Boli,

172
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,460
my darling!

173
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,970
Boli.

174
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,460
My child!

175
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,770
Zhi,

176
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,330
my mother did make
a huge mistake this time.

177
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,060
But all these years,

178
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,210
life has never been easy for her.

179
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,650
I know it. I understand her.

180
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,730
If there's anyone

181
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,770
who is kind to her,

182
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,460
she would certainly fall for it.

183
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,970
Zhi,

184
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,090
for the sake of Boli

185
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,260
and me,

186
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,850
please forgive her this time!

187
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,650
When did I say I won't forgive her?

188
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,380
My child...

189
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,330
Yingchun,

190
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,210
have you finished

191
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,090
what I told you to do earlier?

192
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,500
The maids and guardians present just now

193
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,460
have all been warned.

194
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,500
Boli just called Ms. Qin Mother.

195
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,820
Madam Qi can never know about this.

196
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,140
Whoever dares to mention a word

197
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,090
will be kicked out immediately.

198
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,530
Ms. Qin,

199
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,500
have you ever wondered

200
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
why Madam Hua Jing knew that

201
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,970
right after you had been with Mr. Yang

202
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,500
for a short while?

203
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,820
That was strange, indeed.

204
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,500
Usually, I can drink a lot.

205
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,820
But that day, after just one drink,

206
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,820
I was drunk.

207
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,180
I'm afraid there was something
in the wine.

208
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,700
That bad guy! He set me up.

209
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,140
That bad guy!

210
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,530
Sir, a maid

211
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,730
asked me to give this to you.

212
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,620
A maid? Where is she?

213
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,290
She's gone.

214
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,580
I asked who sent her here?

215
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,850
She said you'll know.

216
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,500
Alright, you may leave.

217
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,900
[Qin]

218
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,660
To my surprise,
that woman is quite capable.

219
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,330
She handled it so well.

220
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,820
She really got it.

221
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,370
Where's the undergarment?

222
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,180
That girl is very cautious.

223
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,660
I have no chance to do it.

224
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,370
I've let Madam Hua Jing down.

225
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,900
After I think it over,
there seems to be no way out.

226
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,970
I've saved up a pouch of money
and valuable stuff,

227
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,540
which is worth about a hundred guan.

228
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,090
The best plan for now is to leave.

229
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,660
If you are willing to come with me,

230
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,730
then at 11:45 PM,

231
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,420
I'll wait by the east courtyard wall.

232
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,130
She'll wait?

233
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,460
She has money?

234
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,490
Do birdcall three times,

235
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,900
then I'll throw the pouch over the wall.

236
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,580
We'll leave together

237
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,090
to become a couple.

238
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,180
I entrusted you with all my sincerity.

239
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,660
So don't let me down.

240
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,090
The woman is getting old,

241
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,010
but the money is not.

242
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,210
At worst, I'll just kill her halfway.

243
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,700
A runaway concubine.

244
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,820
Who'll be looking for her?

245
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,060
Stop!

246
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,540
What are you doing?

247
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,300
We caught the thief!

248
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,250
We caught the thief!

249
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,540
I'm not a thief! I'm a shopkeeper!

250
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,420
You're the one we're after!

251
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,060
You've got the wrong person!

252
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,180
I'm not a thief!

253
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,780
I'm not a thief!

254
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,900
I'm not a thief!

255
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,820
Please stop, I'm begging you!

256
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,490
I'm not a thief!

257
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,970
Lady Zhi, I'm not a thief!

258
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,730
This is a mistake!

259
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,010
You bad woman!

260
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,780
You set me up to fall into the trap!

261
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,970
You're blaming me?

262
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,180
You bad guy!

263
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,210
I'll kill you...

264
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,370
You bad guy!

265
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,330
You...

266
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,090
You!

267
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,610
Yang Youde,

268
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,900
you trespassed into our place

269
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,660
and tried to steal things.

270
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,660
On your way fleeing,

271
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,850
we caught you red-handed.

272
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,610
However,

273
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,490
I won't report you to the officials
for now.

274
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,490
It's getting late.

275
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,820
I do not wish to disturb others.

276
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,730
Keep him in the woodshed until dawn.

277
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,370
Perhaps, by tomorrow morning,

278
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,580
you will commit suicide

279
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,460
out of guilt.

280
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,130
If he dies in the woodshed,

281
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,370
the place will smell terrible.

282
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,180
Why don't we just throw him away?

283
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,370
Even though the Hua Family

284
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,610
will have to
take some responsibility for that,

285
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,180
we are the victims
of the theft after all.

286
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,210
So it's understandable.

287
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,780
Besides,

288
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,060
our family

289
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:21,820
has already committed huge crimes.

290
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,370
Having a thief die in our house

291
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,660
is nothing, right?

292
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,700
Exactly, it's nothing.

293
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,330
Right.

294
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,780
If you change your mind,
tell me everything.

295
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,490
Otherwise, you'll die
without even understanding why.

296
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,010
I'll tell you!

297
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,660
Get him inside!

298
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,780
Yes.

299
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,370
Lady Zhi,

300
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,420
I assure you

301
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,900
that what I said is true.

302
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,660
Since it was Madam Hua Jing

303
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,370
who set up the plan,

304
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,210
where did you get those medicines from?

305
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,820
They were also given by Madam Hua Jing.

306
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:57,330
Her husband

307
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,820
runs a herbal medicine shop, right?

308
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,010
So she can have any kind of medicine.

309
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,060
Master.

310
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,370
Master, something bad happened!

311
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,210
Master!

312
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,780
Master, something bad happened!

313
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,300
Open the door, Master!

314
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:10,940
Master!

315
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:11,900
Useless!

316
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:12,730
Useless!

317
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,970
Master,

318
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,610
we truly couldn't come here before.

319
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,540
Those officials

320
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,180
came in and searched without a word.

321
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,850
In the blink of an eye,

322
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,660
they found

323
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
all of the medicines!

324
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:22,780
They said that according to Daqing Law,

325
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,250
it's strictly prohibited

326
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,060
to sell those things

327
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,060
in medicine shops.

328
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,130
Then they confiscated the medicines

329
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,330
and sealed the shop.

330
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,090
I heard there will be an interrogation
in a few days.

331
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,610
The usual bribes that should be handled

332
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,370
were all handled.

333
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,730
How come

334
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,210
this happened

335
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,210
at this very time?

336
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,850
Master, there's another thing.

337
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,420
I heard from the fellow
across the street

338
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,490
that early this morning,

339
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,580
he saw someone from the Hua Family
entering the government office.

340
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,490
The Hua Family?

341
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,090
Could it be them who're against me?

342
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,090
But how did they know

343
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,130
about the things in our shop?

344
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,130
Master, you should look into this.

345
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,490
Our shop has never

346
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,330
openly displayed those goods for sale.

347
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,850
We've always been

348
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,970
secretly selling
to our regular customers.

349
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,540
Nothing was ever wrong.

350
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,580
Master,

351
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,420
I remembered something.

352
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,460
Speak up if you have something to say.

353
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,540
About several days ago,

354
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:12,580
Madam came to the shop and asked for...

355
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,540
Useless!

356
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,730
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

357
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,850
Bad woman!

358
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,490
She can't achieve anything!

359
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,370
I'll skin her alive!

360
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:32,780
Chengzu!

361
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,780
You can still eat?

362
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:34,780
Bad woman!

363
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,490
How dare you ruin my family's business!

364
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,700
My dear,

365
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,460
whatever you have to say,

366
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,820
please make it clear.

367
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Why did you hit me
without saying a word?

368
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,210
Your family is despicable.

369
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,090
Tell me

370
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,010
who reported my shop

371
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,970
for selling aphrodisiacs?

372
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,610
I have no idea!

373
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,660
You have no idea?

374
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,370
Then I'll let you know it!

375
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,330
Now the shop is sealed off.

376
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,250
The unsealing time

377
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:58,850
is not determined yet!

378
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,250
The neighbors saw the officials

379
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,130
coming in and going out.

380
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,850
Tell me.

381
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,820
Just tell me

382
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,540
how I am supposed
to keep running this business?

383
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,420
I don't know about that.

384
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,540
I really don't know!

385
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:14,970
I get it!

386
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,900
I get it!

387
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,460
It must be Hua Zhi.

388
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,540
It must be her.

389
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,730
It must be her.

390
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,060
If I lost my shop,

391
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,130
your family
won't be able to cover the losses,

392
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:24,970
not even by selling everything!

393
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,780
Bad woman!

394
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
I've been supporting your life,

395
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,490
yet you destroyed my family business!

396
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,900
Get out of the Song Family!

397
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,010
So, Grandmother has to keep

398
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,210
taking these medicines,

399
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,970
right?

400
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,700
Yeah, but she mustn't get angry.

401
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,330
If she gets angry,

402
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,370
the medicine won't work well.

403
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,060
Young Lady, something bad happened!

404
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,370
Madam Hua Jing is here again!

405
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,370
Shaoyao,

406
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,900
take these to the kitchen

407
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,180
and tell Fudong how to decoct them.

408
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,130
Madam Hua Jing

409
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,060
seems to have gone crazy.

410
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:09,970
Several of us tried to stop her,

411
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,850
but none of us could.

412
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,660
Where is she now?

413
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,540
She went to the Madam Hua's room.

414
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Look at my face

415
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,330
and my hands!

416
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,090
It's all because of Hua Zhi!

417
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:24,900
This bad girl

418
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,850
made my husband beat me!

419
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,970
Madam Hua Jing,

420
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,970
you caused trouble yourself.

421
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,370
Shouting at Madam Hua

422
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,330
won't do you any good, will it?

423
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,300
What nonsense are you spouting?

424
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,130
- What are you doing?
- Aunt Jing.

425
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,700
If there's anything you need to say,
talk to me.

426
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,850
Grandmother is not in good health.

427
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:42,820
So,

428
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,250
are you afraid of having Madam

429
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,610
find out about what you've done?

430
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,370
If you're capable of doing it,

431
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,540
then why are you
afraid of me exposing it?

432
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,610
Baoxia, call for help.

433
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,420
Hold on.

434
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,730
If there's anything to say, say it here.

435
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,250
In recent days,

436
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,250
everyone in this household

437
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,850
has been sneaking around and whispering.

438
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,180
Some were crying
and some were making a fuss.

439
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,900
What exactly happened?

440
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,820
And why are you all keeping it from me?

441
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,490
Zhi, tell me.

442
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:10,850
Grandmother,

443
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,250
after Aunt Jing left,

444
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,370
I will explain it to you.

445
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,370
Why?

446
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,330
Are you too ashamed
to say it in front of me?

447
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,300
Fine then.

448
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,970
I'll say it.

449
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,490
Mother...

450
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,330
Shut up.

451
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,130
You shut up!

452
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,370
Move!

453
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:28,970
Mother,

454
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,900
Ms. Qin took an aphrodisiac

455
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,490
and had an affair with the owner

456
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,090
of the Yuexiu Tavern.

457
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,330
I caught them in the act.

458
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,610
In order to shift the blame,

459
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,180
she tried
to steal Hua Zhi's undergarment.

460
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,700
But unexpectedly,

461
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,100
she clumsily failed to do that.

462
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,810
This granddaughter of yours

463
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,530
is young,

464
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,530
but wicked.

465
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,730
She teamed up with Ms. Qin

466
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,530
and set a trap

467
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,700
to catch the owner of the Yuexiu Tavern.

468
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,970
She tortured him severely

469
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,530
to force him
to falsely accuse my husband

470
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,970
of privately selling aphrodisiacs.

471
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,660
Do you understand what I said?

472
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,700
That is what your granddaughter did.

473
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,290
Grandmother, it's not like that.

474
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:06,700
Zhi,

475
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,100
I never doubted

476
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,530
your character and acts.

477
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,620
I just never expected

478
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,210
that my daughter

479
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,250
whom I gave birth to and raised

480
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,420
could actually do

481
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,460
something so despicable.

482
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,460
You are truly vicious.

483
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,180
If you really got what you wanted,

484
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,100
how would your niece
live for the rest of her life?

485
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,420
I thought you didn't know

486
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,620
that she is my niece.

487
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,570
Since you know that,
why haven't you ever

488
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,620
thought about my feelings?

489
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,900
I merely wanted a maid,

490
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,210
someone who is obedient.

491
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,810
But she kept causing trouble,

492
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,420
making me lose my dignity
in the Song Family!

493
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,970
I lost my foothold!

494
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,970
If you didn't drag me down,

495
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,380
how would I be

496
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,180
suffering a lot in the Song Family?

497
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:59,420
What kind of life

498
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
I'm living now?

499
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,290
You

500
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,810
and you!

501
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,490
All of you!

502
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,860
None of you will get away with this!

503
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,700
In this case,

504
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,530
it was all my fault.

505
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,340
I shouldn't have spoiled you so badly.

506
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,490
I'm spoiled?

507
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,660
A crooked stick
will have a crooked shadow!

508
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,290
Old woman,

509
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,140
at this point,

510
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,730
you're reaping what you sowed!

511
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,250
Take Grandmother to rest.

512
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,490
Yes.

513
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,460
Now, everyone in the Hua Family

514
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,340
relies on you

515
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,210
to save their lives, right?

516
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,730
Stop dreaming!

517
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,700
Don't you think

518
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,570
that with your tricks

519
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,290
and gimmicks,

520
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,810
you can regain everything you've lost?

521
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,460
You pushed me

522
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,730
into desperation

523
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,380
and then

524
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,100
live happily here, right?

525
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,010
Since you're

526
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,970
going to watch

527
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,250
me die,

528
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,770
let me

529
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,250
tell you something.

530
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,530
My surname is Hua.

531
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,140
As long as I'm alive,

532
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,810
I will curse you.

533
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,860
I will curse you,

534
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,900
all of you.

535
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,180
For the rest of your lives,

536
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:25,530
you will never

537
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,050
have a reunion.

538
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,570
The old man should have been long dead.

539
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,490
And you should

540
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,860
go to the underworld

541
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,570
to pave the way!

542
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,100
What are you talking about?

543
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,620
How dare you!

544
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,380
Get out of my sight!

545
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,420
Get out!

546
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,010
All of you, just wait and see.

547
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,140
Grandmother!

548
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,180
- Grandmother!
- Madam!

549
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,100
Madam!

550
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,010
Call the physician!

551
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,380
You go get Shaoyao!

552
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,810
Madam!

553
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,140
Physician.

554
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,660
Miss Hua,

555
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,380
forgive my directness.

556
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,490
Since your family faced the disaster,

557
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,290
Madam Hua has been greatly
grieved and angered.

558
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,010
Her health was severely harmed.

559
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,860
Even with good treatment,

560
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,730
it's difficult to go against fate.

561
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,860
Physician,

562
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,010
whatever you do,

563
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,460
please save her.

564
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,460
I'm begging you!

565
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,460
Miss Hua,

566
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,810
Madam Hua's last hour has come.

567
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,380
No medicine can help her now.

568
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,050
If you insist on keeping her,

569
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,660
you'll only cause her more suffering.

570
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,490
I take my leave.

571
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,570
Zhi,

572
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,700
I'm sorry.

573
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,530
I've tried every prescription.

574
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,770
I still can't save her...

575
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,290
Let's get inside.

576
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:36,810
Hurry up.

577
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,770
Come on, let's get in.

578
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,010
She is too weak right now.

579
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,010
Ladies,

580
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,380
perhaps you shouldn't go inside.

581
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,340
Let her rest for a while.

582
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,810
Lady Zhi,

583
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,810
Madam Hua

584
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,730
wants to see you alone.

585
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:31,770
Grandmother.

586
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,620
The physician said

587
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,570
you should take some medicine and rest.

588
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,050
Then you'll be fine.

589
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,100
I will listen to you.

590
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,340
Take medicine

591
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,860
and rest.

592
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,700
Grandmother,

593
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,180
I'm sorry.

594
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,770
I've been holding

595
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,660
this family seal for forty years.

596
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,210
Now,

597
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,180
I'm handing it over to you.

598
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,730
So I can feel relieved.

599
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,460
Grandmother,

600
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,660
if you want to entrust this to me,

601
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,660
I will accept it.

602
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,290
But can you please

603
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:48,460
stay with me for a bit longer?

604
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,380
I feel like

605
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
there're still so many things
I don't understand.

606
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,730
I want you to teach me.

607
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,290
I would like that too.

608
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,900
But,

609
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,660
there will come a day,

610
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,210
when the impossible things

611
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:15,340
and those difficult things...

612
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,100
I believe

613
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,970
that someday,

614
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,730
you will surely succeed.

615
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:30,180
I will.

616
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,860
One day,

617
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,860
I will bring Grandfather

618
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,250
and all the others home.

619
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,250
We will

620
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,380
redeem them all.

621
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,380
Then we move back
to the old Hua Mansion,

622
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,810
cooking, doing embroidery...

623
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:53,180
I can already see that scene.

624
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,050
So many people

625
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,570
and it's bustling.

626
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,770
Zhi,

627
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,770
I'm sorry

628
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,570
for making you

629
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,970
carry a heavy burden.

630
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,860
Can you forgive me?

631
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,380
When I was at your age,

632
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,460
I had black hair as well.

633
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,010
Time flies. In the blink of an eye,
my hair turned white.

634
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:47,050
Don't miss out on someone you fancy.

635
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,050
That day,

636
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,210
it was a sunny day.

637
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,340
I was riding a horse

638
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,180
and I saw your Grandfather.

639
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,860
He was so young.

640
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,010
What a pity.

641
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,660
I can't see him again.

642
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,730
My Zhi is so beautiful.

643
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,050
Grandmother!

644
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,010
Grandmother!

645
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:14,970
Grandmother, please talk to me.

646
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,810
Grandmother, please wake up.

647
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,460
Grandmother.

648
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,970
Grandmother!

649
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,900
Grandmother, please wake up.

650
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,050
Madam!

651
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,460
Madam...

652
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,620
Madam...

653
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,530
Young Lady, just cry.

654
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,210
I don't have the time to cry.

655
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,100
Grandmother left so suddenly.

656
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,620
I have to give her

657
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,050
a decent funeral.

658
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,700
I also

659
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,730
have to take revenge.

660
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,140
Madam!

661
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,620
Madam...

662
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,860
That's not how you cut it.

663
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,290
Cut here.

664
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,460
Look carefully before you cut.

665
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:32,770
Alright.

666
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,210
Never mind, let me do the cutting.

667
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,660
Go see where Duo has gone.

668
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,730
Why hasn't she come back yet?

669
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,970
Let me keep you company a bit longer.

670
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,620
Mother.

671
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,810
Where did you go?

672
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,050
Mother,

673
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,570
why is there

674
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,660
a large wooden box at home?

675
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:52,770
I saw Grandmother

676
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,180
lying inside and sleeping.

677
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,290
She's sleeping in it.

678
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,490
They even covered her with a lid.

679
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,210
Baozhu.

680
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,420
wouldn't let me see Grandmother.

681
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,180
She wouldn't let me
call Grandmother either.

682
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,970
It must be so cold inside that box!

683
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:03,660
Duo,

684
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,460
let me take you to bed, alright?

685
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,570
But Grandmother...

686
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,050
Duo,

687
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,210
Grandmother has passed away.

688
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,900
You'll no longer have Grandmother.

689
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,810
You need to be good.

690
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,530
Don't make her worry.

691
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:20,620
Alright?

692
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,100
No, I don't believe you!

693
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,770
I want Grandmother!

694
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,700
I want my grandmother...

695
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,180
I don't believe you...

696
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,460
I don't believe you...

697
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,010
I want my grandmother.

698
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,210
I don't believe you...
I want Grandmother!

699
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,660
Madam,

700
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,810
it's getting late.

701
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,010
Let me do this.

702
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,050
You should get some rest.

703
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,490
Don't worry about me.

704
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,210
Go check on Boli.

705
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:56,730
He's been crying all day.

706
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,970
He must be feeling bad.

707
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,380
Go.

708
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,490
Shaoyao,

709
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,660
what are you doing here?

710
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,570
Aunt Qi...

711
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,140
Don't cry.

712
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,730
Your hands are so cold.

713
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:45,810
Come on.

714
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,970
Aunt Qi,

715
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,770
it was all my fault.

716
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,140
I'm so useless.

717
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,380
I thought...

718
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,970
I thought I'm capable enough,

719
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:03,660
but I...

720
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,100
I still caused the death of her

721
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,140
and I made everyone so sad.

722
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,970
It was all my fault.

723
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,460
Silly child.

724
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,290
It was all my fault!

725
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,700
How can this be your fault?

726
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,340
It's not.

727
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,380
Come here.

728
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:19,770
It's not your fault.

729
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,700
Don't cry.

730
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,460
Don't cry.

731
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:30,600
[Hua Mansion]

732
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,710
[The memorial tablet of Madam Hua]

733
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,690
Madam.

734
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,650
I'm so sorry. It was all my fault.

735
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,130
Stop there.

736
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,860
You left without a word.

737
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,650
I'm surprised you can still come back.

738
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,220
Father.

739
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,970
Where are you going this time?

740
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,650
Today is Madam Hua's funeral.

741
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,460
I shall offer condolence.

742
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,900
I took this condolence gift
from the storeroom.

743
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,300
Consider it something I've borrowed.

744
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,050
I will pay you back at market price.

745
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,090
You are not going.

746
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,490
Have you lost your mind?

747
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,970
Are you aware of our current situation?

748
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,130
How can you visit them at this time?

749
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,570
You'll get me in trouble!

750
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,490
Father,

751
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,130
in this serious matter
of life and death,

752
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,460
is it necessary to avoid suspicion?

753
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,970
So you know it's a serious matter.

754
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,970
Both inside and outside the court,

755
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,650
Lord Xian got his men everywhere.

756
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:45,900
Today,

757
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,970
who dares to offer condolence
to the Hua Family?

758
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,380
Whether Lord Xian cares or not,

759
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,050
I am not sure.

760
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,300
It is quite clear

761
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,490
that you're using Lord Xian
as an excuse.

762
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,610
Do you know why Hua Yizheng

763
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,260
had his home raided

764
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,010
and why his clan was exiled?

765
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,260
It was because he failed

766
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,970
to pick a side between
Lord Xian and Lord Hui!

767
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,380
How can you distort the truth like that?

768
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,490
He is loyal and upright.

769
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,610
He didn't want to see the princes
fighting against each other

770
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,420
and the officials forming factions.

771
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,650
That's why he suffered this calamity.

772
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:11,530
Right!

773
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,090
Back then, Lord Xian and Lord Hui
both showed goodwill towards him.

774
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,460
He disregarded it all,

775
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,300
insisting on being

776
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,530
a fool who does not understand
his own situation.

777
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,460
And the outcome?

778
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,260
Once he lost the emperor's favor,

779
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,820
who would stand up for him?

780
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,010
Father,

781
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,300
I have lived in this family
for twenty years.

782
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,460
But I never knew

783
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,340
that we are

784
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,050
such a heartless and disloyal family.

785
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,820
When Master Hua fell into misfortune,

786
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,090
you cut ties with his family completely.

787
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,300
If in the future,

788
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,090
I also become that kind of fool

789
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,420
who doesn't understand his situation,

790
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,220
you'll probably

791
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,170
cut ties with me, won't you?

792
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,090
Well,

793
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,860
you are lecturing me.

794
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:47,860
You want to be a decent man, right?

795
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,530
Then go and be one.

796
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,460
The Shen Family is a disgraceful one.

797
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,220
We don't deserve someone
as upright as you.

798
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:55,900
Get out!

799
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,220
I'm sorry.

800
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,970
Qi!

801
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,340
Qi...

802
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,530
I could hear

803
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,610
you arguing with Father from far away.

804
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,460
What happened?
Who in the Hua Family passed away?

805
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,420
Madam Hua.

806
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,170
You don't know her.

807
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:33,490
I do know her.

808
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,610
She mentioned Madam Hua to me.

809
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,340
This must be so hard for Young Lady.

810
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,780
This is her first time
taking charge of a funeral.

811
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:49,460
But she made everything so proper.

812
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,690
The world is a cruel place, isn't it?

813
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,530
No one came to this funeral at all.

814
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,650
Now our family has fallen.

815
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,220
Madam Hua passed away.

816
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
And all the other people

817
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,220
are hiding from us,

818
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,220
not even stepping foot inside our house.

819
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,090
This is unacceptable.

820
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:09,650
I'll go out and take a look.

821
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:19,860
Yingchun,

822
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,970
go tell Young Lady

823
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,340
that Mr. Shen is here.

824
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,860
The Shen Family?

825
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,010
Mr. Shen Qi is holding
the condolence gift

826
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,090
and he came here on foot.

827
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,170
Hua Zhi.

828
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:09,740
I'm sorry for your loss.

829
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,780
You look so worn out.

830
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,900
Thank you for being here

831
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,740
to offer condolence.

832
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,090
What needs to be thanked

833
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,860
is much more than just today's kindness.

834
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,650
I fear I will never
be able to repay your kindness

835
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,820
in this lifetime.

836
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,010
Before the Hua Mansion was raided,

837
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,690
I never imagined

838
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,460
the world can be so cruel

839
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,860
and people can be so heartless

840
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,220
to the extent that I can't even believe.

841
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,010
Now,

842
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,260
I finally understand.

843
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,010
That's just the way the world is.

844
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,170
There are honest gentlemen like you

845
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,220
and unforgivable villains as well.

846
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,300
Hua Zhi,

847
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,900
I shall take my leave.

848
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,460
Who is this?

849
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,970
They're clearly from a wealthy family.

850
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,820
The Empress Dowager arrives.

851
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,050
Everyone, clear the way.

852
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,380
Who?

853
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,010
Who's here?

854
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,220
The Empress Dowager?

855
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,970
Is it the Empress Dowager
from the Imperial Palace?

856
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,170
Wan,

857
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,050
I never imagined

858
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,170
our reunion

859
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,690
would be under such circumstances.
