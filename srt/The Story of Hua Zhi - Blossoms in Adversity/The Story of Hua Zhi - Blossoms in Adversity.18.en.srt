[Episode 18]

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,540
Fudong.

26
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,780
Young Lady.

27
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,050
I've heard all about it.

28
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,890
I don't want to
be a concubine of the Song Family.

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,730
Even if it were to be the Madam,

30
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,060
I wouldn't go.

31
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,170
Fudong, get up.

32
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,290
Come on.

33
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,100
I've been sold
from here and there like animals

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,740
since I was young.

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,290
Finally,

36
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,490
I feel like a human now.

37
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,850
I'd rather spend my whole life

38
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,220
working like a horse here

39
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,890
than go to serve the Song Family.

40
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,980
Who said you had to
go to the Song Family?

41
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,660
Who said you had to work like a horse?

42
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,300
When Madam Xia wanted
to sell some of you the other day,

43
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,380
I made you a promise.

44
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,530
Whether it's you,

45
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,300
Yingchun, or Baoxia,

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,890
as long as you want to be by my side,

47
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,340
I will protect you.

48
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,340
So,

49
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,460
you can rest assured

50
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,250
and do your duty in the kitchen.

51
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,740
If Auntie Hua Jing comes to you again,

52
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,740
I will deal with her.

Young Lady is here, so don't worry.

54
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,810
Sir,

55
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,580
you haven't drunk any water

56
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,810
since last night.

57
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,330
Drink some hot water.

58
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,380
Mind your health.

59
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:10,610
Sir.

60
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,970
Xiao took her own life.

61
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,970
Died as a matched pair with you,

62
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:46,420
I won't envy the immortals.

63
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,820
I have said it.

64
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,890
Don't disturb my meditation

65
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,890
unless it's important.

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,090
Yanxi, you are back.

67
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,820
This meditation room

68
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,300
is a quiet place in the mansion.

69
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,170
No wonder

70
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,540
you want to stay here all day long.

71
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,890
If you like it,

72
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,540
you can come and join me

73
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,650
in meditation and reciting scripture.

74
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,020
Just now,

75
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,460
the Security Bureau
came to deliver a message,

76
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,260
saying that Consort Xiao...

77
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,050
I knew.

78
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,650
You already knew?

79
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,610
Since Xiao has already died,

80
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,140
why didn't you send someone

81
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,740
to retrieve her body?

82
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,490
I don't want to have anything to do

83
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,090
with such a treacherous woman.

84
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,580
How can I allow her

85
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,210
to put shame

86
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,260
on our family?

87
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,170
And right now,

88
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,770
your mother

89
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,140
has already been vindicated.

90
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,610
From now on,

91
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,740
you and I

92
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,490
must recite scripture more often

93
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,540
to pray for your mother.

94
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,300
Okay.

95
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,650
There's something
I want to ask you about.

96
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,260
Does His Majesty know

97
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,890
that you conspire against him

98
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,020
with the help of the Zhou Family?

99
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,890
Did Xiao tell you about that?

100
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,610
You believe her?

101
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,210
She must have told the truth

102
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,020
since she was dying.

103
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,140
She has written it all down.

104
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:57,890
[Died as a matched pair with you,
I won't envy the immortals.]

105
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,020
You got panicked.

106
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,140
You figured out
I'm the Security Bureau Commander,

107
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,500
so you think

108
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,820
this is her testimony against you.

109
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,890
Too bad.

110
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,890
She didn't say a word until her death.

111
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,620
She protected you
until she took her last breath.

112
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,460
And I just drew you out.

113
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,290
So?

114
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,020
Do you want to tell on your own father?

115
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,770
Do you recite scripture every day

116
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,500
just to make yourself

117
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,620
feel more at ease?

118
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,770
Back in the day,

119
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,330
the Zhou Family had command
over the whole army.

120
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,500
You took my mother as your wife

121
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,500
so you could contend
for the heir to the throne.

122
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,580
When my uncle ascended the throne,

123
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,410
you were afraid that His Majesty
would distrust and retaliate upon you.

124
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,580
So you convinced my grandfather

125
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,770
and my uncle to declare a war,

126
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,970
but the army was defeated overnight

127
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,090
and the entire Zhou Family was executed.

128
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,530
You got away scot-free,

129
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,180
and every one
of my mother's clan was dead.

130
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,180
And you used Xiao,

131
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,850
who was madly in love with you,

132
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,090
to kill my mother for you.

133
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,970
She wasn't cruel enough though,

134
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,020
because she didn't

135
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,500
kill Ms. Chen's entire family.

136
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,290
She was not as cold-blooded as you

137
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,820
when it came to that.

138
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,700
Because you wouldn't even spare

139
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,770
your own daughter.

140
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,970
Dong Da wanted to tell on you,

141
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,890
and you killed him.

142
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,260
If Shaoyao wasn't so lucky,

143
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,820
she would have died in the fire.

144
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,260
I guess

145
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,020
you stopped coming after her

146
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,500
because you realized
that the assassins you sent

147
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,620
all failed.

148
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,140
You figured out
I am the Security Bureau Commander.

149
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,180
Besides, Shaoyao

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,260
didn't know anything.

151
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,850
Otherwise, after I brought her home,

152
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,770
she wouldn't chat with you

153
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,970
so calmly,

154
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:08,970
right?

155
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,890
The Security Bureau

156
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,820
is always infamous
for wronging the good people

157
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,090
and using schemes and tricks.

158
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:21,820
Now even you

159
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,820
become one of their kind.

160
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,380
Right.

161
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,210
All that I've said just now

162
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,380
was just to frame you.

163
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,260
How could you, the noble Lord Ling,

164
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,850
possibly get your hands dirty

165
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,410
and kill your wife
just to save yourself?

166
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,210
Shut up.

167
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,330
How could you make Xiao,

168
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,380
a weak woman,

169
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,530
willingly

170
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,970
become a murderer?

171
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,820
I am your father!

172
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,970
I would rather

173
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,530
never have a father like you.

174
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,090
Your Highness.

175
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,090
The eunuch Changqing
from the Palace is here.

176
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,820
Greetings, Your Highness.

177
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,090
His Majesty heard

178
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,140
Consort Zhou
has borne her guilt for many years,

179
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,060
and today her name has been cleared.

180
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,650
He thought you would feel sad,

181
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,380
so he wanted to invite you
to come over to the Imperial Palace.

182
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,530
He has known already?

183
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,260
Your Highness.

184
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,530
Changqing.

185
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,330
I will go with you.

186
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
His Majesty only asked for His Highness
to go to the Imperial Palace.

187
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,140
I can't stop you if you want to go.

188
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,290
It's just that I don't know

189
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,500
if His Majesty is willing to see you.

His Majesty doesn't want to see me?

196
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,300
I was told by His Majesty

197
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,850
to take you to the Shen Pavilion

198

You're still too young.

202

The turmoil of that year

203
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,820
was the biggest secret and scandal
of the royal family.

204
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,780
That is an old scar.

205
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,820
I am not the only one

206
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,970
who wants to bury it.

207

That one in Chenglu Palace

208
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,820
probably is even more reluctant
to reveal the past.

215
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,090
I dreamed about my brother.

216
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,820
He was crying,

217
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,180
but later he laughed.

218
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,610
I'd never seen him like this.

219
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,090

the opposite of reality.

Why didn't he come to see me?

223
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,970

Do you realize your mistake?

228
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,330
I'm not aware, Your Majesty.

229
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,300
I didn't punish you
because you did something wrong.

230
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,460
It's that you didn't realize

231
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,490
what was the meaning
of being father and son.

232
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,420
Even if Lord Ling did wrong,

233
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,970
he is still your birth father.

234
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,460
If you have no moral principles

235
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,300
and you can go against your father
like that today,

236
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,060
maybe you will do the same to me
one day.

237
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,210
I have heard about
what happened to Consort Xiao.

238
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,660

You can't let emotions
take over your judgment.

248

delivered this to you
early this morning.

259
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,540

you'd know how many apples

without getting out of the house.

262
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,420
By then, you can go
buy apples from them.

263
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,970

Can these characters really

be affixed to the fruit?

270
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:39,900
Yes.

271
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,580
When these fruits get bathed more
under the sun,

272
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,820
they will all turn red.

273
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,490
Only the places covered by these papers

274

And the characters
will show on the apple skin.

276
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,580
That means each apple

When the fruits are ripe,

279
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,780
we can put them into a box.

I don't know.

377
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,330
Anyway, Zhi said

378
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,580
that I'm part of her family.

379
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:36,970
Grandmother also said

380
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,330
that I was just born
into the wrong family

381
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,780
and that I was meant to be

382
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,900
her granddaughter.

383
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,290
Zhi.

384
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:51,770
What's the matter?

385
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,420
Do you know elephant chess?

386
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,420
Yes, I do.

387
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,660
I've learned how to play it.

388
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,970
That's impressive.

389
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,620
Shen Huan gave me this.

390
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,460
He wanted to thank me
for the medicine I gave him.

391
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,660
Zhi.

392
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,770
Play the game with me.

393
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,210
I need to finish this first.

394
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,490
You can go to Baoxia.

395
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,100
Baoxia.

396
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,010
Play elephant chess with me.

397
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,010
I don't know how.

398
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,420
I've heard this is quite difficult.

399
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,180
I can teach you.

400
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:19,900
Don't bother.

401
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,970
I...

402
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,290
I'm thirsty. I'll go drink some water.

403
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:24,900
Then I...

404
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,860
I'll find someone else to play.

405
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,210
Young Lady.

406
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,860
Fudong made a batch of honey cakes.

407
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,970
They have sweet osmanthus in them.

408
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,970
Please have a try.

409
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,290
How is it? Tasty?

410
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,660
It tastes good.

411
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,210
Send a box to Ms. Qin.

412
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,570
And send a box

413
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,530
to Shen Qi from Jujube Tree Alley
as well.

414
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,730
Send a few boxes

415
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,050
to the Security Bureau.

416
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,340
Them too?

417
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,380
We should send a few more.

418
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,660
Don't let just the leaders share them.

419
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:22,970
Their subordinates
should also have a taste.

420
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,490
We can afford it.

421
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,970
Alright then.

422
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,570
Then I'll call Baoxia to come along.

423
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,290
That place is too frightening.

424
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,340
Young Lady. Please eat more.

425
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,310
[Yuexiu Tavern]

426
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,180
Ms. Qin.

427
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,700
Lady Zhi asked me

428
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,570
to bring some things over.

429
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,290
Try this box of cakes
while they're still warm.

430
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,730
The money is for your daily expenses.

431
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,290
There are also some clothes.

432
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,100
Try them on later to see if they fit.

433
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,210
Is everyone okay

434
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,290
in the family?

435
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,770
They're doing well.

436
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,420
Does Qin still

437
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:05,970
cry a lot?

438
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:08,620
And...

439
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,620
And Boli.

440
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,250
You are not in our family now.

441
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,250
You should worry less

442
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,420
about those children.

443
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,730
Madam Qi and Madam Xia

444
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,620
will take care of everything.

445
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,180
Don't worry.

446
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:19,970
I'm leaving.

447
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,140
Take care of yourself.

448
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,810
What are you doing?

449
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,340
Is the pastry for us?

450
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,860
Lady Zhi told us

451
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,340
to bring you these.

452
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,570
You can have two, sir.

453
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,530
I have only seen people

454
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,210
throwing stones at our doorstep.

455
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,250
It's the first time

456
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,290
someone brought us pastry, huh?

457
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,340
What are you doing?

458
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:51,860
Baoxia.

459
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,100
Chen.

460
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,970
The Hua Family sent us some pastry.

461
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,530
I thought

462
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,290
it was something rare.

463
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,100
Then don't eat that.

464
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,620
I...

465
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,860
I am afraid it might be poisoned.

466
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,420
I would only poison you.

467
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,620
Why are you so annoying?

468
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,970
We put a lot of effort
into making these.

469
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,770
And you are just being rude.

470
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:09,810
I'm just kidding.

471
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:10,970
Come on.

472
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:11,810
Everybody has his share.

473
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,340
We can't turn down

474
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,010
Baoxia's kind gesture.

475
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,100
Everyone, come on.

476
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:19,900
Baoxia.

477
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,860
You're leaving?

478
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,570
I can show you around.

479
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,420
Come anytime.

480
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,770
Chen, why did you take two?

481
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,180
Little kid, you know nothing.

482
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,290
I take it for someone else.

483
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,490
Young Lady.

484
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,660
Here, have some tea.

485
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,420
Did you see any acquaintances

486
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,210
at the Security Bureau?

487
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,490
I did.

488
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,380
I saw that evil-looking big fool

489
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,380
that searched silver on our master

490
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,860
that day.

491
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,420
There's another one.

492
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,570
Round-faced, big fatty.

493
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,770
Young Lady.

494
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,010
Auntie Hua Jing is here again.

495
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,900
She has even brought her husband.

496
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,180
Hua Jing

497
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,290
really has some nerve.

498
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,660
Last time,
she yelled so loud in Madam Hua's room

499
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,290
that all of us could hear her.

500
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,570
And today,
she acted like nothing happened

501
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,290
and even brought that man to our house.

502
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,250
Last time,
Fudong refused to go with her.

503
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,460
She definitely won't give up.

504
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,770
I saw Zhi was already in there.

505
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,860
Zhi is still a young lady after all

506
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,050
and also a junior.

507
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,810
This might bewilder her.

508
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,100
Let's go.

509
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,100
Since she brought her man here,

510
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,380
as Madam Hua's daughters-in-law,

511
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,290
we should help entertain the guests.

512
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,530
You'd better not go.

513
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,570
It's bad for the baby if you get angry.

514
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,210
Go back and rest.

515
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,290
Zhi, it's good you're here.

516
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,770
I came here last time

517
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,420
because I wanted

518
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,140
to take in Fudong who serves you

519
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,570
as a concubine of our family.

520
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,140
You can decide for her today.

521
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,730
Let her come over right now

522
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,340
and have your uncle

523
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:12,970
take a good look.

524
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,340
A few days ago,

525
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,420
I caught a glimpse of her

526
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,620
at your shop.

527
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,570
There were many people,

528
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,290
so I didn't see very clearly.

529
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,180
Aunt,

530
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,010
Fudong is busy in the kitchen.

531
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,100
I'm afraid she can't come over here.

532
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,100
She's just a maid

533
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,010
and yet you treat her

534
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:32,810
like someone precious.

535
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,730
We even don't get to see her now?

536
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,100
It's nothing like that.

537
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,180
Fudong

538
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,700
was bought by my mother.

539
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,420
If you want to buy her,

540
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,380
I certainly cannot

541
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,530
do a money-losing business.

542
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,460
Let me do the calculation for you.

543
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,180
Just for this month,

544
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:48,970
Fudong made seven kinds of pastries.

545
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,010
With the cost
of materials and labor deducted,

546
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,490
she can earn about 15 guan every day.

547
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,570
By the end of the month,

548
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,970
it would be 450 guan.

549
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,900
And I didn't even count the pastry
she made before.

550
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,770
If you want to take her in, uncle,

551
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,620
at least,

552
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,660
you need to offer the amount
of her one-year earnings

553
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,770
as a betrothal gift.

554
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,290
Then we can talk.

555
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:09,970
How could you?

556
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,380
How can you treat this like a business?

557
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:12,620
Aren't you afraid

558
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,900
of ruining our family's reputation?

559
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,010
Jing, that's not right.

560
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,530
What reputation has been left

561
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,970
for our status now?

562
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,010
We just make a great fortune every day

563
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,340
with those shops.

564
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,620
We've got nothing else.

565
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,250
Be careful

566
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,530
when you come here.

567
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,250
Don't let us

568
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,530
ruin your reputation

569
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,140
and integrity.

570
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,620
Normally,

571
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,730
you're a blood relative
of the Hua Family,

572
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,100
so we shouldn't intervene

573
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,340
as daughters-in-law.

574
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,210
But something you said

575
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,180
was quite right.

576
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,570
We can't ruin

577
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,970
the Hua Family's reputation.

578
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:46,900
Let your niece's maid

579
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,490
become her uncle's concubine?

580
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,700
If this kind of thing gets out,

581
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,010
we will become
the laughingstock of Imperial Capital.

582
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,810
There's one thing you need to know.

583
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,900
Fudong is one of Zhi's maids,
that's correct.

584
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,340
But her indentured servitude
has already been burned,

585
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,530
so she is a free person now.

586
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,660
She can do whatever she wants.

587
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:04,970
Don't take it personally,

588
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,380
but she's under nobody's control.

589
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,900
You put on quite a show.

590
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,570
This is how they treat
the firstborn daughter of your father?

591
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,970
Chengzu.

592
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:22,730
Get lost.

593
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,290
Do you need a hand?

594
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:41,810
Mother.

595
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,810
See?

596
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,380
All of them

597
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,250
treat me so badly.

598
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,860
You...

599
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,420
You ruined my life.

600
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,860
Fine.

601
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,970
I can see now.

602
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:07,210
You're in charge

603
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,810
of the entire Hua Family

604
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,730
and everything
has to go through you, isn't it?

605
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,250
I don't even have a place

606
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,660
in this family, huh?

607
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,340
Fine.

608
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,970
I will leave.

609
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,660
I want to see

610
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,970
how long
you can still live such a well-off life.

611
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,290
A bunch of snobs.

612
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,860
Chengzu.

613
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,460
You can leave.

614
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,180
I'm tired.

615
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,530
Madam Hua, you're coughing up blood.

616
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,100
Don't tell them.

617
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,730
Zhi will get worried.

618
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,860
It's nothing.

619
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,010
It's nothing.

620
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:15,700
Sui'an.

621
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,460
How's your study going these days?

622
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,050
You didn't cause any trouble
for your aunts, right?

623
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,340
No, Mother.

624
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,860
Come on, let me take that.

625
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,180
Go see Madam Hua.

626
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,700
Why did you show up

627
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,530
all of a sudden?

628
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,660
And you brought so many things.

629
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,050
Go pack your things.

630
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,140
Jin'e, let's sit down first.

631
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,570
I heard

632
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,010
my mother has not
been in good health recently.

633
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,380
I can't leave the house as I want.

634
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,970
Take this money

635
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,140
and buy her some tonics for me.

636
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,100
You...

637
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,730
What are you doing?

638
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,900
I know

639
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:48,900
your life has been much better

640
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,490
these days.

641
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,180
But you are a bunch of women,

642
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,180
and running a family
needs a lot of money,

643
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,460
let alone you have to
raise those children.

644
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,900
Keep the money.

645
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,140
It's always a good thing
to have money in hand.

646
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,970
Don't turn me down,

647
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,620
okay?

648
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,970
How much private money can you have?

649
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,250
The dowry Madam Hua gave you

650
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,970
has all been taken by the Yang Family.

651
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,180
Besides,

652
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,140
you've been wearing this robe

653
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,490
for so many years,

654
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,210
not to mention
you don't have a decent piece of jewelry

655
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:13,860
on your head.

656
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,570
I won't take this money.

657
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,970
Take it back.

658
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,900
Anyway,

659
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,010
you should go meet Madam Hua

660
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,770
since you're already here.

661
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,420
It will give her peace of mind.

662
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,010
No.

663
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:23,530
I...

664
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:25,050
I cannot see my mother today.

665
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,700
Keep the money.

666
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,290
I will take you to her.

667
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,050
It...

668
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,180
That monster hit you again?

669
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,730
I'm fine.

670
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,250
I fell and got this bump

671
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,460
a couple of days ago.

672
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,050
If my mother were to see this,

673
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,250
it would break her heart.

674
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,700
Once I'm healed,

675
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:44,900
I'll go see her.

676
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,970
You're just too kind-hearted.

677
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,970
That's why people

678
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,900
walk all over you.

679
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,900
Here.

680
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,970
Aunt Xia, where did you get this?

681
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,290
It's from your Auntie Hua Xian.

682
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,290
Her life is tough,

683
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,010
but she still thinks of Madam Hua.

684
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,140
Aunt Xia,

685
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,380
please tell me

686
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,100
what exactly happened

687
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,050
to Auntie Hua Xian?

688
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,140
She was young with bad judgment

689
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,250
and married a monster.

690
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,620
Every time she comes back with bruises.

691
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:14,970
Her husband did that to her?

692
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,970
I'll go ask her.

693
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,180
Silly girl.

694
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,620
Don't go.

695
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,570
She cares about her reputation,

696
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,010
and Sui'an is her only child.

697
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,620
If this thing gets out.

698
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,620
how could Sui'an
continue his studies then?

699
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,770
She doesn't want to fight for herself.

700
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:32,100
It doesn't change a thing

701
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,460
for us to worry about her.

702
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,970
If you spill it for her,

703
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:36,660
that would only
make things harder for her.

704
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,970
Bolin.

705
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:41,620
Come here.

706
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,050
Zhi.

707
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,490
Aunt Xia.

708
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,530
Take this money.

709
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,730
You are acquainted with Sui'an,

710
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,010
and you know his size.

711
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:51,810
You go and buy him

712
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,010
some clothes and shoes.

713
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,970
Just say your mother made you these,

714
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:55,970
but they don't fit you,

715
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,700
so you gave them to him.

716
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:57,810
Understood.

717
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,660
Go.

718
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,420
Zhi.

719
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:03,490
I think

720
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,490
you do look like a lady in charge now.

721
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,620
Chunxing.

722
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,620
How dare you serve me rancid food?

723
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,180
Please forgive me, Madam.

724
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,810
The master has said
that in the next few days,

725
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,970
you should move out of the main house.

726
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,290
Ms. Chen is with a child now,

727
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,380
and she is waiting to move in.

728
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,490
Chunxing.

729
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,530
Chunxing.

730
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,700
Come here,

731
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,770
let me kiss you.

732
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,340
Master, you're so naughty.

733
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,570
All of them are nothing

734
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,140
but some self-serving snobs.

735
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,730
Did you upset Father again, Mother?

736
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,700
Hao,

737
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,180
can't you hear?

738
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,180
Now you're blaming me instead.

739
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,860
When the Hua Family

740
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,730
was still in the period of prosperity,

741
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,380
your father
was always compliant with me.

742
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,210
Now the Hua family has hit a downfall,

743
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,250
and look how bad and harsh

744
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,010
they treat me.

745
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,250
Now that wretched woman
is already pregnant

746
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,530
with your father's child.

747
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:57,700
When the time comes,

748
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,340
it's hard to tell

749
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,620
if you will inherit

750
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:01,770
your father's estate.

751
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,100
You can't keep my father.

752
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,460
Why take your anger out on me?

753
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,970
I'm the one that who would suffer

754
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,290
in the end anyway.

755
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,730
At the end of the day,

756
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,050
it's all Hua Zhi's fault.

757
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,100
If she had handed Fudong to me

758
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,490
and let your father get what he wanted,

759
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,380
how could I

760
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,140
end up so miserably?

761
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:27,660
Hua Zhi.

762
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,340
Let's wait and see.

763
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,570
Ms. Qin.

764
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,420
Mr. Yang.

765
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,050
You cried all night again, didn't you?

766
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,340
I have a box of scented powder.

767
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,100
Take it.

768
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,210
Cover up a little.

769
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,100
Your eyes are all swollen.

770
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,140
Mr. Yang.

771
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:55,570
This...

772
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,340
It's fine.

773
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,620
What are you doing here?

774
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,180
I...

775
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:35,730
Madam.

776
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,620
Say no more.

777
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,180
Get lost.

778
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,210
If I see you here again,

779
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,620
I will not let you off lightly.

780
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,340
Madam.

781
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,100
Go.

782
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,180
Ms. Qin.

783
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:08,700
Mr. Yang.

784
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,730
Mr. Yang.

785
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,250
My heart hurts so bad.

786
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,140
Perhaps this is my destiny.

787
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,700
I have a son and a daughter.

788
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,570
But now I don't even get to see them.

789
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,420
I have nothing left.

790
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:28,620
Ms. Qin.

791
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:31,340
Alcohol can always
make the sadness go away.

792
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,810
It's a bit cold today.

793
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,900
How about we have a few drinks together

794
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,140
to warm up the body?

795
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,140
Ms. Qin.

796
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,140
These dishes

797
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,340
are all made by my own hands.

798
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,380
I'm not sure if they suit your taste.

799
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,210
I am separated from my own children,

800
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,530
so even the most exotic delicacies

801
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,530
are tasteless to me.

802
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,810
You are the only one

803
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,010
who still cares about
if I feel like eating.

804
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,180
Ms. Qin.

805
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,490
You are still young.

806
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,250
You don't have to be so miserable.

807
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:23,380
Living a life this way,

808
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,380
there's no hope for the future.

809
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,970
Ms. Qin.

810
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,380
I don't think so.

811
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:35,860
I've heard

812
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,250
your indentured servitude
has been burned.

813
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,250
So,

814
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,900
if you are willing to marry again,

815
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,620
you can be my wife.

816
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:44,900
After we get married,

817
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,900
we can have our new kids.

818
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,260
I... I am leaving.

819
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,130
Ms. Qin.

820
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:51,780
Where are you going?

821
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,740
Isn't this your room?

822
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,860
I...

823
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:55,650
Ms. Qin.

824
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,170
I am all alone

825
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,130
in the Imperial Capital.

826
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,460
I feel lonely on my own.

827
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,050
We...

828
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,260
We are the same, all alone now.

829
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,460
No, no, I can't.

830
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,780
Ms. Qin, are you okay?

831
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:05,610
I...

832
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,460
Ms. Qin.

833
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,220
You can't do this.

834
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:07,900
You seem dizzy.

835
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:08,460
Stay away from me.

836
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,610
Let's lie down and rest.

837
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,170
Stay away from me.

838
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,050
Sir.

839
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,860
Stay away from me.

840
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,570
Ms. Qin.

841
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,860
You can't do this, sir.

842
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:14,780
You're drunk, so let me help you rest.

843
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,740
You can't do this, sir.

844
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,780
You can't do this.

845
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,340
Sir, please don't.

846
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,650
Please don't, sir.

847
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,490
Ms. Qin.

848
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,260
Ms. Qin.

849
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,900
How dare you!

850
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,610
You...

851
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:45,740
You...

852
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,130
Madam Hua Jing.

853
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,900
Please spare my life, Madam Hua Jing.

854
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,860
Do you realize

855
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,220
how serious adultery is?

856
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,010
Madam Hua Jing, please spare my life!

857
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,780
Madam Hua Jing.

858
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,220
Mr. Yang.

859
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,300
You are unbelievably

860
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,490
disrespectful

861
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,490
of the Hua Family now.

862
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,460
Madam Hua Jing, please spare my life.

863
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,300
Madam Hua Jing, please spare my life.

864
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,420
Madam Hua Jing.

865
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:09,090
Please spare my life!

866
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,740
Please don't tell anybody about this.

867
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,260
If Madam Xia finds out,

868
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:16,010
she will surely have me killed.

869
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,570
I'll be dead.

870
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,740
Madam Hua Jing.

871
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,610
I'm begging you, Madam Hua Jing.

872
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,010
Madam Hua Jing.

873
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,690
Madam Hua Jing.

874
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,420
Fine.

875
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,380
After all,

876
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,220
we are all members of the Hua family.

877
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,170
Now that this has happened,

878
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,130
I would save your life, of course.

879
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
If you want to live,

880
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,170
I do have a way.

881
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,120
[Hua Mansion]

882
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:17,610
You...

883
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
Why are you here again?

884
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,010
Mr. Zhong.

885
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,260
Um...

886
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,090
Is Madam Qi at home?

887
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,860
She left early...

888
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,650
She left early in the morning

889
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,090
and hasn't come back yet.

890
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,130
Where are you going?

891
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:34,570
You...

892
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,010
The stars are all spread out in the sky.

893
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,970
Winter goes and spring comes.

894
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,340
The universe is in its vast desolation.

895
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,650
Winter goes...

896
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,530
Boli.

897
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,780
Boli, let's have some pastry.

898
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,490
Come on.

899
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,170
Boli, eat first.

900
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,650
You can finish this later.

901
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,570
The stitches here are all crooked.

902
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:09,780
Make it straight.

903
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,260
Ms. Qin.

904
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,970
What brings you here?

905
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,220
Is Zhi in her room?

906
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:24,050
She went out early in the morning

907
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,740
to visit the apple orchards
on the West Mountain.

908
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:26,970
What's the matter?

909
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,530
I just got my monthly allowance

910
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,900
a few days ago.

911
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,050
And I bought her

912
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,010
some trinkets

913
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,420
as my thank-you gifts to her

914
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,300
for looking after me these days.

915
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,010
Ms. Qin, that's very nice of you.

916
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,090
Then give them to me.

917
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,130
I'll pass them on to her later.

918
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,490
It's my thanks to her,

919
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,780
so I hope

920
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,860
I can give these to her in person.

921
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:44,740
I don't know

922
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,050
when she will be back.

923
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,090
You can wait for her here

924
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,220
if you have nothing else to do.

925
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,530
If you need to go back to the shop,

926
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,260
then give it to me.

927
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,740
I'll definitely tell the Young Lady

928
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:52,860
this is from you.

929
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,170
Thank you.

930
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,010
I...

931
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,380
I will wait.

932
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:57,460
Alright.

933
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,220
Have a seat.

934
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:58,970
Don't bother.

935
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,650
Get back to what you were doing.

936
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,970
Please.

937
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:01,820
Okay.

938
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,340
Is this correct?

939
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:21,570
I must have eaten something bad
during the midday meal.

940
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,130
I want to go to the restroom.

941
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,130
Ms. Qin, if it's really bad,

942
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,820
you can go to the west wing.

943
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,740
It's too late.

944
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:30,090
My stomach hurts.

945
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,570
She can't go up to the west wing.

946
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,260
Madam Qi and Boli are there.

947
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,740
We can't let them see her.

948
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:35,740
Ms. Qin.

949
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,740
What about that way?

950
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,650
You can tell she can't hold it.

951
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,050
See how fast she runs.

952
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,420
Yeah.

953
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,780
Look at my newly embroidered
tiger-head shoes.

954
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,090
I wonder whether it's a girl or a boy

955
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,860
in Madam Wu's belly.

956
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,490
Zhi has been exhausted

957
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,900
for this family.

958
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,490
Ms. Qin has broken the rules,

959
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,010
so she can't stay here anymore.

960
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:50,220
Now I am the one in charge,

961
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,490
so I should make the call.

962
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:52,570
This Yuexiu Tavern

963
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,970
is now our major patron.

964
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:54,570
That shopkeeper

965
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,610
has asked me several times

966
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,650
for a smart helper.

967
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,090
I think Ms. Qin is just perfect.

968
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:08,610
Ms. Qin?

969
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,420
What are you doing

970
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,340
in the Young Lady's room?

971
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,740
I...

972
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,610
What are you hiding?

973
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,300
Nothing.

974
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,050
Let me have a look.

975
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,570
I don't, you...

976
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,420
You...

977
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:19,970
Someone!

978
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,220
We got a thief!

979
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,340
Someone!

980
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,300
We got a thief!

981
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,220
Someone is stealing from us.

982
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:25,460
Don't think about leaving.

983
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:26,820
Stop right there!

984
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,780
Someone!

985
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,340
Go!

986
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,220
What happened?

987
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:31,530
Young Lady.

988
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,090
You're finally back.

989
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,380
She's been

990
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,340
acting all sneaky.

991
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,530
She said
she wanted to go to the restroom,

992
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,170
but what she really wanted
was to steal things from your room.

993
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,570
And she stole this.

994
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,130
What did you steal it for?

995
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,220
Can you even wear it?

996
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:42,970
Ms. Qin.

997
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,050
Why did you steal this?

998
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,340
Zhi.

999
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:49,220
I'm so sorry.

1000
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,780
I'm so awful.

1001
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,860
Lady Zhi, what happened?

1002
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,170
Baoxia made a mistake. It's nothing.

1003
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,300
You can go now.

1004
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,010
Close the door behind you.

1005
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,490
Alright, I'm glad you're okay.

1006
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,780
We're just doing our job.

1007
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,050
Dismiss.

1008
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,820
Zhi.

1009
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,650
Why didn't you call them

1010
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,090
to report me to the authorities?
