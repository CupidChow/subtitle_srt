if you don't mind me overstepping,

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,280
I can easily make such

and cousin again.

32

But this isn't a situation
where you can strong-arm a solution.

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,310
My aunt must think it through

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,960
and make the decision herself.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,190

come home with their heads held high.

Tomorrow,
I'll visit the Yang Family again.

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
I'm going to persuade my aunt.

45
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,400

With such a precious guest at the door,

55
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,840
I should have gone out to greet you.

56
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,710
I ask for your forgiveness, Hua Zhi.

57
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,000
Uncle, you are too kind.

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
It's me
who should've visited more often.

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,630
I wonder how my aunt is.

60
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,120
Your timing is not so good.

61
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,280
Ever since my mother-in-law passed away,

62
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,360
my wife has been grieving deeply.

63
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,240
She isn't feeling well recently

64
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,680
and has been neglecting her appearance.

65
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,630
She really cannot receive visitors now.

66
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,870
I see.

67
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,800
I had no idea about that.

68
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,590
In this case, I should really see her!

69
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,400

70
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:30,910
please listen to me.

72
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,360
feels better,

I will send my people to fetch you.

74
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,150
You can see her then.

75
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,430
As an unmarried girl,

76
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,750
it's somewhat improper

77
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,960
for you to come out alone like this.

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,710
How about I send you home right now?

79
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,190
Thank you, Uncle.

80
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,710
It's just that I came today

81
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,910
on behalf of my mother and other aunts.

82
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,910
After my grandmother passed away,

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,360
our family had some disputes

84
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,800
with the Song Family.

85
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,710
I believe you have heard of that.

86
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,080
We know that my aunt is frail.

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,560
We're worried

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,470
that those rumors would make her
confused and upset,

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,870
causing her anxious.

90
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,960
Therefore, I was specifically sent here

91
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,590
to tell her the truth in detail

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,870
and give ease to her mind.

93
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,080
I see.

94
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,360
You can tell me instead.

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,280
It's the same thing.

96
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,030
How can I

97
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,750
say those words to you?

98
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,310
Uncle,

99
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,390
if I

100
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,480
don't see my aunt today,

101
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,680
I will surely face

102
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,870
the elders' reprimand when I get back.

103
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,870
They'll blame me

104
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,600
for not knowing how to talk properly.

105
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,480
And then, all of them

106
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,630
will come here together.

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,360
Won't that be troublesome?

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,950
So, Uncle,

109
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,040
please just let me see my aunt.

110
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,360
We are families.

111
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,270
I don't care

112
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,270
if she dresses up or not.

113
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,430
Alright.

114
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,120
Then come this way.

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,270
Thank you very much.

116
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,430
Open the door.

117
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,160

118
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,160

123
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,390
Alright.

124
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,160
Xian,

125
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,800
take good care of yourself

126
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,190
and don't talk too much.

127
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,950
Or you might get exhausted.

128
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,270
Yes, Qi.

130
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
Why trouble yourself to come here again?

131
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,160
Aunt.

132
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,040
You must come home with me today.

133
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,720
Not just today or tomorrow.

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,720
From now on, forever and ever,

135
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,040
you must never come back here.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,430
Aunt,

137
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,310
I have read the Daqing law.

138
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,560
I know how to get a mutual divorce.

139
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,120
As long as you want it,

140
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
you can have absolutely nothing
to do with that man

141
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,630
for the rest of your life.

142
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,680
Mutual divorce?

143
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,160
That...

144
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
How is that possible?

145
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,800

146
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,870
Mutual divorce is good.

147
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,830
Please get a mutual divorce!

148
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,390
I truly can't bear watching you

149
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,360
suffer like this anymore.

150
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,070
Silly child.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,040
If I left,

152
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,870
he would take his anger out on you.

153
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,270
Then I will go with you.

154
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,430
Isn't that okay?

155
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,270
How is that even possible?

156
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,630
You are the heir of the Yang Family!

157
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,750
Besides,

158
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,430
your future is more important.

159
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,040
Aunt.

160
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,240
You make Sui'an

161
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,720
witness your bitter life every day.

162
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,830
But he's your son.

163
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,040
He must have been
feeling so painful about it.

164
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,750
Also,

165
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,920
even if he stays here,

166
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,270
he will still suffer
from his father's temper.

167
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,000
You don't have to hide it from me.
I know everything.

168
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:52,510
I also know

169
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,870
that you are worried about his future.

170
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,630
The one who accused his own father

171
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
is not allowed to be nominated
for official positions.

172
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,240
But this is me stepping forward

173
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,920
to accuse him on behalf
of a married-off daughter of my family.

174
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,510
It has nothing to do with Sui'an.

175
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,510
Back home,

176
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,040
he can still attend our family academy

177
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,120
and take part in the imperial exams.

178
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,750
It won't affect his future.

179
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,630
Mother,

180
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,310
what Zhi said

181
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
is exactly what I thought.

182
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,630
Not to mention
it won't affect my future,

183
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,680
even if it will,

184
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,190
I am still more than willing to do that.

185
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,630
Mother,

186
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,270
just listen to Zhi.

187
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,390
It was all my fault.

188
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,360
Yang Qi is simply an animal.

189
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,270
How could I let

190
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,510
Zhi go by herself?

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,600
Maybe

192
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,070
I should go take a look.

193
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,160
No!

194
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,430
Even Zhi isn't coming back
from that place.

195
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,000
You're so weak.

196
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,270
How will you possibly
be able to get out?

197
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:45,920
I'll go.

198
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,560
Be careful!

199
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,040
Aunt.

200
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,120
Are you really worried about Sui'an,

201
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,800
or are you just scared to leave?

202
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,870
You heard

203
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,120
what Sui'an said.

204
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,160
Stop using him as an excuse.

205
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,160
Zhi,

206
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,750
you're right.

207
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,680
All these years,

208
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,070
I've been refusing to face the reality,

209
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,390
muddling along through my days.

210
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,240
I've been too cowardly.

211
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,160
I was just using Sui'an as an excuse.

212
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,310
I...

213
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,270
I should clear my mind now.

214
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,670
Even though my uncles and the others
are not at home,

215
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
the daughter of our Hua Family

216
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,240
still should not be bullied.

217
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,390
You have a home.

218
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,390
Let's go home.

219
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,270
Fear nothing.

220
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,320
I'll take care of everything.

221
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,600
Uncle,

222
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,030
why is this door locked?

223
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,360
My dear niece,

224
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,440
my wife is vexed with illness.

225
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,550
I have given it some thought

226
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,440
and decided
to have you stay for a while.

227
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,080
You can keep my wife and son company.

228
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,150
Uncle, you don't have to do this.

229
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,720
Even if you didn't ask,

230
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,240
I'll still stay to keep my aunt company.

231
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,360
Just unlock the door.

232
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,120
What if I don't?

233
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,080
Father!

234
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,240
You shut up!

235
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,840
Uncle,

236
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,030
I have told my family

237
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,030
that I would return at Shen hour.

238
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
If I don't go back,

239
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,550
my mother and the others
will get worried.

240
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,320
You don't have to worry about that.

241
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,550
I will take care of it.

242
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,910
Just stay inside

243
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,390
and have a good catch-up.

244
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,440
Uncle...

245
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,840
Alright, my dear niece.

246
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,320
Let's cut

247
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,000
to the chase.

248
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,670
You incited my son to betray his family

249
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,550
and tried to take my wife away.

250
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,000
I have heard all of that.

251
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,720
Why is it

252
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,510
that my family affairs

253
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,840
have come to be directed

254
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,720
by an outsider like you?

255
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,200
Then I shall accept your kind offer

256
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,550
and stay for a few days.

257
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,440
It's just that I am an outsider.

258
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,630
I will have to go home anyway.

259
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,150
Go home?

260
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,960
What a clever-tongued girl.

261
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,910
You and I both know

262
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,240
that as long as you're alive,

263
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,270
my family will have no peace.

264
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,870
You probably don't know about this yet.

265
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,030
The owner of the Yuexiu Tavern
in Guipi street,

266
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,720
Mr. Yang,

267
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,790
is actually my nephew.

268
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,000
You lured him into the Hua Family

269
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
and tied him up
in the woodshed ruthlessly.

270
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,510
I know all about it.

271
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,510
I really didn't want to make things
difficult for you.

272
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,630
But you brought it on yourself
by coming here.

273
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,630
So don't blame me

274
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,480
for using your methods

275
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,360
against you.

276
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,790
What are you going to do?

277
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,150
Miss Hua came here to visit her aunt.

278
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:42,750
She was going to stay here
for a few days,

279
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,840
but unexpectedly
fell into serious illness.

280
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
She never recovered

281
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,240
and soon died.

282
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,720
How pitiful!

283
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,750
How does that sound like?

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,390
Yang Qi.

285
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,960
Yang Qi!

286
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,270
I'm not leaving!

287
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm not going anywhere!

288
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,150
- Please let Zhi go!
- Xian.

289
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Please!

290
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,030
It's too late.

291
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,320
Father,

292
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,120
just let Zhi go!

293
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,390
I won't do it anymore!

294
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,080
Sir.

295
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,390
Huang.

296
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,510
Madam Xia from the Hua Family is here.

297
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,600
Also,

298
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,030
you've made a dinner appointment

299
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,080
with the master next door.

300
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,840
Now it's time to set off.

301
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll go and send her off first.

302
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,550
After dinner,

303
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,270
I will deal with them.

304
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,120
Let's go.

305
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,630
Yang Qi!

306
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,750
Yang Qi!

307
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,600
Jin'e,

308
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,120
how come you came back alone?

309
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,960
Where is Zhi?

310
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,790
My lips are all chapped from talking.

311
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,840
I was nice to him

312
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,630
and I tried to scare him.

313
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,480
But he just insisted

314
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,630
that Zhi suddenly got the pox.

315
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,910
He said she cannot see anyone

316
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,150
nor even take a carriage now,

317
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,910
so she won't be able to come home
until she's fully recovered.

318
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,390
My goodness!

319
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,750
What should we do now?

320
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,630
Everyone,

321
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
I've been thinking all this time.

322
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,790
I do have an idea.

323
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,750
Just tell us!

324
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,360
Back then,

325
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,630
when we lost our money,

326
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,120
Zhi sought help
from the Security Bureau.

327
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,120
Now,

328
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,600
if anyone can get them to help again,

329
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,360
perhaps...

330
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,790
Yes!

331
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,790
Evil people are afraid
of the eviler ones.

332
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,550
Yang Qi is evil indeed,

333
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,670
but the ones from the Security Bureau

334
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,910
are certainly eviler!

335
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,600
Let's go!

336
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,200
I'll go with you.

337
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,670
You should stay here!

338
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,630
You're about to have a baby!

339
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,080
Take care of yourself first.

340
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,030
It's fine.

341
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,080
I'll go by myself.

342
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,750
It's the Security Bureau, but so what?

343
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,000
At worst, I'll just get a beating.

344
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:19,790
No, Jin'e,

345
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,000
I will go with you.

346
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
We'll go together.

347
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,870
Alright,

348
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,600
let's go together.

349
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,870
Ms. Qin, you'll come too.

350
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,600
You're the best at talking.

351
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:25,870
Okay.

352
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,910
Ms. Qiu, take good care of Yu.

353
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:27,670
Let's go.

354
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,510
Let's go.

355
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,000
He's just an animal!

356
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,910
If I had listened to you last night

357
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,720
and left with you,

358
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,630
this wouldn't have happened.

359
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,080
Zhi, I'm sorry.

360
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,790
It was all my fault.

361
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,510
Sorry.

362
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:48,960
Sui'an,

363
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,200
what time is it now?

364
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,960
About three quarters past Shen hour.

365
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,390
Go get the brush, ink,
paper, and inkstone.

366
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,150
Okay.

367
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,670
Aunt,

368
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,390
I'll teach you
how to write a mutual divorce letter.

369
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,080
What's the point

370
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,080
of writing it now?

371
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,320
If he really tries to harm you,

372
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,000
there will be no need
for a mutual divorce.

373
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,550
I'll go to the tribunal

374
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,360
to sever ties with him.

375
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,200
It's good that you've made up your mind.

376
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,030
Write the mutual divorce letter first.

377
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,480
We'll make other plans later.

378
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,390
Okay.

379
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,240
Hua Zhi has not returned yet.

380
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,790
She probably ran into trouble.

381
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,270
I can't wait until dark.

382
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,670
I'll go now.

383
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:32,840
Mr. Yan!

384
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,000
Mr. Yan!

385
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,510
There's been trouble!

386
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,550
Miss Ling told me

387
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,840
that Miss Zhi has been detained
at Yang Mansion.

388
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,840
I'm going there right now.

389
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,150
You should go
to the Security Bureau first.

390
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,440
The madams had no ideas

391
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,670
other than going to the Security Bureau
for help!

392
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,520
[Imperial Government Office]

393
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,600
Let us in!

394
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,670
- Let us in.
- You're not allowed in!

395
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,080
No way!

396
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,750
We must save our families!

397
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,510
Hurry up and leave!

398
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:52,750
They have all been locked up!

399
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
Let us in!

400
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,000
Stop looking! Leave!

401
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,150
You can't go in!

402
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,670
Let us in!

403
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,030
Please let us in!

404
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,200
- Let us in!
- No way!

405
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,790
What's the matter?

406
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,270
I said you can't get in!

407
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:00,750
Sir,

408
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,150
they're here for help.

409
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,670
They said that Miss Hua's uncle

410
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,630
won't let her and the others go home.

411
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,150
I mean,

412
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,270
what kind of situation is this?

413
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
This is not the county government.

414
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,720
I told them

415
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,750
that the Security Bureau,

416
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,870
as the imperial security department,
can't help it

417
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,870
when even the county government
can't handle it.

418
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,550
But they acted
like they couldn't hear me

419
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,440
and continued to make that scene.

420
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,550
Make it stop.

421
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,200
If this continues,
there will be trouble.

422
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,030
We need to find a way
to make them leave.

423
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,270
Sir, we're begging you.

424
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:21,790
Let us in.

425
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,960
Please let us in.

426
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,600
Let us in.

427
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,390
Quiet!

428
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,480
Get up!

429
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,720
Please, let us in.

430
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:28,030
Let us in, please!

431
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:30,910
Madams,

432
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,080
how is it going?

433
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:32,910
Mr. Yan!

434
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:33,960
You're here too!

435
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,080
The Security Bureau

436
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,320
won't help us!

437
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,840
Since Mr. Yan is here,

438
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,150
he clearly values his friendship
with our family.

439
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,750
We've all been overwhelmed

440
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:41,750
that we even forgot

441
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,080
we do have a man in the family!

442
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,440
Zhi has been detained by Yang Qi!

443
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,150
He doesn't let her come home!

444
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:47,910
Rest assured, everyone.

445
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,790
I'll go there

446
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,670
and take a look right now.

447
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,910
You should all go home

448
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,000
and wait for my message.

449
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,630
Mr. Yan,

450
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,870
a word, please.

451
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,000
Come on!

452
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,390
Come on.

453
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,960
I, his sister-in-law, went there myself.

454
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,670
But Yang Qi still refused to let Zhi go.

455
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,600
Mr. Yan

456
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,720
is only our master of martial arts.

457
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,510
Unless he beats up

458
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,000
the entire Yang Family,

459
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,030
how will he

460
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
bring Zhi out of that place?

461
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,510
Intimidating him

462
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,670
with violence?

463
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,030
Yang Qi won't buy it.

464
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,270
Since he insists

465
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,480
that Zhi is unwell,

466
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,550
we have no reason

467
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,080
to forcibly
search through his house, do we?

468
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,480
Beating up the entire

469
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,270
Yang Family

470
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,550
doesn't sound like something...

471
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,630
Mr. Yan,

472
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,320
you're alone, while they're many.

473
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,440
You don't need to feel guilty.

474
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,000
But just now,

475
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,080
I suddenly had an idea.

476
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,360
Come here, look at him.

477
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,360
Look at his body shape.

478
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,000
The more I look at him,
the more I feel that he looks like

479
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:41,750
that man.

480
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:42,270
Which man?

481
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,550
Exactly!

482
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,080
Right?

483
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,000
He looks exactly

484
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,670
like the Rakshasa in a mask!

485
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,840
Don't say it out loud.

486
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,550
Seriously,

487
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,720
Madam Xia does have sharp eyes!

488
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,150
Look at his height

489
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,960
and his figure!

490
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:57,390
I...

491
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:57,910
Right!

492
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,600
That Rakshasa wears a mask anyway.

493
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,480
No one knows what he really looks like.

494
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,390
As long as Mr. Yan puts on the mask

495
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,390
and bring out that cold and fierce vibe,

496
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,670
it'll work for sure!

497
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,550
Right now,

498
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,870
that's the only way.

499

500
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,200

in the Yang Family,

505
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,670
I'm begging you!

506
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,670
I think...

507
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,510
Let's just do it!

508
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,630
Saving Zhi is important.

509
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,480
You don't need to be nervous.

510
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,030
Later,

511
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,790
I'll show you how to pretend to be him.

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:09,830
This is useless!

530

The Security Bureau received a tip-off,

557
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,440
claiming that criminals were suspected
to be around here.

558
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,030
I came to investigate.

559
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,070
That is a baseless accusation!

560
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,750

562
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,750
I have something to say.

563

There indeed is a criminal
in this mansion.

but you can't speak recklessly!

567
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,400
The Security Bureau only investigates
major matters.

568
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,000
You can't just say that
without evidence!

569
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,160
The criminal is him.

570
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,400
He imprisoned innocent people

571
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,160
and abused women and children.

572
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,830
These two can prove my words.

573
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,680
You wretched girl!

574
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,270
You're...

575
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,680
She's slandering me!

576
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,350
Please discern the truth, sir!

577
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,270
As for whether she's slandering you,

578
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,790
I'll know through interrogation.

579
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:09,920
You,

580
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,110
come with me.

581
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,640
Right,

582
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,830
let's go to the Security Bureau

583
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,550
and make everything clear!

584
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,110
Sir,

585
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,750
I am wrongfully accused!

586
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,400
I am...

587
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,550
Sir,

588
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,830
maybe I should go

589
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,000
to the Security Bureau

590
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,550
with you.

591
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,200
This is my first time seeing someone

592
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,510
so eager to go to the Security Bureau.

593
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,070
Let's hurry.

594
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,960
It's already getting dark.

595
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,200
We are all women.

596
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,790
It's not proper for us
to stay at your residence.

597
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,510
Let's leave.

598
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,480
- Yes.
- Let's go.

599
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,510
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

600
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
Hurry up.

601
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,310
Hurry up.

602
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,110
Hold on!

603
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:22,830
Sir,

604
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,830
could you please do me the honor

605
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,680
and show me

606
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,270
your badge of the Security Bureau?

607
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
You want to see the badge?

608
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,480
Who are you to make that requirement?

609
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,000
Yang Qi.

610
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,270
Earlier, our family was raided

611
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,440
and hundreds were taken.

612
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,400
But we never saw

613
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,720
the badge of the Security Bureau.

614
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,590
Why must you

615
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,400
offend this commander here?

616
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,830
The people from the Security Bureau

617
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,240
are known for being ruthless.

618
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,960
Sir,

619
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,960
my brother-in-law

620
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:51,960
is not very good with words.

621
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,270
Please be generous.

622
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,750
Just forgive him.

623
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,590
Let's leave.

624
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,240
Let's leave.

625
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,200
You're right.

626
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,720
Forgive my indiscretion.

627
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,680
I apologize to you.

628
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,160
Come here.

629
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,640
I've thought over and over

630
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,590
and still feel
that was truly a risky move.

631
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,750
I really shouldn't have let them

632
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,720
take this risk.

633
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
What if they got exposed?

634
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,480
Pretending to be someone
from the Security Bureau

635
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,270
is a grave sin!

636
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,000
Be careful.

637
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:45,920
Madam Wu!

638
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,640
Madam Wu!

639
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,590
Did they come back?

640
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,270
Madam Wu!

641
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,590
A servant from the Yang Family
has reported to the authorities!

642
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,720
Report?

643
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,480
For what?

644
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,440
They said

645
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:53,960
someone

646
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,790
bold as brass went to their home,

647
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,160
pretending to be a man
from the Security Bureau!

648
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,350
Madam Wu!

649
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,680
Madam Wu!

650
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,920
You, you two!

651
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,680
Hold her tight!

652
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,400
I'll be back soon!

653
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,550
Where are you going, Baoxia?

654
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,310
Madam Wu!

655
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,440
- Madam Wu! Be careful!
- Madam Wu!

656
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,110
Sir,

657
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,550
from what I have heard,

658
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,440
when the Security Bureau
investigates a case,

659
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,590
they always send out
a huge group of people,

660
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,960
coming and going abruptly
with impressive momentum.

661
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,510
Why

662
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,830
did you come alone

663
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,160
so late at night?

664
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,830
I advise you not to ask.

665
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,160
Yang Qi,

666
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,400
you'd better shut up.

667
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,720
Is this something you can ask about?

668
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,830
Zhi, Xian,

669
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,440
let's go.

670
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,030
Let's go.

671
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,480
Let's go.

672
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,640
Close all the doors!

673
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,480
None of you are allowed to leave!

674
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,960
You!

675
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,070
Maybe something is wrong with my eyes.

676
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,590
But why is this mask peeling?

677
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,920
I'm sorry.

678
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,070
This mask

679
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,750
is newly made by your bureau,
isn't it?

680
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,110
I've seen many
who don't cherish their lives.

681
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,310
But someone like your uncle

682
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,240
is new to me.

683
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,440
You even know that I am her uncle?

684
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,720
The Security Bureau

685
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,750
really pays attention to every detail.

686
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
That is indeed

687
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,400
the working style of
the Security Bureau.

688
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,240
They're finally here!

689
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,400
Who dares to impersonate

690
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,110
the Commander of the Security Bureau?

691
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:53,880
Sir,

692
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,480
it's him.

693
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,070
And these unruly subjects

694
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:57,960
are all accomplices!

695
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,200
[Yang Mansion]

696
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,880
Saving a life is more meritorious
than building a seven-story pagoda.

697
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,880
I can tell that you are not

698
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,510
a cruel and ungrateful wretch

699
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,550
with a stoney heart.

700
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,590
Please help!

701
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm begging you!

702
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,550
Wait, wait a moment!

703
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,110
You need to be specific.

704
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,270
How should I help you?

705
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,270
When you see that tall one inside,

706
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,440
the official wearing a mask,

707
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,400
just give him a bow

708
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,240
and call him the Commander.

709
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:16,720
And that will be it.

710
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,830
You even found someone
to impersonate the Commander?

711
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,590
Does Mr. Yan know about this?

712
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,240
Of course!

713
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,030
No, no, please.

714
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,920
Please spare me.

715
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,920
If our Commander knows

716
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,350
that I'm out here

717
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,350
calling someone else that,

718
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,550
my life would be over!

719
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,440
You!

720
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,920
You Security Bureau people
have eaten so many

721
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,590
of our pastries!

722
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,270
I'm only asking you for a tiny favor.

723
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:36,830
How can you say no!

724
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,160
Hurry up!

725
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,350
No, it wasn't me! I didn't eat anything!

726
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,440
Zheng Hu ate them!

727
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,640
I hardly had a piece!

728
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,270
You're here already! Just do it!

729
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,920
I don't want to!

730
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,510
Young Lady.

731
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,510
Madams!

732
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,310
Young Lady!

733
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,240
Hurry up!

734
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,240
Young Lady, Madams,

735
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,510
I've brought the inspector

736
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,270
from the Security Bureau!

737
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,400
Inspector?

738
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:00,920
Here comes another fake.

739
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,640
Hold your tongue!

740
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:03,960
Watch your language.

741
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,000
Mr. Chen,

742
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,110
you've arrived just in time.

743
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,000
This person before you

744
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,350
is the Commander's

745
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,160
right-hand man.

746
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,480
Mr. Chen,

747
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,920
how come you have the time to come here?

748
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,030
Sorry for being rude.

749
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,240
Please forgive me!

750
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,030
You see,

751
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,110
this person here

752
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,400
pretended to be your Commander

753
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,750
and tried to search my house!

754
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,000
Chen Qing,

755
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,550
you're awfully late.

756
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,550
I'm so sorry, Commander!

757
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,350
He's trying really hard.

758
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,640
I was being stupid.

759
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,200
Please forgive me, Commander!

760
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,640
She wants to report,

761
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,160
and these two are witnesses.

762
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,030
Take them all with us.

763
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,110
Yes.

764
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,160
Sir.

765
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,030
Sir!

766
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,350
You can't believe him!

767
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,550
His clothe

768
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,480
has holes on it.

769
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,440
And his mask

770
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,350
is even peeling its paint!

771
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,960
How can he possibly be
from the Security Bureau?

772
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:10,830
Shut up!

773
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,270
Mr. Chen here

774
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,830
is an authentic Security Bureau Guard

775
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,550
who patrols the streets
with us every day.

776
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,550
The Commander is his superior.

777
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,640
If even he
doesn't recognize his commander,

778
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,830
who does? You?

779
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:21,960
Mr. Chen,

780
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,550
this troublemaker is so reckless

781
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,160
that he even troubled the Commander
to come here in person.

782
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,510
In my humble opinion,

783
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,640
he should be caned twenty times.

784
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:29,830
No,

785
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,030
thirty times!

786
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,350
Eh...

787
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,830
What do I always say to you?

788
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,720
I've told you
to patrol the streets carefully.

789
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,960
How can you take rumors for truth?

790
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,070
I was truly right about him.

791
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,200
Commander,

792
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
I'll take care of things here.

793
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,640
Sorry for the trouble.

794
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,920
You should get some rest.

795
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,440
Let's go.

796
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,440
Hurry up, move.

797
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,400
Have a safe journey home, Commander!

798
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,160
Yang Qi,

799
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,200
I've already written
a mutual divorce letter.

800
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,550
Take a look for yourself!

801
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,240
From now on,

802
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,440
I have absolutely nothing
to do with you.

803
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,310
How dare you!

804
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,550
Shut up!

805
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:09,480
Guards,

806
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,640
beat him!

807
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,000
You can't beat me! What did I do?

808
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,400
Sir!

809
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,920
Please don't do this!

810
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,160
There's truly nothing

811
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,880
you can't accomplish.

812
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,720
Thank you, Commander,

813
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,640
for holding justice and being kind.

814
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,510
Mr. Yan was really

815
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,720
calm and collected.

816
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,680
Just now I was so scared

817
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,030
that my legs even went powerless.

818
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,310
Baoxia is so smart.

819
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,790
She really had the courage

820
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,590
to drag that inspector over!

821
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,310
Seriously,

822
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,440
our family is destined to survive!

823
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,720
I can't believe

824
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,350
that Mr. Chen really covered up for us!

825
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,440
If it wasn't for him,
we would have been in huge trouble.

826
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,310
To be honest,

827
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,240
I was also really scared.

828
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,790
Fortunately, he's a good person.

829
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,240
Right?

830
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,070
Baoxia.

831
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,920
Tell us the truth.

832
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,160
Does Chen Qing

833
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,510
have feelings for you?

834
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,240
Otherwise, how could he be willing

835
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,310
to make such a huge lie?

836
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,640
I don't think so.

837
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,920
That Commander was a fake?

838
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,750
He's our master of martial arts.

839
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,030
Zhi

840
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,200
really needs to give Mr. Yan a raise!

841
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,160
He's worth it.

842
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
Stop talking!

843
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,750
Let's talk about it when we get home!

844
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,550
Come on,

845
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,070
get on the carriage.

846
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,680
Hurry up, Madam.

847
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,550
Get in!

848
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,000
Yingzhen,

849
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,070
let's take them to get settled first.

850
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,720
Get in.

851
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,640
Come on, Xian.

852
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,790
Be careful.

853
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,400
I need to go back to the Bureau tonight.

854
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,830
I'll come to you tomorrow.

855
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,310
See you tomorrow then.

856
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:49,640
Zhi,

857
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
come here.

858
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,400
About tonight,

859
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,550
tell me

860
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,880
what exactly was going on.

861
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,110
What do you mean?

862
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,110
I feel something's not quite right.

863
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,070
Have you thoroughly investigated

864
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,480
Mr. Yan's background?

865
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,240
The confidence he showed tonight

866
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,480
isn't something

867
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,400
he can fake on the spot.

868
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,200
Aunt Xia, you're so smart
that nothing can be kept from you.

869
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,720
But don't worry.

870
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,200
Mr. Yan is a good man.

871
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,590
About this,

872
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,680
don't tell the others for now.

873
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,680
Still keeping the secret from me?

874
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,880
Alright, don't worry.

875
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,550
I trust you.

876
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,160
He's not some family's young master

877
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,200
running away from home, is he?

878
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,000
Help!

879
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,480
Madam Wu is in danger!

880
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,720
Madam, push! Push hard!

881
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,160
This won't do.

882
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,240
If you go on like this,

883
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
let alone the child,

884
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,110
even you can't bear it either!

885
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,480
Push! Push hard!

886
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,720
You're finally here!

887
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,510
What's going on?

888
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,550
Young Lady, you're finally here!

889
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,070
Upon hearing that
the Yang Family reported us,

890
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,030
Madam Wu was so frightened
that she even started bleeding.

891
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,880
Yinzhu fetched the midwife.

892
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,830
But the midwife said

893
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,750
that Madam Wu had distress
in her pregnancy

894
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,110
and she isn't very good now.

895
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,640
Then what are we waiting for?

896
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
Those things we prepared earlier

897
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:07,790
for inducing labor

898
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,880
and for safety,

899
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,270
just bring them here!

900
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:10,750
Right!

901
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,720
Silver basin, millet straws,
undyed cloths,

902
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,750
and Motherwort buns to ease the pain!

903
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,480
Everything is ready!

904
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,240
Just go and get them!

905
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,070
Right!

906
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:17,640
Right!

907
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,590
And the things on the altar
to induce birth!

908
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,440
With those, everything will be fine.

909
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,000
Zhi,

910
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,270
you should wait in your room.

911
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,110
I need to see her.

912
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,510
Where are you going?

913
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,510
- You can't get in!
- That's right.

914
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,720
You're not married yet.

915
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,960
How can you enter the birthing room?

916
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,270
It could bring misfortune!

917
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,240
Aunt Wu got scared to this state

918
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,110
because of me.

919
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,200
Uncle Pingyang is not here.

920
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,270
Are we going to leave her in there
alone?

921
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,720
It's not like you can do anything
to help in there.

922
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,720
This is for Yu's good,

923
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,790
and for your own good too.

924
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,640
How come a woman giving birth

925
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,590
would bring misfortune?

926
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,350
I'll go see her.

927
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,070
You can't...

928
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,590
Zhi!

929
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,720
Madam, this won't work!

930
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,070
Aunt Wu!

931
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,830
Madam, push hard!

932
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:56,750
If you don't try harder,
let alone the child...

933
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,030
Aunt Wu!

934
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,480
even your own life will be in danger!

935
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,310
Hold my hand, Aunt Wu.

936
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,310
Zhi, I'm afraid

937
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,000
that I won't make it.

938
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,400
What are you talking about?

939
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,480
Even our hardest days

940
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,200
are behind us now.

941
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,440
Uncle Pingyang hasn't returned yet.

942
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,510
We are still waiting for him
to come home!

943
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,720
Zhi,

944
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,030
listen to me.

945
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,640
I'm here.

946
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,440
I'm listening.

947
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,350
Go ahead.

948
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,510
Someday,

949
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,590
if you see Pingyang,

950
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,750
tell him

951
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,830
that ever since I met him,

952
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,030
every day

953
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,400
was a happy day.

954
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,440
Being his wife

955
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,830
is the best thing ever happened to me.

956
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,440
When I'm gone,

957
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,160
I want him to stay healthy and safe
without me.

958
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,270
Aunt Wu, don't say that.

959
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,550
You need to be with us.

960
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,640
You have to be here for the baby

961
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,510
for the rest of your life!

962
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,310
I'm not going anywhere.

963
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,960
May heaven

964
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,550
bless Yuniang.

965
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,550
She's so young.

966
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,920
It's her first time to give birth.

967
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,880
May she and her child be safe and sound.

968
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,310
Heaven bless.

969
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,000
Heaven bless.

970
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,920
Hang in there!

971
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,270
Aunt Wu.

972
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,920
Aunt Wu.

973
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,070
Madam.

974
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,240
Madam, hang in there.

975
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,920
Madam, push hard.

976
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,790
Hang in there.

977
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,440
Madam.

978
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:31,720
Madam.

979
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,590
Madam, hold on.

980
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,160
Zhi,

981
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
I feel so cold.

982
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:39,640
Aunt Wu,

983
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,310
when Uncle Pingyang comes home,

984
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,350
he will surely be a good father.

985
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:44,960
Then together,

986
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,070
you'll watch this baby grow up.

987
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:47,920
You'll teach him to read

988
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,110
and play with him.

989
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,160
When the weather gets warm,

990
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,550
we will

991
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,440
take him to fly a kite together.

992
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:53,960
How does that sound like?

993
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,240
Aunt Wu,

994
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,030
now it's all up to you.

995
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,640
I'm here for you.

996
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,590
Can you push a little harder, please?

997
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,030
Madam!

998
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,110
Madam!

999
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:07,830
Hang in there!

1000
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,480
Hang in there.

1001
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,110
Madam!

1002
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,350
Madam.

1003
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,510
Madam, you must not give up.

1004
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,110
Madam,

1005
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,000
push hard!

1006
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,550
I'm going to invite your mother over
right now.

1007
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,000
No matter what happens,

1008
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,880
I will bring your mother here.

1009
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,240
Wait for me.

1010
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,030
Let's get inside!

1011
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,720
Let's go!

1012
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,200
Aunt Qi, Aunt Xia...

1013
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:30,920
Yu!

1014
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:32,960
Mother.

1015
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:34,960
Your mother is here.

1016
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,400
Mother.

1017
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:39,790
She's here.

1018
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,880
We are all here.

1019
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,270
Yu,

1020
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,680
you must hang in there.

1021
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,480
When this is over,

1022
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,400
I will make you something delicious.

1023
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,920
Yes, Yuniang,

1024
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,510
we have prepared everything for you.

1025
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Ergui

1026
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,440
drew a fortune stick for you.

1027
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,640
It says both you and the baby
will be safe.

1028
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,960
Don't worry.

1029
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,030
Yes, yes!

1030
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,680
Today is an auspicious day.

1031
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,000
Yu,

1032
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,790
listen to me.

1033
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,550
When I gave birth to Zhi,

1034
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,550
I almost stopped breathing

1035
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,150
just like you.

1036
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,550
I was in pain for three days,

1037
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,000
wishing I could die instead.

1038
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,070
But look at me.

1039
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:16,960
Now

1040
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,880
I am safe and sound.

1041
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,190
And

1042
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,510
Zhi has grown up.

1043
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,070
Just hang in there!

1044
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,230
Yu,

1045
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,230
please don't give up.

1046
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,360
Madam, push!

1047
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,070
Push, Madam!

1048
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,800
Hang in there.

1049
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,710
Madam.

1050
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:31,800
Madam.

1051
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,110
Madam, you must hang in there!

1052
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:33,800
Madam,

1053
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,760
push hard!

1054
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,760
Push!

1055
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,110
Push, Madam!

1056
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,190
Push!

1057
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,880
Harder, harder!

1058
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:41,800
Harder!

1059
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,880
Push harder!

1060
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,510
The baby is coming out!

1061
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,190
- The baby is born!
- The baby is born!

1062
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,550
The baby is born.

1063
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,880
That is wonderful!

1064
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,480
Finally!

1065
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,110
Amazing!

1066
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,510
Madam,
you have gained a precious daughter.

1067
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,760
A girl is good.

1068
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,800
A girl is good.

1069
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,510
Come on, let's meet her.

1070
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:11,710
Look at this little face.

1071
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,590
Look at these eyebrows and eyes.

1072
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,670
She looks

1073
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,030
so much like Yuniang.

1074
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,800
The baby is so small

1075
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,440
that her face is still wrinkled.

1076
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,230
How can you tell whom she looks like?

1077
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,550
Aunt Wu is truly amazing.

1078
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,150
So tired.

1079
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,960
Are you silly?

1080
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,960
I've dug up more earthworms
than you have.

1081
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,400
This one is mine.

1082
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,280
Thank you.

1083
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,400
Can't believe I was called silly
by a little silly girl.

1084
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,510
What are you saying?

1085
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,630
I didn't say anything.

1086
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,710
You didn't?

1087
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,440
Then please take it seriously.

1088
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,550
Get more earthworms for me, alright?

1089
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:21,920
Okay.

1090
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,550
But can you tell me

1091
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,550
why do you want so many earthworms?

1092
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,000
Zhi said

1093
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,280
that before Yu had her baby,

1094
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,150
she got frightened.

1095
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,150
That might cause some
lingering ailments.

1096
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,190
These earthworms

1097
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,000
are also called "earth-dragons"

1098
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,190
and specifically used to treat seizures.

1099
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,190
Earlier, when Yu had the baby,

1100
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,280
I couldn't help much.

1101
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,320
Now I have to pay attention
when preparing this medicine.

1102
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,480
You know quite a lot.

1103
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,840
So, did you say

1104
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,360
that even worms can be used as medicine?

1105
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,000
Of course.

1106
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,190
There's a lot
that can be used for medicine.

1107
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:48,920
For example,

1108
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
toads dried in the sun.

1109
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,110
I've been looking forever

1110
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:53,760
but couldn't find any dried toads.

1111
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,360
It's not so easy to buy them.

1112
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,670
That's no big deal.

1113
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,920
You just want a toad, right?

1114
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,230
I'll get you one.

1115
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,800
[I'll bring you something tasty
at Hai hour.]

1116
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,070
I'll bring you something tasty
at Hai hour.

1117
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,760
At this time of the year,

1118
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,030
why have you brought ice?

1119
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,630
This is called Milk Sugar Snow.

1120
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:36,920
Is it tasty?

1121
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,480
It's not particularly sweet.

1122
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,320
Try some.

1123
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,000
Just eat it.

1124
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,320
It will melt soon.

1125
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,440
Yanxi,

1126
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,760
I used to say I don't believe in fate.

1127
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,670
But the situation with Aunt Wu yesterday

1128
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,480
was so critical.

1129
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,920
At that time,

1130
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,230
I really was out of ideas.

1131
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,590
I was just thinking

1132
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,880
Uncle Pingyang and Aunt Wu

1133
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,880
are both good people

1134

who have never done anything bad.

1135
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,400
They surely won't be facing

1136
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
such a catastrophe.

1137
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,760
I believe

1138
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,800
there is karma in the unseen.

1139
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,320
Both goodness and evilness
will be repaid.

1140
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,110
It's just we can't sense it normally.

1141
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,030
It only becomes clear
at times of crisis.

1142
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,710
If Madam Wu

1143
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,000
has been harsh to you and the others,

1144
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,710
would you still stay by her side

1145
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,760
and protect her like yesterday?

1146
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
So this karma

1147
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,510
is not actually in the hands
of the heavens.

1148
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,840
It's still about people.

1149

Yes.

Your Highness,

1151
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:48,550
someone from the Palace has arrived.

1152
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,710
Who is it?

1153
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,480
It is Changqing the eunuch.

1154
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,630
Your Highness.

1155
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,110
Greetings, Your Highness.

1156
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,280
Those pastries from last time,

1157
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,360
did you enjoy them, Your Highness?

1158
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,000
I have brought some more for you.

1159
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,510
Weren't those pastries

1160
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,110
from Yanxi?

1161
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,880
Perhaps the eunuch from the Palace

1162
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,710
didn't make it clear,

1163
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,840
which led you to misunderstand.

1164
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,440
They were a gift from His Majesty.

1165
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,320
His Majesty hasn't seen you
for a long time

1166
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,110
and has been missing you.

1167
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,510
So I came here to check on you.

1168
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,710
Seeing that you are well,

1169
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,360
I can now go back
to report to His Majesty.

1170

Did you find anything?

00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,320
I found out

the eunuch named Qingxiang

1186
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,070
abruptly fell ill and died yesterday.

1187
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:53,800

that he accidentally
ate something poisonous.
