25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,440
Madam Xia.

26
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,520
I hear you cough a lot

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,320
at night.

28
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,480
Ms. Su is a little deaf.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,080
I will sleep here for a few days

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,640
so I can take care of you.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,880
Madam Hua.

32
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,160
Do you know about
what the yard outside is like now?

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Zhi made such a mess

34
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
that there's almost no room

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,720
for us to stand.

36
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,880
Ms. Qin

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,960
slipped on a fruit a few days ago

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,760
and she almost hurt her buttock.

39
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,480
Ms. Qin

40
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,280
is always in a flurry.

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,880
I'm not here

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,880
to bad mouth Zhi.

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,600
We've been busy for days

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,120
as busy as a bee.

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,000
But

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Zhi keeps spending our money

47
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
and there's nothing in return yet.

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,280
If she keeps going like this,

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,960
I'm afraid our money
will be gone completely to waste.

50
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,760
Tell you what.

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,040
I know what she's up to.

52
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,520
I used to be a merchant too.

53
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,400
I know best
how hard is it to be a merchant.

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,040
She's selling fresh food.

55
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
But in the Imperial Capital,

56
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,760
The members of the royal family,

57
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,120
or the common folk.

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,600
They have seen and tasted
every sort of food.

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,200
People can't be impressed

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,920
by her mediocre food.

61
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,360
Let's see.

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
We don't have a signboard,

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
and let alone a proper shop.

64
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,720
Besides,

65
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,360
this is a word-of-mouth market.

66
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
So how can we pull this off?

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,200
Don't you agree?

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,440

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,000

She fell into sleep.

71
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,120
Any adjustment?

72
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,240
Young Lady,

73
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,560
the recipe will definitely work.

74
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,080
But

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,960
who are we supposed

76
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,200
to bring these all the way to downtown?

77
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,560
They will become sticky

78
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,520
after a while.

79
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,720
I traveled with my Grandfather
back then,

80
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,760
and one time we passed
by the Jiuyi Region.

81
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,320
The people there cut their hair short
and got tattoos on them,

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
they sat around to eat and drink.

83
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,400
And they didn't have chopsticks.

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,280
They all used bamboo sticks
to skewer the food,

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,240
and roasted it over the fire.

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,280
It was very handy.

87
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,680
We have nothing

88
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
but bamboo in this manor.

89
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,760
This can work.

90
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,720
It looks nice this way.

91
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,840
Like a coral beaded bracelet.

92
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,600
Fudong,

93
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
Get a name for it.

94
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,800
I...

95
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,080
I am naming it?

96
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,560
Since it's the food you made,

97
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,600
of course you should name it.

98
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,480
Madam Wu said it resembles
a coral beaded bracelet,

99
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,120
but I've never seen one.

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,400
When I was a kid,

101
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,520
I loved to play with marbles.

102
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,440
They were red and round, just like this.

103
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,360
How about

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,960
we name it honey marble?

105
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:07,920
Great.

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,960
Let's make a few dozen first tomorrow,

107
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,360
and see if people like them in downtown.

108
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,040
We're going to sell them?

109
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,440
Young Lady, hawking in the streets

110
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,440
is quite embarrassing.

111
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,560
You can deduct my monthly pay.

112
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,720
Yingchun and Fudong, are you going?

113
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,320
Young Lady.

114
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,320
I will do everything you ask

115
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,200
no matter how dirty or tiring it is.

116
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,520
I never say no.

117
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,720
But hawking in the streets,

118
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,440
I really...

119
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,320
Now I know.

120
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,000
Animal lanterns?

121
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,120
I can make them.

122
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,440
But if we are selling,

123
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,920
we can't beat

124
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,440
Feng's Lantern Shop

125
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,360
and Liao's Lantern Shop.

126
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,240
It doesn't matter.

127
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,240
We're not selling them.

128
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,720
Alright then.

129
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,640
Mr. Zhong.

130
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,640
make the lanterns

131
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,920
based on these drawings.

132
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,480
These are animal lanterns.

133
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,480
But

134
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,080
no special festival is on the way.

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,760
What do you use the lanterns for?

136
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,520
Young Lady.

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
Will people really buy honey marbles?

138
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,360
Of course they will.

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm already thinking

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
about the price of each string.

141
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,360
It was not easy for Fudong

142
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,120
to make a whole pot of these.

143
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,520
Madam Xia.

144
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,960
Miss Zhi.

145
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,080
Usually,

146
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
I won't be a buzzkill

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,840
seeing you all talking happily together.

148
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,280
It's just that

149
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,720
I still have to say something

150
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
that you might not want to hear.

151
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,320
These hawthorn fruits

152
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,240
should taste quite good.

153
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,640
But we're in the middle of nowhere,

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
we can barely ever see a soul all day.

155
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,200
Even if these fruits are good,

156
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,400
who are you gonna sell them to?

157
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,760
I wanna know

158
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,880
do you have a proper shop
that can greet customers,

159
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,040
or you have some connections
to sell them to?

160
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
Madam Xia is always so thoughtful.

161
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,760
So please enlighten me.

162
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,680
Do you have a plan?

163
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,640
I don' know what to do.

164
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,640
But I do know

165
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,680
you can't set up a stall
on the street like the last time

166
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,480
when you were selling
Spring Festival couplets.

167
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,320
That's exactly

168
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,000
what I have

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,280
in my mind.

170
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
Look at that arrogance.

171
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
She talked in a different tone

172
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
since she took charge of the family,

173
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,920
I don't have any shops

174
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,800
or connections.

175
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,000
That's why in the past few days,

176
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,240
I went to the city
first thing in the morning.

177
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,360
I observed very carefully

178
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,320
to see the food traffic,

179
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,360
and where would people
like to spend their money at?

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
So what is your conclusion?

181
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,280
Tomorrow is our

182
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,440
first day of opening.

183
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,280
We must be there
right at the gate of the Academy

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,360
when the school is over.

185
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,160
We're a sinful family after all,

186
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,400
so we'd better act in a low-profile way.

187
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,520
So,

188
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,000
We can use this flower

189
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,640
as our sign.

190
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,800
Pair up in two.

191
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,800
Who is with me?

192
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,040
Miss Zhi, you're joking, right?

193
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,720
We are a decent and educated family.

194
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,120
Let alone Ling
and the other younger kids.

195
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,280
Even a maid

196
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,000
doesn't want to lose her dignity.

197
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Hawking in the streets?

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,960
What would people think of us?

199
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,760
No noble man will marry a hawker girl.

200
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,000
Madam Xia,

201
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,360
we're on the same page here.

202
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,640
Yingchun, Baoxia.

203
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
We will be wearing the lanterns
on our heads

204
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,120
to conceal one's face.

205
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,400
That could draw less attention.

206
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,040
It's just two people in animal headwears

207
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,680
selling the haws.

208
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,240
Who would know who we are?

209
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,480
Keep your distance.

210
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
I did.

211
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,280
Do you think this will work out?

212
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,720
Go, hurry up.

213
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
I don't know.

214
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,480
Time to go home.

215
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,400
The kids are coming.

216
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:34,920
Go.

217
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,720
No, you should go.

218
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,320
Come on.

219
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,960
I am not going.

220
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:37,640
What...

221
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,040
You...

222
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,000
Look, what are they?

223
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,800
A cat.

224
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,400
This is a goldfish.

225
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,440
I want to touch it too.

226
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,320
Stop.

227
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,600
Let me touch it.

228
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,240
Honey marbles.

229
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
It's delicious, go ahead.

230
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:54,840
I want a string, too.

231
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,640
Do you want to try it?

232
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,720
It's so delicious.

233
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,520
Give me a string.

234
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,200
It's not for free.

235
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,320
You need to pay later.

236
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,080
My steward will come to pay you.

237
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,480
Listen to me.

238
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,840
Okay.

239
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,080
My treat.

240
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,680
I want some too.

241
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay.

242
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,920
I want to have a taste.

243
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,920
Fudong and Baoxia

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,960
brought home with a total of 117 wens

245
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,560
after three hours.

246
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,880
Let's take a ballpark number.

247
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You can have 10 percent of the income

248
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,520
as your wages.

249
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,280
Thank you, Young Lady.

250
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,520
Here.

251
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,160
Take it.

252
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,040
You work hard, you earn your share.

253
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,360
No one can deny that.

254
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,640
If you hadn't been pulling my sleeve...

255
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,800
I would have been...

256
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,960
I didn't pull you.

257
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,840
Who knew?

258
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,200
We have a lot work to do.

259
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,480
Mr. Zhong has already made

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,280
many animal lanterns for us.

261
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,200
Right.

262
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,960
His hands are all cut up.

263
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,200
I'm sending him his share, too.

264
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,720
Let's go have a look.

265
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,480
Go.

266
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,800
Look at me.

267
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,280
Honey marbles.

268
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,920
Sour and sweet honey marbles.

269
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,160
Sour and sweet honey marbles.

270
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,960
Would you like to try some?

271
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,080
Look at the bustling street.

272
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,000
Honey marbles.

273
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,320
Sour and sweet honey marbles.

274
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,120
What's all this noise about?

275
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:32,680
Honey marbles.

276
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,520
Honey marbles.

277
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,680
What is that on your head?

278
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,920
That's rare.

279
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,800
They look like fruit vendors.

280
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,920
Let's go find out.

281
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,880
Look at this headwear,

282
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,680
Sour...

283
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,080
Let's go.

284
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,120
Honey marbles.

285
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,640
Sour and sweet honey marbles.

286
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,760
My money.

287
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,320
Catch that thief.

288
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,360
Stop right there.

289
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,240
A little thief.

290
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,240
So stupid.

291
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:58,920
Exactly.

292
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,720
He shouldn't have...

293
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,680
Agree.

294
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
He...

295
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,040
stole my money.

296
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,560
Whose money is this?

297
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,600
I...

298
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,080
Um...

299
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,440
You don't want your money back?

300
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,840
He looks

301
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,640
fine.

302
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,800
Please give it to me.

303
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,960
Thank you.

304
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,240
I...

305
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,920
He got in my way.

306
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,360
I... I... I wasn't helping you.

307
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
Don't... don't get this wrong.

308
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:44,960
Because I wasn't.

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,040
Don't... don't get this wrong.

310
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,480
Soaking the haws

311
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,720
makes my hands even turn white.

312
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,400
Look at them.

313
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,400
Come on, dry your hands with this.

314
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:07,840
Okay.

315
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,640
Yingzhen.

316
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,680
Where have you been?

317
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I can't help much.

318
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,880
So I went to Mr. Zhong

319
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,160
and helped him cut some lantern paper,

320
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,560
and applied some paste to them.

321
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,080
We're short on lanterns.

322
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,560
There are haws

323
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,160
all over the ground outside.

324
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,920
And now you're
moving them inside the house?

325
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,480
Yingzhen, Huilan.

326
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,280
What are you
also join their little business?

327
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,280
What else can we do?

328
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Anyway, I have to earn some money

329
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,680
to buy stationery for Boli.

330
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,440
Look at you.

331
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,160
Money is all you care about now.

332
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,240
Where is Ms. Qin?

333
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,440
Where did she go?

334
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,280
She?

335
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,640
She went into the kitchen
first thing in the morning.

336
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,480
Right, Yingzhen?

337
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Young Lady.

338
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
When will it be the end

339
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,760
of this kind of rough life?

340
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,640
Are we to set up a stall for a lifetime?

341
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,000
Hang in there.

342
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
We need to keep doing this
for at least three months

343
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,880
to take a further step.

344
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,600
We need the whole Imperial Capital

345
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,440
know about us and our honey marbles.

346
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,840
Three months?

347
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,520
Young Lady.

348
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Hearing the beautiful sound
of the money,

349
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,640
three months are nothing,

350
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,280
I could do it for another three years.

351
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,200
Let's go.

352
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,440
Who is that annoying guy?

353
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,800
From the Security Bureau.

354
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,960
I know who he is.

355
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,360
Come on.

356
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,720
I hate this thing.

357
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,320
Aren't you ashamed?

358
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:10,960
Young Lady.

359
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,880
I've thought it through.

360
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,480
There's nothing shameful
about earning money.

361
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,480
From now on,

362
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm not wearing this thing.

363
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:16,920
Let's go.

364
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,000
Don't you know about that?

365
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,560
Those girls from the Hua Family

366
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,960
have a lot of tricks up their sleeves.

367
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,760
I even went to their stall

368
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,720
and checked on them.

369
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,680
Sir.

370
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,200
What I'm worried about

371
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,240
is that those women

372
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,920
would stir up trouble
using food-selling as their disguise.

373
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,400
We can't let our guard down.

374
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,440
I saw them.

375
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,000
There's nothing on their sign

376
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,920
but a flower

377
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,800
painted on it.

378
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,520
My point is

379
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,640
Miss Zhi

380
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,040
is indeed a smart lady.

381
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,720
Why didn't she just write her surname?
[*Hua means flower in Chinese]

382
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,480
For one thing,

383
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,440
the Hua Family has been incriminated,

384
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,720
she doesn't wanna
draw any unnecessary attention.

385
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,440
For another,

386
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,760
their customers are mostly children,

387
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,040
a little pretty flower

388
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,040
can impress them.

389
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,440
Sir.

390
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,600
Do you agree

391
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,480
with what I'm saying?

392
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,240
That's it?

393
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,560
You talked for so long,

394
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,040
and yet you didn't buy some to try?

395
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,480
Do you want to eat the haws, too?

396
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,800
My sister wants that.

397
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,040
It was sold out quick.

398
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,080
Your sister likes it too, huh?

399
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,240
Well,

400
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,960
have you finished running 30 laps yet?

401
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,520
No.

402
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,840
Then go already.

403
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,400
Sir...

404
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,880
There's still a lot of work waiting,

405
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,240
I'll go...

406
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,320
I'll get it done.

407
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,160
This table is not good,

408
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,760
Replace it with a smaller one tomorrow,

409
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,800
Will do.

410
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,400
Come sit with me, Yanxi.

411
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,320
Did you remember
the time when I was a kid?

412
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,080
You were busy with state affairs,
imperial uncle.

413
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,360
Back then, during meals,

414
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,680
there was just a low table
placed beside,

415
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,120
and even if you were dining,

416
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,760
you would also test me on my studies.

417
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,880
In those days,

418
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,040
You grew so tall so quickly

419
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,440
and became so big.

420
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,680
Bus you still sat by such a small table,

421
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,640
being my accompany.

422
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,560
Changqing.

423
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,320
Bring back that tea tabl

424
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,040
back in here.

425
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,040
I and Yanxi

426
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,360
will still dine like that in the future,

427
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,080
Yes,

428
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,240
I'm old,

429
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,240
I can't eat too much meat for my health.

430
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,680
You should eat more.

431
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,120
Venison?

432
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,360
I remember it was your favorite.

433
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,800
I remember

434
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
it was you who taught me
how to hunt deer.

435
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,280
Start a fire in the hunting land

436
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,800
then we could cut the meat
and drink the blood.

437
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,920
Now I'm too old

438
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,440
to ride a horse.

439
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,840
Well,

440
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,640
Yanxi.

441
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,240
Ever since you took over
the Security Bureau,

442
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
you have done a great job.

443
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,280
It was just that

444
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,240
there were not enough killings.

445
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I know

446
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,200
that you are a kind

447
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,720
and decent kid.

448
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,720
However,

449
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,400
don't show mercy to anyone
who gets in your way.

450
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,280
By doing so,

451
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,680
you will have less troubles

452
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,640
in the future.

453
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,200
I see.

454
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,280
An old man

455
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,560
just loves to preach.

456
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
I've said enough,
let's enjoy the dinner.

457
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,480
How is the investigation going

458
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
about your mother?

459
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,200
Not a clue.

460
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,040
Eat up.

461
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,120
Two wens.

462
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,600
Come on!

463
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,920
Here, take this.

464
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,280
Thank you.

465
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:56,920
I want one.

466
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,400
Two wens.

467
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,520
Here you go, thank you.

468
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,520
Two wens.

469
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,280
Here, take it.

470
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:02,720
Thank you.

471
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Thank you.

472
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,880
I'll have a skewer too.

473
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,320
Here.

474
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,120
Thanks a lot.

475
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,160
Young Lady.

476
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
The man from the Security Bureau.

477
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,640
I don't care who he is.

478
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,600
You want my marbles,

479
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,440
you pay up.

480
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,480
Don't cut in line!

481
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,880
That person is an inspector
of the Security Bureau,

482
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,240
you've had a dispute with him before.

483
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,920
No wonder he looks so familiar.

484
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,760
Just take it.

485
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,560
You give me a stick for what?

486
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,320
Judging by the way he looked at you,

487
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,680
he probably recognized you.

488
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,960
Thank god he didn't
make things difficult for you.

489
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,360
It is you I should thank.

490
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,360
What brings you here?

491
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,800
I heard a new kind of fruit is for sale

492
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,520
on the Willow Street

493
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,360
and there's even a flower painted
on the signs.

494
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,640
No risk, no gain.

495
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,280
But it's not good for business

496
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
in the long term

497
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,320
if you keep putting a cover up for this.

498
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,600
It all depends on

499
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,680
what His Majesty is thinking.

500
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,280
I wish I could ask him in person.

501
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,760
Enough talk of that.

502
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,080
Try it.

503
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,800
This might just be

504
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,840
the ones you picked the other day.

505
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,880
You're not a fan of sourness, right?

506
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I've never had it before.

507
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,000
Then wait three more days.

508
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,480
You can come back

509
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,240
after we make the fruits sweeter.

510
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,920
Daddy, I want to eat this.

511
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,000
Miss,

512
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,000
how much for the fruit?

513
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:28,960
One wen each.

514
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,280
I'll take one.

515
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,840
Just one?

516
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,840
Have at it, kid.

517
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,640
Daddy, we can share.

518
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,640
Daddy doesn't like it.

519
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,360
You go on.

520
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,000
Mister, please wait.

521
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,560
One wen for two.

522
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,600
This one is on the house.

523
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,840
Thank you, Miss.

524
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:57,960
Thank you, Miss.

525
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,000
It's our turn now.

526
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,040
Eat slowly.

527
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:03,840
Thank you.

528
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,920
Thanks a lot.

529
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,840
I wonder

530
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,760
what is it like
between the fathers and sons

531
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,520
among the common folks?

532
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,680
Probably they are just like us now.

533
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,120
The young kid listens
to his preachy old man

534
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,000
when they're eating.

535
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,120
I really am getting old.

536
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,760
How would you know

537
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,080
the situation amongst the common folks?

538
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,760
Being in the royal family,

539
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,160
we are meant to

540
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,760
be different from those ordinary people.

541
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,240
You come to have a meal with me

542
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,720
from time to time,

543
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,600
that's enough for me.

544
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,120
Won't you lose money doing business

545
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,480
by such a generosity?

546
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
No, the marbles don't worth much.

547
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,120
Then in a couple of days,

548
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,360
Please keep one skwer for me

549
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
when you make new honey marbles
in two days.

550
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,800
Wrap it up in the paper

551
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,760
painted with flowers.

552
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,000
Alright.

553
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,480
Do you buy that for your family?

554
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,960
I want my uncle to taste it.

555
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,600
Look.

556
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,160
Madam is making the fruits works of art

557
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,320
even though she is just pitting them.

558
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,240
Let's get to work.

559
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,520
Let me see it.

560
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,320
Let me see it.

561
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:20,920
Please.

562
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,360
Go inside the house first.

563
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,320
Go inside.

564
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Come.

565
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,120
Aren't they adorable?

566
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,280
Absolutely.

567
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,040
So adorable.

568
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,840
Three.

569
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,600
Four, five.

570
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,520
Where did all the poultry

571
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,000
come from?

572
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,680
You bought them?

573
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
That was quick.

574
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,440
I know I'm amazing.

575
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,600
We have to wait until they grow up.

576
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,480
Does that mean

577
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,360
we will have eggs to eat?

578
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,760
Zhi says,

579
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,680
we keep buying eggs of the poultry,

580
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,760
and it costs a lot of money.

581
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,080
So we can raise them ourselves,

582
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,240
also as a pastime.

583
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,920
How many chickens and ducks are there?

584
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,160
Don't lean forward.

585
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,560
You shouldn't bend over.

586
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,600
Mind your belly.

587
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,640
Baozhu.

588
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:43,840
Here's yours.

589
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,160
How much is that?

590
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,680
Come on, let me see.

591
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,280
Yinzhu.

592
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,200
Fudong.

593
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,680
How much did you get?

594
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,200
Not as much as that
before the family hit a downfall.

595
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,600
But it's way better than
I got last month.

596
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,720
Why are you running? Show me.

597
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Stop nosing around.

598
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,920
Tell you what?

599
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,440
One of us is paid the most.

600
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,240
Who is it?

601
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,360
It's an open secret already, okay?

602
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,160
Fudong, of course.

603
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:15,920
Isn't that so?

604
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,480
She took a whole guan.

605
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,400
If it was not for her,

606
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,600
we couldn't have had our pay
in the first place.

607
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,000
She gets more than the rest of us,

608
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,240
that's because she deserves it.

609
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,120
Baozhu,

610
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,680
Let me see how much you've got.

611
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,600
I don't care about the others,

612
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,000
I only wanna know your share.

613
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,360
How much did you get?

614
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,680
Show me.

615
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,800
That ungrateful girl!

616
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,920
What's wrong with her?

617
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,880
Fob me off with just half a guan.

618
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Isn't she?

619
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,560
Go.

620
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:29,840
Madam.

621
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,720
She is stealing,

622
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,960
I can catch her on the site.

623
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,080
Keep it down.

624
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,680
I will deal with her
when the right time comes.

625
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,400
How lovely!

626
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,280
Let's get to it.

627
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,280
We can head home early
after we finish it.

628
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,320
We can have a hot meal, then.

629
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,520
Young Lady, look at this.

630
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,160
Young Lady, take a look.

631
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,080
This one is pretty.

632
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,640
Hua Zhi.

633
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,680
What are you doing here?

634
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,360
I'm heading somewhere.

635
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,760
What are you picking?

636
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,760
The pastry we made sold well

637
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,280
the other day.

638
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,960
Fudong wants to
improve the recipe better.

639
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:36,920
She asked me

640
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,280
to pick these green leaves

641
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
and dye the dough.

642
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,960
The fragrance of the plant
will burst in your mouth.

643
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,440
So it's my off day

644
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:42,960
for being a hawker girl today.

645
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,800
I'll have a taste
of your new pastry then.

646
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
The other day,

647
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,120
you said you wanted to bring some pastry

648
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,800
for your uncle.

649
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,160
Fudong made a type of honey cake.

650
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:50,960
It's fragrant and soft.

651
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,720
My Grandmother and Ms. Su love it.

652
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,280
Come to Willow Lane tomorrow.

653
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Take some to him.

654
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,480
Thank you then.

655
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,680
Do you need a hand?

656
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,760
No.

657
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,920
I am a girl who provides for my family.

658
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,920
I am always on my own.

659
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,680
See you tomorrow.

660
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:02,600
See you tomorrow.

661
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,040
What are these?

662
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,640
There is a Willow Street in the city

663
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,000
specializing in sweet pastry.

664
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,680
This is their newly made honey cakes.

665
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,640
You have been long in the palace,

666
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,280
and rarely taste the food

667
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,640
of the common people.

668
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,760
So I brought you some.

669
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,640
Yanxi.

670
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,000
You earn not much
in the Security Bureau.

671
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,800
Uncle.

672
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,320
This only costs five wens per portion.

673
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,640
Five wens.

674
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,840
I have never had

675
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,000
the pastry that is worth five wens only.

676
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,560
Yummy.

677
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,120
Very sweet.

678
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,840
Go on, share with me.

679
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,400
Go on.

680
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,200
Your Majesty.

681
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,520
May I have one?

682
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,160
Well...

683
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Yanxi bought this for me.

684
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,360
You don't get to eat.

685
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,960
Go away.

686
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:01,960
Your Majesty.

687
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,320
Lord Xian is here.

688
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,880
Greetings, Father.

689
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,400
Your Highness.

690
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,520
I heard you had a bad appetite recently.

691
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,560
These fruits from Ruihe House

692
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,600
are unrivaled in the Imperial Capital.

693
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:25,600
I told their head chef

694
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,360
to make some appetizing fruits

695
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,520
for you specifically.

696
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,080
They are still hot.

697
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,480
Please try.

698
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,160
Take it back.

699
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
I don't wanna eat.

700
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,320
Your Highness.

701
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,760
These cake

702
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,800
are made by the Hua Family, right?

703
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,200
You're quite discerning.

704
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,880
I heard a few days ago

705
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,480
that family of sinful women
show no repentance,

706
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,080
and now they've even become peddlers.

707
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,760
How come

708
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,560
bring these things
into the Imperial Capital?

709
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,440
What's the big deal?

710
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,080
Just some snacks

711
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,800
made by some women.

712
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,840
Don't make a fuss about that.

713
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,240
I think Yanxi is right,

714
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,240
Since they've given up their dignity,

715
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,400
and started to sell things
on the street.

716
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,600
That means
they degraded themselves to commoners.

717
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,240
Yangong.

718
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,600
You are just narrow-minded,

719
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,520
That's why you care.

720
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,040
I will reflect on myself, Father.

721
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,400
Your Highness.

722
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,480
The pastry?

723
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,240
Throw it away.

724
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,920
Okay.

725
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,760
Wait a moment.

726
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,480
What a waste to throw it away.

727
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,000
I just came back here,

728
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,160
and have not yet tasted

729
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,320
the pastry from Ruihe House.

730
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,320
You do have a good appetite.

731
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:57,960
Thank you, brother.

732
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Floral cloth.

733
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,360
Take a look at the floral cloth.

734
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,360
Let's take a look.

735
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,520
Calligraphy and painting.

736
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:14,480
Come and see.

737
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,440
Up for sale.

738
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,800
Why didn’t you make a sound?

739
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,200
You were reading.

740
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,320
I'm killing time here.

741
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:34,870
[The Mathematical Treatise
in Nine Sections]

742
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,600
Were you solving math problems

743
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,760
to kill time?

744
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,240
This book is very interesting.

745
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,800
Here you are.

746
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,840
The pastry from Ruihe House.

747
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,360
They are very expensive.

748
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,080
Did you buy it?

749
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:49,760
It was a gift from someone.

750
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,240
Study the recipe when you go back home.

751
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,400
Know yourself, know your enemy.

752
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,600
You can learn from the best.

753
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,360
Fudong has always wanted to

754
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,280
try the pastry of the Ruihe House,

755
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,480
but we can't afford it.

756
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,280
This portion costs half a guan
if I remember it right.

757
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,280
This one here

758
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,600
might cost even more.

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,840
Look at the sky.

760
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:12,960
I'm afraid it's going to rain.

761
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,880
We can only take the pastry back home

762
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,640
and let the family shares.

763
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,120
Baoxia,

764
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,280
cover the pastry.

765
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,920
It's raining so heavily.

766
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,120
Don't push.

775
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:55,680
Stop the cart.

776
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,280
Smash the stall of the Hua Family.

777
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,440
Yes.

778
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,680
Smash the stall.

779
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,800
Your...

780
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,480
What?

781
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
She is the owner.

782
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,560
You wanna buy pastry?

783
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,840
I don't mind if you take it all.

784
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,120
Except for the cart.

785
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,680
Young Lady, don't...

786
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,640
Don't go.

787
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,480
Mister,

788
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,440
It is one guan
for this whole cart of pastry.

789
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,160
Would you like to pay now
or put it on the tab?

790
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,800
Perhaps you haven't brought
enough money.

791
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,520
That's a lot of money.

792
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,200
I cannot make change for this.

793
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,160
Keep the change.

794
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,280
That's very generous of you.

795
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,720
What are you up to?

796
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,240
Please come again
if you like the pastry.

797
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,200
Wrap it up.

798
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:01,800
Here you go.

799
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,920
What are you looking at? Get going.

800
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,240
Go.

801
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,680
Do you know who that person is?

802
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,960
You almost scared me to death.

803
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,520
I don't know.

804
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,480
Never mind, you'd better not know.

805
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,350
[Yunlai Restaurant]

806
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,000
Won't you have a taste?

807
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,280
Too sweet.

808
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,120
It is very sweet.

809
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,720
Quite tasty.

810
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,720
I really didn't expect this.

811
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,480
You even came up with

812
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,600
such a self-degrading trick,

813
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,040
fraternizing with that criminal woman.

814
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,160
Self-degrading?

815
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:06,760
What else?

816
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,680
If that's not what you wish for,

817
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,960
do you wish

818
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,200
for her pretty face?

819
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,000
Not even close.

820
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,760
No wonder Father adores you.

821
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,960
You don't care about the rules

822
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,200
and how people think of you.

823
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,840
You are nothing like

824
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,600
a careerist coveting power.

825
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,040
I'm afraid Father

826
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,920
also thinks this way.

827
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,920
If you say no.

828
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,480
Gu Yanxi.

829
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,960
You have no idea

830
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,560
how much I envy you.

831
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,200
I knew.

832
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,600
Back then when imperial uncle

833
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,840
taught me how to read,

834
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,320
you often held your ink and brush

835
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,080
and stared inside, longing to join in.

836
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,720
So I knew.

837
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,160
However,

838
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,200
I am indeed different from you.

839
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,440
Because I am not the heir to the throne.

840
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,560
No matter how I behave,

841
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,360
one way or another,

842
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,040
it makes no difference.

843
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,800
Look at this scar.

844
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,640
Something like this

845
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,880
would never happen to you.

846
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,400
Do you still remember Qi Ruhai,
Your Highness?

847
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,680
How could I forget?

848
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,120
He was a good stooge.

849
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,200
And he died because of you.

850
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,080
That's right.

851
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,600
Do you know who is behind

852
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,440
this private coinage case?

853
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,480
And who told Qi Ruhai

854
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,160
to frame me?

855
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,400
It wasn't me.

856
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,120
Many in the Court think it was you.

857
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,080
So you're saying,

858
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,640
it's impossible to clear my name now.

859
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,600
Alright then,

860
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,200
that was me.

861
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,400
I know it wasn't you.

862
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,480
Because there's only one person

863
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,120
that can make Qi Ruhai

864
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,640
to die without any complaint.

865
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,560
That man make you live in fear.

866
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,320
And he forced me to scar my face
to prove my innocence,

867
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,040
and leave the Northern Land forever.

868
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,800
I see.

869
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,720
So that's how it is.

870
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,880
Gu Yanxi.

871
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,600
It turns out

872
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,640
that you're as miserable as I am.

873
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,520
Don't think that way.

874
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,720
We both lost something,

875
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,320
but also we gained something in return,
haven't we?

876
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,760
Drink?

877
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,600
I never drink.

878
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,920
Gu Yangong.

879
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,400
You're so depressed
living a life like this.

880
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,760
It takes one to know one.

881
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,320
It seems that

882
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,760
although we were born
in the royal family

883
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,680
but perhaps the common folks

884
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,840
are happier than us.

885
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,320
We are rich in wealth,

886
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,080
but poor in soul.

887
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,800
Life is nothing but a temporary stay.

888
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,920
We are destined to wander.

889
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,440
You see,

890
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,040
even the beggars on the streets

891
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
and thieves in prison

892
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
have their loved ones.

893
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,920
But you and I?

894
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,760
We've got nobody.

895
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,960
What we said toda stays in the room.

896
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,320
I owe you a favor for that.

897
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:07,920
We

898
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,080
didn't say a word today.

899
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,480
Heading back to the palace?

900
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,840
I'm heading home.

901
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,480
Since you don't like the pastry,

902
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,440
I'll take some off your hands.

903
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,480
You're back, My Lord.

904
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,400
What are you having here?

905
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,160
My Lord,

906
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,240
this is the pastry

907
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,480
Xi bought for me.

908
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,160
He's been so busy.

909
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,200
He's just such a filial kid.

910
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,640
You see?

911
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,600
My Lord,

912
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,560
would you like to try some?

913
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,120
Alright.

914
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,440
How is that?

915
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,440
What?

916
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,520
He went out again?

917
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,360
I heard His Majesty called him back.

918
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,560
Why is he so busy

919
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,120
even though he doesn't even have a job?

920
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,320
Qi Ruhai is dead.

921
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,920
Yanxi is always absent.

922
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,760
I know what he did.

923
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,240
This old fellow.

924
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,040
He's put my son

925
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,880
in a place

926
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,160
that is shady and notorious.

927
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,720
Madam.

928
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,560
These past few days

929
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,200
I've been watching that girl.

930
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,440
Every three days

931
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,680
she takes the stolen honey

932
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,920
and hands it over to an outsider.

933
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,640
When's the next time?

934
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,400
Tomorrow night, I think.

935
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,200
She is too young

936
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,200
to manage a big family.

937
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,360
She is just too naive.

938
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,120
Tomorrow night

939
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,160
I will have her hand me over

940
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,360
that household ledger
with her own hands.

941
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,640
Wait and see

942
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,480
she will be embarrassed
in front of the whole family.

943
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,080
Chanlu.

944
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,320
Ms.

945
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:34,880
I...

946
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:46,600
You are

947
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,960
just an ungrateful lowlife.

948
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,120
How dare you

949
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,160
betray all of us?

950
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,200
Everyone comes out.

951
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,080
What's wrong, Jin'e?

952
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,680
Yingzhen,

953
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,040
you have no idea, aren't you?

954
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,040
This girl

955
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,520
is about to sell all the honey

956
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,120
to the outsiders.

957
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,760
Madam.

958
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,280
Madam, help.

959
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,160
Aunt Xia.

960
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,320
What is going on?

961
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,200
She

962
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,720
stole the honey of the cooked haws.

963
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,040
She met with someone

964
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:12,880
in the middle of the night,

965
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,880
and delivered it outside the manor.

966
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,480
Why are you coming out.

967
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,080
Be careful with your baby.

968
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,800
Go back.

969
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,000
They...

970
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,800
It's fine, go back.

971
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:21,920
She

972
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,200
is one of Madam Zhu's maids.

973
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:24,960
So I am

974
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:25,920
in no position to deal with her.

975
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,360
Since you take charge of the family now.

976
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,560
Tell me,

977
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:29,960
what should we do with her?

978
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,280
Chanlu.

979
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,160
Speak up.

980
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,360
I did wrong.

981
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,440
You can punish me in any ways.

982
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,880
If this is true,

983
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,120
why bother with punishment?

984
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,680
Just kick her out.

985
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,200
Since this isn't a false accusation,

986
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,640
you should at least tell us why.

987
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,760
Miss Zhi,

988
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:52,760
my...

989
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,600
My mother needs to take medicine
all year round.

990
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,640
I can pay for the medicine

991
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,000
with my monthly allowance

992
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,040
in the past.

993
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,400
But ever since we came here...

994
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,920
Miss Zhi,

995
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,960
I made a mistake.

996
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,120
Miss Zhi is too young

997
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,880
and Yingzhen is always nice
to the maids.

998
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,720
I can see why Chenlu
had the guts to steal.

999
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,000
Okay.

1000
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,000
Jin'e.

1001
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,840
Zhi is too busy.

1002
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,160
She has to arrange

1003
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,680
our food and everything day after day.

1004
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,400
Let alone she has to

1005
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
keep an eye on her business
in the daytime.

1006
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,320
After she comes back,
she needs to do the accounts

1007
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,680
until midnight.

1008
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,120
It's normal when someone steals
under her watch.

1009
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,160
Exactly.

1010
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,600
You have too many things to do,

1011
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,120
so you've got no time
for the household affairs.

1012
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,200
Chanlu

1013
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,680
is one of Madam Zhu's maids.

1014
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:39,440
Well,

1015
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,360
even if Miss Zhi

1016
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,240
do know about this,

1017
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,560
you just can't punish her right away

1018
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,880
because she's
one of your mother's maids, right?

1019
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,120
From what I see,

1020
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,800
you two

1021
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,480
seem to have planned this early on.

1022
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,720
Stay out of this.

1023
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,280
Madam Qi.

1024
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,480
I'm not picking sides here.

1025
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,520
But to be honest,

1026
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,600
if Madam Xia is still in charge
of the household ledger

1027
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,480
none of this would ever happen.

1028
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:02,760
Miss Zhi,

1029
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,560
do you agree?

1030
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,520
Madam Hua said

1031
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,360
she heard you fighting outside

1032
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,880
so late.

1033
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,920
You can go to her room

1034
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,040
and figure out what to do

1035
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,960
and make things clear.

1036
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:23,640
Zhi.

1037
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,600
Ask away.

1038
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,080
Fudong.

1039
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,360
You've known for a while

1040
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,160
that Chanlu was stealing honey.

1041
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
I already entrust you with the kitchen.

1042
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,480
Why didn't you say anything?

1043
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,120
She's one of your maids.

1044
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,200
How dare she

1045
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,880
get in the way of your mother's maid?

1046
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,880
Our family now

1047
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,080
have to work hard
to provide food on the table.

1048
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,480
You're the peddler on the street,

1049
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,040
and Fudong is a pastry chef
in the kitchen.

1050
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,200
You've got so many people
looked up to you,

1051
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,520
I understand it's difficult

1052
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,200
to make everybody happy.

1053
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,600
Yes.

1054
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,240
I've heard that those maids of Miss Zhi

1055
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,040
would get more monthly allowance
than other people.

1056
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,040
I've got

1057
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,280
plenty of time anyway,

1058
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,320
I would like to share the burden,

1059
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,040
then we can sleep tight at night.

1060
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,880
Madam Hua,

1061
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:07,680
what do you say?

1062
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,200
Back in the day,

1063
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
I would have

1064
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,640
disabled your hands

1065
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,480
and kicked you out.

1066
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,440
Madam Hua, please don't.

1067
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,880
I won't do it again, I promise.
