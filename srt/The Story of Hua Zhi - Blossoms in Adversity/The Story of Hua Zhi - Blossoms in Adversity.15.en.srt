00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:05,150
Come, this way.

193
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,350
These are our new products.

194
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,150
I like this one!

195
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,070
I'll have the square-shaped cake!

196
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:15,830
Coming.

197
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:16,950
Here's the money.

198
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,030
- Here you go.
- Just a moment.

199
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,550
Okay.

200
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,230
Our chef was inspired by flowers

201
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,630
when she made these.

202
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,350
Eat slowly.

203
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,630
Slow down.

204
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,510
Be careful.

205
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,710
Please,

206
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,310
come here.

207
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,710
Please send this
to the guest over there.

208
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,590
Everything here is freshly made.

209
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,230
Come on.

210
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,750
Mother, it's delicious!

211
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:38,590
Lady Ling.

212
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,270
Lady Ling!

213
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,110
Over here!

214
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,110
Help, please.

215
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,790
Please come in!

216
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:46,390
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

217
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,550
Excuse me!

218
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,550
Excuse us!

219
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,750
These are the gifts
from the Yunlai Restaurant.

220
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,790
Osmanthus cakes!

221
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,070
I've been sewing all the time

222
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,790
and my hands hurt now.

223
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,230
Yingzhen,

224
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,110
you should take a break.

225
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,670
My hands hurt too.

226
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,950
But I'm happy about it.

227
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,230
To my surprise,

228
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,310
our income

229
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,550
has been so high!

230
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,190
Look!

231
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,710
These stacks

232
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:18,510
and volumes

233
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,790
are not just paper.

234
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,230
That's all money!

235
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,550
Huilan,

236
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,870
you're becoming just like Jin'e!

237
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:26,830
Yingzhen,

238
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,830
where is Zhi?

239
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,550
She's over there.

240
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,270
Zhi,

241
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,670
I heard from Ling

242
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,750
that the alley

243
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,750
is jam-packed

244
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,750
and the shop

245
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,350
is filled with people.

246
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:36,750
Why are you

247
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,310
still doing the accounts here?

248
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,590
You should hurry back

249
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,710
and keep an eye on the shop.

250
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,750
This is our first day.

251
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,070
I have to make sure everything is clear,

252
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,590
so I'll know tomorrow's
expense and income.

253
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,430
These sticks of yours

254
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,190
won't get the job done.

255
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,030
I'll do it.

256
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,670
This is...

257
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,390
Before I married,

258
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,070
none of my brothers

259
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,950
could defeat me when using an abacus.

260
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,270
When I got married,

261
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,710
I secretly put this abacus

262
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,190
in the case of my dowry

263
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,910
and brought it here.

264
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:05,870
From then on,

265
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:06,870
it had been at the bottom of the case,

266
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,070
serving only as a souvenir.

267
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,190
I didn't expect

268
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,470
that I'd use it again!

269
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,910
Your Aunt Xia

270
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,510
does have foresight.

271
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,990
When we got raided,

272
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,310
she didn't only stash money

273
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,150
but also an abacus!

274
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,870
It's certainly more useful
than your shoes and socks.

275
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,630
Don't you think so?

276
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,950
Indeed.

277
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,590
Nianqiu,

278
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,750
from now on,

279
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,510
you'll learn

280
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,510
how to use an abacus from Aunt Xia.

281
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,110
Aunt Xia,

282
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,230
I'll leave this to you.

283
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,950
I'll go check on the shop.

284
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,710
Go on, hurry.

285
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,230
Go.

286
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,510
I am leaving.

287
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,270
Come on.

288
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,230
Take these away.

289
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,870
Take a look.

290
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:57,910
Yingchun.

291
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,870
[Hua Shop]

292
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,390
With so many shops opening at once,

293
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,790
we can hardly keep up with the work.

294
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,830
Even I have to come here

295
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,590
join in this hardship.

296
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:05,550
Lady Ling.

297
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,430
Today's the opening day

298
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,350
and it is truly overwhelming.

299
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,830
We won't trouble you tomorrow.

300
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,110
Ling, try this!

301
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,710
This chestnut cake is really delicious.

302
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,270
Zhi!

303
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,270
Let's go take a look at the other side.

304
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,030
Someone fainted over here!

305
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,630
Someone has fainted!

306
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,590
Come over and take a look!

307
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,070
Someone has fainted!

308
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,350
Go take a look.

309
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,750
What's going on here?

310
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,590
What exactly happened?

311
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,110
He suddenly fainted.

312
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,070
Right.

313
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,430
He is not dead.

314
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,750
He's just too hungry.

315
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,470
Yingchun,

316
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,750
go get some food.

317
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,670
Help him up.

318
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:12,750
You two, come here.

319
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,990
Slowly, take it easy.

320
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:19,550
Come on.

321
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,030
What a good poem, Zhi.

322
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,910
Look.

323
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,550
The sovereign shall
serve for the people.

324
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,270
He has read Grandfather's writings.

325
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,430
How did such a talented man

326
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,950
end up like this?

327
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,710
What else could possibly happen?

328
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,150
If he used such compositions

329
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,110
in the imperial examination,

330
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,630
I'm afraid

331
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,350
he would never get a pass.

332
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,070
If His Majesty read this,

333
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:02,470
I fear

334
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,230
he would end up

335
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,390
like Grandfather.

336
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,910
You're awake.

337
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,710
Are you feeling better?

338
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,830
Thank you.

339
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,070
I'll take my leave.

340
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,390
Don't you want your poetry?

341
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,710
The tall branches lack charm.

342
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,710
What's the harm if the fallen leaves
still carry the chill.

343
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,790
Did you write this?

344
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,830
May I ask for your name?

345
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,070
I'm Zheng Zhi.

346
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,670
Thank you for saving my life.

347
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,430
I now own nothing

348
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:46,870
but a few scrolls of poetry and essays.

349
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,030
They're important to me.

350
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,390
Please give them back.

351
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,350
Where do you live, Mr. Zheng?

352
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,350
And Where are you working?

353
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,950
I'm just a useless scholar,

354
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,670
with nowhere to live

355
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,390
and nowhere to work.

356
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,990
May I have a word with you?

357
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,630
Mr. Zheng,

358
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,190
my family is hiring

359
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,670
a teacher who is good at
poetry and literature.

360
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,830
You are highly talented.

361
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,510
I wonder if you are willing
to give it a try.

362
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,630
I am poor,

363
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,230
but I do not wish to accept charity.

364
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,790
Thank you.

365
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,830
I will take my leave.

366
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,070
How is this the charity?

367
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,430
You are so weird.

368
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,870
Although we have newly opened a shop,

369
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,310
we're not rich people.

370
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,030
We are a sinful family.

371
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,510
Grandfather has a collection
of thousands of books.

372
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,870
If you like,

373
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,070
you can borrow them.

374
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,510
My family name is Hua.

375
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,110
You are...

376
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,390
I was so rude just now.

377
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,990
My apologies!

378
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,550
Let alone family academy,

379
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,390
I will do anything for you!

380
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,030
If it's for Master Hua,

381
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,150
I am willing to risk my own life.

382
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,350
Mister, you've been too polite.

383
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,070
Please, rise.

384
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,990
You're willing to accept charity now?

385
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,230
That villain is here to bully Zhi again.

386
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,550
Fortunately, I have been prepared.

387
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:50,790
Mister, this way!

388
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,990
Can I help you?

389
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,670
Are you looking for someone?

390
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,710
No, not really.

391
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,790
Of course, I'm here

392
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,110
to look for that fierce silly girl.

393
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,630
Well, please check out

394
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,270
if there's something
you would like to try.

395
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,270
Then, I'll have

396
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,030
this one

397
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,030
and that one.

398
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,910
Could you get them for me?

399
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:13,510
Sure.

400
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,470
Mister,

401
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,470
is there anything else you need?

402
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,550
Just get me one of each.

403
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,150
Sure.

404
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,270
Whose horse is running away?

405
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,830
Whose horse is it?

406
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,510
Whose horse is it?

407
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,390
My horse!

408
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,190
Horse!

409
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,350
Horse!

410
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:15,870
My horse!

411
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:16,910
My horse!

412
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,390
Hurry up! You've lost your horse!

413
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:19,870
You!

414
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,590
This guy...

415
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,270
Slow down!

416
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,190
Be careful!

417
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:02,990
I can do it myself.

418
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,150
This is the first time
that you have ridden for so long.

419
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,270
I'm worried about your waist

420
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,950
and your legs.

421
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,670
When you learned to ride,

422
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,350
was it like this as well?

423
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,910
I was too young at that time,

424
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,390
so I can't remember clearly.

425
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,230
You learned to ride horses
when you were little?

426
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,230
Are you trying to say

427
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,470
that the families
in the Imperial Capital

428
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,630
that can afford to
have their children ride horses

429
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,470
are either rich or noble?

430
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,390
If I really came from such a background,

431
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,070
why would I join the army

432
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,870
and work for you

433
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,590
as a master of martial arts?

434
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,390
Sorry.

435
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,670
You didn't even ask the question.

436
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,750
What's there to apologize for?

437
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,150
Besides, we've known each other
for so long

438
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,390
and you've never asked me any questions.

439
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,870
Actually, since I met you,

440
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,710
I've been curious.

441
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,870
It's just inappropriate for me to ask.

442
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,230
If I ask questions now,

443
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,630
you might overthink it.

444
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,590
You're being so polite to me.

445
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,310
It seems

446
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,070
that we're still distanced.

447
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,030
It's not like that.

448
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,950
I feel that if you want to tell me

449
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,990
about yourself,

450
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,470
you will tell me someday.

451
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,630
My mother passed away when I was little.

452
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,470
My father remarried.

453
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,590
I was raised

454
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,270
by my uncle.

455
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,630
He taught me to ride

456
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,070
and read.

457
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,030
Later, I joined the army

458
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,150
to repay his kindness.

459
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,630
Actually, I want to tell you more

460
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,190
about myself.

461
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:55,350
Hopefully someday,

462
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:56,950
I can

463
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:57,870
tell you everything.

464
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,830
But for now, let's just

465
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,310
ride the horse

466
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,470
and feel the breeze,

467
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,950
right?

468
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:06,710
Alright.

469
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,510
It's getting late.

470
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,750
Let's head back.

471
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,110
I'm afraid
that when I tell you the truth,

472
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,110
we'll never

473
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,110
be together like this.

474
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,390
Mr. Yan, you are back.

475
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,270
Mr. Yan,

476
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:52,950
well...

477
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:53,750
Where...

478
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,790
Where's Zhi?

479
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,230
Mr. Zhong, don't worry.

480
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,950
I have taken her to the shop.

481
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,350
She will be back later.

482
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,710
Thank you, Mr. Yan.

483
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,270
She's been

484
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,510
so busy!

485
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,950
Mr. Zhong,

486
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,070
did you serve Master Hua before?

487
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,430
That's right.

488
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,670
Ever since I was young,

489
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,350
I have been by Master Hua's side.

490
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,630
I have served him

491
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,790
for almost my whole life.

492
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,590
I heard when the scholars

493
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,390
travel around,

494
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,510
they usually have pages
prepare ink and ink brushes for them.

495
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,070
So the page who served

496
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:33,830
Master Hua along with you

497
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,870
must be

498
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,830
close to him too, right?

499
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,030
There's no such a person.

500
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,670
It has always been just me.

501
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,910
In this case,

502
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,470
you've worked very hard.

503
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,790
It's nothing.

504
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:58,630
Mr. Zhong.

505
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,070
Zhi.

506
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,950
You don't need to do this.

507
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,350
The others

508
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,470
will sweep these leaves away.

509
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:04,950
It's okay.

510
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:05,990
I just

511
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,670
want to get some exercise.

512
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,470
Zhi.

513
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,910
Well...

514
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,070
How do you know Mr. Yan?

515
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,550
He's a friend of mine.

516
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,550
What's wrong?

517
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,150
Yesterday,

518
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,390
he asked me

519
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,790
about Master Hua.

520
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,390
Zhi.

521
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,550
You can't read his mind.

522
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,870
So we must be cautious.

523
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,870
Rest assured.

524
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,990
I know

525
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,830
what kind of person he is.

526
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:37,670
Alright then.

527
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,990
Perhaps I am overthinking it.

528
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,590
Alright, Zhi.

529
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,550
Don't let me keep you.

530
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,310
I will take my leave.

531
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,150
Today's lesson

532
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,670
will be taught

533
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,630
by Mr. Zheng.

534
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,750
From now on,

535
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,350
on all odd-numbered days,

536
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,590
he will take my place

537
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,630
to give you enlightenment lessons.

538
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,110
Yes.

539
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:19,630
Greetings, Mr. Zheng.

540
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,430
I thought

541
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,630
he's a strict one.

542
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,990
It turns out he's not.

543
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,150
I forgot to mention earlier

544
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,470
that during the enlightenment class,

545
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,910
you can't chat,

546
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,270
mess around

547
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,750
or be distracted.

548
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,270
In this class,

549
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,670
we will study
the Thousand Character Classic.

550
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,870
The darkling skies and yellow earth.

551
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,190
The darkling skies and yellow earth.

552
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,190
Amid great chaos had their birth.

553
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,950
Amid great chaos had their birth.

554
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,910
Look at me!

555
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,190
It's amazing?

556
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,270
No talking!

557
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:06,430
Before the end of today's class,

558
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:08,230
I'd like

559
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,310
to introduce myself to you.

560
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,870
You're Mr. Zheng.

561
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,310
We already know.

562
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,830
Before I came here,

563
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,670
I wasn't Mr. Zheng.

564
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,070
I was born in a remote area.

565
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,830
My family was dirt poor.

566
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,670
When I was four years old,

567
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,590
my father died from a disease
because we couldn't afford a physician.

568
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,710
My mother remarried and moved away.

569
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,070
From then on, I lived with my aunt.

570
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,350
My aunt couldn't afford my education

571
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:40,790
and there weren't any literate people
in the village.

572
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,750
I had to walk barefoot for miles

573
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,990
to a teacher's place

574
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:46,790
and kneel outside his door

575
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,110
to beg him to lend me books.

576
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,230
Later on,

577
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,350
I became his favorite student.

578
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:52,910
And after that,

579
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,030
I was finally able to take the exams.

580
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,430
After passing the provincial exam,

581
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:58,790
I supported myself

582
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,270
by copying books and writing letters.

583
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,550
By walking,

584
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,950
I came to the Imperial Capital.

585
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,390
Perhaps,

586
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,390
the provincial exam is as far as I go.

587
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,110
When I first

588
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,430
saw this academy,

589
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,230
I had a dream that night.

590
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,110
In my dream, I was still

591
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:14,910
as young as all of you,

592
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:15,750
sitting here

593
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,630
with paper and ink brushes.

594
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,630
I could learn anything I want.

595
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,070
I was too happy,

596
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,590
so I laughed and woke up.

597
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,870
After I became a teacher,

598
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,310
your families often came to visit me,

599
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,830
bringing gifts and concerning about you.

600
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,670
They want me to be strict with you.

601
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,430
What I want to say

602
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,030
that you are young

603
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,070
and do not waste your time.

604
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,070
Isn't that strange?

605
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,590
A couple of days ago,

606
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,310
I secretly

607
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,870
went to the academy.

608
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,590
I saw those naughty kids

609
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,390
actually sitting there

610
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,870
and reciting along with the teachers.

611
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,790
Could it be

612
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,310
that Mr. Zheng knows how to cast spells?

613
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,430
It seems I should give Mr. Zheng

614
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,630
a pay rise.

615
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,590
Right!

616
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,270
With him and Master Mu teaching,

617
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,670
we don't need to worry
about the kids anymore.

618
00:25:59,270 --> 00:25:59,790
Yesterday,

619
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,550
Boli came back and told me

620
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,710
that today he will have a day off

621
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,030
and he wants to help in the shop.

622
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,070
I was really surprised.

623
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,590
Before,

624
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,390
he'd ask me for some pocket money

625
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,310
and go out playing all day.

626
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,110
I'll treat you to some pastries!

627
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,430
Great!

628
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,550
Let's go, time for pastries.

629
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,590
What's wrong?

630
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,430
It's my treat. Take whatever you like.

631
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,790
This one looks good.

632
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,350
This one is super crispy.

633
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,190
This one?

634
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,230
Yes, exactly!

635
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,190
Hua Bolin?

636
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,590
Right, it's him!

637
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,870
Is it really Hua Bolin?

638
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:37,710
Isn't this Hua Boli?

639
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,430
Hua Boli is here too!

640
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,630
Hua Bolin, Hua Boli.

641
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,910
Are you selling food here?

642
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:41,750
Yeah.

643
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,270
What's wrong with selling?

644
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,630
It's not like stealing or robbing.

645
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,870
You two, come here.

646
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,590
I want to buy something.

647
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,390
How much is this one?

648
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,510
What would you like?

649
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,670
Go away.

650
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,350
I'm not talking to you.

651
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,550
I want to buy it from them.

652
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,110
Go away...

653
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:55,870
Why are you shouting?

654
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,390
Everyone, go home.

655
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,310
Or I'll go to your parents.

656
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:01,750
Hurry up.

657
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:04,590
Let's go.

658
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,350
Just leave.

659
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,830
Bolin.

660
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,470
You said that we did nothing wrong.

661
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,510
Why are you ashamed?

662
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,870
I'm not.

663
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,030
I...

664
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,870
I'm no worse than them.

665
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,230
Then why did you hide from them?

666
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,230
Alright.

667
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,230
Today you have one day off.

668
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,270
You two

669
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,350
don't stand here.

670
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,150
Come home with me.

671
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,750
We'll head back.

672
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,190
Go home.

673
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,870
What do you want for dinner?

674
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,230
I'll let the chefs know.

675
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:53,550
Here they are.

676
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,230
They're here!

677
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:54,830
Come on, move.

678
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,990
Little peddler.

679
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,150
Little criminals from the Hua Family,

680
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,030
aren't you selling anymore?

681
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,310
Poor you.

682
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,550
You got kicked out of our academy,

683
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,230
so now you have nowhere to go.

684
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,150
Get out of the way!

685
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,150
Don't look down on us.

686
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,030
We have food and clothing

687
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,190
and we have a place to study.

688
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,190
Our teachers

689
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,830
are much better than yours.

690
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,070
That's right.

691
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:15,750
Let's go.

692
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,470
Ignore them.

693
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,270
Let's go.

694
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,110
This is ridiculous!

695
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,150
Your family runs a shop

696
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,270
and sells food.

697
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,750
You made money

698
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,230
painstakingly.

699
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,430
Your sister has become

700
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,310
a joke in the Imperial Capital.

701
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,190
Shut up!

702
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,910
Little Peddler.

703
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,590
Shut up!

704
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,150
Go to the academy.

705
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,750
Shut up!

706
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,510
What should he do after school?

707
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,910
He sells cowhide candy!

708
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,790
Bolin!

709
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:41,590
Bolin!

710
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,510
Stop fighting!

711
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,950
Stop!

712
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,110
Stop fighting, get up!

713
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,230
I've told you that she's not bad.

714
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,070
Pretty, right?

715
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,630
This pastry lady is really pretty!

716
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,190
Move, I can't see.

717
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,350
I brought you here!

718
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,350
Right.

719
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,150
What are you doing?

720
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,710
Aunt Qi, why did you come back?

721
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,270
Zhi,

722
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,510
making money

723
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:12,030
is never-ending.

724
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,270
We are

725
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,070
not as wealthy as before,

726
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,910
but we have everything we need.

727
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,910
As a young lady,

728
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,510
you are running about all day

729
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,990
and showing up in the public.

730
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,990
This is inappropriate.

731
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,670
When this period is over

732
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,190
and the business is stabilized,

733
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,830
you might as well

734
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,870
leave it to a professional shopkeeper

735
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,230
and accountants.

736
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,950
Aunt Qi, did you hear

737
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,910
some kind of rumor?

738
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,470
Just now, on our way home,

739
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,590
your younger brothers

740
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,110
fought with the other kids.

741
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,190
They got nosebleed.

742
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,310
What happened?

743
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,990
It was nothing serious.

744
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,910
Just some

745
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,150
ignorant children

746
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,430
said that we're lowly merchants.

747
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,270
They also...

748
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,750
They also said bad things about you.

749
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:03,950
Bolin was so angry

750
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,110
that he started to fight with them.

751
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:08,670
Zhi,

752
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:09,910
I think

753
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,950
that the kids are studying hard

754
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,510
just to earn

755
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,990
a good social standing in the future.

756
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,390
If it's just for money

757
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,430
that we degrade ourselves

758
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,270
to the level of merchants and artisans,

759
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,830
won't that be wrong?

760
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,950
Do the boys think the same?

761
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,590
They are too young

762
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,270
to understand these things.

763
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,590
But think about it.

764
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,750
If they consider merchants
as noble ones,

765
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,270
why did they try to hide from

766
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,910
their former friends?

767
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,350
Why did they get angry
upon hearing just a few words

768
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,710
and even fight with the others?

769
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,630
Aunt Qi, what about you?

770
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,070
Are you shamed of me?

771
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,950
Are you ashamed
because we're running a business?

772
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,070
You can't put it that way.

773
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,350
Before, when we had no food or clothing,

774
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,270
not to mention running a business,

775
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,110
even begging

776
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,150
was acceptable.

777
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,430
But now,

778
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,830
things are different.

779
00:30:59,270 --> 00:30:59,990
But Grandfather and the others

780
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,990
are still in the Northern Land!

781
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,070
Forget it, Aunt Qi.

782
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,510
It's getting late.

783
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,990
The work here is almost done.

784
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,350
I'll go home with you.

785
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,630
Let's go.

786
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:28,990
Mother,

787
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,030
you should discipline your maids.

788
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,390
What's wrong?

789
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,390
They've been doing nothing

790
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,310
apart from repeating disgusting words

791
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,030
heard from the idle men out there.

792
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,390
What did they say?

793
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,790
Ling is angry for a reason.

794
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,710
Ever since Zhi

795
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,230
started the business,

796
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,470
there're people

797
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,230
talking about her every single day.

798
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,670
They're not talking about you.

799
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,950
Why are you mad?

800
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,470
Mother, you don't know.

801
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,790
Recently, some idlers

802
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,790
didn't just make up things about Zhi.

803
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,430
They actually...

804
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,830
They actually composed

805
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,870
a series of stories

806
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,550
about the ladies in our family.

807
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,150
They even gave us nicknames.

808
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,550
They gave Ling nickname?

809
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,390
Ling used to be

810
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,870
a well-known and talented

811
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,470
young lady,

812
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,950
so they called her

813
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,230
Lady Scholar.

814
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,710
Lady Scholar?

815
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,470
It sounds

816
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,070
quite decent, isn't it?

817
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,030
What do you know?

818
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:23,070
That was the pseudonym of Xue Hongdu
from the previous dynasty.

819
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,790
That person gained a living
in the brothel.

820
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,310
Those words are unpleasant to hear.

821
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:28,710
But,

822
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:30,550
they do no harm to you.

823
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,590
Don't talk to me
about these things again.

824
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,270
I don't have the time

825
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,670
for your frivolous complaints.

826
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:36,910
There are a lot of things

827
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,790
about the shop

828
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,750
and the mansion

829
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:39,510
that are run by

830
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,830
Zhi and me.

831
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,110
You can't help,

832
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:42,990
but at least you should stop complaining

833
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,230
and let me have some peace.

834
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,070
You and Zhi are

835
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,910
getting so close now.

836
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,390
Don't you care about your own daughter?

837
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,270
You!

838
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,190
She was quiet before,

839
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,630
now she has suddenly wised up.

840
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,990
She's so popular now,

841
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,710
managing the house, opening shops,

842
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,750
and running the academy.

843
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,430
All the good reputations

844
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,310
go to her!

845
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,070
Ling.

846
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,670
Zhi!

847
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,270
Ignore her.

848
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,390
Let me tell you something.

849
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,030
These days,

850
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,350
I have been

851
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,110
so anxious

852
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,670
that I even got sores in my mouth.

853
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,710
I can't even drink water.

854
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,190
Let's hurry and check the accounts.

855
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,670
Why didn't you ask Nianqiu for help?

856
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,630
I was going to talk to you about her.

857
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,710
Come on, let's go.

858
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,110
Come here.

859
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,230
Zhi,

860
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,950
this is the girl you've taught.

861
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,710
And these are the accounts she managed.

862
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,110
Yesterday,

863
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,790
I was so busy that I didn't even sleep.

864
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:43,950
I knew

865
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,110
that you were busy with the shop,

866
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,070
so I asked

867
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,070
for her help.

868
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:47,910
However,

869
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,990
it took ages for her to get here.

870
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:50,790
What's more,

871
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,950
today

872
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:52,670
she finally came,

873
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,070
but right under my watch,

874
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,390
she miscalculated several entries.

875
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,190
Such a troublemaker

876
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,510
should have been kicked out long ago!

877
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,910
We don't keep freeloaders in our house!

878
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,350
Seriously,

879
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,510
I know that she's pitiful

880
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:04,830
and you wanted to help her.

881
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,070
But she is

882
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,670
really not that smart.

883
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:08,750
No matter what I did to teach her,

884
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:09,710
she just couldn't learn!

885
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,070
If I keep her here,

886
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,670
she won't do any help.

887
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:14,790
Also, nowadays,

888
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,550
there's so much work to do in the shop.

889
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,430
With everything together,

890
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,110
so many details need to be managed

891
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,390
and countless transactions
need to be recorded.

892
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,510
There are the expenses
on food, clothing, and necessities.

893
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,430
All sorts of details as well.

894
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,830
I'm already exhausted,

895
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:27,710
yet I still can't finish the job.

896
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,150
I'm not going to

897
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,310
let this fool

898
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,310
piss me off to death!

899
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:33,990
In any case,

900
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,870
I don't want her anymore.

901
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,870
Please take her back

902
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,030
and do whatever you want with her.

903
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,110
I'm so angry.

904
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:43,110
Get up.

905
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,830
Why did you miscalculate?

906
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,310
The more scared I was,

907
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,870
the more mistakes I made.

908
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,710
The more mistakes I made,

909
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:54,950
the more scared I got.

910
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:02,990
Go to Shaoyao for applying medicine

911
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,830
and then take a rest.

912
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:20,550
Madam,

913
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,030
you've been working all night.

914
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,030
And that Nianqiu

915
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,990
couldn't help you.

916
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,990
If you keep pushing yourself like this,

917
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,230
you might fall ill.

918
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,150
That would be terrible.

919
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,670
What else can I do?

920
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,390
The better the business goes,

921
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,870
the more work for me to do.

922
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:33,990
Look,

923
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,590
the account books on this desk

924
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,990
are as high as mountains!

925
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:38,990
I have to check each transaction

926
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,550
and make sure
that every number is correct.

927
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,070
I can't allow the slightest error.

928
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:44,870
I...

929
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:45,990
I'm having a headache.

930
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,470
It hurts.

931
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,110
Madam,

932
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,590
why don't you just

933
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,030
hand over these accounts

934
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,110
to Lazy Zhi?

935
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,270
Even I can't manage,

936
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,670
how would she cope with them?

937
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:57,310
Can she grow an extra pair of hands
to do more?

938
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,870
But, nothing

939
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,350
is as crucial as your health.

940
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:03,990
I'm wondering

941
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,790
I used to be

942
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,990
in charge of the whole family.

943
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,430
How come I became so muddled now?

944
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,990
I shouldn't have been doing this alone.

945
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:13,550
Yinzhu,

946
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,190
make a trip

947
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,150
to the Xia family's cloth shop

948
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,150
and find Xia Ming.

949
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,110
Tell him

950
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,910
to come see me.

951
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,510
Who is Xia Ming?

952
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,830
A servant who was in my parents' place.

953
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,190
When he was little,

954
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,150
he learned accounting from me.

955
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,870
When I got married,

956
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,030
I even recommended him

957
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:28,910
to be the assistant-manager.

958
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,270
I heard he's been

959
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,990
doing great.

960
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,430
I myself can't cope with everything.

961
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,030
I need someone I can trust

962
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,030
to help me.

963
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:36,710
Right?

964
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,310
Otherwise,

965
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,710
I'm going to exhaust myself.

966
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,830
I'll go right now.

967
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,030
Yinzhu,

968
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,150
don't let anyone see you.

969
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,710
For now, don't let Zhi

970
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:45,830
and Madam Hua know,

971
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,990
in case they get suspicious.

972
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,750
I understand, don't worry.

973
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,670
As a young lady,

974
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,870
you are running around all day

975
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:24,950
and showing up in public.

976
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,630
This is inappropriate.

977
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,910
When this period is over,

978
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,550
and the business is stabilized,

979
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:31,790
you might as well

980
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,750
leave it to a professional shopkeeper

981
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,990
and accountants.

982
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,550
She was quiet before,

983
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:37,990
now she has suddenly wised up.

984
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,390
She's so popular now,

985
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,230
managing the house, opening shops

986
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,310
and running the academy.

987
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,710
All the good reputations

988
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,590
go to her!

989
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,430
This is the girl you've taught.

990
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,990
Right under my watch,

991
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,230
she miscalculated several entries...

992
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,150
It's so late
that even the horses are asleep.

993
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,710
And there are no classes to attend.

994
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,710
I came here just to sit for a while.

995
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,190
Finally feeling tired?

996
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,430
The weather is nice today.

997
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,710
There are more stars than usual.

998
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,910
How long has it been
since you last watched the stars?

999
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,510
I forgot.

1000
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,870
I thought

1001
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,310
I could be free,

1002
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,590
doing whatever I want.

1003
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,990
But I've been so busy

1004
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,790
that I don't even have the time

1005
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,590
to look up at the sky.

1006
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,030
The last time
I was sitting here doing nothing

1007
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,510
was back when the disaster

1008
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,630
hasn't happened to Grandfather.

1009
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,670
You just forgot to rest.

1010
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,950
I will remind you next time.

1011
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,670
Are you cold?

1012
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,910
Is there anything bothering you?

1013
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,550
Nothing big,

1014
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,350
but It's annoying.

1015
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:25,950
Tell me.

1016
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:29,710
