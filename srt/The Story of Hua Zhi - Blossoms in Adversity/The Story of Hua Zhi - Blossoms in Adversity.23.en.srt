00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,560
there's no such thing
in the law of Daqing.

190
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,390
It's not in the law indeed,

191
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,600
but in the second year of Mingfeng,

192
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,750
the sixth year, and the eleventh year,

193
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,750
there were precedents
that involved fines.

194
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,720
The cases you mentioned

195
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,950
were adjudicated during the years

196
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,800
when Grandfather was still a prince

197
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,630
and served as a magistrate.

198
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,240
Your Highness, as you say.

199
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,430
Fine.

200
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,800
Yang Qi and Hua Xian's mutual divorce
is granted.

201
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,600
Yang Qi must pay two hundred guan

202
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,680
to Hua Xian

203
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,870
within one month.

204
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,600
If you fail to pay,
you will be detained.

205
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,950
And given a hundred strokes of the cane.

206
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,720
We did it!

207
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,240
Your Highness.

208
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,120
This is great!

209
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,750
You...

210
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,390
You're killing me.

211
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,870
We don't want that.

212
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,000
We want you to sell your house and land

213
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,950
and pay your debt.

214
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,120
You...

215
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:09,660
[Qijing Government Office]

216
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,270
Where is he?

217
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,070
How come

218
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,070
you fancy

219
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,830
such a sharp-tongued lady?

220
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,630
She might sue you one day.

221
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,870
I'm not afraid of that,

222
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,670
Look out for yourself, Your Highness.

223
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,270
I am a bachelor out and out.

224
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,270
Look

225
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:38,910
what you are wearing now.

226
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,200
You are really dedicated

227
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,390
to working for her, huh?

228
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,270
Haven't been there in a while.

229
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,720
You aren't serious about her, right?

230
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,750
What do you think?

231
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,200
Yanxi.

232
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,510
Let's make a bet.

233
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,320
On?

234
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,480
One month later,

235
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
if you haven't got tired of her,

236
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,320
then I'll gift you

237
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,200
a piece of Mandarin duck brocade.

238
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,030
Three months later,

239
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,630
if you two are still lovey-dovey,

240
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,600
I'll gift her
a white jade Guanyin statue.

241
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,670
And what if it goes beyond that?

242
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,960
Beyond that?

243
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,600
Don't tell me

244
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,270
that you could be together
for half a year.

245
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,120
Fine then.

246
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,270
This time,

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,790
you owe me a favor.

248
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,790
I just asked you to uphold justice,

249
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,960
but I didn't say for whom.

250
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,790
You're the young lord.

251
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,910
You can't renege.

252
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,790
You'd better start to think

253
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,150
about how to repay me.

254
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,870
I am just an idle man without a job.

255
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,240
I am not capable

256
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,870
of returning the favor.

257
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,630
When it comes to
leading troops into battle,

258
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,630
none of the young commanders in Court

259
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,550
can match you.

260
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,390
Now the world is at peace,

261
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,270
there's no war to fight.

262
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,120
I'm afraid I can't return this favor.

263
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,480
You never know.

264
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,630
Let's wait and see.

265
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,080
Maybe someday you can return the favor.

266
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,080
It sounds like

267
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,440
you have known that day would come.

268
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,630
Be careful with your words.

269
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,870
Come on, drink some tea.

270
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,670
The tea is quite nice indeed.

271
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,840
I'll take it.

272
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,270
Consider it as another favor

273
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,120
and I'll return it one day.

274
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,200
Gu Yanxi.

275
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,630
Since you returned
from the northern land,

276
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,670
you've become even more annoying.

277
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,870
Speaking of which,

278
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,720
how are things
between you and your father?

279
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,030
I've heard

280
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,550
Father has ordered
you must reconcile with your father.

281
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,030
I shall take my leave.

282
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,960
Lord Ling and Gu Yanxi

283
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,030
are both held
in the palm of Father's hand.

284
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,200
Enjoying fine tea together
at the hour of Hai.

285
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,790
Sir.

286
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,750
Well...

287
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,440
Well...

288
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,080
What is it?

289
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,790
There was a message
from Lord Ling's Mansion.

290
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,600
Lord Ling wanted you to go home.

291
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,120
It was about his condition.

292
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,200
He is not well.

293
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,200
Anything else?

294
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,000
That's all.

295
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,630
Stop.

296
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,670
Let's call it a day.

297
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,960
Last time

298
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,840
Lord Ling was furious.

299
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,440
His Highness has been acting strange
these past few days.

300
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,630
No one is allowed
to go near his bedchamber

301
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,270
at night.

302
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,200
And not a corner in the mansion
can be left dark.

303
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,960
Look how bright it is in his bedchamber.

304
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,200
I heard it's because he's afraid
that someone might harm him.

305
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,200
I've heard as much.

306
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,390
His Highness is now afraid of the dark

307
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,440
and to sleep.

308
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,270
He grows more haggard
with each passing day.

309
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,270
Let's head back.

310
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,550
Help!

311
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,120
The bedchamber is on fire!

312
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,240
Put out the fire!

313
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,840
Hurry up!

314
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:40,670
Hurry up!

315
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:41,790
Hurry up!

316
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,320
The water's here!

317
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,000
The water's here!

318
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,030
Over here, this way!

319
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,960
Hurry up!

320
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,270
Put out the fire!

321
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,550
The chamber is on fire!
Put out the fire!

322
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,440
Hurry up!

323
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,720
Quick!

324
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,360
Your Highness.

325
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,670
Lord Ling's bedchamber is on fire!

326
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,480
Hurry up!

327
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,550
The water is here!

328
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,840
Where is the house

329
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,320
you are interested in?

330
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,750
Come on.

331
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,360
It's right at the end of this street.

332
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
It's a bit small,

333
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,960
but it's enough for my son and me.

334
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,750
You're just a stone's throw away.

335
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,750
A very short distance.

336
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,390
It's also convenient for Sui'an
to go to school.

337
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,270
I can go with you
to check the house tomorrow

338
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,200
and see how it is.

339
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,670
Okay.

340
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:26,960
Zhi.

341
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,480
The head of the family.

342
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,200
Do a little speech.

343
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,080
Everyone,

344
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,630
we're having a banquet here

345
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,670
to celebrate Auntie Hua Xian and Sui'an

346
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,240
finally starting their new life.

347
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,360
And also

348
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,600
for Aunt Wu and her healthy daughter.

349
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,750
Our family

350
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,960
has a new girl now.

351
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Let's all have a drink together.

352
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:50,870
Cheers.

353
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

354
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,510
Let's drink it.

355
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,320
Yuniang, you had just given birth.

356
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,720
Zhi, you are the closest to her.

357
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,630
You should drink that for her.

358
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,360
Zhi, come on.

359
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,270
Okay.

360
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,270
Then I'll have another drink
on behalf of Aunt Wu.

361
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,200
Another one for me, please.

362
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,270
This is delicious.

363
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,080
How nice we are now.

364
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,790
There are more and more people

365
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,480
in our family.

366
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,440
They were part of our family before.

367
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,910
Now they just come back to us.

368
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,670
It's Zhi

369
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,840
who brought them back.

370
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,150
I used to think

371
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,790
that once married,

372
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,120
there was no home for us women.

373
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,240
But now,

374
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,200
Ergui has returned.

375
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,270
And Xian has ended her misery.

376
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,600
Just by looking at you by my side,

377
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,150
I feel peace inside.

378
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,600
Anyway, from now on,

379
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,550
whatever we encounter,

380
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,480
we will always have a home to return to.

381
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,960
No matter what happens,

382
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,750
our Zhi

383
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,510
will never leave any of us behind.

384
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,480
Zhi.

385
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,670
I...

386
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:09,960
Thank you.

387
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,960
Let's try this.

388
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,390
I want to thank you too, Zhi.

389
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,550
Ergui.

390
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,440
Easy on the wine.

391
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,030
I'm a big girl, Mother.

392
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,550
All you two know is a simple thank-you.

393
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,670
There's so much left to say.

394
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,720
But that's alright.

395
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,720
How about

396
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,750
each one of us,

397
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,630
one by one,

398
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,000
raise a toast to Zhi?

399
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,840
Okay.

400
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,510
Come on.

401
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,390
Come on. Drink up.

402
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Gu Yanxi,

403
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,750
the moonlight is beautiful tonight.

404
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,320
Where are you?

405
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,270
Yanxi.

406
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:17,870
Let me hold you for a while.

407
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,670
Just for a while.

408
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,120
What's wrong?

409
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,630
Don't look at me.

410
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,360
Look at the sky.

411
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,120
The moonlight is very beautiful tonight.

412
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,630
Okay.

413
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,960
Do you remember the moonlight

414
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,000
of the Lantern Festival that year?

415
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,320
It was beautiful,

416
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,200
just like today.

417
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What happened?

418
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,270
Lord Ling's Mansion was on fire.

419
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,590
So was its owner.

420
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,110
Tomorrow,

421
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,720
people will all be talking about it,

422
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,350
but those talking

423
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,350
will eventually fade away.

424
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,880
Just like my mother's death,

425
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,720
it will turn

426
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,510
into some gossip over a cup of tea

427
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,680
and the truth
that never sees the light of day.

428
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,400
You didn't come to the banquet today.

429
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,270
Fudong prepared
several pots of fine wine.

430
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,160
You missed it.

431
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,310
Is that so?

432
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,510
That's such a pity.

433
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440

Your Majesty, it's been taken care of.

451
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,830
It's been twenty years.

452
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,070
This scar

453
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,550
has finally been healed.

454
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,070
Yanxi should finally

455
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
get over his mother's death.

456
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,960
Sir, this...

457
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,680
Take it.

458
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,790
It's a reward from His Majesty.

459
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,350
You've done your job well.

460
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,110
My thanks to His Majesty.

461
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,960
And thank you, sir.

462
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,590
[Lord Xian's Mansion]

463
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,160
Last night, Lord Ling...

464
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,240
They say there was a fire by accident.

465
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,790
I don't believe it was an accident.

466
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
It really surprised me.

467
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,070
His Majesty has been the Emperor
for twenty years

468
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,590
and getting old day by day.

469
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,880
But his cruelty

470
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,590
never gets old.

471
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,400
His Majesty has just issued an order.

472
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,110
He wants Your Highness

473
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,590
to investigate Lord Ling's death.

474
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,790
Investigate?

475
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,400
He is clearly taking this chance

476
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,200
to send me a message

477
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,110
and warn me

478
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,400
not to become

479
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,960
a thorn in his heart.

480
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,000
Otherwise...

481
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,310
Here it comes.

482
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,310
The hot mugwort water is here.

483
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,310
Everyone make some room.

484
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,590
Here it comes.

485
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,480
The mugwort water is here.

486
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,200
Careful.

487
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,070
Slow down.

488
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,070
Running so fast
doesn't earn you a reward.

489
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,070
Madam Xia.

490
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,550
It's not up to you today.

491
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,960
I am waiting for Madam Wu's reward.

492
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,000
I can't remember

493
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,110
when was the last time

494
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:05,960
we had the baby-bathing ceremony.

495
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,310
It was when Duo was born.

496
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,350
In the blink of an eye,

497
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,750
it's actually been six years.

498
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,750
Yes.

499
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,310
Where is Zhi?

500
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,920
If she doesn't come soon,
the water will go cold.

501
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,960
Zhi has a lot of things to do.

502
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,400
Jin'e, you can host it.

503
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,070
Alright then.

504
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,110
Come on.

505
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,160
Put our gifts into the basin.

506
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,160
- My gift for the baby.
- Mine.

507
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,000
Mine.

508
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:21,960
Mine too.

509
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:22,750
Good girl.

510
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,160
You have all put your gifts?

511
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:24,720
All good?

512
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,400
- All good.
- Come on, baby.

513
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,310
Yuniang.

514
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,400
Put the girl's hands into the basin

515
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,200
and wash them with the mugwort water.

516
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,310
- Careful.
- Careful.

517
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,790
You forgot my gift.

518
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:32,590
Zhi.

519
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,030
Zhi.

520
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,030
You've arrived just in time.

521
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,200
We are just about to start.

522
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,640
Mr. Yan, you've come.

523
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,590
Mr. Yan,

524
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,920
the girl is pretty cute, right?

525
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,920
Very cute.

526
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,790
Well, if you say so,

527
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,350
you have to reward such a cute girl.

528
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,480
Mr. Yan is a guest, after all.

529
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,720
It's very nice of him
to be here today already.

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,720
Don't ask him for a gift.

531
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Just ignore her.

532
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,790
All she can see is money now.

533
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
She will also be my student one day.

534
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,070
So I have prepared my gift

535
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,790
for today.

536
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,830
I can't accept that, Mr. Yan.

537
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
This is too valuable.

538
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,750
When she grows up,

539
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,270
I'll give her
an even more valuable gift.

540
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,480
Don't be so distant with Mr. Yan.

541
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,510
He bought an expensive gift indeed,

542
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:15,750
but Zhi is right here.

543
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,030
Zhi can't let Mr. Yan starve, right?

544
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,160
Right.

545
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,830
Zhi.

546
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,000
Remember

547
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,830
to give Mr. Yan a raise.

548
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,000
The water's getting cold.

549
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,960
Quick.

550
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,830
- Look at her tiny hands.
- Look at her tiny hands.

551
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,750
- Look at her tiny hands.
- Let's wash your hands.

552
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,400
Great.

553
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,960
I think this little girl here

554
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,680
might make more money than Zhi
when she grows up.

555
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,070
Then she must grow faster,

556
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,240
so she can help me out.

557
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,030
Zhi, hold the baby.

558
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,960
Can I hold her?

559
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,070
Here.

560
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,270
Yuniang.

561
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,200
The girl doesn't

562
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,590
have a pet name yet.

563
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,440
Silly new mother.

564
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,400
Give the girl a name.

565
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,200
I'm not well-read.

566
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,350
I can't think of a good name
at the moment.

567
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,750
I need more time.

568
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,590
This is easy.

569
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,440
You can

570
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,550
go ask Master Mu and prepare

571
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,070
a box of his favorite pastries.

572
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
He is the most knowledgeable person

573
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,160
in the entire Imperial Capital.

574
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,350
That's right.

575
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,720
Hurry up.

576
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,550
Actually,

577
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,200
I prepared an extra gift for her.

578
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,550
When did you

579
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,920
learn to squander money?

580
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,510
How is that squandering money?

581
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,310
I went to Taihe Restaurant

582
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,030
and bought eighteen jars

583
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,160
of the best spring wine

584
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,110
and buried them in the bamboo forest
of Zihuang Residence.

585
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,110
Zhi.

586
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,790
I was right there

587
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,750
when she was born.

588
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,590
I can't love her enough.

589
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,590
Aunt Wu,

590
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,070
do you want to wait

591
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,000
until Uncle Pingyang is back

592
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,510
and name your daughter?

593
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,400
When I was still unmarried,

594
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,510
I didn't expect

595
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,270
to meet someone like him.

596
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,070
And I have never imagined

597
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,680
us having kids after marriage.

598
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,110
Now I have a baby daughter,

599
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,270
but everything is completely different.

600
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,400
I've always been curious.

601
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,510
You're such a serene and demure lady.

602
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,070
And Uncle Pingyang

603
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,750
is the most wayward person
in our family.

604
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,750
How come you got to know each other?

605
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,270
Don't laugh if I tell you.

606
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,030
I had a good voice when I was younger,

607
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,750
I often sang to amuse myself

608
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,480
when I got bored at home.

609
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,350
Being an unmarried daughter
of an official,

610
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,070
singing songs wasn't considered

611
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,070
a decent hobby.

612
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,350
So

613
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,200
I could only sing in the garden
occasionally

614
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,920
for a short while

615
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,350
and entertain myself.

616
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,520
♪After a night of falling frost♪

617
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,560
♪All the trees by the lakeside
seem to be dyed in white♪

618
00:24:59,070 --> 00:24:59,720
You silly horse.

619
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,880
I'm listening to the song here.

620
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,270
Listen.

621
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,240
This is the most beautiful voice

622
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:10,360
I've ever heard.

623
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,240
Wonderful.

624
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,920
You must be the best singer

625
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,240
in the Imperial Capital!

626
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,750
May I ask

627
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,030
who did you learn from?

628
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,350
Who is that?

629
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,240
How could there be

630
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,440
such an impudent rascal?

631
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,590
Let's go.

632
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,240
Tell me, horse.

633
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,880
Can I hear her sing again today?

634
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,270
Young Lady.

635
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,790
The doorman said

636
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,720
that the young lad

637
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,110
had been standing outside these days.

638
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,240
Such a nuisance.

639
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,110
What is he doing standing out there?

640
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,440
Who knows?

641
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,880
But don't be afraid.

642
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,240
If he dares do anything,

643
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,750
you can tell Master to break his legs.

644
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
But he hasn't really done anything.

645
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,770
[Please forgive my rudeness]

646
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,000
Young Lady.

647
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,550
What is written on it?

648
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,400
Who knows?

649
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,680
Here comes another one.

650
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,790
Ever since I heard you singing
the other day,

651
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,200
my ears were momentarily enlightened
as if hearing celestial music.

652
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,680
What kind of silly poetry is that?

653
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,340
♪Only one way leads to Yu Temple
and Lan Pavilion through the ages♪

654
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,640
♪After a night of falling frost♪

655
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,590
He had a great understanding of music.

656
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,030
Each time I sang a song,

657
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,590
he'd write a comment on his kite.

658
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,680
Rather than calling it a comment,

659
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,110
it was more like a compliment.

660
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,000
Then I realized at that time

661
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,480
what bosom friends meant.

662
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,510
And later,

663
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,880
he came to hear me sing every day.

664
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,000
Young Lady.

665
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,030
The kite.

666
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,440
Every time he arrived,

667
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,960
he would fly his kite.

668
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,270
Then I would know he was outside.

669
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,960
I didn't know
if he was a tall handsome man.

670
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,480
And he didn't know

671
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,110
if I was a fair lady.

672
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,550
It went on like that

673
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,160
for a whole half year.

674
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,670
♪Please keep one thing in mind♪

675
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:24,440
♪Only idle people can live a cozy life♪

676
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,750
The beauty in the building
is playing the jade flute

677
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,640
while learning language of the phoenix
on Dan Mountain.

678
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,270
Phoenix, phoenix, will you come?

679
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,160
Where is the person I long for?

680
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,110
The jade flute-playing beauty.

681
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,030
Language of the phoenix.

682
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,960
Giddy up.

683
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,240
Wait for me.

684
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,880
I shall come to ask for your hand.

685
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,960
It was a little scary
to think about that afterwards.

686
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,880
I had never met him in person.

687
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,270
Our connection was solely through music.

688
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,480
If he were ugly,

689
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,350
that would be bearable.

690
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,200
But if he were vile

691
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,680
or even deceitful,

692
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,550
I would be doomed.

693
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,030
Yet you still married him.

694
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,400
Yeah.

695
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,960
If I were to choose again,

696
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,030
I would still marry him.

697
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,640
That's what love is like.

698
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,640
It's like

699
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
walking onto a single-plank bridge
with your eyes closed.

700
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,550
You are fully aware
that the slightest misstep

701
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,000
would cost your life

702
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,960
and there would be no going back.

703
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,640
But if I hadn't said that to him

704
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,160
and taken a step forward,

705
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,680
I would surely regret it
in this lifetime.

706
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,830
Now I think

707
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,640
maybe it's a little scary

708
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,830
to marry a man

709
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,880
that you have never met face to face.

710
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,070
But then I think,

711
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,830
if I had missed Pingyang

712
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,270
and failed to know him

713
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,590
and stay by his side

714
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,510
in this life,

715
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,310
that would truly be terrifying.

716
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,830
I spent all my luck

717
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,680
and courage

718
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,510
on that day.

719
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,110
Uncle Pingyang

720
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,270
also chose to take a step forward.

721
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,270
He also crossed the single-plank bridge.

722
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,480
So

723
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:09,240
you two became a fine couple.

724
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,310
This one tastes better.

725
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,070
This?

726
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,200
You like it?

727
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,480
I want this one.

728
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,440
Alright.

729
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,110
Our income comes in steadily

730
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,550
and gradually adds up.

731
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,030
The cash box is almost filled.

732
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,240
I wonder how they are doing
in the northern land,

733
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,590
and if they have enough
clothing and food.

734
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,110
Hurry up.

735
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,640
What are you doing?

736
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,720
Useless.

737
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
I'll make you taste the whip today!

738
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,400
How does it feel?

739
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,440
Feel good?

740
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,750
Good?

741
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,680
Stop it.

742
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,400
My brother is frail.

743
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,510
He has been weak since he was young.

744
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,750
He just made a slip,

745
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,680
but it wasn't intentional.

746
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,030
Even if we are sinners,

747
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,510
we're already helping to build dams

748
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,480
in the Sanbai City to guard the borders.

749
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,240
You are an officer

750
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,590
who is fed
by the salary of Daqing Nation.

751
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,590
How can you be so cruel

752
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,240
as to humiliate him
and treat him like an animal?

753
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:28,960
Pingyu,

754
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,750
don't say anything.

755
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,590
Humiliate?

756
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,030
Still putting on airs here

757
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,400
like the famous family
in a high position, huh?

758
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,790
The whip in my hand

759
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,070
doesn't know who you are.

760
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,880
You want to stand up for your brother?

761
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,590
Fine.

762
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,350
Finish all of his work today.

763
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,070
If you can't finish,

764
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,240
none of you leaves.

765
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,000
Try me!

766
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,440
Officer,

767
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,350
please accept it.

768
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:47,310
Take it for a drink

769
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,350
to warm up.

770
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,200
You want to fob me off
with that little money?

771
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,070
Who am I?

772
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,400
A beggar?

773
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,440
Do you still think

774
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,550
you're high-ranking officials?

775
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,160
Today,

776
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,960
I am going

777
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
to teach you three a lesson.

778
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,350
Officer.

779
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
Why are you still here?

780
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,480
What?

781
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,440
Don't you know?

782
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,070
General Wu is coming
for an inspection today.

783
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,350
The other officers
have all rushed over there.

784
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,270
General Wu?

785
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,510
Pingyang.

786
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,270
General Wu is really here?

787
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,310
You.

788
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,640
You're always the quick-witted one.

789
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,830
Who would have thought

790
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,110
we'd be yet living such lives
at this age?

791
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,350
Pingyu.

792
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,830
I'm still worried about our family.

793
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I want to know

794
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,510
if my wife and son are doing well.

795
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Look at this place.

796
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,070
I don't even know

797
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,960
if we can make it back alive.

798
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,590
Everyone shut up.

799
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,310
With his age,

800
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,070
Father is still moving rocks on the dam,

801
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,590
and yet you're in self-pity?

802
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,240
You are all big and strong.

803
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,400
You think this is difficult?

804
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,680
Then you're no better
than women and children.

805
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,270
After everything that's happened,

806
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,640
our women might have to endure

807
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,200
even a lot more to get by.

808
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
Madam Qi.

809
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,590
You make a late-night snack

810
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,110
for Boli?

811
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,550
Yes.

812
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,550
I am pretty tired.

813
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,680
You can keep him company for a while.

814
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:31,790
Madam Qi.

815
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,070
You've made soup for Boli?

816
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,680
Yes, I have.

817
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,440
He studies hard at night

818
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,880
and gets hungry easily.

819
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,790
I just learned how to make these.

820
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,510
It's my first time making them.

821
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,480
They surely can't compare to Fudong's,

822
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,310
but I've tasted one.

823
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,590
It's not too bad.

824
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,160
So?

825
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,720
Please do try some.

826
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,440
Come.

827
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,920
Mother.

828
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,190
Please have one.

829
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,670
It's my first time

830
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,360
making this soup as well.

831
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,840
You can try it.

832
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,440
Okay.

833
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,550
It tastes so good.

834
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,190
We've got that much?

835
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,440
Are you sure?

836
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,590
I've counted it three times.

837
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,400
It is the right number.

838
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,800
We've saved up so much money.

839
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,710
Who would have known?

840
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,960
Aunt Xia,

841
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,030
bring everyone to the main hall.

842
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,880
I have something to say.

843
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,800
Why did you

844
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,550
hire a painter here

845
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,710
to paint the two of us?

846
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Lady Zhi arranged this.

847
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,110
I just did what she told me.

848
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,550
Where is Zhi?

849
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,480
I will go and ask her.

850
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,400
She's in the main hall

851
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,710
discussing something with everyone.

852
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,800
Okay.

853
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,230
Please look after her for a while.

854
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,000
Zhi.

855
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,480
I was about to inform you later.

856
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,150
Seems you can't wait.

857
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,800
Have a seat.

858
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,070
Zhi.

859
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
You've gathered us all here.

860
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,590
What is it about?

861
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,400
I still need

862
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,710
to help Boli with his homework.

863
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,760
Up to now,

864
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,960
the profits of the Hua's

865
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,150
hit half a million.

866
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Half a million?

867
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,030
That much?

868
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,230
Half a million.

869
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,840
I remember you said

870
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
that if we saved up half a million,

871
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,630
according to the law of Daqing,

872
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,110
we...

873
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,710
Mother.

874
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,510
We've really

875
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,630
earned enough ransom money

876
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,960
to pardon them from exile.

877
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,150
That would be great!

878
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,320
Back then

879
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
when Zhi talked about it,

880
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,920
I thought she was daydreaming.

881
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,880
Who would have thought

882
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,760
it would actually come true?

883
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,590
Remarkable.

884
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,190
But the money

885
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,360
can only redeem one person.

886
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,590
Exactly.

887
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,360
That's why

888
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
I've gathered everyone here to discuss

889
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,760
how we should

890
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,840
use the money.

891
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,480
If we are to redeem someone,

892
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
who should that be?

893
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,760
I think

894
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,000
Grandfather is old.

895
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,670
We should bring him back first.

896
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,670
What's there to discuss?

897
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,230
The money is only enough for one person.

898
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,670
Of course, we should

899
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,590
redeem Father first.

900
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,800
A teenage boy like Boyu

901
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,000
can handle the hardship.

902
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,400
I agree

903
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,230
with what you think.

904
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,190
Where do we go to redeem him?

905
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,960
And who should we give the money to?

906
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,880
Mother.

907
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,550
Grandfather and the others are now

908
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,030
in Sanbai City in the northern land.

909
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,880
This ransom must be delivered there

910
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,280
to the government office of Sanbai City.

911
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,920
So I have decided to set off
with the money

912
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
to the northern land

913
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,710
in ten days.

914
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,400
So that means

915
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,280
you can see Boyu and the others?

916
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,710
Please prepare a batch

917
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,710
of clothes, shoes, and hats.

918
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,070
And also prepare
medicinal herbs and food.

919
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,630
The more, the better.

920
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,110
Alright.

921
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,400
I will go prepare them right now.

922
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,320
I will go prepare right now.

923
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,880
I'll go with you.

924
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,070
Come on. Let's go.

925
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,760
We can help each other, quick.

926
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,280
Come on.

927
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,590
You go prepare...

928
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,320
Zhi.

929
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,510
You've hired a painter

930
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,320
because you want

931
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,590
to take the portrait
of me and the kid north,

932
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,280
right?

933
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,670
I plan

934
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,550
to give Uncle Pingyang a surprise.

935
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,070
I'll go back right now

936
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,320
to apologize to the painter.

937
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,760
I need to ask him
to paint me a bit plumper

938
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,400
so that Pingyang will be reassured.

939
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,440
Zhi.

940
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,960
I was too excited and forgot to ask you.

941
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,280
You're going to the northern land

942
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,480
all by yourself?

943
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,550
Of course not.

944
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,000
Even though I go out to do business,

945
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,230
I will bring the servants and guardians

946
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,150
along with a caravan of horses.

947
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,190
I was confused.

948
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,920
Mr. Yan

949
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,360
is the head of the guardians.

950
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,710
Will he go with you

951
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,550
and protect you by your side?

952
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,590
He has other things to do.

953
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
I won't bother him then.

954
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,630
He gets his monthly allowance

955
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,320
from us every month.

956
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,480
What is more important than you?

957
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,590
Mother.

958
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,590
I will take care of myself.

959
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,110
Young Lady.

960
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,030
Yingchun.

961
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,800
How long has it been
since Mr. Yan came here?

962
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,190
It's been about three days.

963
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,840
Young Lady.

964
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,000
What is Mr. Yan's occupation

965
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,190
outside here?

966
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,670
How come he's just like vanished

967
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,760
when he gets busy?

968
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,550
He's handling some important matters.

969
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,150
It's alright if he doesn't come back.

970
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,070
As long as he's safe.

971
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,000
We can tell him I'm heading north

972
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,280
after he comes back.

973
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:30,590
Okay.

974
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,760
Watch out.

975
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:54,960
Hurry.

976
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,280
Stop right there!

977
00:39:59,150 --> 00:39:59,670
Don't run!

978
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,400
Stop right there!

979
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,230
Quick!

980
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,110
Over there!

981
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,190
Quick!

982
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,320
Sir.

983
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,280
We got him.

984
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
He's the spy of the Zhao Empire

985
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,630
that escaped from us.

986
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,230
We have searched the lairs

987
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,960
of those spies inside and outside

988
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,710
the Imperial Capital.

989
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,000
So where did this one come from?

990
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,670
Perhaps he came to deliver a letter.

991
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,800
But he was unlucky

992
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,880
to run into us.

993
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:39,760
No letter in there.

994
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,590
There was.

995
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,230
He ate it before I caught him.

996
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,550
He ate it?

997
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,000
He would've eaten the tube
if I'd been slower.

998
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,670
His body is still warm,

999
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,510
so the letter is still there.

1000
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,190
Dissect him.

1001
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,030
Sir.

1002
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,710
He entered the city with a letter
the day before yesterday,

1003
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,280
but we intercepted it
before it was delivered.

1004
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,550
And he killed himself on the spot.

1005
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,440
It really surprised me.

1006
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,110
General Wu,

1007
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,550
the General of the Northern Defense
appointed by me,

1008
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,960
colluded with
the people of the Zhao Empire.

1009
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,440
With a person like him
guarding the border for me,

1010
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,920
it's no different
from inviting enemies into our land.

1011
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,110
Yanxi.

1012
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,710
Handle him for me.

1013
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,190
Your Majesty.

1014
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,760
I have garrisoned in the northern camp
for ten years.

1015
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,360
I know General Wu well.

1016
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,960
There might be more to this matter.

1017
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,280
Many of our capable soldiers sacrificed.

1018
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,320
If we lose Wu Yong as well,

1019
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,710
the northern land
will become a weak point.

1020
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,590
Even if we appoint a new general there,

1021
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
I'm afraid
he won't be accepted by the troops.

1022
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,630
Are you suggesting

1023
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,030
that he has been wronged?

1024
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,480
I don't know

1025
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,710
if he was wronged.

1026
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,190
This is crucial.

1027
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
I am willing to go to the northern land

1028
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,230
to make a thorough investigation.

1029
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,070
If he really is in collusion
with the Zhao Empire,

1030
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,230
I will certainly

1031
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,030
execute him on the spot.

1032
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,110
Sir.

1033
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,480
This is so sudden.

1034
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,920
We haven't prepared anything yet.

1035
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:12,400
So you're not going?

1036
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,840
If so, I will find someone else.

1037
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,440
No.

1038
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:16,230
Sir.

1039
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,230
I... I didn't mean that.

1040
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,400
What I mean is

1041
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,230
that we need to bring more clothes.

1042
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,630
Sir.

1043
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,070
If he won't go, I will.

1044
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
I've never been
to the northern land before.

1045
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,070
Go away.

1046
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,960
Adults are talking here.

1047
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,320
Sir.

1048
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,630
Even if we ride fast to the north,

1049
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,840
the round trip
will take more than twenty days.

1050
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,280
What about

1051
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,110
Miss Hua?

1052
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,800
I will tell her.

1053
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,230
Slow down.

1054
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:41,550
It's hot!

1055
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,840
Let me get one for you.

1056
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,550
Don't take this one.

1057
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,800
It's not cooked through yet.

1058
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,550
This one is ready.

1059
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,590
Careful, it's hot.

1060
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,670
Mr. Yan is back.

1061
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,590
Mr. Yan.

1062
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,320
Mr. Yan.

1063
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,920
Have an orange.

1064
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:58,920
No, thanks.

1065
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,400
Have you seen Hua Zhi?

1066
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,150
She was here just after class ended.

1067
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,510
She walked around the yard

1068
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,190
and then left.

1069
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,840
She's probably
in the accounting room now.

1070
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,110
I'll go have a look.
