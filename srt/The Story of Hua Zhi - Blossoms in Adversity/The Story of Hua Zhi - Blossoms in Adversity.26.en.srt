00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,550
Now that I've read it,

193
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,480
I know that he is in good health.

194
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,440
Look at his handwriting,

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,870
still vigorous.

196
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,200
He's well.

197
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,550
Bolin,

198
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,910
Father prepared you
a calligraphy copy book.

199
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,320
Mother, Father sent his regards to you.

200
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,590
[Letter From Boyu]

201
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,440
He has named our child.

202
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,960
It's Yuan.

203
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,670
Good name.

204
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,320
We've prepared

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,320
so much wine, dishes, and fruits.

206
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:18,630
Those

207
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,270
were for Father.

208
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,790
But we can't waste them.

209
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,870
Let's celebrate anyway

210
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,150
and welcome Zhi home.

211
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,670
Good.

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,440
Sounds perfect.

213
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,550
It seems there's really something wrong
in the Palace.

214
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,360
Even the looks on these servants' faces

215
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,200
are different from before.

216
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,150
Madam,

217
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,320
come on, have another drink!

218
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,150
Have a bit more.

219
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,150
I've already drunk quite a lot.

220
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,840
Why don't you drink yourself?

221
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
You're all trying to make me drink.

222
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,440
Easy there, easy.

223
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,480
You should drink too.

224
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,440
I'll join you!

225
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,270
Come on.

226
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,240
Here you go.

227
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,550
Qin Ergui, what's wrong with you?

228
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,960
Why do you keep making me drink?

229
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,790
What about you?

230
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,630
Fill up your own cup, too.

231
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,270
Alright, I'm filling it up.

232
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,360
Slow down.

233
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,320
Pour some for Yingzhen.

234
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,080
I can't drink any more.

235
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,390
I can't.

236
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,030
It's alright.

237
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,480
We're celebrating today. Drink up!

238
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,910
Come on, Huilan.

239
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,360
I haven't emptied my cup yet.

240
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,790
Come on.

241
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,510
Bottoms up!

242
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,670
Come on.

243
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,390
Come on.

244
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,750
Madam Zhu, would you
play something for us?

245
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,000
I'd rather not!

246
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,600
But you're good at it.

247
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,360
Oh, come on!

248
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,200
It's been so long.

249
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,120
I've forgotten how to play.

250
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,630
Just play.

251
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,630
Madam Zhu.

252
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,030
Today is for celebration.

253
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,320
Just play for us

254
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,910
as a reward,

255
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,600
or we'll keep nagging you.

256
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,000
Aunt Yingzhen,

257
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,150
I'll make a humble start

258
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,150
and play with you.

259
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh my, this is incredible!

260
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,150
Ling

261
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,120
was never willing to play for us!

262
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
Come on!

263
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,720
Go ahead, play!

264
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,480
Since Ling is playing,

265
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,030
I'll also play for you.

266
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,120
- Great!
- Great!

267
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,270
Madam Qi,

268
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,080
you should also show us what you can do.

269
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,840
No, I can't.

270
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,270
Haven't practiced in a long time.

271
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,960
I really can't.

272
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,150
Come on!

273
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,480
Alright, since we're celebrating today,

274
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,960
I'll do it for you.

275
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,960
- Great!
- Great!

276
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,750
Do it!

277
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,480
You didn't know?

278
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,120
Oh, my dear Huilan!

279
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,030
You can do this?

280
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,240
You are

281
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,840
a hidden talent!

282
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,630
Why didn't you join them

283
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,960
to write couplets back then?

284
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,150
All you do is talk.

285
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,870
Why don't you show us your trick too?

286
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,960
My dear,

287
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,120
please spare me.

288
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,550
What can I possibly do?

289
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,910
Do you want me to show you

290
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,870
how to use an abacus?

291
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,790
Actually, that will do as well.

292
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,630
Right?

293
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,120
Aunt Wu,

294
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,630
why don't you sing a song?

295
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,550
No, I...

296
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,960
I brought you flowers

297
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,000
and a kite,

298
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,910
yet you wouldn't even
sing a song for me.

299
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
You are

300
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,120
as sharp-tongued as Jin'e!

301
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:32,790
Go on!

302
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,120
Ladies, if you don't mind,

303
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,750
I'd like to sing a song.

304
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,120
But if you laugh at me,

305
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:45,320
I won't do that.

306
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,630

- Come on!

or the time after that,

my family can truly

By that time,

329

Gu Yanxi,

330
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,080
will you be there?

331
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,630
Changqing,

332
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,600
shouldn't the banquet be held

333
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,240
in Jiying Hall?

334
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,720
Why has it been moved to Chenglu Palace?

335
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,960
Young Lord, come with me

336
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,150
and you will know.

337
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,390
Young Lord,

338
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,320
it is of great importance.

339
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,440
Therefore, I dare not act rashly.

340
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,960
The decision will be yours.

341
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,200
What happened to my uncle?

342
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,630
Yesterday, after leaving the Court,

343
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,870
His Majesty said he'd been so busy

344
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:35,360
and tired.

345
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,150
So he went to take a nap.

346
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,270
But after he laid down,

347
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,320
I

348
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,550
could not wake him anymore.

349
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,790
It's been a day and a night?

350
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,270
Yes.

351
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,790
Fortunately,
His Majesty had already decreed

352
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
that due to Lord Ling's recent passing,

353
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,630
he wanted

354
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,360
to mourn for his brother,

355
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,200
so this year's palace banquet
would be kept simple

356
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,270
and he would not attend personally.

357
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,720
That was why I managed to keep this

358
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,390
a secret until now.

359
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,670
In the Palace,

360
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,150
the only person
His Majesty can trust and rely on

361
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,510
is you.

362
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,390
Close the gates immediately.

363
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,790
No one goes in or out.

364
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,240
Gather the Security Bureau Guards

365
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,360
and the imperial guards
to seal off the Palace.

366
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,790
Bring all the servants,

367
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,390
ladies, eunuchs for questioning.

368
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,840
Hurry, walk faster!

369
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:32,790
Hurry up!

370
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:34,440
What are you doing? Hurry up!

371
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,510
Move faster!

372
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:36,630
Hurry up!

373
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,720
What are you looking at?

374
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,720
Hurry up!

375
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,080
Move!

376
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,200
Move quickly!

377
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,030
Stop wasting time!

378
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:52,870
Yesterday,

379
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,870
did you visit Chenglu Palace?

380
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,910
I'm innocent.

381
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,120
I'm innocent!

382
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,550
His Majesty did summon me last night.

383
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:00,790
But when I arrived,

384
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,510
His Majesty had already gone to bed.

385
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,240
I thought to myself,

386
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,110
perhaps His Majesty was too tired.

387
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,750
I only sat for a short while

388
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,110
before returning.

389
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
I did not attend him in his bedchamber.

390
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,440
Commander, if you don't believe me,

391
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,680
you can ask Jixiang,

392
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,550
my eunuch.

393
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,920
Oh, right,

394
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,680
Changqing can vouch for me!

395
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,160
What time was it?

396
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,550
It was just past the hour of Xu.

397
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,070
Consort Chen,

398
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,200
for the next few days,

399
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,070
please rest here temporarily.

400
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,350
Once everything is clear,

401
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
you can go back to Lanqi Palace.

402
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,440
Take her away.

403
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,590
If she was telling the truth,

404
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,680
when His Majesty left the Court,

405
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,070
he was still well.

406
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,750
When Consort Chen arrived,

407
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,550
I'm afraid His Majesty was not asleep,

408
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,310
but in a coma.

409
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,350
Did Lord Xian and Lord Hui visit

410
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,350
or send anything?

411
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,200
I don't think so.

412
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,750
Lord Xian did send a food box,

413
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,400
but His Majesty didn't even touch it.

414
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,750
Residue of the heart-nourishing soup
has been investigated.

415
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,350
This month's medical records
from the Imperial Medical Bureau

416
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,030
have also been examined.

417
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,200
Yesterday's meals
from the imperial kitchen

418
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,550
and all the relevant staff
have been interrogated.

419
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,830
Nothing unusual.

420
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,510
According to the records
of the past few days,

421
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,030
it was you, Physician Zhang,

422
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,440
who checked His Majesty's pulse, right?

423
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,790
Since the beginning

424
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,750
of this month, it has been me

425
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,310
who's been checking His Majesty's pulse.

426
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,070
Apart from

427
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,000
the regular heart-nourishing soup
he takes,

428
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,310
I haven't added or reduced

429
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
any medicine.

430
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,550
Yesterday, I took His Majesty's pulse

431
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,960
and found it no different from usual.

432
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,920
Commander, please
investigate thoroughly.

433
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,070
When was the pulse checked?

434
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,310
Around the hour of You.

435
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,480
Before His Majesty had his meal.

436
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,200
You serve in the Imperial Medical Bureau

437
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,510
as a level-six physician, right?

438
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,680
Your family all live in the capital,
don't they?

439
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,550
Yes, they do.

440
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,160
No, please!

441
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,790
Commander, please show mercy!

442
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,110
Check His Majesty's pulse again

443
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,160
and report the results to me truthfully.

444
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,200
In the next few days,

445
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,790
please stay in Chenglu Palace.

446
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes.

447
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,920
They are all dead?

448
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,440
Yes.

449
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,880
I waited long but didn't get any news.

450
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,270
So I went there, only to find

451
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,200
that they were all killed in battle.

452
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,030
You went out for over a month,

453
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,640
set up five checkpoints along the way

454
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,680
and killed over a hundred
and thirty travelers.

455
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Yet, you just happened to miss

456
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,880
the Commander of the Security Bureau?

457
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,720
The Commander has

458
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,590
taken control of the Palace.

459
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,550
Your Highness,

460
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,510
there's news from the Palace

461
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,400
saying that the Commander has returned.

462
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,790
I failed to accomplish the task.

463
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,240
Please punish me, Your Highness.

464
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,590
Rise.

465
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,440
The Commander of the Security Bureau

466
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,440
is never easy to deal with.

467
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,200
There are greater tasks for you
in the future.

468
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,270
You can make amends then.

469
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,670
[Instructor's street murder]

470
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,440
I could never imagine

471
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,750
that the great fighters I sent out

472
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,270
would all be killed by him.

473
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,160
Not even a single word

474
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,590
or a portrait

475
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,440
was sent back.

476
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,110
This is what makes the Security Bureau

477
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,880
formidable.

478
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,480
However,

479
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,750
we must succeed

480
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,110
before he returns.

481
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,920
Now, His Majesty is unconscious.

482
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,960
The outcome of this game
has already been decided.

483
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,350
Got it.

484
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,880
First, withdraw all your people.

485
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,880
You must be very cautious
in the next few days.

486
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,200
Be sure not to expose yourself.

487
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,160
If you see anyone

488
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,030
from the Security Bureau
near the mansion,

489
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,640
just act like nothing has happened.

490
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,590
Judging by the current situation,

491
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,030
I can easily win this game

492
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,160
by doing nothing.

493
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,960
Be patient.

494
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,070
Tell me.

495
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:56,830
I...

496
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,070
I...

497
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,160
Speak the truth,

498
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,070
then you can live.

499
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,270
If you dare to lie to me,

500
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,750
your entire family
will die before tomorrow.

501
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,510
I am sorry.

502
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,030
His Majesty's pulse is weak,

503
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,030
and his blood flow is stagnant.

504
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,510
Without an efficient treatment,

505
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,830
I fear that within seven days he will...

506
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,160
Has there been anything unusual
in the capital these days?

507
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,880
Commander,

508
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,720
the Security Bureau
has been running as usual,

509
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,510
and there's no news
about the Zhao people either.

510
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,350
I'm afraid the news about the spies
from the Zhao Empire

511
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,720
was a smokescreen from the beginning.

512
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,440
What about the princes?

513
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,440
Lord Hui and Lord Xian

514
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,440
have been staying indoors.

515
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,440
They might have heard
some rumors and are trying

516
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,400
to avoid suspicion.

517
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,110
The enemy is probably
trying to waste our time.

518
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,720
Send more men to keep

519
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,750
a close watch on them,

520
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,920
especially Lord Xian.

521
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,640
No matter what happens,

522
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,480
report everything to me.

523
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,590
Understood.

524
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,400
Commander.

525
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,480
We've searched the entire Palace.

526
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,960
Everyone is here

527
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,030
except for

528
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,240
the Sixth Prince.

529
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Back when

530
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,830
Boyu was with me,

531
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,440
I totally spoiled him.

532
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,510
Now, it's a good thing

533
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,830
that he's going

534
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,720
through hardships to gain experience.

535
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,790
He'll learn a lot.

536
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,830
Next time,

537
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,830
when you go back there

538
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,790
to bring all of them home,

539
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,030
I'll definitely go with you.

540
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,160
We'll spend ages trying to save up
such a huge sum of money, though.

541
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,160
Yes, that's why we need
to figure out a way

542
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:40,920
to make our money generate more money.

543
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,550
That's a good idea!

544
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,200
Young Lady.

545
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,030
It's not like money can have kids.

546
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,550
How does it make more money?

547
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,880
The money we earn in our shop

548
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,550
and from the restaurants

549
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,270
is already quite a lot,

550
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,680
but the restaurants

551
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,680
are making a fortune every day.

552
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,880
Look at you, Zhi.

553
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,680
I've been thinking the same.

554
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,350
Every day when I do the accounting,

555
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,920
I keep thinking

556
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,510
that we've been working
for those restaurants

557
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,270
and diners

558
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,830
for some time now,

559
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,030
but

560
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,790
as the ones doing the hard work,

561
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,750
we only earned a little in the end.

562
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:11,830
I

563
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,240
have been

564
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,590
so jealous of them already.

565
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,960
Half a million

566
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,830
might be enough to start a small shop.

567
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,680
But to start a restaurant,

568
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,750
I don't think it's enough.

569
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,310
That's true.

570
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,310
Throughout the Imperial Capital,

571
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,680
our family owns shops

572
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,550
in a number of markets

573
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,070
in decent locations.

574
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,110
Before I got married,

575
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,030
I used to handle the account books.

576
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
I remember that any of those shops

577
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,000
was worth over a million.

578
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,160
And that

579
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,400
was the price ten years ago.

580
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,510
Take a look!

581
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,350
Check it out!

582
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
Vintage liquor!

583
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,310
My legs are so sore.

584
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,240
Aunt Xia was right.

585
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,160
Any decent place

586
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,400
to run a restaurant

587
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,030
is out of our reach.

588
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,110
Then what do we do?

589
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,680
I heard an eminent monk

590
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,480
has come here,

591
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,590
vowing to rebuild

592
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,510
the ruined temple south of the city.

593
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,200
Yes.

594
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,510
Do you have an idea?

595
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,070
Let's go to the south of the city.

596
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,160
Young Lady,

597
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,070
that place is quite remote.

598
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,590
Hey,

599
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,440
when the Daxiangguo Temple is rebuilt,

600
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,400
things might change.

601
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,350
[Tangxi Restaurant]

602
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,570
[Tangxi Restaurant]

603
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,880
Three hundred and fifty thousand then.

604
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,200
We'll consider it a deal.

605
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
As for the deposit...

606
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,960
Hold on!

607
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,000
Isn't that Miss Zhi?

608
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,110
Mr. Bai,

609
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:52,960
what a coincidence.

610
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,510
What brings you

611
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,110
here today?

612
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,960
Hurry back home to get sixty thousand.

613
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,270
No rush.

614
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,440
I have the money.

615
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,680
Mr. Wang,

616
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,720
here is sixty thousand.

617
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,350
Miss Hua,

618
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,240
you are being a bit unfair now.

619
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,310
I've been discussing with Mr. Wang
for so long

620
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:13,920
and we've just made a deal.

621
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,790
In the business world,

622
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,310
first come, first served.

623
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:18,920
Who made the deal first

624
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,200
can't be decided by mere discussions.

625
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,960
It should be confirmed with the payment.

626
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,000
Miss Zhi,

627
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,200
a word, please?

628
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,070
Miss Zhi.

629
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,270
Truly, we meet
in the most unexpected places in life.

630
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,160
I thought this desolate place

631
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,000
would attract no one.

632
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:34,880
Unexpectantly,

633
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,680
we meet once again.

634
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,510
I'll pay the deposit first.

635
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,160
And then we'll talk.

636
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:40,680
Miss Zhi,

637
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,030
since we share the same thought,

638
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,590
I still wish to say a few more words.

639
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,480
The Hua's Shop
makes a fortune every day,

640
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,720
which truly impresses me.

641
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,030
But a restaurant
is different from a pastry shop.

642
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,960
It requires not only good food
but also more management skills.

643
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,680
You'll need both skills and connections.

644
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,750
Moreover,

645
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,590
buying a restaurant

646
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,680
costs a huge sum of money.

647
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,070
So please think it over, Miss Zhi.

648
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Before last year,

649
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,030
no one in the capital knew

650
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,350
that the Huas could make pastries.

651
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,590
Speaking of which,
I must thank you for that, Mr. Bai.

652
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,030
It was you who saw our value.

653
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,310
But who is born
with the knack for management?

654
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:08,590
I believe

655
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,400
that as long as
I'm willing to put in the effort,

656
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,640
I can always find a way.

657
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,510
If I get scared by what you say

658
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,240
and dare not move forward,

659
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,830
then there's truly nothing
that can be accomplished.

660
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,550
I'm worried that the money you've worked

661
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,110
so hard for

662
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,110
might be wasted in vain.

663
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,400
That's why I kindly advised.

664
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,480
If you insist,

665
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,350
I have nothing to say.

666
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,200
Actually,

667
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,270
I have a question for you, Mr. Bai.

668
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,640
How do you find the extra energy?

669
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,750
You're already running

670
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,550
the huge Yunlai Restaurant.

671
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,270
How come you still want
to acquire Tangxi Restaurant?

672
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,400
That's a long story.

673
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,110
I am no longer

674
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,920
the manager of Yunlai.

675
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,270
The owner of Yunlai Restaurant

676
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,510
has hired someone else to run it.

677
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,350
To be honest,

678
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,400
I have nothing now.

679
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,720
I have to start all over again.

680
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
So I need to be extra cautious.

681
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,880
I've searched
in the capital for over a month

682
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,920
before I found this place.

683
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,750
A decent man ends a friendship
without resorting to harsh words.

684
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,240
Mr. Bai, you're a righteous man.

685
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,880
I have heard

686
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,550
that Yunlai's owner,

687
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,920
Mr. Zhu,

688
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,000
always tries to use
and then discard his helpers.

689
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,030
Such a short-sighted man.

690
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,270
Mr. Bai, I think your leaving
the restaurant

691
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,640
is his misfortune.

692
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,070
Miss Zhi,

693
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,200
how well-informed you are!

694
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,030
That's right.

695
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,750
I plan to start my own business.

696
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,920
I won't work for someone else anymore.

697
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,070
Mr. Bai,

698
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,790
I always admire you for your capability.

699
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,920
Miss Zhi,

700
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,750
I, too, have always
admired your foresight.

701
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,270
If it hadn't been

702
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,590
for your support in the first place,

703
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,000
we would have to try much harder

704
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,350
to get where we are now.

705
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,200
Since you want

706
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,030
to restart your business

707
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,680
and we wish to reach new heights,

708
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,590
I think we can easily strike a deal.

709
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,000
Mr. Wang,

710
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,750
the deposit is paid

711
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,680
by Mr. Bai and me together.

712
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,830
Sixty thousand in total.

713
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,790
Thirty thousand each.

714
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,110
What does this mean?

715
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,000
But there is one condition.

716
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,070
Mr. Wang,

717
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,920
now that you have accepted the deposit,

718
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:55,400
you must not bring a third buyer

719
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,110
to check this place out.

720
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,030
Do you understand?

721
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,960
Yes.

722
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,030
Understood.

723
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,550
But

724
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,310
which one of you exactly

725
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,310
will be the owner of Tangxi Restaurant?

726
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,680
When the winner between us

727
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,750
is determined.

728
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,790
After I win,

729
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,720
I will return thirty thousand

730
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,510
to Mr. Bai.

731
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,310
I will do the same.

732
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,240
When I acquire this restaurant,

733
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,310
I will return thirty thousand

734
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,270
to Miss Zhi.

735
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,920
You're confusing me.

736
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,550
What winner?

737
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,830
Hua's pastry!

738
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,070
Hua's pastry!

739
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,830
Hua's pastry!

740
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,070
Hua's pastry!

741
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,790
Hua's pastry!

742
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,270
Hua's pastry!

743
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,510
Hua's pastry!

744
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,110
There are words on it.

745
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,550
The Hua's...

746
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,310
Starting tomorrow,
the Hua's and the Bai's

747
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,640
will set up a cooking arena.

748
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,030
Each presents their signature dishes

749
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,000
to treat the capital's diners.

750
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,480
In five days,

751
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,880
the one with greater profits wins.

752
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,590
If you want to know where the arena is,

753
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
please come to the end of Linghua Street

754
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,030
where the Tangxi Restaurant is located.

755
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,590
- Interesting.
- What does it mean?

756
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,880
Quite interesting!

757
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,620
[Tangxi Restaurant]

758
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,400
All of you present here

759
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,790
are experts in the kitchen.

760
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,640
Since you've signed
the contract and taken

761
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,510
the advance payment,

762
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,680
from now on,

763
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,000
you work for the Hua Family.

764
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,880
Fudong,

765
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,640
I entrust this list to you.

766
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,000
From now on,

767
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
they will follow your command.

768
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,160
Young Lady,

769
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,830
how can I manage so many people?

770
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,720
No.

771
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,830
Fudong,

772
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,680
if we want to take over that restaurant,

773
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,070
we must put on a good show.

774
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,960
No matter how capable you are
on your own,

775
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:42,920
you still need

776
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,790
these kitcheners

777
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,510
to assist you.

778
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,030
Young Lady,

779
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,400
if you ask me to create

780
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,640
new dishes in the kitchen by myself,

781
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,240
I'd be more than willing to do it.

782
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,880
But if you want me
to manage so many people...

783
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,440
You know,

784
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,680
back home,

785
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,750
I couldn't even

786
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,480
manage a few maids.

787
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,590
Now

788
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,070
our windmill posters

789
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,350
are all over the capital.

790
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,680
When the competition starts,

791
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,030
countless people will come here.

792
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,920
If you don't take the position
of head chef,

793
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,160
who else in the family

794
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,160
could do it?

795
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,350
Do you remember,
in the class of Diversity,

796
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,160
I've told you

797
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,790
that a person has four limbs

798
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
but only one heart.

799
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,200
I have found you

800
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,000
so many additional hands.

801
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,790
You just need to be the heart.

802
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,400
Everyone,

803
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,200
although I am the head
of the Hua Family,

804
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,240
it is Fudong who is the head chef.

805
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,510
From now on,

806
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,510
please

807
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,680
follow Fudong's orders.

808
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

809
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
Do snakes really live here?

810
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,480
I really saw one before.

811
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,510
What's wrong?

812
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,750
Why stop looking?

813
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,440
Shen Huan.

814
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,590
Things between Yanxi and Zhi don't seem

815
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,350
to be going well.

816
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,480
Ever since we returned from the north,

817
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,590
neither of them smiled.

818
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
When returning to the city,

819
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,720
they parted ways directly.

820
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,240
I asked Zhi about it,

821
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,920
but she wouldn't tell me what happened.

822
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,680
Forget it.

823
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,240
Even if I knew,

824
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,750
I probably wouldn't understand.

825
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,110
I wouldn't be of any help either.

826
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,680
Since there's nothing you can do,

827
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,030
then stop worrying about it.

828
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,510
Think about the happy things.

829
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,000
That makes sense.

830
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,110
Hey,

831
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,790
your journey to the north

832
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,070
must have been interesting, right?

833
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:43,920
I've never been

834
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,310
that far away in my life.

835
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,270
It doesn't matter.

836
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,200
Let's go together.

837
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,640
We can go to places

838
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,960
more interesting than the north.

839
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,510
Like

840
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,590
the south, the west...

841
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,000
The east!

842
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:58,960
Don't lie to me.

843
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,400
Never!

844
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:01,720
Come on,

845
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,070
pinky promise.

846
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,480
Deal.

847
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,160
There's a snake!

848
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,110
Where is it? Where?

849
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,200
Where?

850
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,750
Did you scare it away?

851
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,880
Stay back!

852
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,400
No,

853
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,350
I saw it right here!

854
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,030
Where is it?

855
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,270
There!

856
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Let me ask you one more time.

857
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,000
When did the Sixth Prince go missing?

858
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,880
I...

859
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,640
Last night,

860
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,590
when I took you people there,

861
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,070
I already knew
the prince had gone missing.

862
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:45,960
Go on!

863
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,590
I'll tell you!

864
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,240
Stop!

865
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:58,160
I can't take it!

866
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:58,830
Speak!

867
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,350
The prince went missing

868
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,350
the day before yesterday.

869
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,680
We were thinking

870
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,960
that if we reported it,

871
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,270
we'd certainly suffer punishments,

872
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,350
so we agreed to keep it secret

873
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,920
to buy as much time as possible.

874
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,400
After all, no one ever cared

875
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,480
about him anyway.

876
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,840
Even when an ordinary family

877
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,480
lost their children,

878
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,070
they'd start looking for them
immediately.

879
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,190
Where did you get such audacity?

880
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,760
Tell me,

881
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,880
when was the prince last seen
the day before yesterday?

882
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,880
We were drinking
at the imperial kitchen that day

883
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,190
and got a little drunk.

884
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,110
I... I don't remember the exact time.

885
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,190
Yanxi,

886
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,320
hold the brush upright.

887
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,510
The strokes have to be straight.

888
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:48,550
Commander,

889
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,760
there's still no news
about the Sixth Prince.

890
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,110
Conduct another thorough search
in the Palace.

891
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,510
Look anywhere that can hide people

892
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,510
or dead bodies.

893
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,920
I'm afraid the Sixth Prince

894
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,510
is already gone.

895
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,400
Alright, I will do it.

896
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,630
Any news from Lord Xian?

897
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,110
Not even his dogs made a bark.

898
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,150
No sign of any movement.

899
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,280
As long as the Security Bureau

900
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
doesn't have anything on him

901
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,480
and can't find

902
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,280
a cure,

903
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
he can hide in there

904
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,840
until seven days later.

905
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,070
I will send more men to keep

906
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,150
a closer eye on him.

907
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,440
Starting today,
the kitchen of Tangxi Restaurant

908
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,710
will be split in two.

909
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,630
Cooks from the Hua's

910
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,000
and cooks from the Bai's

911
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,110
each taking a side.

912
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,150
Both sides compete in the same building.

913
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,960
Both sides count the orders

914
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,230
every day.

915
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,550
In five days,

916
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,230
the one with more profits wins!

917
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,480
Darling,

918
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
can you lift it?

919
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,190
Perhaps

920
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
you should go chop some scallions

921
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,630
or give the pot a scrub.

922
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,110
That's the kind of work
you should be doing.

923
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:16,880
Hey, don't leave!

924
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,760
Alas, a young missy

925
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,800
might bring me bad luck.

926
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:23,960
I can't believe

927
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,840
I'm here to follow

928
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,070
a little girl's lead.

929
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,400
Before we came here,

930
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,230
we should have known.

931
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,110
Even the head

932
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,150
of the Hua Family

933
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,110
is a little girl,

934
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,000
so the ones following her

935
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,230
are surely

936
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,840
all young girls as well.

937
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:35,960
That's right.

938
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,670
The problem is...

939
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:43,920
Fudong,

940
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,070
those siskins

941
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,550
have been plucked and washed clean.

942
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,550
But because
I'm not yet familiar with this place,

943
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,400
I couldn't find the Shaoxing wine.

944
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,550
Seriously, women

945
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,400
are so rigid.

946
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,630
Can't you make

947
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,030
vinegared siskins
without the Shaoxing wine?

948
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:57,760
In that case,

949
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,760
say something nice to me

950
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,440
and I'll help you do it.

951
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,360
Back when I was at the duke's mansion

952
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,880
making vinegared siskins,

953
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
our Fudong

954
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,000
probably wasn't even born yet.

955
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,510
Shaoxing wine
has been hard to purchase lately.

956
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,360
We have to wait
for it to arrive by ship next month.

957
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,360
Go get the Jinhua wine instead.

958
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,000
Jinhua wine?

959
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,710
I'm afraid that'll be too sweet.

960
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,510
Yes.

961
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,360
So when you add
the red yeast rice later on,

962
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,630
halve the amount and that'll do.

963
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,670
Alright.

964
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:30,960
Sir,

965
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,030
I remember now.

966
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,190
The first month

967
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,150
of the year before last, the Grand Master
invited the duke's head chef

968
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,280
to cook for his family.

969
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,320
I'm certain I've seen you.

970
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,320
What were you doing then?

971
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,960
I am Sun Xiaohuo.

972
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,000
The Grand Master loved

973
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:45,960
my shredded chicken
with eight mixed vegetables.

974
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,070
So you're the renowned

975
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,800
Chef Sun!

976
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,840
A pleasure to meet you.

977
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,710
The honor is mine.

978
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,840
But

979
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,710
no one compares to you!

980
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,230
Niu's stewed fish

981
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,030
is renowned throughout the capital!

982
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:00,710
Right?

983
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,400
Yeah.

984
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,760
Fudong,

985
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,400
where did you work before?

986
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,150
I...

987
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,110
I've always been in the Hua Mansion.

988
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:12,670
Starting from
the beginning of last year,

989
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,800
I've made sugared haws,

990
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,400
date paste honey cakes...

991
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,920
What?

992
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,230
How come they all sound like

993
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,070
snacks from a street stall?

994
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,920
So what else have you made before?

995
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,320
Before,

996
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,400
I've been with Lady Zhi

997
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,190
as her maid.

998
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,510
Oh my.

999
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,760
A newbie.

1000
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,880
Who is she to call the shots here?

1001
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,360
Be careful not to cut your fingers!

1002
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,920
Learn from him.

1003
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,800
The knifing skill

1004
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,800
requires

1005
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,440
decades of practice.

1006
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,510
They look professional.

1007
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,440
Who told you to work like this?

1008
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,760
Who told you to work like this!

1009
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,030
Use flour to clean the pig's stomach

1010
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,320
and sugar to clean the intestines!

1011
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,510
You're as stupid as a pig!

1012
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:18,880
What's the matter?

1013
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,440
She really did cut her finger!

1014
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,840
Let me see.

1015
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,000
Fudong.

1016
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,030
Your knifing skill

1017
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,400
is truly impeccable!

1018
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,670
I'm sorry if I jinxed it.

1019
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,000
I'm a straightforward man.

1020
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,440
Fudong,

1021
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,670
please don't take it to heart.

1022
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,630
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

1023
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,110
Fudong,

1024
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:39,920
I think

1025
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,880
you really shouldn't be the head chef.

1026
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,360
I mean,

1027
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,510
you can't even

1028
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,960
chop scallions well!

1029
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,400
You...

1030
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,320
Qi,

1031
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,030
go get some stove ash

1032
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,150
for Fudong's cut.

1033
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,480
Thanks, but I'm fine.

1034
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,440
Xigu?

1035
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:57,880
Where are you going?

1036
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,960
Why stop chopping?

1037
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,480
Xigu!

1038
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,440
Fudong wouldn't speak to me
no matter what.

1039
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,440
You should talk to her.

1040
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,550
She is inside.

1041
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,280
Let me see your hand.

1042
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,590
So it's not about the cut.

1043
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,400
What exactly happened?

1044
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,480
You know you can tell me.

1045
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,030
I will certainly stand up for you.

1046
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,800
Young Lady.

1047
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,630
I...

1048
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
I think I saw

1049
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,440
the man who sold me.

1050
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,190
Where did you see him?

1051
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:02,960
At Tangxi Restaurant?

1052
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,760
He is the second chef at Bai's.

1053
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:09,630
Fudong,

1054
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,670
you are now with the Hua Family.

1055
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,840
You don't have to
be afraid of him anymore.

1056
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,590
How can I not be?

1057
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,150
He'd been beating me since I was a kid.

1058
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,440
He...

1059
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:25,030
He is the man
who brought me to this world.

1060
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,360
That man is your father?

1061
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,480
Do you know

1062
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,400
why he sold me in the first place?

1063
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:44,110
He'd been drinking

1064
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,110
for as long as I can remember.

1065
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:48,510
He'd abuse my mother when he was drunk.

1066
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,280
Then she ran away.

1067
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,230
That year,

1068
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,670
he was preparing a birthday feast
for a wealthy family.

1069
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,150
I couldn't even
read properly at that time,

1070
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,440
but I'll never forget that dish.

1071
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,630
It was called Roasted Camel Hump.

1072
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,000
That day,

1073
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,440
he took the camel hump home

1074
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,590
to marinate it.

1075
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,590
Father, wake up!

1076
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,360
Wake up!

1077
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,150
What was that for?

1078
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,230
I'm sleeping.

1079
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,760
The meat is gone!

1080
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,000
Where is the meat in the basin?

1081
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,880
The meat!

1082
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,030
Are you dead?

1083
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,670
You couldn't even keep an eye

1084
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:22,480
on such a big piece of meat!

1085
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,550
Father,

1086
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,230
you told me to buy firewood!

1087
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,000
You still have the nerve to cry?

1088
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,590
It was either taken by a dog

1089
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,230
or stolen by a thief.

1090
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,320
The feast must be ready tomorrow!

1091
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:33,670
I...

1092
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,400
Where can I get another

1093
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,670
piece of camel hump now?

1094
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:38,960
Even if I sold myself to someone,

1095
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,480
I...
