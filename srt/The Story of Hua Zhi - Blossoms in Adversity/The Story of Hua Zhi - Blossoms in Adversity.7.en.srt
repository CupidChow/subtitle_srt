00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,670
[Episode 7]

25
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,250
Father, enough beating?

26
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,370
Why?

27
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,970
I have made a promise,

28
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,340
and I will keep it.

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,700
Stop right there.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,530
You disloyal and unfilial kid.

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,620
In my eyes,

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,820
Master Hua was showing loyalty

33
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,300
speaking bluntly in the Court.

34
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,850
You serve as an official at the Court,
just like Minister Hua.

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,170
You are now calling me
disloyal and unfilial?

36
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,980
So father, I also wonder

37
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,020
on what grounds do you serve
as an official?

38
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
And on what grounds do you act as a man?

39
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,410
You...

40
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,370
I must beat you to death today.

41
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,660
Father.

42
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,770
Father.

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,850
Enough.

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,700
He is the only hope in our family

45
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,300
that can be the top
of the imperial examination.

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,260
Stay out of this.

47
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,810
Father.

48
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,620
You can't beat him anymore.

49
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,180
That Shen Qi kid.

50
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,820
Will he come or not?

51
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,620
What are we going to do?

52
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,100
We won't make it there
if we don't set off now.

Grandma.

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,260
We can't wait for him.

55
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,930
Otherwise, we won't make it.

56
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,210
But how are we supposed to go there

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,100
without Shen Qi?

58
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,130
Zhong's leg has just recovered a little.

59
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,410
He still can't walk.

60
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,010
Who's going to drive the carriage?

61
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,290
Yes, this...

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,410
I'll drive.

63
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,180
Zhi.

64
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,620
When did you learn to drive a carriage?

65
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,570
I didn't.

66
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,570
But it doesn't hurt if I try.

67
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,980
I used to travel around all over

68
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,700
with my Grandfather.

69
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,740
I was always in a carriage.

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,050
Every time Mr. Zhong drove,

71
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,130
I was always watching by his side.

72
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,740
I believe I can handle a carriage.

73
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,700
Try it and we will find out.

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,820
Just get the horse running.

75
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,050
Can you really?

76
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,210
It's just that the carriage now

77
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,100
is loaded with a lot of stuff.

78
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,010
It probably can't fit anyone else.

79
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,130
I'll have to go by myself.

80
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,490
Be careful on the way there.

81
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,540
If that's not enough time,

82
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,410
don't push yourself too hard.

83
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:38,260
I'll do my best.

84
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,100
Miss.

85
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,340
These coats are too light.

86
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,460
Someone needs to
weigh down the carriage,

87
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,220
so they won't fall off.

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,330
Aren't you smart?

89
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:22,660
Let's go.

90
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,500
Stop staring.

91
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,700
No one will show up
in the middle of nowhere.

92
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,940
Wait, someone's coming.

93
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,330
Thank god I made it.

94
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,060
Are you from the Hua Family?

95
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,100
Please accept it.

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,780
I would like to have a few word
to my family.

97
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:09,980
Alright.

98
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,500
People showed up here?

99
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,170
That was the first time.

100
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,660
It's very brave of you

101
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,660
to come here.

102
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,500
Go on.

103
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,570
What are you doing here?

104
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,100
Where are the others?

105
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,380
What about Zhong, the coachman?

106
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,940
His leg is injured.

107
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,450
It's a bumpy ride.

108
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,820
So I came here alone.

109
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,540
Grandfather.

110
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,170
The Northern Land
is not as warm as the south.

111
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,570
I brought some heavy clothes.

112
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,740
Zhi, heads up.

113
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,650
Look at me.

114
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,380
Grandfather.

115
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,420
I haven't shed a tear

116
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,860
since what happened.

117
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,570
I know.

118
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,530
My Zhi girl

119
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,260
is a very brave

120
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,060
and strong girl.

121
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,060
Don't worry about us.

122
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,970
We have any necessities we need now

123
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,130
and also a place to live.

124
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,180
Everyone is doing well.

125
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,010
Good.

126
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,330
I am relieved.

127
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,650
Father.

128
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,420
How's Bolin doing?

129
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,090
The things we brought you

130
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,060
are enough of each one of you.

131
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,500
Please take these clothes

132
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,300
to everyone.

133
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,740
I will take care of the family.

134
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,620
Who is that girl?

135
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,330
The granddaughter of Hua Yizheng.

136
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,860
The one who had a pre-agreed
marriage engagement

137
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:54,940
with Shen Qi.

138
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,010
His granddaughter?

139
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,450
I'm sure she's more interesting
than that old guy.

140
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,420
It fits perfectly.

141
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,570
Boyu.

142
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,260
Your mother brought you shoes.

143
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,620
Come on, I'll put them on for you.

144
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,740
I miss my mom so much.

145
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,570
I miss her.

146
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,090
Boyu.

147
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,970
Your mom misses you too.

148
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,970
But now you

149
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,890
are a little man.

150
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,180
If she knew you were crying,

151
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,060
she would be worried.

152
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:17,940
Zhi.

153
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,890
How do I look?

154
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,210
Aunt Wu sew it with her hands.

155
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,260
Cherish it.

156
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,010
No wonder.

157
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,570
Look at the crooked stitches.

158
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,090
Her unique stitching way.

159
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,740
Aunt Wu, she is...

160
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:30,970
What about her?

161
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,130
She wanted to come.

162
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,450
But the carriage only fits one person.

163
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,300
It's better she didn’t come.

164
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,700
I don't want her see me

165
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,330
like this.

166
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,940
After you go back,

167
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,650
you need to

168
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,500
tell her I'm doing great.

169
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,530
You can say

170
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,740
I

171
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,570
look good,

172
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,740
think positively,

173
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,620
and also have a good appetite.

174
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,820
I have prepared for anything
that might happen

175
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,500
on the long long journey heading north.

176
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,010
I'm crying

177
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:08,860
because of this sour fruit.

178
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,420
Uncle Pingyang, have a seat.

179
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,770
Zhi.

180
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,260
Remember this.

181
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,090
Up behind the hill
of the Qingya Academy,

182
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,010
there are two large
Chinese scholar trees,

183
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,740
I planted them
at the year you were born,

184
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:29,650
when I was still a student

185
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,650
studying there.

186
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,300
When you go back,

187
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,450
don't forget to water them often,

188
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,530
and loosen the soil.

189
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,700
I got this.

190
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,450
Uncle Pingyang,

191
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,740
which department is hanling the case?

192
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,820
The Security Bureau?

193
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,060
Prince Xian, Gu Yangong, the supervisor
of the Ministry of Justice.

194
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,820
After the Security Bureau
confiscated our property,

195
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,860
we fell into the hands of Prince Xian.

196
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,450
That arsehole.

197
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,260
Drink?

198
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,260
I have never drunk any alcohol
in my life,

199
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,130
but I must drink this bowl of wine.

200
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,530
Gentlemen.

201
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,970
Cheers to our last best day.

202
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,250
Finished?

203
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,780
Time to go.

204
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:24,970
It's a journey of thousands of miles.

205
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,420
How long are you gonna sit here?

206
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,780
Don't worry.

207
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,300
I will take care of everything at home.

208
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,300
I will take care of

209
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,450
every single one of them.

210
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,610
Grandfather, do you have anything

211
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,540
that you want me to do for you?

212
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,970
I will certainly do it.

213
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,540
Grandfather

214
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,140
just hope

215
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,330
that you can be happy and content

216
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,450
in your future.

217
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,140
Come on.

218
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,420
Let's go.

219
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,570
What are those Security Bureau Guards

220
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,300
here for?

221
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,180
This case has been transferred to

222
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,820
my Ministry of Justice long ago.

223
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,660
The one who is walking faster

224
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,140
is the commander of the Security Bureau.

225
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,210
What do you want?

226
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,450
Drag her away.

227
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,180
Yes, sir.

228
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,250
Don’t you dare touch her!

229
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,140
You are here for me, aren't you?

230
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,250
That's right.

231
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,850
I’d like a word with you, Minister Hua.

232
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,900
Zhi, go, I'll be fine.

233
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,970
A new commander.

234
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,730
He must be here to nitpick.

235
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,180
Ever since the first day
of Daqing Nation established,

236
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,900
only crown princes could
lead the Ministry of Justice,

237
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,450
and I am the only prince.

238
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,020
So I don't know
what His Majesty want from me

239
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,090
by giving me this position.

240
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,780
Let's leave.

241
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,900
Let's go and see

242
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,610
how he's gonna nitpick about my work.

243
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,090
Sir, what brings you here?

244
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,850
Minister Hua, do you still remember

245
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,490
that fire at Prince Ling's Mansion

246
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,020
on the Lantern Festival Day?

247
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,370
What if I do remember?

248
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,020
When you came to offer condolences,

249
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,210
a kid around seven years old

250
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,420
was with you back then.

251
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,610
Is that your descendant or servant?.

252
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,090
Why ask now?

253
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,970
It concerns an old case.

254
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,370
It's a long time ago
and I was a busy man.

255
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,900
I have been running around everywhere
these years

256
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,450
and child servants came and went.

257
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,330
They're scattered all over the world.

258
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,370
I truly can't recall.

259
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,210
Which one are you talking about?

260
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,060
Could you please think it over again?

261
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,330
If you're hiding something on purpose,

262
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,850
that would be interesting.

263
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,210
Sir.

264
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,370
Send regards to Prince Xian.

265
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,420
Since I'm in charge of this case now,

266
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,250
so I thought I could come take a look.

267
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,900
I did not expect
to find you here as well.

268
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,140
It's truly a coincidence.

269
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,850
I've heard you are dedicated
to your job.

270
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,210
And they are not wrong.

271
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,570
Since I've received His Majesty's grace,

272
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,730
I must be responsible for my job
no matter when.

273
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,940
I dare not let down the Emperor.

274
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,610
Have these criminal

275
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,300
ever offended you?

276
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,780
How come you come here in person?

277
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,540
Criminals are leaving the city,

278
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,210
it's just a routine search.

279
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,540
Chen Qing.

280
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,610
Search them.

281
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,610
Yes.

282
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,420
You might not be aware of this.

283
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,970
Before they are leaving the city,

284
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,210
His Highness had already

285
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,820
ordered a thorough search.

286
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,900
Look at that attitude.

287
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,020
I must embarrass you today.

288
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,660
I have matters to attend to.

289
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,180
Please proceed as you wish, sir.

290
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,700
They're pitching against each other.

291
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,730
But don't drag my family into this.

292
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,060
Sir.

293
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,020
I found something.

294
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,780
Silver.

295
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:06,780
Here, too.

296
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,610
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

297
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,300
We didn't do a good job.
Please punish us.

298
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,700
This is your definition

299
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,490
of a thorough search.

300
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,210
What's going on?

301
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,300
Control them!

302
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,300
Yes.

303
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:28,330
Miss.

304
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:29,570
I was the one
who brought these heavy clothes.

305
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,420
They didn't know any of that.

306
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,250
I am guilty indeed.

307
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,540
I won't lie.

308
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,970
You heard that, sir?

309
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,540
I am impressed.

310
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,450
If this case,

311
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,210
the misunderstanding today

312
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
is kind of a good story
that people would like to know.

313
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,570
Do whatever you have to, Your Highness.

314
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,610
Your Highness.

315
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,850
What do we do with her?

316
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,490
She's just a little woman.

317
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,940
Don't you know how to handle a woman?

318
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,420
I see.

319
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,660
Take this rebellious back
to the government office.

320
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,420
Beat her 10 times with the stick.

321
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,140
And release her.

322
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,180
Will do.

323
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,420
No.

324
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,330
You can't do this.

325
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,700
This silver is mine.

326
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,330
Don't take her away.

327
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:12,850
Let her go.

328
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,570
Let her go.

329
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,850
-Miss.
-Zhi.

330
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,660
-Miss.
-Zhi.

331
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,060
-Let her go.
-Miss.

332
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:20,940
Zhi.

333
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,060
Let her go.

334
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:22,730
Hold on.

335
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,180
Three thousand li to the north

336
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,540
is governed by His Majesty.

337
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,540
But you found her guilty because of me.

338
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,820
Today,

339
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,210
I entrust these men

340
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,020
with you.

341
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,020
If anything happened to any of them
on the way,

342
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,700
you won't live another day.

343
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,660
Yes.

344
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,250
Go.

345
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,700
Hurry up.

346
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,850
Move. hurry up.

347
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,780
Hurry up.

348
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,060
Move.

349
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,180
Sir.

350
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,570
Go back to the Bureau now?

351
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,970
I have to go somewhere else.

352
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,540
Miss.

353
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:23,940
Father.

354
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,330
If Zhi didn't

355
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:26,940
stepped up

356
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,180
and said it was her doing.

357
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,450
I'm afraid

358
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,660
my brothers wouldn't have
survived after the torture.

359
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,370
But I assume

360
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,850
they won't go too harsh on her.

361
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,420
Prince Xian must want to
downplay the incident

362
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,660
and won't let anyone
talk about it again.

363
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,970
I'm not worried

364
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,420
about what she might suffer today.

365
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,900
I worry about her future.

366
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,420
You...

367
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:44,850
Xie.

368
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,940
Zhi is a smart girl.

369
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,060
Don't worry.

370
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,020
Our family will be fine

371
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,250
under her watch.

372
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,420
I know she's smart.

373
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,610
She is not only smart

374
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,730
and courageous.

375
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:58,020
She burns the bridge behind her

376
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,850
when she does things.

377
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,850
She's already a smart and decisive
young woman.

378
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,250
I only wish that life

with the silver,

in the clothes.

As she grew up,

567
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
she often went wherever I went,

568
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,470
like a little puppy following its owner.

569
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,910
I've heard that in the South,
when someone has a newborn daughter,

570
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,150
they brew a large batch of wine,

571
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:00,980
and once it is filtered,

572
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,190
they bury it in a pond,

573
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,110
and never to unearth it again

574
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,740
until the daughter is to be married,

575
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,710
They dig up the earth of the pond,

576
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,950
and take it out to
entertain the wedding guests.

577
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,540
The people of the South
call it 'daughter wine'.

578
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,430
Zhi is still young,

579
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,630
I have nothing to gift her,

580
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:13,870
so I saved money

581
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,950
and bought eighteen jars
of spring wine brewed in iced stones,

582
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,350
and buried at the northern
downhill of Qingya Academy.

583
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,110
I only wish that Zhi grows up

584
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,260
and is always happy

585
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,950
till she marries a good man.

586
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,390
These wines

587
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,110
have been buried for fifteen years now..

588
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,740
It suddenly occured to me that

589
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,710
my family buried some wines here.

590
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,500
So I dug it up
and see if they're still here.

591
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:42,500
That simple?

592
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,950
I want to take these wines with me.

593
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,020

Miss,

603
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,870
these wines

604
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,580
can all pawn for one hundred
and seventy strings of cash coins.

605
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,390
Here are seventeen banknotes.

606
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,110
Please keep them well.

607
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,060
Please exchange for another separate
two strings of cash coins for me.

608
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:47,630
Alright.

609
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,190
Why is there still one jar left?

610
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,470
This jar is for you.

611
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,390
A thank-you gift
for spending time with me.

612
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,670
Thank you.

613
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,540
And what is this?

614
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,820
You've been a big help

615
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,910
carrying those wines all the way here.

616
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,300
[Yongchang Pawnshop]
You just came back here,

617
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,260
it's not easy to make a living.

618
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,630
Just take it.

619
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,740
That's very generous of you.

620
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,630
Stop it.

621
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:16,670
You also need to

622
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,870
return the carriage back.

623
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,060
What about you?

624
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,910
I’ll head back first.

625
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,060
It's getting late, I can take you home.

626
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:26,300
Don't bother.

627
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,260
The Hua Mansion
has been sealed for days,

628
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,910
now you lose your home,

629
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,780
and let alone you're an injured lady
walking on the street with money.

630
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:33,580
How can you go back alone?

631
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,870
How did you know?

632
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,110
The entire city knows of
Minister Hua's conviction.

633
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,300
I knew who you were

634
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,390
when we first met.

635
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,670
Get on the carriage.

636
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,020
There's not a soul here.

637
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,190
The road is bumpy.

638
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,300
If you can't hold on...

639
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,910
Even if there's somebody here,

640
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:09,870
I don't care.

641
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,390
I'm afraid I'll fall off the carriage
going like this.

642
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,580
There's no tree to lean against here,

643
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,220
so I’ll have to lean on your shoulder.

644
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,390
No offense.

645
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,950
These are your dowry wines, aren't they?

646
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,220
You pawned them all.

647
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,670
How will you marry then?

648
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,780
I gave you a whole jar for free,

649
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,950
can you just keep your mouth shut?

650
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,500
Didn't you worry that

651
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,950
I wouldn't have stolen all your wines?

652
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,060
I had no choice.

653
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,630
Only women and kids are left now.

654
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,220
Not one of them
is suited for hard labor.

655
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,300
Let alone move a jar of wine,

656
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,300
they can barely dig.a hole.

657
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:44,150
I wouldn't have let them know anyway

658
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,740
no matter what.

659
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,670
What would happen if they knew?

660
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,470
They love gossips,

661
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,020
so they can't keep a secret.

662
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,350
Besides,

663
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,870
I don't know what they would do

664
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,220
with the money.

665
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,020
It's fine if they don't
do anything stupid,

666
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:58,980
I can't afford to take the fall for them

667
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,780
and go through all this again.

668
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,820
It's so weird.

669
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,220
You're even more reliable

670
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,740
than those people who

671
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,500
have lived with me under one roof
for all these years.

672
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,630
Aren't you afraid
I might harm you for money?

673
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,430
These wines are worth quite a lot.

674
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,430
Even if I don't ask for your help,

675
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,910
I would hire a few laborers.

676
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,710
And they might not
be as dependable as you.

677
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,190
When I came out
of the government office,

678
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,580
covered in blood and all.

679
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,540
You were the only one to stop
and ask me how I was doing?

680
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,020
It's the first time I've known

681
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,980
that I'm actually a good person.

682
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,780
But I'm also stupid.

683
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,390
You tricked me into doing hard labor.

684
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,580
Actually,

685
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,950
you don't have to rush into a decision,

686
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:39,630
give yourself and your family

687
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,580
some time.

688
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,060
Sometimes, the closer the people,

689
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,260
the deeper the misunderstandings.

690
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,350
It's like an invisible wall
is standing between you.

691
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,350
You can only see
how much you love each other

692
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,470
when the wall is torn down.

693
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,150
Why did you say so?

694
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,390
The thing I regret most in my life

695
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,220
is that when I was young,

696
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,500
I distanced myself from my loved ones.

697
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:59,780
Who was that?

698
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,950
My mother.

699
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,870
This is the second time we met.

700
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,870
I still don’t know your name.

701
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,540
My surname is Yan.

702
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,260
And my first name is Yanxi.

703
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,220
Yanxi.

704
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:15,980
Thank you for everything you did today.

705
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,910
I'm taking a nap.

706
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,220
We have looked around.

707
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,190
Was she

708
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,190
kidnapped

709
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,820
by some traffickers?

710
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,740
Don't jinx it.

711
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,950
It's still daytime now.

712
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,540
How can a person just disappear?

713
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,150
Maybe we should go to downtown tomorrow

714
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,540
and see if the traffickers knows her.

715
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,150
I'll go right now.

716
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,670
Don't.

717
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,430
Madam Zhu.

718
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,350
Where are you going?

719
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,190
It's getting dark.

720
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,820
Now you know the consequence.

721
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,710
We should not have bothered

722
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,430
to sew the silver into the clothes
in the first place.

723
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,910
Jin'e,

724
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:08,020
What do you mean by that?

725
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,540
We did that

726
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,500
out of good intention.

727
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,260
Earlier, Madam Hua asked you
to pool the money together.

728
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,060
I tried so hard.

729
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,190
But I still couldn't

730
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,260
get the money out of your pockets.

731
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,870
Now look what happened.

732
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,540
It all went to those constables.

733
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,980
If we gave that money,

734
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,350
it would have just
benefited the petty inspectors,

735
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,220
I see no difference.

736
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,500
Watch your tone,

737
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,580
I'm managing a big family here.

738
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,780
And all you care about is your children.

739
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,820
Jin'e, it’s all my fault.

740
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,220
Miss has returned.

741
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,110
My girl.

742
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,020
Zhi.

743
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:50,910
Zhi.

744
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:57,220
Zhi.

745
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,710
Zhi.

746
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,870
Thank god.

747
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,820
You're back unscathed.

748
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,980
I was struck ten times with a stick
by the constables,

749
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:07,630
so it's not even close to unscathed.

750
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,870
You knew why I got punished.

751
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,500
Could mother not know why?

752
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,110
I...

753
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,980
Come on.

754
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,580
Can you just

755
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,670
be honest with me?

756
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,910
No.

757
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,190
If I had told you,

758
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,670
you surely wouldn't have agreed.

759
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,500
She is not smart enough
to come up with such a plan.

760
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:42,740
Aunt Qi.

761
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,980
It was your idea, wasn't it?

762
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:46,700
Miss Zhi.

763
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,580
You don't have to be that angry.

764
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,580
If you were married,

765
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,700
you would also care deeply
for your boys.

766
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,060
You have no idea

767
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,230
what do it mean

768
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,620
to get exiled to the Northern Land.

769
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,230
Once you leave the city
and pass the checkpoint,

770
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,350
there're all bandits
once you arrive at Kun Mountains.

771
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,390
They would kill you

772
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,700
for a bit of money.

773
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,430
You all thought
that money could bring them safety,

774
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,310
but you were putting them in danger.

775
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,500
They confiscated the money anyway.

776
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,310
Yes, you think we're lucky, huh?

777
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,540
I was beaten because of you.

778
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,230
If father and Uncle Pingyuan

779
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,180
fall into the hands of Prince Xian,

780
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,870
they won't survive it.

781
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,430
Don't ever give me

782
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,020
any money

783
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,430
from now on.

784
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,830
Either way, it was my fault.

785
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:27,580
It was my mistake.

786
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,620
I shouldn't have given you
all the money.

787
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:32,500
Zhi.

788
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:34,230
If you want to argue about
right and wrong,

789
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,430
go argue with the officials.

790
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,910
You can't talk to your mother like that.

791
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,270
Jin'e,

792
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,950
she didn't mean it.

793
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,790
This home is not a place

794
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:42,950
for reasoning.

795
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,980
I've known it for a long time.

796
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,500
I am tired.

797
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,750
You are injured so bad.

798
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
Where do you going?

799
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,500
You could have a good rest.

800
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,180
You...

801
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,090
Sir, you're back.

802
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,890
I smell the aroma of the wine
from far away.

803
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,210
You were quite observant.

804
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,570
How could you find that tiny silvers

805
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,010
even though
they were sewn into a jacket?

806
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:23,730
Well.

807
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:24,810
That means I am born

808
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:25,450
for this job.

809
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,290
If so,

810
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,130
make the most of your eyes.

811
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:30,730
An important task for you.

812
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:31,690
Well...

813
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,770
Thank you, sir.

814
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:33,930
Starting tomorrow,

815
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,210
you don't need to come here,

816
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:36,890
just keep an eye for me
on the Hua Family.

817
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,330
The Hua Family?

818
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,410
Keep a closer watch.

819
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:40,730
If something bad happened to them

820
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,010
like what happened to Hua Zhi today,

821
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,810
you're a dead man.

822
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:44,850
Yes.

823
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:45,690
One more thing.

824
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,170
Go to the Yongchang Pawnshop.

825
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,970
Tell the shopkeeper that
the seventeen jars of wine pawned today

826
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,330
are not for sale.
We will buy them back one day.

827
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,090
Yes.

828
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,570
Aunt Wu,

829
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,650
are you willing to leave with me?

830
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,650
We can make a living together.

831
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:03,850
We should also take
Baoxia and the maids with us.

832
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,730
Otherwise, Madam Xia might sell them
for money one day.

833
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,290
Why bring this up all of a sudden?

834
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,090
I never make up my mind until now.

835
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,810
I had to concern about
upholding the Hua Family's honor.

836
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,770
I had to be a good girl
for my Grandfather and my mother.

837
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,610
I had no freedom
like a bird losing it wings.

838
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,450
Now I have nothing left.

839
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,850
As long as they consider me

840
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,330
as a young and little girl,

841
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,930
they won't take me seriously.

842
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,130
I'm just a girl that
don't talk too much,

843
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,690
even the words of Bolin and Boli

844
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,730
counts moe than me.

845
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,370
I'm almost come of age.

846
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,010
I need to take care of my family.

847
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,250
I see,

848
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,410
you felt wronged.

849
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,010
It's not like that, Aunt Wu.

850
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,570
A person was born alone,

851
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,330
so in the end

852
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,210
you have to find your own path

853
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,610
and live your own life.

854
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,130
If someone shares a journey with you,
that would be great.

855
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:43,610
If not, then part ways.

856
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,610
Life is too short to waste your time.

857
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,730
You always think more

858
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,690
and thorough than I do.

859
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,730
What you say is absolutely right.

860
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,170
Madam Xia said

861
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,450
home is not a place for reasoning.

862
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,010
You just got back.

863
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,410
You had no idea

864
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,090
what was it like today in the house.

865
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,330
Because of you,

866
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:05,570
Madam Hua was so desparate that

867
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,530
she sent Ms. Su to downtown
to pull some strings.

868
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,130
She said

869
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,170
we were already miserable,

870
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,490
but we were still hanging in there.

871
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,850
As adults,

872
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,530
if we can't even protect a kid,

873
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,650
what would that make us?

874
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,290
We can't sacrifice you

875
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,450
just because of

876
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,330
that whole bunch of men.

877
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,050
See?

878
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:24,810
Aftering hearing this,

879
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,970
you know how important you are

880
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:26,690
to all of us, right?

881
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,570
Let me tell you one more thing.

882
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,810
The money Ms. Su took to pave the way

883
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,770
was all given by Jin'e.

884
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,730
Most of them

885
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,730
only care about their own kids.

886
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,770
But Jin'e sold her jade beads

887
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,130
even though she didn't want to.

888
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,050
She even cried secretly at night.

889
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,330
She still wanted to save you

890
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,810
with that little money.

891
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:47,810
I can repay her

892
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,450
for what she have spent on this.

893
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:50,770
You just don't understand.

894
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,450
This is not a matter of money.

895
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:53,850
I'm not finished.

896
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,130
Baoxia was back in the early morning.

897
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,170
You know your mother.

898
00:39:58,450 --> 00:39:59,970
She was always taken good care of.

899
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,010
She has no idea

900
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,890
what the outside world is like.

901
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,570
It really shocked me that

902
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,050
she could find her way
to the government office.

903
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,610
She asked around about you

904
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,850
even though she was extremely scared.

905
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,890
She was home crying

906
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,850
with her feet all swollen.

907
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,770
She said nobody saw you

908
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,850
since you left the government office.

909
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,810
Mr. Zhong can barely stand still,

910
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,770
but he was looking for you
leaning on his cane.

911
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,770
Everyone was worried sick.

912
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,050
They all went out to look for you.

913
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,170
Only I was left at home.

914
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,210
to take care of Madam Hua.

915
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,290
They all went out for me?

916
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,610
What else could it be?

917
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,130
You are one of our family.

918
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,730
We love family.

919
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,450
Madam Xia asked all the maids
to go with her.

920
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,690
All these years,

921
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,290
the first thing in the morning
for Huilan

922
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:43,970
to take Boli to his study.

923
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,650
But today,

924
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:47,410
she didn't care
about her own son's studies.

925
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,810
She went to look for you instead.

926
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,050
Concubine Qin was the funny one.

927
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,730
She went to to the temple
to do the divination.

928
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,050
She was so eager to find where you were.

929
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:57,450
She went to the wrong temple.

930
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,370
So Jin'e scolded her.

931
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:03,130
No one told me these things.

932
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,650
They are all elders.

933
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,770
They think taking care of the young
is their responsibility.

934
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,810
If they bragged about it
in front of you,

935
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:10,970
that would be so shameful.

936
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,770
Proud as Jin'e,

937
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,130
she has never apologized
to anyone in her whole life.

938
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,610
Well,

939
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,210
I just want you to know,

940
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,770
what you just told me were not wrong.

941
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,890
But as a family,

942
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,930
you can always argue
about right and wrong.

943
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,290
They are all women

944
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,810
with no skills to make a livelihood.

945
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,570
But when something bad happens,

946
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,730
you will realize

947
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,690
your family is always be there for you,

948
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,090
and always worry about you.

949
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,130
I understand, Aunt Wu.

950
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,050
I need to think it over.

951
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:11,370
Where did all these quilts come from?

952
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,770
Just lie down.

953
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,050
No questions.

954
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:17,330
I don't want them.

955
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,290
Take them away.

956
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:19,610
Stop.

957
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,810
Could you please
listen to me for just one time?

958
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,130
You are injured now,

959
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,690
if you sleep on the straw

960
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,410
and catch a cold,

961
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,530
you won't get better forever.

962
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:34,850
Zhi.

963
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,810
Just listen to Aunt Xia.

964
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,410
You have to be

965
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,610
more careful

966
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,850
these days.

967
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,250
I can

968
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,370
sleep with Aunt Qi.

969
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,490
It's warmer that way anyway.

970
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:46,410
Then...

971
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:47,570
How about Boli?

972
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,850
Boli

973
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,330
can sleep with Bolin.

974
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,770
You're all grown up now,

975
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,050
it's not proper to share a room.

976
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,410
Right.

977
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:55,410
We can make do

978
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,370
and it's even warmer.

979
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,450
Zhi,

980
00:42:58,690 --> 00:42:59,610
lie down.

981
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:00,850
You wounds

982
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:01,810
look so bad.

983
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,610
You need to sleep on something soft.

984
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:04,890
I'll sleep with the concubines.

985
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:05,650
It won't be cold.

986
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:06,290
That's right.

987
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,170
Miss Zhi, don't worry about us.

988
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:09,610
Just lie down.

989
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:11,690
When your injury heals,

990
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:13,290
you can wash the quilt

991
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,290
and give them back to us.
