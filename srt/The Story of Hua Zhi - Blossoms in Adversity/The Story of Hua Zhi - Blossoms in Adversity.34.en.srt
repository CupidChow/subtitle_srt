This year's drought in the three states

92

naturally driving up the market prices.

But the southern lands possess
abundant resources,

95
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,800

are also unobstructed.

We are willing to invest
in building ships

98

to take the waterways

99
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,280

100
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,280
to ensure the supply
of restaurants in the Imperial Capital.

that you have never

112

00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,830

189
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,240
Return safely.

190
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,390
Commander.

191
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,600
What?

192
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,040
Earlier today, Liu from the kitchen

193
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,630
went to purchase rice for us boys,

194
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
but he ended up returning empty-handed.

195
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,120
He said someone was causing trouble
at the grain market,

196
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,750
threatening to smash the rice shop.

197
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,310
He said they charged
a thousand for one dou,

198
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,040
and the rice was even mixed
with sand and rice bran.

199
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,680
The salary from the Security Bureau

200
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,360
can't even afford two dou of rice now?

201
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,160
These unscrupulous merchants.

202
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,920
They shouldn't have their shops smashed.

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,680
They should be executed.

204
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,390
Go away!

205
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,120
Get away!

206
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,870
Get lost!

207
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:22,920
Step aside!

208
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,920
Move!

209
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,160
What's wrong?

210
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,920
Take him.

211
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:29,800
Sir!

212
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,510
What is this for?

213
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,680
What is this about?

214
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:32,920
Sir!

215
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,120
Collect all the evidence.

216
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,240
Search this place thoroughly!

217
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,510
Sir, I am innocent!

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,560
I am innocent, sir!

219
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,600
He truly deserves this!

220
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,720
Out of the way!

221
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,240
[Grain Store]
Go away!

222
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:44,920
Move!

223
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,480
Get away!

224
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,830
I didn't do anything! Sir!

225
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,920
I've been wronged, sir!

226
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,120
Let me go, please!

227
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,600
Good!

228
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,070
Good!

229
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,040
That man indeed deserves to die.

230
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,600
You have no conscience!

231
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,750
Yes, exactly.

232
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,600
Exactly.

233
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
They should be beheaded!

234
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
They must not be let off easily!

235
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,070
Kill them!

236
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,360
Well done!

237
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,680
This serves them right.

238
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,310
Every one of them deserves this!

239
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,040
They're all

240
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,240
so shameless!

241
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,310
This year's severe drought

242
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,270
has left the people
with nothing to harvest.

243
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,430
Yet, you had the audacity to hoard goods

244
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,680
and maliciously inflate prices,

245
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,920
turning a natural disaster
into a man-made calamity.

246
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,150
Since you leave the people no choice,

247
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,910
I won't let you off either.

248
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,600
Shackle them and parade them

249
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,320
at the city gate for three days.

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,360
If any of you dare to do it again,

251
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,480
I will take your life.

252
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,390
Take them away.

253
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,720
Good!

254
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,390
Well done!

255
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,360
They must be severely punished!

256
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,440
Don't let a single one of them get away!

257
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,240
Recently, a group of grain merchants

258
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,270
have been arrested.

259
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,030
Prices soar in the Imperial Capital.

260
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,600
The people no longer
have any spare money.

261
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,150
If we don't do anything,

262
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,550
it might lead to chaos.

263
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,550
Those few unscrupulous merchants alone

264
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,440
won't be able to cause
any major trouble.

265
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,150
No, they won't.

266
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,030
But the Security Bureau has found this.

267
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,240
When the ruler is unjust,

268
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,790
the nature turns ominous.

269
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,320
Three years with no rain,

270
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,600
the crops withering in the fields.

271
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,630
Recently, there's been
some groundless talk among the people.

272
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,750
They said a divine being
had descended as a child,

273
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,550
spreading the ballad,

274
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,720
saying that Daqing

275
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
would perish in a natural calamity.

276
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,960
Though it is nonsense,

277
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,960
the intentions of the people behind it

278
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,910
are exceedingly malicious.

279
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,120
Are those natural disasters

280
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,750
and calamities all my fault?

281
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,720
Do they want me

282
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,120
to issue a self-criticizing edict?

283
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,360
Uncle, do not
let such rumors trouble you.

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,270
I will dig out the truth about it.

285
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,440
Go ahead.

286
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,720
Yes.

287
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,550
Departing from the Imperial Capital,

288
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,630
it takes five days downstream
to Zhuzhou.

289
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,480
Keep moving eastward,
we'll reach Jianning.

290
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,750
Then if we keep heading south,

291
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,670
we can arrive in Jinyang
within three days.

292
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,440
So, for this first voyage,

293
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,440
let's head to Zhuzhou.

294
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,750
It is closer and carries less risk.

295
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
Although Zhuzhou is close,

296
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,670
stopping there might seem like

297
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,840
dragging in everybody

298
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,630
for nothing.

299
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,270
It's better to continue south
to Jinyang.

300
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,720
That place is well-connected

301
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,600
with convenient road
and water transport.

302
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,080
Plus, goods from all over the country

303
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,000
are all shipped there.

304
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,510
If the journey goes smoothly,

305
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,480
then within ten days,

306
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,630
we can return home.

307
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,360
We'll keep the ingredients iced.

308
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:33,870
There'll be no problem.

309
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,440
Jinyang...

310
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,270
Isn't that where Lady Rong

311
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,120
lives now?

312
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,440
That was the personal motive of mine.

313
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,240
I'm going to pay Rong a visit
on the way.

314
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,440
But...

315
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,030
Miss Hua, do you plan
to make this journey in person?

316
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,870
Yes.

317
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,270
That will be the maiden voyage
of our ship.

318
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,150
If I don't go,

319
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,120
I won't feel at ease.

320
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,120
Everyone has entrusted
their money to me.

321
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,600
I can't just let it go to waste.

322
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:52,720
Young Lady,

323
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,720
just go without worry.

324
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,600
Mingxia and I

325
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,840
will take good care of the restaurant.

326
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,360
Commander,

327
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:06,720
we found him.

328
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,790
This man

329
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,750
bribed children with fruits

330
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
and taught them to sing the ballad.

331
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,270
Right.

332
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,390
But he can hardly read.

333
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,200
How could he possibly compose ballads?

334
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,910
Him, and a few others.

335
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,750
They were paid to do this risky job.

336
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,240
Find the one

337
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,840
who was paying them.

338
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,910
Let's see what exactly is happening.

339
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,360
Yes, sir.

340
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:23,840
Yes, sir.

341
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,390
You found the source of the ballad?

342
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,510
Yes.

343
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,200
[I've been investigating
the mastermind secretly.]

344
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,230
[I believe they're in Jinyang.]

345
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,240
Yanxi,

346
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,270
this time,

347
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,240
you'll have to make another
long journey.

348
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,510
It is my duty.

349
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,390
I heard that girl from the Hua Family

350
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,360
is quite remarkable.

351
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,240
She has raised funds
to buy a merchant ship

352
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,000
and is preparing to do business
on the water.

353
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,870
Do you know about this?

354
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,600
I have long severed ties with her.

355
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,440
I am not aware of her recent moves.

356
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,960
Yanxi,

357
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
I was also young once.

358
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,240
With time,

359
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
romance

360
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,080
will naturally fade away.

361
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,240
Alright,

362
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:19,790
off you go.

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,910
Take it as a chance to relax.

364
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,390
Thank you for your kindness.

365
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,480
I will set out today.

366
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,360
[I believe they're in Jinyang]

367
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,390
Look,

368
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,750
a few days ago,

369
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,790
I ordered these hairpins.

370
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,240
One for you,

371
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,550
one for Rong.

372
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,150
They're beautiful.

373
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,150
Indeed.

374
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,510
Zhi,

375
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,790
as Rong hasn't been around,

376
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,630
I had nothing to do.

377
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,600
So I made a few clothes.

378
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,670
These were measured

379
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,870
by her previous size.

380
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,150
I don't even know

381
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,870
if she has gained or lost weight by now

382
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,080
and if these will fit.

383
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,630
There's no need to worry.

384
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,390
How about I find an artist

385
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,910
to sketch Rong

386
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,600
in her new clothes

387
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:04,600
and bring the painting back to you?

388
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,390
There's no need for that.

389
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,630
As long as Rong is happy.

390
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,600
That's all I need.

391
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,670
I remember that Rong

392
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,150
loves the red bean cakes from our shop.

393
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,150
Those cakes are easy to preserve,

394
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:16,960
so I had someone

395
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,870
bring back a few boxes.

396
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,960
Take them with you

397
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,440
and remind her of the taste of home.

398
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:21,840
Pack them up.

399
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,320
And these.

400
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,840
Rong

401
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,240
can't live without her storybooks.

402
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,320
These are the latest ten chapters
of The Story of Hongxiao.

403
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,390
Take these lest she think

404
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,240
about it all the time.

405
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,910
This book is already dog-eared.

406
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,080
You must have read it quite a lot, too.

407
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,510
Just pack them up.

408
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,670
The way of learning

409
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,510
lies in cultivating virtues

410
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,870
and serving the people.

411
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,550
And in stopping at...

412
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,360
Stopping at...

413
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,670
In stopping at...

414
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,270
I can never memorize this part.

415
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,840
But Bolin and the others can recite it.

416
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:11,910
Be patient.

417
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,000
You started later than they did.

418
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,120
Being able to learn so much now

419
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,000
is no small feat.

420
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,630
How about this?

421
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,320
I will go over it for you again.

422
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,200
Once you understand the meaning,

423
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,150
I'm sure you can recite it.

424
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:21,720
All right?

425
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
The purpose of learning

426
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,000
lies in decent morals.

427
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,480
The way of learning

428
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,870
is also the way of governing.

429
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,480
The ruler must take
the well-being of the people to heart

430
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,080
and treat the people with the intention
of utmost goodness.

431
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,870
Do you understand?

432
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:38,870
Now look here...

433
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,510
I've looked everywhere for Jian.

434
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,320
It turns out you're giving him
extra tutoring.

435
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,150
Jian,

436
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,360
hurry up and thank Mr. Shen

437
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,360
for being so dedicated to you.

438
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,790
Thank you, sir.

439
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,840
You're going south in person?

440
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,480
Yes.

441
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:58,630
Seeing is believing.

442
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,840
I won't rest easy

443
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,840
unless I make this trip myself.

444
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,000
Then I will accompany you.

445
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,510
That will be great.

446
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,670
When it's inconvenient for me
to appear in public,

447
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,270
you will be our face as Mr. Shen
from the Capital.

448
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:09,870
Alright.

449
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,150
You're setting out on a long journey?

450
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,030
Yes.

451
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,390
Mr. Shen and I

452
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,440
are going on a long trip together.

453
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,510
Zhi, I want to go too.

454
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,150
Jian told me

455
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,960
he has never left the Imperial Capital.

456
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,320
He's of a reserved nature.

457
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,630
It'll do him good
to go out and see the world.

458
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,200
Master Hua used to say

459
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,200
that reading is the same as traveling.

460
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,750
For both character and horizon,

461
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,440
traveling will do him good.

462
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,000
Then you must
prepare your luggage quickly.

463
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,080
We'll set off tomorrow.

464
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,750
Thank you, Zhi!

465
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,240
Young Lady.

466
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,960
The wind is strong on the river.
Don't catch a cold.

467
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,030
A strong wind is good for sailing.

468
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,080
Commander.

469
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,240
Commander,

470
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,840
look at the flag on that ship!

471
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,080
It's the Hua Family's flag.

472
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,510
Miss Hua has her own ship now.

473
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,480
Whatever she does,

474
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,830
she always gets it done.

475
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,270
Commander,

476
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,270
we've caught all the privateers.

477
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,790
How dare you

478
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,550
target the Hua Family's merchant ship?

479
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:33,960
Rest assured, sir.

480
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,680
Miss Hua was not alarmed.

481
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:36,720
Keep a close watch.

482
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,270
Things on this canal

483
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,400
are not peaceful.

484
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes, sir.

485
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,920
Look!

486
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,240
Look, there's a little porpoise!

487
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,830
How delightful!

488
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,750
It swims so fast!

489
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,550
It has dived down.

490
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,240
Where did it go?

491
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,310
Careful.

492
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,350
Got it.

493
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,880
Naughty boy!

494
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,110
It's swum back again!

495
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:23,350
Hurry inside.

496
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,030
It's over there.

497
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,160
Looks like rain.

498
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,030
Get inside.

499
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,400
Young Lady,

500
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:28,830
you're right.

501
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,200
There're dark clouds in the sky

502
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,510
and hidden waves in the river.

503
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,790
A storm is coming.

504
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,070
Let's go.

505
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,270
Let's lower the sails.

506
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,310
Okay.

507
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,480
Go and call for help

508
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,270
to lower the sails.

509
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,110
Okay.

510
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,920
Also inform the ships behind.

511
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,030
Tell them to lower their sails too.

512
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,160
Okay.

513
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,960
Lower the sails!

514
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,270
Sails down!

515
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,400
Quickly!

516
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,200
Sails down!

517
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
You guys, stop wasting time!

518
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,110
Hurry up, lower the sails!

519
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,110
Sails down!

520
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,750
Sails down!

521
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,550
A storm is coming!

522
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,070
Sails down!

523
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,400
Sails down!

524
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,270
Hurry up!

525
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,270
Sails down!

526
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,750
Sails down!

527
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,070
Lower the sails quickly!

528
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:15,720
Grandfather,

529
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,200
now I can sail anywhere I want too.

530
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,480
I no longer fear the storm.

531
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,720
[Jinyang Dock]
Zhi!

532
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,000
Zhi, I'm right here!

533
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:42,960
Rong!

534
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,350
Rong,

535
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,160
slow down. Be careful.

536
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,310
Got a letter
saying that you were coming.

537
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,270
I've been looking forward to it
day and night.

538
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,720
You're finally here!

539
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Let me have a good look at you again.

540
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,440
You're as good-looking as ever.

541
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,590
You have become plumper, though.

542
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,880
Your mother talked about it every day.

543
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,640
She wonders if you're now

544
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,640
plumper or slimmer than before.

545
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,750
Is Mother doing well?

546
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,720
Is everyone doing well?

547
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,830
Yes, they're all well.

548
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:08,960
They just miss you a lot.

549
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,830
A banquet has been prepared at home.

550
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,510
We can start the feast
as soon as we return.

551
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,750
The carriage has been readied as well.

552
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,200
I've also found

553
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,110
accommodations for the sailors.

554
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,640
I'll have someone
take them to settle in.

555
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,920
Thank you for being so thoughtful.

556
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,510
Thank you.

557
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,550
Don't mention it.

558
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,440
We are family.

559
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,030
Who is this?

560
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,400
This is Mr. Shen.

561
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,550
You haven't met him yet.

562
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,310
This is Jian,

563
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,510
the youngest boy in our family.

564
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,680
Mr. Jiang.

565
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's get going.

566
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,030
I'm already hungry.

567
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,590
Zhi and I will share a carriage.

568
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,200
How come it's Mr. Shen Qi
who accompanies you?

569
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,030
Where is Mr. Yan?

570
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,790
[Jiang Mansion]
Mr. Shen, be careful.

571
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,270
This place is even more splendid

572
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,240
than our old mansion!

573
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,350
Zhi,

574
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,400
now that you have come,

575
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,720
you must stay with me a little longer.

576
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,680
Tomorrow, I'll take you downtown

577
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,400
for a good stroll.

578
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,240
If there's anything you need to do,

579
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,590
just leave it to Zhengzhi.

580
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,270
I'm here for business.

581
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:17,880
So

582
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,160
it's better for me to stay at the inn.

583
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,480
Zhi, what kind of business

584
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,200
are you doing this time?

585
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,310
Maybe I can help you with it.

586
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,550
This time,

587
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,920
I came to purchase some ingredients.

588
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,550
Also, as Jinyang is a fertile land,

589
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,350
I want to seek

590
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,350
other business opportunities.

591
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,750
Just stop talking

592
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:33,510
about business for now.

593
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,480
Zhi must be tired of the long journey.

594
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,070
Let's go eat first.

595
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,480
Zhi,

596
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,440
we have chefs from the Imperial Capital.

597
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,350
Zhengzhi was worried
that I might not like Jinyang cuisine.

598
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,350
Zhi, don't worry about me.

599
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,880
My parents-in-law hardly show up,

600
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,960
nor do they interfere much with us.

601
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,240
And my sister-in-law

602
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,590
is as gentle as Aunt Wu.

603
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,200
She's been so nice to me.

604
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,400
But last month,
she got married and left home.

605
00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,720
So she seldom stays here now.

606
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,960
Zhengzhi is obviously

607
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,640
a meticulous person.

608
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,400
He treats you well.

609
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,070
This year for my birthday,

610
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,480
Zhengzhi hired a troupe

611
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,400
to stage The Story of Hongxiao.

612
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,640
Zhi, how do you think

613
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,160
he knew that I like it?

614
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,350
Ling

615
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,720
sent you so many storybooks.

616
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,790
It seems they're all wasted.

617
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,480
But seeing you well

618
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,440
puts my mind at ease.

619
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,550
Zhi,

620
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,440
I hope

621
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,750
you can also be with someone
who cherishes you.

622
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,720
Ladies and gentlemen...

623
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,960
Let's go have a look.

624
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,720
Okay.

625
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

626
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,510
next, I will perform

627
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,830
my specialty,

628
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,960
my master skill.

629
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,440
I will make people

630
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,480
disappear into thin air!

631
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:50,070
- Good!
- Good!

632
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,240
Alright, next,

633
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,110
I will invite two people onstage
to assist me.

634
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,070
Two?

635
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,200
Any volunteers?

636
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,400
Zhi, let's go together!

637
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,200
Here, here!

638
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,070
Alright, two beautiful ladies!

639
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,000
Come on.

640
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,440
Come on.

641
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,750
Follow me.

642
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,480
Come here.

643
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,240
Clap your hands!

644
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,960
Come on.

645
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,550
Come on.

646
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,160
Good!

647
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,510
Please, come this way.

648
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,550
Alright.

649
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,310
Watch carefully.

650
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,160
Zhi, come in!

651
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,000
The living people...

652
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,860
♪When all the lights
were taken from the world♪

653
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,730
♪You are my only shimmering star♪

654
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,890
♪You save me with everything♪

655
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,510
♪Protecting me by my side♪

656
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,650
♪Refusing to give up♪

657
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,610
♪Never give up♪

658
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,740
♪Just to seize♪

659
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:45,720
Commander,

660
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,480
the trap we set

661
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,400
has gotten something.

662
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,400
So this is how

663
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,750
they trick people!

664
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,750
This place is so different
from the Imperial Capital!

665
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,680
Daqing is vast.

666
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,640
Local customs vary from place to place.

667
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,550
Three fried pancakes, please.

668
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,830
Sure, just a moment.

669
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,310
Here go you.

670
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,510
Eat up.

671
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,160
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

672
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,550
Jian,

673
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,960
back in the academy, I am the teacher

674
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:37,920
while you are a student.

675
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,960
Now as we're out here,

676
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,240
you're just a child.

677
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,510
If there's anything
you want to eat or buy,

678
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,350
just tell me.

679
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,720
Jian?

680
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,160
Mr. Shen,

681
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,790
can I go check on him?

682
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,830
Are you hungry?

683
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,550
It tastes good, doesn't it?

684
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,030
Slow down. Don't get choked.

685
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,960
Choking to death
is better than starving.

686
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,480
Where's your home?

687
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,590
Home?

688
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,790
Jinyang City is my home.

689
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,310
This

690
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,310
is my bed.

691
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,920
I'm just trying to get by.

692
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,680
It's alright.

693
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,400
I used to be like this too,

694
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,480
starving every day

695
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,750
and trying to survive,

696
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,510
as death could come at any moment.

697
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,920
And then?

698
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:31,880
Later on,

699
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,720
I managed to get out.

700
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,350
I found a home.

701
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,550
I now have food to eat
and a school to attend.

702
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:39,960
Things will

703
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,720
get better for you too.

704
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,720
The world won't always be so terrible.

705
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,750
I don't believe that.

706
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,110
There's no such good fortune.

707
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,030
Even if it does exist,

708
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:47,920
it's just sheer luck.

709
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,830
You met good people.

710
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,000
But in this city,

711
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,790
there're no good people.

712
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,750
This is my pocket money.

713
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,310
It's all here.

714
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,350
Take it.

715
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:17,880
What's wrong, Jian?

716
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,270
Mr. Shen,

717
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,830
back then,

718
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
if I hadn't met Zhi,

719
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,750
I might

720
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,590
still be like him now,

721
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,270
wandering on the streets.

722
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,680
I might've died of starvation by now.

723
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,640
But I am not her.

724
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,790
That bag of money

725
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,070
won't really help him much.

726
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,270
In this world,

727
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,640
there must be many others

728
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,550
like him

729
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,920
and me before.

730
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,160
They're all suffering.

731
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:49,960
It doesn't matter.

732
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,680
You are still young.

733
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:52,960
You

734
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,240
will surely become

735
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,750
someone as remarkable as Zhi.

736
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,480
Someone who can help them.

737
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,440
But

738
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,110
you can only help them one by one.

739
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,830
In a city,

740
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,880
in an empire,

741
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,030
there are just too many kids

742
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,880
suffering like this.

743
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,000
But Mr. Shen,

744
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,790
is there really no way

745
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,440
to make their lives better?

746
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,720
You never know.

747
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,200
You might find a way it in the future.

748
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,590
The others can't,

749
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,510
but you can.

750
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,070
Alright.

751
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,310
We're here to see this city today.

752
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,160
Let's go.

753
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,830
Rong, Zhi.

754
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,270
Rong,

755
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,510
you should take some rest.

756
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,400
Yesterday, Zhi said
she wants to do business.

757
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,000
So I invited a guest over.

758
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,550
I'll accompany her to meet with him.

759
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,000
Okay.

760
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,110
Then I'll

761
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,030
sort these things out.

762
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,640
Who is this person?

763
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,720
My family has lived in Jinyang
for generations.

764
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,200
About the business world,

765
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,240
though I haven't been deeply involved,

766
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,400
I do know some friends.

767
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,590
This one

768
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,270
is a successful businessman
from Jinyang,

769
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:59,640
named Zeng Ming.

770
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,000
He has extensive connections

771
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,000
and is very friendly.

772
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,160
He must be able to help you.

773
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,310
This is

774
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,750
my elder sister-in-law,

775
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,550
known as the Jade God of Wealth.

776
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,030
Miss Hua,

777
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm very pleased to meet you.

778
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,350
Mr. Zeng, you might need
to look out for us.

779
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,270
Since Mr. Jiang has asked me a favor,

780
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,030
I will

781
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,830
surely try my best.

782
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,550
Miss Hua, if there's anything you need,

783
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,590
just say the word.

784
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,550
I've got it all covered.

785
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,880
It's so heavy!

786
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,510
My wrists are even sore!

787
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,830
It's so pretty!

788
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,270
I didn't even want it.

789
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,440
Master insisted on buying it for me.

790
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,160
It's like carrying a rock all day,

791
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,480
so tiring.

792
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,550
Look at this ring of mine!

793
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,070
Has it got scratched?

794
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,310
It really shows off
the beauty of your hand.

795
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,680
This ring really brings out
your skin tone.

796
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,030
This one looks good too.

797
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,920
Where did you get this?

798
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,070
It really makes your hand look pretty!

799
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,680
This one looks good as well.

800
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:20,880
Mr. Zeng,

801
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,830
this...

802
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,960
It's today's tea party.

803
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,960
All the ladies of high society in town

804
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,030
have been invited.

805
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,270
If you become friends with them,

806
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,960
business opportunities

807
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,440
will naturally come to you!

808
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,790
Look,

809
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,030
the lady in the middle is Madam Chen.

810
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,790
Her family deals in seafood.

811
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,440
Fish, shrimp, pearls, shells...
They have it all.

812
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,960
And that lady over there

813
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,240
is Madam Zhou.

814
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,880
Her husband is a major grain merchant

815
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,160
in Jinyang City.

816
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,440
Mr. Zeng, what brings you here?

817
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,680
Good to see you all.

818
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,110
Greetings, madams!

819
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,270
Who is this lovely girl?

820
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,920
Today, I will introduce

821
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,880
a new girl to you all.

822
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:03,880
This is

823
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,640
Miss Hua from the Imperial Capital.

824
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,720
She's the owner of Zhiming Restaurant.

825
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,160
The pastries

826
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,590
served in her restaurant

827
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,720
are even favored

828
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,590
by the Empress Dowager!

829
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,550
It's quite impressive, indeed!

830
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,110
Have you been to the Palace?

831
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,440
Are the women in the Palace

832
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,110
all as beautiful

833
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
as fairies?

834
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,550
What do they wear?

835
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,830
How do they like their hair done?

836
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,240
What styles of clothes do they wear?

837
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,880
What kind of pastries do they eat?

838
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,160
I have other matters to attend to,

839
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:30,550
so I will take my leave now.

840
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,640
Let's catch up another day.

841
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,350
See you around.

842
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,400
Bye.

843
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,590
My Lady has always been
living in a simple style.

844
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,200
Her mind is not on dressing up.

845
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,200
But

846
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,160
when I followed her

847
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,510
to the Palace to deliver the pastries,

848
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,960
I've seen it all.

849
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,550
Right now in the Palace,

850
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,680
the most popular hairstyle
is the skyward hair bun...

851
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:46,920
That was hard for you.

852
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,000
If they asked you what books you read

853
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,880
and what kind of business you do,

854
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,030
you would talk all day.

855
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,110
But when it comes to clothes
and jewelry,

856
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,920
you can't say

857
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,590
even half a word.

858
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,880
Don't make fun of me.

859
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,440
All right.

860
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,510
Sorry, I'm late!

861
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,640
So sorry!

862
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,350
Mr. Lu,

863
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,310
please forgive me.

864
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,310
Oh, please.

865
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,920
It's me who's asking you for a favor.

866
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,830
Please, have a seat.

867
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,830
All right.

868
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,350
To be honest with you, Mr. Zeng,

869
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,550
during my years in the Imperial Capital,

870
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,720
I've managed to save up some money.

871
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,070
This time,

872
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,000
I came to Jinyang

873
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,480
to look for a good business opportunity.

874
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,400
Since you have the money,

875
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,720
then I'll tell you the truth.

876
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:48,270
Actually, although Jinyang is affluent,

877
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,160
the most profitable business here

878
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,640
is not trade, you know?

879
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,960
I would like to hear the details.

880
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,160
In fact, there is

881
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,960
a business that is extremely profitable.

882
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,960
Two more bolts of brocade for Madam Zhou

883
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,790
and a hairpin
with the eight-treasure design.

884
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:17,920
Young Lady,

885
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,720
add them up!

886
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,070
The products

887
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,030
these madams ordered

888
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,350
are worth nearly more

889
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,590
than our restaurant's monthly income!

890
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,200
Alright, you're the capable one.

891
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,270
That's quite true.

892
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,550
Madam Chen.

893
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,070
If there's anything else you want,

894
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,030
we'll make note of it all.

895
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:31,960
Next time,

896
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,110
I'll bring them all to you

897
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:33,790
along with our pastries.

898
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,590
You can give them a try.

899
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,440
Alright,

900
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,640
this is good.

901
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,880
Tonight, I'll talk to my husband.

902
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,110
The top-quality seafood

903
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,440
will be reserved for you.

904
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Thank you, Madam.

905
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,270
Mr. Shen here

906
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,680
is so good at handwriting

907
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,440
and also handsome.

908
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,920
How old are you?

909
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,880
Are you married?

910
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,030
Not... Not yet.

911
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,240
My younger sister is eighteen.

912
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,720
You two will make a perfect match.

913
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,790
How about

914
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,000
you come home with me today

915
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,310
and meet with her?

916
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,400
T-Thank you, but no.

917
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,110
My younger sister

918
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,360
has her dowry all prepared,

919
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,510
but there's no one

920
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,590
she likes here in Jinyang.

921
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,710
As long as you're willing to,

922
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,230
you're more than welcome
to join my family.

923
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,920
My parents have no sons.

924
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,480
A son-in-law will be like a son to them.

925
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,840
Madam Zhou,

926
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,550
Mr. Shen still has his parents at home.

927
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,550
I fear

928
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,000
he'll need their opinion.

929
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,150
Be patient, though.

930
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,230
We'll be staying in Jinyang

931
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,150
for a few more days.

932
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,030
There's plenty of chances ahead.

933
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,550
Madam Zhou,

934
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,710
your sister is so young.

935
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,190
Why the rush?

936
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,590
She's so beautiful.

937
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,150
Many would want to marry her.

938
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,030
Commander,

939
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,070
the patrols

940
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,800
in these gambling houses

941
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,190
are all professional fighters.

942
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,960
I'm afraid the business
Mr. Zeng talked about

943
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,000
won't be so easy to manage.

944
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:34,510
Find out

945
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,230
who's the true owner

946
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,760
of these houses.

947
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:37,880
Yes, sir.

948
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,230
- Hurry up!
- Slow down.

949
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,230
Who would have thought

950
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,280
that Jinyang could be so lively?

951
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,710
It's even more bustling
than the Imperial Capital.

952
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,150
Jinyang is a prosperous place.

953
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,440
I heard that the people here

954
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,230
always drink and gamble all night long.

955
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,230
When night falls,

956
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,510
it becomes even livelier than daytime.

957
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,070
If I'd known this,

958
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,840
I'd have sold you to the Zhou Family

959
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
to be their son-in-law.

960
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,110
That way, I might be able

961
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,360
to make a good deal with them.

962
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,190
Do you really want to sell me?

963
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,360
Water lanterns!

964
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,880
Water lanterns!

965
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,360
Lotus water lanterns!

966
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,280
Mister,

967
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,440
get a lotus lantern

968
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,800
and live happily ever after
with your lady!

969
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,800
We'll have two. One for each.

970
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,360
Alright!

971
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,550

How is it today?

1010
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,760
Here she comes.

1011
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,880
Does this look good?

1012
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,510
She's here.

1013
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,320
Madams.

1014
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,760
Why are you alone?

1015
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,960
Where is Mr. Shen?

1016
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,630
He's too scared to come.

1017
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,710
He's quite shy!

1018
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,710
So very shy.

1019
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,070
I quite like him.

1020
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,880
You're not leaving early again today.

1021
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,590
Tonight,

1022
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,150
let's go to the assembly together.

1023
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,510
We'll ask the envoy

1024
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,070
to predict your marriage.

1025
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,480
Envoy?

1026
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,670
You're new here.

1027
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,840
Here in Jinyang,

1028
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,190
we have a living immortal

1029
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,670
known as Master Haoyue.

1030
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,510
She's a divine being descended to earth,

1031
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,760
able to predict weather and fortune.

1032
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,840
The ones who go to sea for business

1033
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,360
always consult her for divination,

1034
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,510
and it works every time.

1035
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,590
You better believe this.

1036
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,630
My husband

1037
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,070
is always out at sea.

1038
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,440
Each year, he donates
a hundred thousand to her!

1039
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,630
Now you got me curious.

1040
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,190
But you can't go dressed like this.

1041
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,110
We all are

1042
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,000
her notable customers.

1043
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,280
Come on, girls,

1044
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,670
let's make her look good!

1045
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,000
The Seven Stars Mansion?

1046
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,360
Yes.

1047
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,150
That's exactly the name of the place.

1048
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,360
If you wish

1049
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,760
to conduct business in Jinyang,

1050
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:11,960
first of all,

1051
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,510
you must consult Master Haoyue about it.

1052
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,070
And second,

1053
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,550
you can't avoid dealing with
the Seven Stars Mansion.

1054
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,670
The Seven Stars Mansion

1055
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,510
is like a towering tree

1056
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,670
that shades the entire city.

1057
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,150
Since you are new here,

1058
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,320
if you don't wish to
lean on that big tree,

1059
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,960
it might be hard for you to take root.

1060
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,590
Well, this Master Haoyue.

1061
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,960
Who is that?

1062
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,760
She

1063
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,920
was invited to Jinyang City

1064
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,920
by the Seven Stars Mansion

1065
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,590
three years ago.

1066
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:43,710
She's amazing, seriously!

1067
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,510
Nowadays,

1068
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,630
from small ceremonies
like weddings and funerals

1069
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,230
to major matters
like fleets setting sail

1070
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,550
or officials being promoted,

1071
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,670
all must seek her counsel.

1072
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,030
Or people won't feel at ease at all.

1073
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,800
Oh, right.

1074
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,070
At the beginning of this year,

1075
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
she said there would be a drought.

1076
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,320
Look what's happening now!

1077
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,960
Didn't

1078
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,510
her prediction come true?

1079
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,000
Is it really so accurate?

1080
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,840
Where did she come from?

1081
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,400
It doesn't matter!

1082
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,590
As long as she can help you

1083
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,880
make a fortune,

1084
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,150
that'll be enough, no?

1085
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,070
That makes sense.

1086
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,110
It's about to start.

1087
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,280
- Let's go over there.
- Come on.

1088
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,760
Let's go.

1089
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,400
Why are you still standing there?

1090
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,150
You must be respectful.

1091
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,030
Hua Zhi.

1092
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,000
Get down!

1093
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,150
Last night, three stars appeared
along with the moon.

1094
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,960
It was a sign of great disaster.

1095
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,760
My heart is filled with compassion.

1096
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,400
I set up the altar

1097
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,630
only to alleviate disasters for you all

1098
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,840
and to guard you safe.

1099
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,230
- Thank you, Master.
- Thank you, Master.

1100
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:50,960
If you have any questions,

1101
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,880
