[Episode 8]

25
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,860
Just go to sleep.

26
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,860
When recovered,

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,420
just clean the blanket

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,420
and return it.

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,180
Just lie down.

00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:53,700
Come on,

31
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,620
Be careful.

32
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,300
Gentle.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,500
Does it hurt?

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,780
The way you lost your temper just now

35
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,980
was quite impressive.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,260
Now you feel the pain?

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,420
Don't move!

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,220
I'll take off your bloodied clothes

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,220
and wrap up the wound with them.

40
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,140
The wound has been wrapped.

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,780
How is she now?

42
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,540
The dressing is changed.
She's asleep now.

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,780
You should get some sleep too.

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,260
Do you think I'm getting senile?

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,380

00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,900
to let her go alone.

47

00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,060
she has to recover fully.

61
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,660
Indeed.

62
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,260
She is thoughtful.

63
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,780
This trip,

64
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,700

just her body.

68
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,940
it was all my fault.

69
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm sorry, to you

70

It's okay. It's over now.

Earlier today,

74
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,900
I was too proud

75
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,860
to say something nice.

76
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,980
Hua Zhi had her reason

77
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,460
to be unhappy.

78
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,140
Don't be sad.

79
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,380
Look at yourself,

80
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,420
are you acting like a young lady

81
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,940
from an official family?

82
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,860
You must be careful on the road.

83
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,940
If you can't catch up with them,

84
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,420
then let it be.

85
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,740
Trading is a lowly profession after all.

86
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,740
If you take it as a long-term plan,

87
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,060
I'm afraid

88
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,700
it is to degrade yourself.

89
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,300
Hua Zhi,

90
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,540
where did all these quilts come from?

91
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,100
Just lie down.

92
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,340
Why ask so many questions?

93
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,140
Give this to BoLi,

94
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,660
save him from being forced
to reciting books.

95
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,580

96
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,940

97
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,780
You, an unmarried girl,

98
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,260
how can you

99
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,500
bargain with those merchants?

100
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,220
Don't ever

101
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,340
give me money again.

102
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,820
I won't take your money anymore.

103
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,180
Either way, it was my fault.

104
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,260
Just go to sleep.

105
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,220
When you recovered from the injury,

106
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,340
wash the quilt

107
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,260
and return it.

108
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,620
They are all domestic women.

109
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,100
They have no real abilities indeed.

110
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,940
But when something happens to you,

111
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:14,900
at least,

112
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,980
you'll have someone
waiting for you at home,

113
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
worried about you.

114
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,260
Sometimes, the closer people are

115
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,380
the deeper the rift between them.

116
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,620
As if there's a sheet of paper
between you two.

117
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,540
Only when the paper is torn.

118
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,620
can you see each other's true heart.

119
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,820
As long as you find the right star,

120
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,260
you can reach your destination.

are you feeling better today?

124
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,740
Much better.

125
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,340
There’s something

126
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,380
I want to talk to you.

127
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,300
What if I don't agree?

128
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,820
Do you want to

129
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,660
get rid of your mother and Aunt Xia

130
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,380
and work on your own?

131
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,500
I want to take charge of the household
and manage things.

132
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,380
But why?

133
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,780
I have an idea.

134
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,020
Perhaps it'll work.

135
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,060
It'll save us

136
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,620
and Grandfather and the others.

137
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,260
Tell me about it.

138
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,300
According to the Daqing Criminal Law,

139
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,980
volume 29, article 65,

140
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,620
apart from the ten abominations,

141
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,740
flogging, beating with sticks,
penal servitude, exile, and execution,

142
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,300
can all be redeemed.

143
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,380
Depending on
the severity of the punishment,

144
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,860
redemption can be made with money.

145
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,380
How much money is required?

146
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,460
200, 000 coins a year
for penal servitude,

147
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,540
300,000 for a two-thousand-mile exile,

148
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,940
and 500,000 for
a three-thousand-mile exile.

149
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,380
As for hanging and beheading,

150
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,740
that'll be 1.2 million.

My dear,

work day and night,

177
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,260
they can earn up to 2000 per month.

178
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,420
After buying the food and clothing,

179
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,940
they'll have nothing left.

180
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,460
Making thousands
is already quite a feat.

181
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,660

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,500
Right now,

191
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,220
Madam,

192
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,380
Hua Zhi means well.

193
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,100
Please don't blame her.

194
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,140
Zhi,

195
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
you are too young to...

196
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,260
Let her speak.

197
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,500
Indeed, if you ask me for the money now,

198
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,300
or to provide

199
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,460
a way to make this fortune at once,

200
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,500
I can't do that.

201
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,700
Let alone you,

202
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,820
not even the Goddess of Wealth

203
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,260
can conjure up this kind of money.

204
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,060
But there is still a way to go.

205
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,260
As long as the goal is set,

206
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,620
I'll figure out a way to reach it.

207
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,100
What way?

208
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,460
Hua Zhi,

209
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,100
This is nothing like the last time.

210
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,100
Last time, you relied on your courage.

211
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,260
But now, not to mention thousands,

212
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,820
only for this month's food,

213
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,020
you can't conjure them up.

214
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,740
This morning, when I made porridge,

215
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,500
there was not a single grain left.

216
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:23,940
Baoxia,

217
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,540
take Yinzhu and Chanlu,

218
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,660
get the carriage and go to downtown,

219
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,500
to buy everything we need

220
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,220
for this month.

221
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,220
The rest of the money,
by 20% of the old standard,

222
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,540
give it to the servants as their wage.

223
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,260
Yes,

224
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,180
I'll get the carriage

225
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:39,980
and set off immediately.

226
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,820
Go.

227
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,900
Where does this check

228
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,100
come from?

229
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,740
Oh my,

230
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,580
that was ten taels of silver!

231
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:45,940
How can you

232
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,260
just so easily

233
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,540
give it to the servants?

234
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,900
Quickly call them back!

235
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,620
Not just them.

236
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,140
Grandmother, aunties,

237
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,660
even the younger ones will all
receive a monthly allowance.

238
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,940
There will be more next month.

239
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,860
From now on,
we will have pocket money.

240
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,300
That uh...

241
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,420
You,

242
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,380
you can't do this.

243
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,020
Hurry up and apologize to your auntie,

244
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,060
and ask her to take charge again.

245
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,260
Quickly.

246
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,860
Grandmother,

247
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,220
As long as I'm in charge of this family,

248
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,180
I'll assure you we have enough to live.

249
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,660
Three months.

250
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,140
If I fail,

251
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,340
I'll hand the account book

252
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,180
back to Aunt Xia with both hands.

253
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:39,140
It has cleared up.

254
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,140
Yesterday it was cloudy.

255
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,220
Perhaps last night,

256
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,660
the wind blew the clouds away.

257
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,260
Hua Zhi,

258
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,300
come here.

259
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,340
Grandmother,

260
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,420
I have said what needed to be said.

261
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,220
As for other matters,

262
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,820
I truly don't know at the moment.

263
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,860
I wasn't going to ask more questions.

264
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,740
Since I've allowed you to be in charge,

265
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,900
the result and consequences

266
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,020
will be your responsibility to bear.

267
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,060
However, there is one thing

268
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,740
I need you to make a decision about.

269
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,700
The marriage with the Shen family?

270
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,420
My granddaughter is so smart.

271
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,380
Grandmother,

272
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,140
please write a letter for me

273
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,180
to break off the engagement.

274
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,220
From now on, we will make our own way

275
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,180
without relying on other people.

276
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,220
And I will take a good care of my family

277
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,100
in my own way.

278
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
This letter,

279
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,820
I will not write for you.

280
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,180
I will personally take you

281
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,380
to the Shen family
to break off this engagement.

282
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,580
Girl,

283
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,420
Let's go.

284
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:45,940
Grandmother,

285
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,500
I'm not skilled at driving a carriage.

286
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,860
You might find it bumpy.

287
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:49,820
That's fine.

288
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,580
For dinner,

289
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,060
I'd like an extra bowl of rice.

290
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,420
Before, our carriages

291
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,780
were always covered.

292
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,860
The window was tiny,
and it felt stifling sitting inside.

293
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,740
But today,

294
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,420
I get this wide view.

295
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,900
My mind is also broadened.

296
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,370
[Shen Mansion]

297
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,060
Madame Hua comes to visit.

298
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,460
Okay, just a moment.

299
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,740
We should stay away from them.

300
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,060
How could you let them in?

301
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,020
What do you know?

302
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,900
The two of them,

303
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,580
everyone knows who they are.

304
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,620
If they kept standing at our door,

305
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,900
we'd be in trouble.

306
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,780
Dear,

307
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,660
I can't see them myself.

308
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,820
Later,

309
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,300
Whatever they want,

310
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,820
just send them away.

311
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:48,660
I...

312
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,060
What's the fuss?

313
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,500
Mother.

314
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,140
Mother.

315
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,340
Are they man-eating tigers or what?

316
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,580
An old women and a girl

317
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,540
have scared you to this state.

318
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,140
If you want to hide, then hide.

319
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,740
I’ll meet with Madam Hua.

320
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,420
Alright.

321
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,940
My friend.

322
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,340
Madam.

323
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,820
Madam,

324
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,900
this must be your eldest granddaughter.

325
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,900
Indeed.

326
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,220
Madam, many blessings.

327
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,340
My old friend,

328
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,540
My son is still at work.

329
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,660
There're only us

330
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,380
left at home.

331
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,460
We apologize for any neglect.

332
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,260
Your son has been promoted.

333
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,180
His Majesty relies heavily upon him.

334
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,100
Naturally, he's too busy to meet guests.

335
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,100
This is good, though.

336
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,660
Without the men,

337
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,780
us girls

338
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,580
can do the talking the way we want.

339
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,580
Please.

340
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,940
Living in the manor

341
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,580
must be hard for you.

342
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,420
If you need anything,

343
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,900
I'll send them to you.

344
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Or you can

345
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,580
carry them back using that a cart.

346
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,780
Life in the manor is humble indeed,

347
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,220
but with my granddaughter here,

348
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,220
We have everything we need.

349
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,180
I have heard about it.

350
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,260
Hua Zhi has been
selling couplet on the street

351
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
In this imperial capital,

352
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,820
words have spread everywhere.

353
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,380
I've also heard about it.

354
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,260
Thanks to your grandson.

355
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,420
He's truly an upright

356
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,860
and kind-hearted child.

357
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,460
Back then, our lord

358
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,100
arranged this engagement.

359
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,900
He didn't choose the wrong person.

360
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,740
Shen Qi is preparing for
the imperial examination next year.

361
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,020
Now,

362
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,740
he's been studying hard.

363
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,780
This engagement...

364
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,500
The engagement,

365
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,140
let's cancel it.

366
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,500
My friend...

367
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,580
I apologize for the intrusion today.

368
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,700
We shouldn't be here.

369
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,220
But I feel that

370
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,660
we should finish what we started.

371
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,420
The day you went to the manor,

372
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,860
was due to emotional ties,

373
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,940
but I can't pretend
like nothing happened.

374
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,460
Nowadays, our two families
are worlds apart.

375
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,020
This marriage

376
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,140
is inappropriate.

377
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,860
Today, I'll make the decision
on behalf of our lord,

378
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,300
to annul this engagement.

379
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,220
Our families have been friends
for generations.

380
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,740
It is us

381
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,460
who let you down.

382
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,980
It's just that times have changed.

383
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,420
However, there's one more thing.

384
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,500
The betrothal gifts you sent to us

385
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,100
along with the betrothal letters

386
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,620
back when we arranged the engagement

387
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,500
have all been confiscated.

388
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,380
Now,

389
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,820
we can't pay you back.

390
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,500
Let's not mention it.

391
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,460
Debts must be repaid.

392
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,740
We can't pay you back now,

393
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,420
it doesn't mean we won't be able to
in the future.

394
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,860
Hua Zhi.

395
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,220
Please, take a look.

396
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,660
Is anything missing?

397
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,940
With embarassment, I have

398
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,580
written this IOU.

399
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,420
Please keep it safe.

400
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,100
[IOU]

401
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,260
My friend,

402
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,500
you're going to embarrass me to death!

403
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,860
A debt is debt,

404
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,460
has nothing to do with our friendship.

405
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,260
Zhi.

406
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,460
We won't disturb you any longer.

407
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,620
Take good care of yourself.

408
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Please don't see me out.

409
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,300
Hua Zhi is here?

410
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:02,980
She came to break off the engagement.

411
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,780
Shen Qi!

412
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,660
Hua Zhi.

413
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,020
Mr. Shen?

414
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
I just wanted to tell you

415
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,340
a gentleman's word is his bond.

416
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,300
No matter what my grandmother,

417
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,420
Father,

418
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,860
or mother said,

419
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,300
I, Shen Qi, will keep the promise,

420
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,900
never to leave or forsake you.

421
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,180
Mr. Shen,

422
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,740
it's not like that.

423
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,540
It's my own decision
to break off the engagement.

424
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,620
No one is forcing me.

425
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,060
You don't want to marry me?

426
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:42,900
Shen Qi,

427
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,620
you are a truly good person.

428
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,940
No matter who in the future

429
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,180
ends up marrying you,

430
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,740
she'll be counted as lucky.

431
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,060
Thank you for your generous help,

432
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,700
and for buying my couplets.

433
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,140
Thank you for coming after me

434
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,260
to say those words to me.

435
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,380
All these,

436
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,860
I will remember for the rest of my life.

437
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,660
Hurry back now.

438
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,220
Miss Zhi,

439
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,980
then, from here on,

440
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,660
are we

441
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,900
still friends?

442
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,380
Of course.

443
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:17,860
I'm leaving now.

444
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,900
Let me do it.

445
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:26,700
I can handle it.

446
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,180
Boss,

447
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,700
no wonder the girl from Hua family

448
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,660
doesn't want the wedding wine anymore.

449
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,180
She broke off the engagement
with the Shen family today.

450
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,740
I kept watching her all the way.

451
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,660
Shen Qi

452
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,860
was limping along after her.

453
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,740
The two were inseparable.

454
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,700
I don't know what they said,

455
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,660
but they ended up crying.

456
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,020
She cried?

457
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,060
No, him.

458
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,780
A grown man

459
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,300
crying over a young lady.

460
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,180
That really is...

461
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,860
Boss,

462
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,580
since you have ordered that wine,

463
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,940
I believe it's important.

464
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,460
I think keeping it in the shop

465
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,860
Is inappropriate.

466
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,540
So I let them

467
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,420
bring it back.

468
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,100
Fudong's pastry gets tastier everyday.

469
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,700
I've been spoiled.

470
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,420
You try.

471
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:48,820
Delicious!

472
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,580
Hua Zhi,

473
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,660
you really gave me a scare today.

474
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,300
What on earth happened?

475
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,500
Where did all this money come from?

476
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,300
The wedding wine Uncle Pingyang
prepared for me，

477
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,940
I pawned it.

478
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,140
This is half the money.

479
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:08,820
You take it.

480
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,060
This is your dowry.

481
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,500
What use is it
when the marriage is called off?

482
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,140
This money,

483
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,340
I'll keep it for you for now.

484
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,020
Let me know when you need it.

485
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,340
Okay,

486
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,180
whatever you say.

487
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,740
Zhi,

488
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:28,940
is it worth it,

489
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,220
for this family?

490
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,460
Aunt Wu,

491
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,340
catually, I'm not that selfless.

492
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,940
I've just come to understand,

493
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,340
rather than hiding,

494
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,140
It's better to move forward.

495
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,140
I want to protect those I love,

496
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,780
and do what I want to do,

497
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,260
not just for you all,

498
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,740
nor for Grandfather.

499
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,380
It's for me.

500
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,620
Only by taking this step out,

501
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,260
can I walk further.

502
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,260
The farther I walk, the happier I feel.

503
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,620
Perhaps one day,

504
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,380
I will attain true freedom.

505
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,060
Without relying Grandfather,

506
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,700
I'll still be able to travel around,

507
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,700
to explore the world.

508
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,340
When that time comes,

509
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,660
you must write to me,

510
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,900
and tell me

511
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,100
what the mountains and oceans are like.

512
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:08,980
Alright.

513
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,300
Let's not talk about the far future.

514
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,980
Just tell me about your current tasks.

515
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,340
This wine money,

516
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,060
will be spent in less than half a year.

517
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,860
Livelihood,

518
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,420
where exactly is it based?

519
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:26,860
Right here.

520
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,140
No, no.

521
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,940
Why not?

522
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,420
Aunt Wu said it is delicious.

523
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,780
Bolin and Boli both said the same.

524
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,100
I just fumbled through it myself.

525
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,980
It's nothing presentable.

526
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,020
We don't need

527
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,860
to be that presentable right now.

528
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,180
Wait until there is a grand banquet
for us to serve,

529
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:44,860
then you can worry.

530
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,460
Since you said so,

531
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,620
I'll give it a try.

532
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,180
If it doesn't work...

533
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,740
It’ll be okay.

534
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,860
I have plenty of ways.

535
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,620
Yingchun, Baoxia,

536
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,180
pick hawthorn berries every morning,

537
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,420
pluck stems and select the best.

538
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,260
Yinzhu will be in charge of rinsing.

539
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,300
Chanlu, Miqiu,

540
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,460
remove the seeds,
also pick off the bad ones.

541
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,140
Zhegui is responsible for the firewood.

542
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,740
Fudong will do the cooking.

543
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,620
Finish your work before taking a rest.

544
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,420
The weather is still cool.

545
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,020
Washing fruits with cold water,

546
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,580
why don't you ask

547
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,900
your own maids to do it?

548
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,820
Fine,

549
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,900
Yingchun, Baoxia,

550
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,620
you two will be in charge of rinsing.

551
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,940
And you pick the red berries.

552
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,900
Starting from today,

553
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,820
anyone who does a good job
will be paid double,

554
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,060
and if you make mistakes,
your monthly pay will be halved.

555
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,420
Everyone, get to work!

556
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,020
Yes.

557
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,460
She's so young,

558
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,420
but so good at giving orders.

559
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,340
Let her be.

560
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,780
Think it as children playing house.

561
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,660
I'll get a few days of leisure myself.

562
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,460
Once she encounters difficulties,

563
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,580
she will realize

564
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
how hard it is to support a family.

565
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,420
Such a large amount of cash,

566
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,300
I wonder where she got it from.

567
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,780
I'll tell Baozhu to ask her later.

568
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:07,620
About this money,

569
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,780
If it comes from an improper source,

570
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,260
we could be in troubles.

571
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,940
I,

572
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,780
just have these endless worries.

573
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,460
Let's go.

574
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,580
and get

575
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,980
some more sleep.

576
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,940
Where is the hemostatic medicine?

577
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:34,860
Let's go,

578
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,580
I'll take you to find some.

579
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,460
It hurts so much!

580
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,260
When all these berries are rinsed,

581
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,540
my hands would be frozen off.

582
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,460
This is a smart way!

583
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,300
Stop, stop, stop!

584
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,940
Baoxia,

585
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,460
you're spoiling them!

586
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,420
The fire is too strong!

587
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,740
The honey is burnt!

588
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,700
My job used to be
preparing pens and ink for Boli.

589
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,780
I have never done this sort of work!

590
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,100
Forget it

591
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,620
just get some rest.

592
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,220
I'll make the fire myself.

593
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,780
That would be the best.

594
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,300
Thank you, Fudong.

595
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,780
Hua Zhi

596
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,980
has been wasting food
in every way possible.

597
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,500
It tastes as good as always.

598
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,060
What's good about it?

599
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,100
It's so sour!

600
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,220
No, no!

601
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,420
It's too sweet!

602
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,660
You'll get sick of it
when you have a bit more.

603
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,900
Why are you all idling around?

604
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:01,820
Where are the red berries?

605
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,820
Hua Zhi,

606
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,260
I just went for Yinzhu and Chanlu.

607
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,780
They said the work given by Madam Xia

608
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,860
hasn't been finished yet.

609
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,860
So they haven't come back yet.

610
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,500
There's no one picking the berries.

611
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,420
Then I'll deduct a day's wage
for everyone.

612
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,620
Yingchun,

613
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,140
from today onwards,

614
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,060
you no longer need to rinse berries.

615
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,100
You'll be the supervisor.

616
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,660
If anyone slacks off,

617
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,420
or makes any mistakes,

618
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,100
report it to me.

619
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:25,380
Baoxia,

620
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,700
come with me to pick berries.

621
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,740
Boss,

622
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,220
people from
the branches of the Hua family

623
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,540
have all been escorted out of the city.

624
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,540
According to what you said,

625
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,020
the person we're looking for
should be around 17 or 18 years old.

626
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,500
I've questioned

627
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,260
all the young ones among them.

628
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,500
None of them

629
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
has been
to Prince Ling's Mansion as a child.

630
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,020
If that scholar boy
is not among those exiled,

631
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,500
he must be one of the servants.

632
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,780
Now most of their servants
have been disbanded.

633
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,700
Trying to find him

634
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,380
is probably
like looking for a needle in the sea.

635
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,220
Huazhi has been back for two days.

636
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,900
I wonder if she has recovered.

637
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,060
What a coincidence!

638
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,860
Why are you here?

639
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,060
I remember you.

640
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,460
You're that soldier.

641
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,300
So I shouldn't be here, huh?

642
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,060
I can't listen, can I?

643
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,860
On the way back that day,

644
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,420
you seemed restless.

645
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,300
Did you encounter any trouble afterward?

646
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,060
Not at that time.

647
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,180
But now there's a lot of troubles.

648
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,340
Is that so?

649
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,580
Then, is there

650
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,540
anything I can help with?

651
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,380
Yes, there is.

652
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,780
I still have so many berries

653
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,260
to pick.

654
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,660
It seems you ultimately
couldn't get off the ship.

655
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,300
Did you think through?

656
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,780
Get off the bed?

657
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,660
All thanks to your good words.

658
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,180
I'm now temporarily in charge,

659
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,180
steering against the wind.

660
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,020
Right now it's just small matters.

661
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,660
In the future,
I must venture into danger.

662
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
He's not a soldier?

663
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,900
So, does he sell ships,

664
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,980
or beds?

665
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,460
Miss,

666
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,220
you're picking berries here?

667
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,780
Madam Lin.

668
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,660
Fudong has made some snacks.

669
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,620
Take them.

670
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,340
They're very soft.

671
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,940
You're offering us more tasty food?

672
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:40,940
This...

673
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,580
Just hurry home and have a good meal.

674
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,860
I'll bring you more in a few days.

675
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,140
Thank this lady.

676
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:48,900
Thank you.

677
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,540
Thank you.

678
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,380
Go home.

679
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,420
Thanks a lot.

680
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,740
Do you know them?

681
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,660
They're all struggling to make a living.

682
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,260
How can I not help them?

683
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,940
Her daughter and son-in-law
both died of illness.

684
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,500
Baoxia,

685
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,020
let's go.

686
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,820
How come you girls

687
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,700
are working out here?

688
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,820
Where are the male servants?

689
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,620
They all ran off.

690
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,260
The old and the young ones,

691
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,860
all of them?

692
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,220
What do you mean by asking that?

693
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,420
Are you coming to work for us?

694
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,660
I can't afford to pay you.

695
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:27,980
In that case,

696
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,980
when you can afford to pay me,

697
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,940
let me know.

698
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,180
I'll come over immediately.

699
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
It seems that your trip to the capital

700
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,620
didn't get you a suitable job.

701
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,180
You're right.

702
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,460
Working as a hatchet man,

703
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,140
I don't like that.

704
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,060
But don't worry,

705
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,460
I'll survive.

706
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,340
There's still a long way to go.

707
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,740
Things will eventually go your way.

708
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,420
Then I also wish you

709
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,540
a smooth sailing.

710
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,420
I'm leaving.

711
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,300
Let's go.

712
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,500
Hua Zhi,

713
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,540
Judging by that scar on his face,

714
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,860
I don't think he's a good man.

715
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,060
I disagree.

716
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,420
Yinzhu,

717
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:27,900
Madam Xia has

718
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,860
so much work for us to do.

719
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,500
Yet you have the time to do extra jobs.

720
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,140
I'll go right now.

721
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,420
Zhegui,

722
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,380
come here.

723
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,580
Madam Xia said

724
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,140
anyone who wants to help can come.

725
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,020
Okay.

726
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,100
Is there something special?

727
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,700
The ladies

728
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,220
always need to be taken care of.

729
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,020
Do I

730
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,300
have to tell you every detail?

731
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:55,820
Chanlu,

732
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,300
Your monthly wage

733
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,420
is paid by Hua Zhi.

734
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,020
Yingchun,

735
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,740
please don't make it hard for me.

736
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:02,980
My contract

737
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,220
was sighed with Madam Xia.

738
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:19,660
Fudong,

739
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,180
Madam Xia said

740
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,020
Madam Hua wants
japonica rice porridge for lunch.

741
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,780
She wants you to make it now.

742
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:24,700
Alright.

743
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,380
I'll make it now.

744
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,980
It's still early, no rush.

745
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,300
Hua Zhi,

746
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
I heard from Yinzhu

747
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,180
that Madam Xia complained about
there are too many maids here.

748
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,660
She's annoyed by all the noises.

749
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,500
She also said,

750
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,900
"those bitches

751
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,340
spend all day in the kitchen,

752
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,420
stealing our food".

753
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,020
She said she wants
to sell a few more of us.

754
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,660
Hua Zhi...

755
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,980
How very strange,

756
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,340
the girl in charge brings me the meal.

757
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,340
I have another favor to ask.

758
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,540
I sure need to be more attentive.

759
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,100
I anticipated as much.

760
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,060
Tell me about it.

761
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,420
Grandmother,

762
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,780
first, try this pickled vegetable.

763
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,740
It's light and refreshing.

764
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,620
Fudong picked these from the backyard,

765
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,940
and figured out
how to make them delicious.

766
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,620
Such a clever girl.

767
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,020
She's from your quarters, isn't she?

768
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,420
If you want to say something,

769
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,340
just say it.

770
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,340
Grandmother,

771
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,140
I want the maids' indenture contracts.

772
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:45,980
Otherwise, Fudong

773
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,140
will be sold by Madam Xia.

774
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,380
How can that be allowed?

775
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,820
Why?

776
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,700
I don't know.

777
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,220
Don't know...

778
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,060
Hua Zhi,

779
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,300
you called all of us here

780
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,620
for what?

781
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,060
Boli hasn't finished studying yet.

782
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,540
Wait until Madam Xia is here,

783
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,460
you'll know.

784
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,540
Hua Zhi,

785
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,740
we each manage our own businesses,

786
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:25,900
but you,

787
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,420
are reaching your hand into my pocket.

788
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,540
Madam Xia, don't worry.

789
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,420
No one can take advantage
of another today.

790
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,340
Hua Zhi,

791
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,900
for such important things,

792
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,020
it's better to let Aunt Xia keep them.

793
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,700
Mother, don't worry.

794
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,300
We don't need them anymore.

795
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,700
All of your indenture contracts
are here.

796
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,900
Since we lost everything,

797
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,740
all the maids, concubines,

798
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,180
we've been supporting each other.

799
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
We all witnessed that.

800
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,780
You've had a tough time these days.

801
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,660
I'm aware of it all.

802
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,620
Now, since I am in charge,

803
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,420
I won't be doing nothing anymore.

804
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,700
No matter it's Madam Hua,

805
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,700
or Madam Xia,

806
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,500
or me,

807
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,380
we can control your actions,

808
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,780
but not your feelings.

809
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,500
If deep down, you

810
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,260
hate this place

811
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,100
and don’t want to work,

812
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,060
we have no reason to keep you.

813
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,780
Hua Zhi, please,

814
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,620
don’t sell me!

815
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,380
I will never be lazy again.

816
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,500
Yes, please,

817
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,140
don’t sell us.

818
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,700
We will work harder!

819
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,060
Please don’t sell us

820
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,180
Don’t sell us!

821
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Don’t sell us, Hua Zhi!

822
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:26,980
When did I

823
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
say that I was going to sell you off?

824
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,740
I'm holding these contracts

825
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,940
because I want to set you free.

826
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,900
Really?

827
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,780
Zhi, you...

828
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,460
What are you even talking about?

829
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,380
In this world,

830
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,460
we're all equal.

831
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,700
No one is born to serve others.

832
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,820
They're just unlucky
to end up like this.

833
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,660
If they could gain their freedom,

834
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,260
who would wish to be a servant?

835
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,700
I will keep my words.

836
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,300
I...

837
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,020
I...

838
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,220
I have worked so hard

839
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,380
to discipline these girls.

840
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,300
Now, finally,

841
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,260
they're not running away.

842
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,700
You...

843
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,100
With just a few words,

844
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
you've given all that away!

845
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,180
Madam Xia, then from now on,

846
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,140
you don't need to work that hard.

847
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,300
But

848
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,180
if you release the maids,

849
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,540
who'll comb my hair,

850
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,580
and who will dress me?

851
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,380
Hua Ling, you have so much skills.

852
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,260
You can draw,

853
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,220
and you can embroider.

854
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,420
Are such simple tasks

855
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,260
like getting dressed and doing hair,

856
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,020

Even if not as a maid,

947
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,940
you'll still have a good future.

948
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,900
But, what else can I do?

949
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:51,700
Get married.

950
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,580
You're pretty.

951
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,020
You can marry a farmer, or a fisherman.

952
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,140
You'll never get starved.

953
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:58,980
If you can marry a merchant,

954
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:00,900
perhaps in the future,

955
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,940
you'll get rich.

956
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,820
Yingchun,

957
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,540
I'll take my leave.

958
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,820
You should hurry up and get ready too.

959
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,620
Take care.

960
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,980
Is a bright future

961
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,700
just marrying a good man?

962
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,620
Yingchun.

963
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,700
Hua Zhi,

964
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,580
I've been wanting to ask,

965
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,860
these days,

966
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,940
we keep rinsing and frying berries

967
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,340
for what exactly?

968
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,420
I was gonna tell you later.

969
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,900
Baoxia and the girls
don't know about this yet.

970
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:53,540
When Fudong

971
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,100
finalized the recipe for fried-berry,

972
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,460
we'll start to sell them in the city.

973
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:58,940
Hawthorn berry,

974
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,220
everyone in the city knows what it is.

975
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,300
But no one eats them.

976
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,500
How could anyone

977
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,540
be willing to pay for them?

978
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,540
Just make it delicious.

979
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,100
They'll be paying.

980
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:08,940
Hua Zhi,

981
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,900
waht about the next?

982
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,220
A tower begins with a heap of bricks.

983
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,740
We start from selling berries,

984
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,140
then expand the business step by step.

985
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,060
So,

986
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,940
from now on,

987
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,140
the whole family
will be running a business together?

988
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,020
If poor people want to get rich,

989
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,020
working is a better idea than farming,

990
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,140
and business is better than working.

991
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,220
If we want to save Grandfather,

992
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,180
this is the only way.

993
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,500
Running a business
is just like fighting a war.

994
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,660
In the past, you all

995
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,820
worked only in the house.

996
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,820
But from now on, you must become
leaders who command troops,

997
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,700
to win battles.

998
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,180
Together, let's carve out a path

999
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,060
in the imperial capital.

1000
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,140
Alright,

1001
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,460
I'll do this with you.

1002
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,860
And me!

1003
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:53,820
Here.

1004
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,380
Baozhu,

1005
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,100
Baozhu, my clothe is torn.

1006
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,340
Madam, just leave it there.

1007
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,340
I'll get the needle and thread
as soon as these berries are ready.

1008
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,220
Yinzhu, come and help.

1009
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,180
Coming!

1010
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,980
Come on, come on,

1011
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,220
try these.

1012
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,500
What do you think?

1013
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:27,540
Is it good?

1014
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,540
Really delicious!

1015
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,340
So good!

1016
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:29,940
Delicious.

1017
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,140
This is delicious, Madam!

1018
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,340
Little girl,

1019
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,420
smart move.

1020
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,620
Stealing all my maids.

1021
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,060
Madam Xia?

1022
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,220
At night,

1023
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,940
I always hear you coughing.

1024
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,100
Ms. Su has poor hearing.

1025
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,780
I'll sleep here for the next few days

1026
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,180
to look after you.
