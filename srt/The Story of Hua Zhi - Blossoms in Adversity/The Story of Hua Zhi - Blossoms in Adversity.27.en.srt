Mister.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,870
How about I give you my daughter,

29
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,950
and you give me that camel?

30
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,950
Can we exchange?

We can't afford to pay for it.

58
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,590
I do know that everything requires

59
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,630
dedication.

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,710
You are now distressed and agitated.

61
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,710
You won't be of much help there.

62
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,430
I will think of another way

63
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,470

That's fine.

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,310
I've been so incredibly busy
in the past few days

71
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,240
that I hardly had time to think of you.

72
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,190
Physician Zhang.

73
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,240
It is poisonous
to mix stiff silkworm and poria.

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,680
As an imperial physician,

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,680
you didn't even know about it.

76
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,920
And not a single word was written
in the medical record

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,830
about the medicine
used in His Majesty's pillow.

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,310
Yet you kept it a secret.

79
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,800
What are your intentions?

80
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,040
This medicinal pillow wasn't prepared
by the Imperial Medical Bureau,

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,160
and His Majesty has never ordered us

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,160
to prescribe stiff silkworm powder.

83
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,920
There's only one liang
of the stiff silkworm powder

84
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,000
in this medicine bag,

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,950
and it isn't an oral medication

86
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,630
but rather dispersed by its scent,

87
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,830
so its effects
will be way less powerful.

88
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,630
And there are only four qian of poria

89
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,950
in the decoction.

90
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,800
Even if the two are incompatible,

91
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,270
the toxicity they generated

92
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,480
would only cause His Majesty
to sleep more deeply,

93
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,480
but would never put him in a coma.

94
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,120
His Majesty is in a coma.

95
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,240
Don't you have something to say?

96
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,600
This medicinal pillow
was indeed made by Changqing.

97
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,640
Your Highness,
there's one thing you weren't aware of.

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
His Majesty can't sleep at all

99
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,810
without the poria

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,240
and the stiff silkworm powder.

101
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,830
I was afraid
someone might take advantage of this,

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,750
so I only asked Changqing

103
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,830
to buy and make the medicinal powder.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,390
There's not a third person
knowing about this.

105
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,270
How long has His Majesty been
having trouble sleeping?

106
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,480
His Majesty has been plagued
with frequent nightmares

107
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,240
for ten years.

108
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,800
Since Lord Ling passed away,

109
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,390
his headache has been unbearable
all night long

110
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,480
and it was even harder for him to sleep.

111
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,000
Uncle has never told me that.

112
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,390
Physician Zhang.

113
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,120
According to you,

114
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,830
since the toxicity
of these two medicines is minor,

115
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,310
what is the reason that put His Majesty

116
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,240
in a coma?

117
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,480
Some unknown poison
might have interacted

118
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,680
with these two substances

119
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,310
and led to this result.

120
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,510
Is there an antidote?

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,870
We don't even know what the poison is.

122
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,800
If we rashly prepare an antidote

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,390
and get the opposite
of the desired result,

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,830
I'm afraid

125
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,040
His Majesty can't take it anymore.

126
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,120
Are you sure?

127
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,630
You saw your daughter?

128
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,830
I saw her clearly.

129
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,360
I raised that kid.

130
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,680
I could never mistake it.

131
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,040
Wonderful.

132
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,950
No matter how capable she is,

133
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,830
she's your daughter,

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,390
and you are her father.

135
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,070
A daughter should always
be obedient to her father.

136
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,800
The cooking competition

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
is already in the bag.

138
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,270
Exactly.

139
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
Everything about cooking that Xigu knew

140
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,390
was taught by me.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,920
I have asked around.

142
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,310
She's been serving as a maid

143
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,750
in the Hua Family for so many years.

144
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,040
What can she do?

145
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,390
Alright.

146
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,680
Tell you what?

147
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,240
You need to present yourself

148
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,510
as her father.

149
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,240
I'm all ears.

150
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,870
I've heard

151
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,190
your daughter's great skills
at making pastry

152
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,070
were the reason why this year

153
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,000
the Hua Family turned things around.

154
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,070
You are her father.

155
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,720
It's good if you can convince her

156
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,310
to work with you.

157
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,310
It will be even better

158
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,270
if she can give us

159
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,000
the pastry recipes of the Hua Family.

160
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,070
Exactly.

161
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,070
Come on, drink it all.

163
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,040
Shaoyao.

164
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,680
Shaoyao.

165
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
Why don't you come in
through the front gate?

166
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,870
Mr. Zhong knows who you are.

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,560
That's the exact reason

168
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
why I...

169
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,310
Never mind.

170
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,750
Let's go play elephant chess.

171
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:04,750
I can't.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,480
What's wrong?

173
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,240
I'm worried sick.

174
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,040
Zhi is having a competition.

175
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,800
I really want to help her,

176
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,310
but...

177
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,600
I don't know how to cook.

178
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,430
I'm of no help at all.

179
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,600
What competition?

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A cooking competition.

181
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,310
Duo told me

182
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,270
that if we won,

183
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,240
we could have lots of delicious food

184
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,800
every single day.

185
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,560
If...

186
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,240
If we lost,

187
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,870
our whole family
would have to beg for food.

188

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,790
I hope you all will join me

379
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,080
in uniting our efforts
to surpass the Bai's.

380
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,910
Are you going to make

381
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,200
fish slice,

382
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,440
chicken in black bean sauce,

383
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,910
spicy pig kidneys,

384
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,270
and eight mixed vegetables?

385
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,630
She knows so much?

386
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,390
No.

387
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,790
Remove all these.

388
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,000
What do you mean?

389
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,200
Everyone has worked hard all day

390
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,320
and all the ingredients are ready.

391
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,240
Now you want to throw them all away?

392
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,960
What airs are you putting on?

393
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
It takes at most two hours

394
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,840
to handle these ingredients

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
with your skills.

396
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,630
If it took you over half the day today,

397
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,670
I knew

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,550
why they said the Hua Family
served food so slowly.

399
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,550
Don't waste your time

400
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,150
on making these dishes.

401
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,840
These dishes

402
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,840
are our specialty dishes.

403
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,120
What can we make except for these?

404
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,600
Do you want to serve the customers

405
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,200
with your sweet hawthorn fruits?

406
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,720
I know

407
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,440
all of you have been head chefs
for many years

408
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,480
in prestigious families.

409
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,840
I also know

410
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,960
these are all your specialty dishes.

411
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,150
You are willing to make the dishes

412
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,510
that you are most proud of.

413
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
I express my thanks to you here
on behalf of Lady Zhi.

414
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,080
However,

415
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:47,550
why did you

416
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,000
all come out
from those prestigious families

417
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,360
and accept our Hua Family's offer?

418
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,390
All of you are quite experienced cooks.

419
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,360
In knife skills,

420
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,840
heat controlling and seasoning,

421
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,150
you're all top-notch.

422
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,510
It's just a pity

423
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,550
that you keep

424
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,670
making your so-called specialty dishes.

425
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,030
You are satisfied
with the present situation

426
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,270
without changing a thing for ten years.

427
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,270
Even with the most skilled dishes,

428
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,110
people will get tired of them one day.

429
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,110
I have seen it.

430
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,400
What the Bai's will make today

431
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
are five-flavor almond jelly goose,

432
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,310
preserved vegetables,

433
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,480
spicy stewed game,

434
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,550
and stir-fry venison.

435
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,640
Almond jelly goose

436
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,590
is a signature dish

437
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,350
from Yunlai Restaurant.

438
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,030
But now the diners
in the Imperial Capital

439
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,200
advocate health-preserving
medicinal cuisine,

440
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,590
so now they add

441
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,310
schisandra chinensi

442
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,830
that can nourish
and strengthen the body.

443
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,200
Vinegared siskins
have been popular for a while,

444
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,270
but now there are many vegetarians
in the Imperial Capital.

445
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,030
So the Bai's

446
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,880
combine the preserved lotus root

447
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,590
with the preserved bamboo shoot

448
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,830
into a vegetarian dish.

449
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,200
Spicy stewed game and stir-fry venison

450
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,720
each originated
from the signature dishes

451
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,240
of Banshan Restaurant
and Fengxiang Restaurant.

452
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,880
But the Bai's surpasses them
on these two dishes.

453
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,000
It has infuriated
those two restaurant owners,

454
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,550
but they can't do anything about it.

455
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,510
Therefore,

456
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,550
starting today,

457
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,680
I will invalidate the menu

458
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,160
and finalize the new dishes.

459
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,590
What do you mean by that?

460
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,160
Don't get ahead of yourself.

461
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,000
These men here

462
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,510
have all been cooks

463
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,480
for half their lives.

464
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,720
Does any of you

465
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,720
want to listen

466
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,590
to this kid here?

467
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:02,550
Niu.

468
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,750
I won't listen to her.

469
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,550
What about you?

470
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,440
Speak up! Say it.

471
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,350
Fine, you don't want to answer, huh?

472
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
I don't accept this!

473
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,110
I'm telling you,

474
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,200
I've been in the business
for so many years,

475
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,270
and I've never seen a head chef

476
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,680
who could cut their fingers

477
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,920
while chopping vegetables.

478
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,720
Look at your delicate

479
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,550
and slender fingers.

480
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,830
When you can hold a knife steadily,

481
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,070
then come and challenge me again!

482
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,640
She is quite a professional.

483
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,000
Today,

484
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
let me make this clear.

485
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,200
Since the Young Lady
has entrusted the kitchen to me,

486
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,880
then I have the final say in everything.

487
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,070
If any of you disagree,
leave my kitchen.

488
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,070
And you are free to go with your salary.

489
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,110
Young Lady gave me the right.

490
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,270
I can manage it

491
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,000
no matter whether you are here or not.

492
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:32,720
Fudong.

493
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,200
No, Ms. Fudong.

494
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,110
What do you need us to do?

495
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,830
Please do tell.

496
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,240
The weather is cool today.

497
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,880
The residents here favor strong flavors.

498
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,400
We can replace fish slice

499
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,590
with spicy ginger fish soup.

500
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Replace chicken in black bean sauce
with quail soup.

501
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,310
And serve them all in clay pots.

502
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,640
Let's make

503
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,720
the tender roasted venison

504
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,000
and fragrant pan-fried tofu.

505
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,440
Do you mean
that kind of fragrant pan-fried tofu

506
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,680
from Shuixing Restaurant?

507
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,400
No.

508
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,240
We will add one more seasoning.

509
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,240
First, pan-fry the tofu
with scallion oil.

510
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,070
Then take 20 Chinese torreya seeds,
toast them till burnt

511
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,240
and grind them into powder.

512
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,510
After adding the sauce,

513
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,680
cook it together with the tofu.

514
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,270
I have prepared
the Chinese torreya seeds.

515
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,750
You can make the scallion oil first.

516
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,830
Yes, Ms. Fudong.

517
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:16,830
Qian,

518
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,440
I know that you are not just good

519
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,000
at fish slice.

520
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,830
The spicy ginger fish soup you make
is also exceptional.

521
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,960
It's just that
the duke couldn't eat spicy food,

522
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,640
so you haven't had the chance
to make it for many years.

523
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,550
Today,

524
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,720
may I have the honor

525
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,030
to witness your culinary skills?

526
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,240
Bring me the fish.

527
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,000
What are you waiting for?

528
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,110
Go.

529
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,550
Get the fish, come on.

530
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,110
Yes.

531
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,240
Get to work, go.

532
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,440
I was quite impressed

533
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,550
seeing you
making quite a speech in there.

534
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,790
The way you carried yourself

535
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,510
was even better
than the head chef of Bai's.

536
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,640
Young Lady, you are making fun of me.

537
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,310
I was just putting on an act.

538
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,640
You had no idea.

539
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
When that cleaver came down just now,

540
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,720
my heart skipped a beat.

541
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,920
Spicy ginger fish soup.

542
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:13,830
Alright!

543
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,920
I'll have one order
of spicy ginger fish soup, please.

544
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,550
Make it two.

545
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,030
Alright!

546
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,240
Pay attention to the cooking heat!

547
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,240
One order of fragrant pan-fried tofu.

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Where are the reports
from the past few days?

565
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,110
Let me look them over.

566
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,030
I've organized them all

567
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,880
and placed them on your desk.

568
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,750
However,

569
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
there's nothing related

570
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,510
to that matter at the Palace.

571
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:22,750
Fudong.

572
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,680
have some tea.

573
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,550
Young Lady,

574
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:26,590
you don't have to.

575
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,790
Come on, you need it.

576
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,830
You spend all day in the manor,

577
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,830
how do you know so much

578
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,160
about the restaurants
in the Imperial Capital?

579
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,200
I was quite amazed

580
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,240
hearing you saying all that.

581
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,400
Young Lady.

582
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,550
To be honest,

583
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,240
ever since you taught me
how to make haws,

584
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,830
and entrusted the kitchen to me,

585
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,200
I came to realize

586
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,000
going forward,

587
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,790
I might not have to be a maid
all my life.

588
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,030
These culinary skills

589
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,070
that I learned when I was little

590
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,590
would one day come in handy.

591
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,640
So

592
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,680
whenever I had the chance

593
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,550
to go out

594
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,510
or there were banquets at the mansion,

595
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,440
I would observe, memorize, and ask about
everything that I considered important.

596
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,830
Especially

597
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,270
after what happened to our family
last year,

598
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,960
I realized even more

599
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,920
that being a cook
might not earn much respect,

600
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,200
but it truly is something

601
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,960
that can be of use everywhere.

602
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,480
You're right.

603
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,270
People always need to eat

604
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,310
no matter what happens.

605
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,720
With a skill,

606
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,000
you can make a living wherever you go.

607
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,000
It would be wasteful

608
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,400
to just throw it away.

609
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,720
This is...

610
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,750
Smells so good.

611
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,030
Steamed buns.

612
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,240
I want one.

613
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,510
Mother, I want one.

614
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,880
Don't fight,
there's enough for everyone.

615
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:49,790
Thank you, miss.

616
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,590
There is meat too.

617
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,110
Slow down, no need to rush.

618
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,920
Thank you.

619
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:54,960
Slow down.

620
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,640
Thank you.

621
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:57,590
I want one.

622
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,240
I want one too.

623
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

624
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,830
Eat up.

625
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,750
Yes, eat up.

626
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,350
Thank you.

627
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,720
I want one more.

628
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,160
Don't eat too fast.

629
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:06,680
Give me one.

630
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,480
I'm starving.

631
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,000
Mother, try this.

632
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,920
Take a few more buns.

633
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,510
It's enough for everyone.

634
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,200
So delicious.

635
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,310
Eat up.

636
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,480
Are you hungry?

637
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,310
I've put the food here.

638
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,720
If you want to eat, help yourself.

639
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,550
If you ever get hungry,

640
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,270
just come here.

641
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,920
We will often bring food here.

642
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,200
Young Lady.

643
00:24:59,400 --> 00:24:59,920
What's the matter?

644
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,830
That child is timid.

645
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,510
I'm afraid he can't beat the others
even if he tries.

646
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,200
He probably often goes hungry.

647
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,030
Don't worry.

648
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,310
I'll come by often from now on.

649
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:12,830
Let's go.

650
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:32,790
What would you like?

651
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,400
I'd like one of these.

652
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,240
What is

653
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,720
your signature dish?

654
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,960
I want this one.

655
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,510
Another portion of fish soup, please.

656
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,510
I want your signature dish.

657
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
This one looks good, I'll take this.

658
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,030
Yes, these dishes.

659
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,030
Serve them quickly.

660
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,920
This is delicious.

661
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,480
Coming up.

662
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,200
It'll be ready in no time.

663
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,920
The Hua Family's cook

664
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,000
really has a thing or two.

665
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
How come none of the cooks I hired

666
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,680
know how to put in thought

667
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,400
like this?

668
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,960
Go prepare a valuable gift.

669
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,030
Yes.

670
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,270
[Tangxi Restaurant]

671
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:43,550
I have long admired your reputation,

672
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,070
and I have come especially
to visit you today.

673
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,720
You're looking for me?

674
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,070
You must be

675
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,880
the head chef of the Hua Family.

676
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,070
May I ask your name?

677
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,480
Ms. Fudong,

678
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,070
he...

679
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,200
You can leave.

680
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,240
I'll take care of the rest.

681
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Alrighty.

682
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,960
You heard the head chef.

683
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,000
Let's call it a day.

684
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,440
She's our head chef.

685
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,510
Why didn’t you say so earlier?

686
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,880
I... You...

687
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,830
Ms. Fudong.

688
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:16,480
We're leaving, Ms. Fudong.

689
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,240
Why aren't you leaving yet?

690
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,550
May I ask your name, miss?

691
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,400
Why?

692
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,200
Well...

693
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:40,310
That basket looks quite heavy.

694
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,480
Let me help you carry it.

695
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,400
No need.

696
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,880
I didn't know you were the head chef.

697
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,160
Please forgive me.

698
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,590
I am a cook

699
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,640
and just a cook.

700
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,830
You don't have to be so polite.

701
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,110
And don't follow me.

702
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,750
Then I'll speak frankly.

703
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,920
I'd like to ask you, miss,

704
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,070
if I offer three times
the monthly allowance,

705
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,550
and give you another house as a gift.

706
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,240
Miss,

707
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,480
would you be willing to join the Bai's?

708
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,960
You

709
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,400
are Bai Mingxia?

710
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:07,880
It is me indeed.

711
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,640
My Lady is competing
with you in the arena.

712
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,960
and now
you are poaching me from my Lady,

713
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
you truly aren't a good person.

714
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,510
Miss, you misunderstand.

715
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,960
I am a businessman indeed,

716
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,030
I would never undermine others

717
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,160
right before the battle.

718
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,920
I intend to invite you to join the Bai's

719
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,110
after the competition is over.

720
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,550
Without my Lady,

721
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,880
I would still be miserable

722
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,510
and perhaps begging for food somewhere,

723
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:26,750
instead of standing here,

724
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,310
and looking at you.

725
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,310
Please leave.

726
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,750
I will not leave the Hua Family.

727
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,030
Don’t be so hasty to turn me down.

728
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,750
Miss.

729
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,160
Miss.

730
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,030
Miss.

731
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,350
- Thank you.
- Please give me another one.

732
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,240
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

733
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,110
- Thank you, miss.
- Go ahead.

734
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,960
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

735
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,680
That's so nice of you.

736
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,200
We've got something to eat.

737
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,550
I'll help you.

738
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,110
These are the raw ingredients

739
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,680
that are left over today, right?

740
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,270
And you cooked for them.

741
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,960
They are people too.

742
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,550
They want to have something hot to eat

743
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,160
to warm their bellies in cold nights.

744
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,750
You come from a wealthy family,

745
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,350
you don't know

746
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,480
this bit of food

747
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,030
can save a person's life.

748
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,160
Thank you.

749
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,510
I also begged on the streets
when I was young

750
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,440
and almost starved to death.

751
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,270
But unfortunately,

752
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,720
I had no luck

753
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,720
to meet a good person like you, miss.

754
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,160
That's why

755
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,240
you opened a restaurant?

756
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,270
Yes.

757
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,440
I was always hungry as a child,

758
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,830
it's hard to let go
even after growing up.

759
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,790
So here I am,

760
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,590
doing a business
to serve food and fill people's bellies.

761
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,550
Mother, I want more.

762
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,030
I had enough.

763
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,000
You can eat mine.

764
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,880
Alright then.

765
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,240
Give me two more buns.

766
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,030
You're hungry, aren't you?

767
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:01,720
Thank you.

768
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,310
Thank you.

769
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,590
Give me another one.

770
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:07,830
Come, this way.

771
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,750
Don't be afraid.

772
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,160
Hurry.

773
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:37,240
Move aside.

774
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,830
My kid!

775
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,350
Move aside.

776
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:39,790
My kid!

777
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:42,880
Get off.

778
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,920
My child!

779
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,510
My child!

780
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:47,720
Get out of my way.

781
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,270
Get up.

782
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:53,720
Go.

783
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,590
Go.

784
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,590
Why are they grabbing the children?

785
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,160
I don't know.

786
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,720
Move aside.

787
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,270
Get out of my way.

788
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,160
Get out of here.

789
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,270
Take him away.

790
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,160
What are you doing?

791
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,550
Look over there.

792
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,310
Who...

793
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,830
Who were those people?

794
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,920
Desperadoes.

795
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,590
In this Imperial Capital,

796
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,790
many nobles
keep retainers for dirty work,

797
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,550
hire assassins

798
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,480
and even train soldiers in private.

799
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,720
Maybe we were just unlucky tonight

800
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,480
to stumble upon them.

801
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,160
No, I must go back.

802
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,310
I'll walk with you.

803
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:38,680
Alright.

804
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,110
I have no idea

805
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,200
where those little beggars were taken.

806
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,110
This is unusual.

807
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,240
We must report to the government office.

808
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:51,240
Fudong.

809
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,830
If I need you to stand as a witness,

810
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,590
will you do that?

811
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,480
Go report the case, Young Lady.

812
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,270
I will do it.

813
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,920
But I'm afraid

814
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,830
the government office
might not be aware of this,

815
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,000
and even if they are aware,
they won't do anything about it.

816
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,880
There is a better place

817
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
to ask for help.

818
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:04,510
Where?

819
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,750
The Security Bureau.

820
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,200
But what did those men in black

821
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,680
abduct those little beggars for?

822
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,670
[Secret Report]

823
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,550
Get in

824
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,750
or get lost.

825
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,750
I'm afraid I will disturb you.

826
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,000
I forgot to tell you something.

827
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,270
Lady Zhi had someone

828
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,720
send some new beverages yesterday.

829
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,790
This is yours.

830
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,160
I didn't dare to send it
to the Palace to you.

831
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,830
Lady Zhi has been very busy lately.

832
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,510
She joined a cooking arena

833
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,350
and has been up to her neck these days.

834
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,200
But she's still thinking of you, sir.

835
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,440
Right.

836
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,510
When in the Palace,

837
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,160
you don't even
have time to catch your breath.

838
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,110
Of course, she would worry about you.

839
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:56,790
Sir.

840
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,640
Could you try some?

841
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,030
So I can tell the maid
that you have drunk this

842
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,680
and reassure Lady Zhi.

843
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,440
This is the new beverage
that the Hua's has come up with

844
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,200
for the competition.

845
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,350
It's quite interesting.

846
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,000
It even fizzes.

847
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:11,720
Where are the bubbles?

848
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:13,640
There were still some yesterday.

849
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,640
Don't know why there's none today.

850
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,590
I'm afraid she might lose

851
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,000
using this to compete.

852
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,240
I'm returning to the Palace.

853
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,790
You take care of the affairs here.

854
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,440
Okay.

855
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,110
Sir.

856
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,000
I didn't know there was a note in there.

857
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,270
This was from Lady Zhi,

858
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,440
[Someone's abducting children.]
so I didn't dare to open it.

859
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,270
I'll go find her.

860
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,550
Have you finished all your business?

861
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,720
I don't have anything urgent here.

862
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,750
You don't need to worry.

863
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,480
Go take care of your matters first.

864
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,550
I wrote you a note

865
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,670
because I thought the Security Bureau

866
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,360
could be of help.

867
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,110
Let's talk somewhere else.

868
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,150
You said someone was abducting children.

869
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,190
What's going on?

870
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:22,760
Fudong saw many men in black

871
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,510
abducting little beggars
in the Grass Lane

872
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,480
and they were only abducting boys.

873
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,840
These little beggars

874
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,000
just disappeared like that

875
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,510
and were nowhere to be found.

876
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:31,670
But they are

877
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,670
living human beings.

878
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,230
I've said everything I needed to.

879
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,760
You go ahead with your tasks first.

I'm sorry, Hua Zhi.

885
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,360
I have to go.

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,150
tell me what it is all about, okay?

892
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,280
I will come back.

893
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:19,840
Then I'll wait for you.

894
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,440
Sir.

895
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,510
I've checked.

896
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:38,710
There are still beggars missing today,

897
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,960
they are all around
the age of eight or nine.

898
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,760
I thought

899
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,190
this was the least relevant clue,

900
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,960
but it turned out to actually be a clue.

901
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,150
What clue?

902
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,030
Are you a fool?

903
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,880
It means
that the Sixth Prince is still alive.

904
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,880
No matter who the other party is,

905
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:52,840
they probably haven't found him yet.

906
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,440
The Sixth Prince?

907
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,150
What do they want him?

908
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,670
I'm afraid

909
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,590
only the Sixth Prince himself knows.

910
00:35:59,230 --> 00:35:59,840
But sir,

911
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,670
they've abducted the little beggars,

912
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,590
and haven't found the Sixth Prince.

913
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,030
We're out in the open.

914
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:04,960
It's like
looking for a needle in a haystack

915
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,030
trying to find the Sixth Prince.

916
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,360
It's such a hassle,

917
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
we can give up.

918
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:12,800
No, no.

919
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,400
Tomorrow,

920
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,510
you all go out to search the streets.

921
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,070
The louder, the better.

922
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,360
Search!

923
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,880
Some of you, go over there,

924
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,190
Make sure to search thoroughly.

925
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,280
Go that way.

926
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,000
Take a look inside.

927
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,480
Need help over here.

928
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,590
Officers.

929
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,360
Your Highness.

930
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,670
Recently,

931
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,880
every Security Bureau Guard

932
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,760
has gone out there

933
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,400
to look for the Sixth Prince.

934
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,110
If they do find him...

935
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,550
You have dispatched the troops
in the capital

936
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,320
to search for him for so long,

937
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,190
yet haven't caught a glimpse of Six,

938
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,440
I'm afraid

939
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,440
they won't find him easily.

940
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,360
Your Highness,

941
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,960
we can't underestimate them,

942
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,920
you can't be too careful.

943
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,440
As long as they don't find Six,

944
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,280
We can sit tight.

945
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,550
But now,

946
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,760
the Security Bureau
has put forth effort,

947
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,510
I can't be a sitting duck.

948
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,230
I will spare no effort

949
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,230
to find the whereabouts
of the Sixth Prince.

950
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,440
before the Security Bureau does.

951
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:26,840
But what if luck's on their side

952
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,920
and they find him

953
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,800
before us?

954
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,630
Then I will surely

955
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,230
silence the Sixth Prince

956
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,400
before he speaks.

957
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,710
Don't worry.

958
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,670
In another two days,

959
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,590
it would be too late to change anything

960
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,110
no matter what.

961
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,630
Get it done.

962
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,920
I will.

963
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,670
I wonder how those little beggars

964
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,400
are doing now.

965
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,150
Young Lady.

966
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,400
It's the same voice from that night.

967
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,630
Let's go.

968
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,280
Alright.

969
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:25,960
What is it?

970
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,030
What's that?

971
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,880
It's a signal fire, let's move.

972
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,360
Alright.

973
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,000
It's you!

974
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,920
Since you've been in my carriage,

975
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,510
don't think about leaving.

976
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,550
Get in.

977
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,590
Young Lady.

978
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,710
I'm afraid

979
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,400
he is still in shock.

980
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,070
Don't be scared.

981
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,000
Once you're on the carriage,

982
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,280
no one can catch you.

983
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,280
There have been bad people around lately

984
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,400
abducting kids like you.

985
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,760
You can come home with us first,

986
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,000
and you can go back

987
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:46,590
when things calm down outside,

988
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:47,280
What do you think?

989
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,630
Come home?

990
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,480
Come on.

991
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:57,800
Baoxia.

992
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,920
You're back.

993
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,550
Who is this kid?

994
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,920
A little beggar out on the street.

995
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,800
He snuck into our carriage,

996
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,670
so we brought him back.

997
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,590
This is called kidnapping, Young Lady.

998
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,480
I will catch you.

999
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,400
Get out of here.

1000
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,190
He...

1001
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,920
Look at him.

1002
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:27,960
Baoxia.

1003
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,150
Go find Shaoyao.

1004
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:29,800
Let her have a look at his injury.

1005
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
A living child.

1006
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,840
My name is Shaoyao.

1007
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,070
What's your name?

1008
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,630
Are you a puppy?

1009
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,590
Why do you bite me?

1010
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,440
And show your teeth.

1011
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,880
Is your name Huang?

1012
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,190
But it was Zhi

1013
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:00,920
who brought you back.

1014
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,280
Let's call you Jian.
[*"Jian" means bringing home a waif]

1015
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,110
You look even younger than Bolin.

1016
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,630
Children are not supposed to bite.

1017
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,280
Do you know that?

1018
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,630
Come out quickly.

1019
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,190
I need to...

1020
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,000
I can't catch him.

1021
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,840
I'll count to three.

1022
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,550
If you don't come out,

1023
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,320
then no food for you.

1024
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,360
One.

1025
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:19,630
Two.

1026
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,590
He's really like a puppy,

1027
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,800
longing for food.

1028
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,710
Good boy, Jian.

1029
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,230
Alright, stop teasing him.

1030
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,030
He might bite you again.

1031
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,000
Take a look at his injury.

1032
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,840
Don't hide...

1033
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,360
The big sister here is a physician.

1034
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,550
Stretch out your hand and let her see.

1035
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,230
It won't hurt.

1036
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:39,840
After she's done looking,

1037
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,710
I'll get you some food.

1038
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,150
These...

1039
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
These are all abrasions.

1040
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,920
He also got a foot sprain.

1041
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,670
Have you

1042
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,480
fallen off a carriage

1043
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,510
and rolled a few times on the ground?

1044
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,550
Are these finger marks?

1045
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,510
Did someone try to strangle you?

1046
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,480
Keep this a secret.

1047
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,960
If the Madams ask,

1048
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,360
just tell them he's a manservant
that I've bought recently.

1049
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,400
Tell them to keep this
within the family.

1050
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,070
Okay.

1051
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,440
Then where does he sleep?

1052
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,480
He is timid.

1053
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,480
Let him stay in my room for now.

1054
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,920
I'll squeeze in with Shaoyao tonight.

1055
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,510
Baoxia,

1056
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,670
go get him something to eat.

1057
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,360
Make sure it's hot.

1058
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:23,800
I'll go as well.

1059
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,070
Don't eat the leftovers,

1060
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,630
I'll make him
a fresh bowl of hot noodle soup.

1061
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:28,670
Shaoyao.

1062
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,230
Check what medicine we have at home.

1063
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,590
Use what's in hand to treat him first.

1064
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,150
Don't worry.

1065
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,960
Just some minor injuries.

1066
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,960
I've cured that mangy little yellow dog
in the courtyard

1067
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,150
when it was in worse shape than you.

1068
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,280
It's okay.

1069
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,710
This is so dirty.

1070
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,550
Where did you steal this from?

1071
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,440
Tell you what?

1072
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,550
Since you are here,

1073
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,590
you're not allowed to steal anymore.

1074
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,320
If you do that again,

1075
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,000
I will break your legs.

1076
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,230
Are you a little mad dog?

1077
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,110
You want to bite me?

1078
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,710
If you don't behave, I will...

1079
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:10,630
I will stew you

1080
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,400
and eat you.

1081
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,070
I'll add something

1082
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:13,960
to make you taste even better.

1083
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,920
I'm just kidding.

1084
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,190
These are all good for
promoting blood circulation

1085
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,230
and relieving the pain!
