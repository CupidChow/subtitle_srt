00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,250
Young Lady.

193
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,050
I want to stay.

194
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,570
Aren’t you afraid?

195
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:46,490
Please.

196
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,770
Please don’t send me away,

197
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,050
Please?

198
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,970
I'm homeless.

199
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,490
Get up first.

200
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,690
You did nothing wrong.

201
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,810
Why would we send you away?

202
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,450
But none of my former employers

203
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,690
would have believed in what I said.

204
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,970
If they found out about this,

205
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,410
I'd rather die.

206
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,290
Okay, stop crying.

207
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,890
No one will speak ill of you.

208
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:15,730
That’s right.

209
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,690
What are you doing here?

210
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:22,730
Girl.

211
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,410
Don’t be scared.

212
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,210
You can just think of it

213
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,610
as stepping into dog poo.

214
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,530
I saw they two

215
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,290
outside.

216
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,330
They were beaten half to death

217
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,130
and could barely get on their feet.

218
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,770
I'm Fudong.

219
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,210
Are you hungry?

220
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,330
I’ll go and get you

221
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,290
some hot soup and rice.

222
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,090
I’m not going anywhere.

223
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,170
I’m not going anywhere.

224
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:42,610
Okay.

225
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,170
Then stay here.

226
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,170
stay together with all of us.

227
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,450
Young Lady.

228
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,730
I want to have a name.

229
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:54,170
Can you name me?

230
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,490
How about this?

231
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,810
Her name is Yingchun.
[*the meaning is greeting spring]

232
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,970
Her name is Baoxia,
[*the meaning is embracing summer]

233
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,050
And she's Fudong,
[*the meaning is driving away winter]

234
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,770
And I will give you the name

235
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:03,970
Nianqiu.
[*the meaning is looking for fall]

236
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:04,730
Do you like it?

237
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,050
Nianqiu?

238
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,770
[Hua Zhi's maid, Nianqiu]

239
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,250
I like it.

240
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,050
I like it.

241
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,170
That's great

242
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,410
Now each of our names contains a season.

243
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,930
You can sleep with me tonight.

244
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,570
I'll make a bed for you tomorrow.

245
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,130
Go to sleep.

246
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,730
You're still up?

247
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,690
How is it going?

248
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,490
She's just been a bit frightened

249
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,410
but didn't get hurt.

250
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,050
The girls took her to rest.

251
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:52,050
I mean you.

252
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,570
I'm doing fine.

253
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,210
And I owed you a debt of gratitude

254
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,290
because of that gadget

255
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,050
you gave me.

256
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,050
And if it hadn't been

257
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,850
for that very gadget,

258
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,610
which made you feel safe somehow,

259
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,850
you might have thought twice

260
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,090
before you confronted them like that.

261
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,050
I really don't understand.

262
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,370
If those two guys

263
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,250
had gone desperate,

264
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,570
they could have

265
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,250
killed two of you.

266
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,690
Have you ever thought about that?

267
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,890
My Grandfather used to ask me

268
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,610
why I was so bold and reckless

269
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,330
and always confronted the dangers.

270
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,410
I was much more fearless

271
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,170
when I was little.

272
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,090
And now I know more things,

273
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,330
but I am less reckless.

274
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,170
I used to be afraid

275
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,530
that I couldn't be a well-behaved lady,

276
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,810
and that would disappoint my Grandfather

277
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,330
and make my family ashamed.

278
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,210
And now,

279
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,250
I'm afraid

280
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,530
that I can't shoulder the responsibility
to take care of my family

281
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,690
and let down
my Grandmother and the others.

282
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,730
Even if I return to the capital now,

283
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,210
I feel like I'm treading on thin ice.

284
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,690
Every night,

285
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,730
my mother can't sleep in peace.

286
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,290
She's afraid
that the moment she wakes up,

287
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,050
she'll find herself
back in poverty and hunger.

288
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,010
They are afraid that would happen again,

289
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,130
so I need to be brave for them.

290
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,050
I am the one who brought them back,

291
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,490
so I have to protect them.

292
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:11,450
Hua Zhi.

293
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,090
Sorry for what I just said.

294
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,050
Words don't count.

295
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,410
Starting tomorrow,

296
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:20,970
I will teach you

297
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,250
how to use the silent sleeve dart,

298
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,690
and teach you some hand-to-hand combat

299
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,690
for self-defense, alright?

300
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,970
Get some rest.

301
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,730
Tomorrow I will summon the guardians

302
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,170
and make some new rules for them.

303
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,890
You must have known this day would come,

304
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:32,970
since you hired me

305
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,090
in the name of master of martial arts.

306
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,090
Thank you then, Mr. Gu

307
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:43,690
Hua Zhi.

308
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,930
If you want to protect your family,

309
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,570
then I will be your guardian angel.

310
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:49,330
At least,

311
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,530
before I leave.

312
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,010
Finally, we won't

313
00:13:58,610 --> 00:13:59,610
see that Li Gui again.

314
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,490
It's a great relief

315
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,570
to get rid of him.

316
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,130
Totally.

317
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,170
If we need
to hire a new head of guardians,

318
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,970
who knows what kind of person he is?

319
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,490
God always has its odd plan.

320
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,410
Why men are all

321
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,330
tall and strong?

322
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,610
We can't compete with that.

323
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,570
I don't agree.

324
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,570
I think

325
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,530
Lady Zhi herself

326
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,130
is even stronger than men.

327
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,970
If I hadn't come,

328
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,730
I wouldn't have known

329
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,970
Aunt Qi thought so highly of me.

330
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,410
I was just discussing with your mother

331
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,690
about hiring a new head of guardians.

332
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,850
It's a tricky task.

333
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:27,810
Well,

334
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,450
it is impossible to judge
a man's heart from his face.

335
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,050
What if it was

336
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,850
some vicious guy like Li Gui,

337
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:33,810
What should we do?

338
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,170
Don't worry, Aunt Qi.

339
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,730
I've already spoken to Mr. Gu.

340
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:37,810
As long as

341
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,890
he is still hired
as our master of martial arts,

342
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,370
he can also oversee the courtyard.

343
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,970
I’ll just pay him extra wages for that.

344
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:42,970
Really?

345
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,330
Thank god.

346
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,410
We're lucky, right?

347
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,450
He's such a good-looking gentleman

348
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,810
and also Shaoyao's brother.

349
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,450
It's so nice of him

350
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,770
to take on two jobs here.

351
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:54,930
Zhi,

352
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,810
you must keep him around.

353
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:58,330
Exactly.

354
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,610
I made him

355
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,930
two new long robes.

356
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,290
Hand them to him in person.

357
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:03,810
Do what I say.

358
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,770
Let Baoxia go
buy another two pairs of shoes,

359
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,410
and some good tea leaves.

360
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,170
When you get the chance,

361
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,770
you can ask about

362
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,410
what he likes to eat
and what he likes to use.

363
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,770
That's the best way
to cater to his preferences.

364
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,730
You’re still young,

365
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,130
and you don't know how the world works.

366
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,730
If you offended him one day,

367
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,770
and he wanted to quit...

368
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,410
Aunt Qi.

369
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:18,530
I’ll go help you check

370
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,290
how is Boli doing in class.

371
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,130
Great, go.

372
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,570
You must keep in mind

373
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:23,570
what we just said.

374
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,210
Hold the pose.

375
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,050
Mr. Gu,

376
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,970
you're our master of martial arts.

377
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,290
Then why do we only
get to study the horse stance?

378
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,850
Exactly.

379
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,050
So what do you want to learn?

380
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,170
I want to learn how to
leap onto roofs and vault over walls,

381
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,450
split mountains
and shatter rocks.

382
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,410
I also want to learn sword flight.

383
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,330
- I want to learn that too!
- I want to learn that too!

384
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:06,410
Fine.

385
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,410
That's great!

386
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:09,810
Now I can learn sword flight.

387
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,770
But you must first
master the horse stance.

388
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,130
Why?

389
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,170
No matter what you want to learn,

390
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,850
you must first get your stance steady.

391
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,210
I thought you were busy.

392
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:24,770
I need to be a nice employer

393
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,090
no matter how busy I am.

394
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,610
What if you get upset

395
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,730
and decide to quit?

396
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,210
That will depend on

397
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:31,330
how you treat me.

398
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,570
Just an orange?

399
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,130
Thank you, Lady Zhi.

400
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,890
I'll teach you
how to use silent sleeve dart.

401
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,690
Greetings, Madam Hua.

402
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,890
She is our new maid,

403
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,770
Nianqiu.

404
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,410
Get up.

405
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,890
Stand up and talk.

406
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,570
You don't have to kneel from now on.

407
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,090
Come on.

408
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,370
Madam Hua is telling you to get up.

409
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,130
You're a pretty girl.

410
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,610
You all serve Lady Zhi by her side.

411
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,370
She can't take care of herself

412
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,570
when it comes to trivial things.

413
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,130
She won't care
if she eats well or sleeps well

414
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,890
once she gets busy.

415
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:23,770
All she thinks about

416
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,490
is making money.

417
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,890
You all should help her out,

418
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,770
and take care of her.

419
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,170
Yes, Madam Hua.

420
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,090
You may leave.

421
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,090
Let's go.

422
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,130
I heard that it was your elder brother

423
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,210
who saved that new girl the other day,

424
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,890
and now
he's also the master of martial arts.

425
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:52,970
Yeah.

426
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,050
My brother likes Zhi a lot.

427
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,650
Keep your hand straight.

428
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,210
Go this way.

429
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,730
Turn your palm upwards.

430
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:17,930
Otherwise, your hands will get poked.

431
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,050
A bit higher.

432
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:20,850
Relax.

433
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,690
Right, up.

434
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,130
Like this?

435
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:39,610
Shoot.

436
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,210
Not bad.

437
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,170
Let's go on.

438
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:53,290
It's fine.

439
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,570
Go on.

440
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:10,410
Let's take a break

441
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,410
and grab something to eat.

442
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,210
Go ahead.

443
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,690
I chose the biggest one for you.

444
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,850
Why don't you have it?

445
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:21,970
You can't share a pear.
[*Sharing a pear means parting ways]

446
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,730
You did well today.

447
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:24,810
But you also need to

448
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,850
practice more every day.

449
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,810
That big horse is meek.

450
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,610
This meek horse you are talking about

451
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,890
has broken a dozen guys' legs.

452
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:35,890
It likes you.

453
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,730
Mr. Gu,

454
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,450
you do know

455
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,690
how to flatter your employer.

456
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:40,930
Of course.

457
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,570
If you are unhappy,

458
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,970
I'd lose my job.

459
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,330
Can you teach me horse riding?

460
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,010
Why all the sudden?

461
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,490
When my Grandfather

462
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,450
left for the Northern Land,

463
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,730
he said If I had known
how to ride a horse at that time,

464
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,290
I could have caught up with them sooner

465
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,290
and spent more time with them.

466
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,770
I will go to the Northern Land

467
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,770
someday anyway.

468
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,170
I want to

469
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:58,970
go farther away.

470
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,330
If I can ride a horse,

471
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:01,730
I can go anywhere on my own.

472
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,530
I once asked my Grandfather to teach me,

473
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,050
but he was a scholar,

474
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,690
and he went everywhere
in carriages and palanquins.

475
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:15,890
Don't hold on to this spot.

476
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,330
You need to hold onto the reins.

477
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,610
I can't.

478
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,250
If I do that,

479
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,290
it will get restless,

480
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,290
and I might fall off.

481
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,210
You won't.

482
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,410
I am the one who is riding a horse,

483
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,970
that's easy for you to say.

484
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,210
FIne.

485
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,050
Even if you fall,

486
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,210
I can catch you.

487
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:15,410
See? You won't fall.

488
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,690
Yanxi.

489
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,690
Why are you whistling?

490
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,170
I'm imitating you.

491
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,090
You have to try harder then.

492
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,770
The horse didn't stop.

493
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,490
Teach me then.

494
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,050
Next time.

495
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:45,170
How about that?

496
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,450
Do you still want to learn?

497
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,810
It feels like I'm riding waves

498
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,450
when I'm riding the horse.

499
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,090
You aren't afraid of falling now?

500
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,570
I still am, but I am learning anyway.

501
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,050
So do you want to

502
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:58,810
go for another two laps?

503
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,050
Sure.

Grandmother.

524
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,050
Why did you come here?

525
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,090
This must be the master of martial arts.

526
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,130
He is my brother.

527
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,090
I asked Mr. Gu to teach me
how to ride a horse.

528
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,690
The horse started running

529
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,810
once I got back on it.

530
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,770
This horse is very fierce,

531
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,010
it listens to no one

532
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,370
except me.

533
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,610
Haven't you yet

534
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,170
lectured the guardians?

535
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,970
Now I remember.
Thank you for reminding me.

536
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:38,930
Madam Hua,

537
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,770
I'll take my leave.

538
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,730
Hold on.

539
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,730
Turn around,
I wanna have a look at you.

540
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:01,090
You can go.

541
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:02,730
I'll take my leave.

542
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,130
I'll go with you, Yanxi.

543
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,210
Yanxi.

544
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,810
You two looked so awesome

545
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,930
on the horse.

546
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,410
Let me tag along, okay?

547
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,290
Teach me.

548
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,170
Yanxi, wait.

549
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,250
Grandmother.

550
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,250
It's my bad.

551
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,050
What are you blaming yourself for?

552
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,410
It's a fine horse.

553
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:33,890
Grandmother.

554
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,730
It has a bad temper.

555
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,930
Don't get too close.

556
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,570
Relax.

557
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,210
You’re just too uptight,

558
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,570
always like a bowstring.

559
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,810
You were making the horse nervous

560
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,850
because you wouldn't relax.

561
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,450
Relax a little.

562
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,050
Do you notice the pack horse

563
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,970
that delivers goods for our kitchen?

564
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,290
The bags carried on its back are soft.

565
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,290
They are steadily

566
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,170
placed there.

567
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:00,930
If it were

568
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,370
a hard and stiff stick,

569
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,210
it would fall to the ground

570
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,450
once the horse moved.

571
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,370
If you want to learn
how to ride a horse,

572
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,010
you need to remember one thing.

573
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,490
No matter

574
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,650
what happens,

575
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,770
never let go of

576
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,130
the reins in your hands.

577
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,210
You can't lose your determination

578
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,850
to control the direction.

579
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,450
Whether it is about riding horses,
dealing with people,

580
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,450
or handling affairs,

581
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,450
you need to learn to go with the flow

582
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,770
and find the balance.

583
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,730
The horse has great strength,

584
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,970
and you have less.

585
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:30,490
You must learn to leverage its strength,

586
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,330
only then you can
take over control and turn the table.

587
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:34,250
Grandmother.

588
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,770
How do you know all this?

589
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,090
To you, I'm just an old woman

590
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,530
who spends all day long in this house

591
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,370
without knowing anything,

592
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,050
right?

593
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,050
I was a young girl once.

594
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,890
When I was your age,

595
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,770
I loved to ride wild horses
and drink strong liquors.

596
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,570
All the young lads in the imperial city

597
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,050
couldn't catch up with me.

598
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,690
It was a fine horse.

599
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,730
In my younger days,

600
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,690
Those gates couldn't hold me back.

601
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,770
I would ride my roan horse

602
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,890
out to the suburbs for hunting

603
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,290
once my mother let her guard down.

604
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,250
My horse back then...

605
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,130
Its hooves would sweat
when trampling through the snow,

606
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,690
and under the saddles,
its curly hair would swirl.

607
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,050
It was truly a beautiful and fine horse.

608
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,610
One time,

609
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,250
the horse

610
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,610
got lost in the strong wind,

611
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,690
and it somehow

612
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,690
ran up to a shabby house,

613
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,810
so I went in there
and stayed away from the wind.

614
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,450
You...

615
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,690
What are you afraid of?

616
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,490
I won't hurt you.

617
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:29,770
And then what happened?

618
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,890
Who was that person?

619
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,850
He became your Grandfather.

620
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,610
Here.

621
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,530
What is this?

622
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:05,690
It's a hand-warmer.

623
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:06,770
Try it.

624
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,090
It's made from wild rabbit fur.

625
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:08,850
It will get you warm.

626
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,130
The fur is from the rabbit I hunted

627
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,450
a few days ago,

628
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,250
and I sewed this with my hands.

629
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,250
How could you kill a living creature?

630
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:16,930
Give that back then,

631
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,610
I'll give it to someone else.

632
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,330
No.

633
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:19,690
Don't.

634
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,250
Thank you, lady.

635
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:23,090
You're welcome.

636
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,370
Who would have thought

637
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,850
that I got to spend the rest of my life
with that man?

638
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,250
I thought

639
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,530
you were betrothed to my Grandfather

640
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,930
after he passed
the imperial examination.

641
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,450
What was the fun then?

642
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,370
I wouldn't marry someone

643
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,970
in a snobbish way like that.

644
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,610
My father was a marquis,

645
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,050
and my mother was a county princess.

646
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,570
Yet I fell for a poor boy.

647
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:52,250
So as a result,

648
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,410
it caused quite an uproar in my family.

649
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,770
But soon,

650
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:58,450
your Grandfather
became the top of the examination.

651
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:00,970
And my family
had nothing more to complain about.

652
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,810
But what if
he hadn't passed the examination?

653
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,890
would you marry him?

654
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,290
It didn't matter.

655
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,570
I had thought it through.

656
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:09,690
I'd elope with him.

657
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,090
if that was the worst scenario.

658
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,530
The world was so big,

659
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,370
wherever we went would be our home.

660
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,490
What I admired in him

661
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,930
was not his talents or official titles.

662
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,570
So you love him
for his character and temperament?

663
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,050
Not even close.

664
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,690
It was because of his look.

665
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,770
When I entered that dilapidated house
that day,

666
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,010
I saw

667
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,930
such a handsome young man.

668
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,970
And my heart just...

669
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,330
Grandmother,
you pointed at the wrong spot.

670
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,650
It was thumping right here.

671
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,650
So fiercely.

672
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,010
We've been through ups and downs

673
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:42,930
after our marriage,

674
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,170
He worked his way up.

675
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,970
and our children were all grown up.

676
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,850
I was once
the youngest daughter of the Qin Family

677
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,250
and now
became Madam Hua of the Hua Family.

678
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,330
When I'm in front of you,

679
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,650
I have to be a serious

680
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,170
and fair person.

681
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,330
And I have to present myself
as an unsmiling person.

682
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,130
The fun of hunting and drinking
has long long gone.

683
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,050
No more fun for me.

684
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,050
I can have a drink with you.

685
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,250
No more drinking.

686
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,730
Shaoyao said it was not allowed.

687
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,090
Kid,

688
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,130
don't listen to that nonsense

689
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,490
from those irrelevant people.

690
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,730
They always talk
about family background, clan,

691
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,970
career, fame and success.

692
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,890
That's not looking for someone you love,

693
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,370
it's just pure business.

694
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,890
If one day someone

695
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,370
can make your heart pound so hard

696
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,210
that you can feel your heartbeat
up here?

697
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:30,610
Remember.

698
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,450
That's your man.

699
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,050
Really?

700
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,810
Do you like that master of martial arts?

701
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,690
Grandmother.

702
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,290
I have never thought about these.

703
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,210
You are a smart girl,

704
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,050
ask yourself

705
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,690
what's your true feelings for him.

706
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,530
Every time I meet him,

707
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,530
I feel very happy.

708
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:00,770
When he comes to see Shaoyao,

709
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,410
I always want to talk to him.

710
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,250
And there are things

711
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,730
that I only want to say to him.

712
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,770
I don't want any answers.

713
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,650
I just want to tell him.

714
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,010
That is it.

715
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,050
I think deep down

716
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,210
I do like him.

717
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,370
But right now

718
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,570
I am responsible for the whole family,

719
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,850
there are so many things for me to do.

720
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,450
I cannot promise him anything.

721
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,610
You are wrong.

722
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:23,890
Remember.

723
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,930
No matter
what your responsibilities are,

724
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,890
or how significant those things are,

725
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,690
do not waste your youth time.

726
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,290
If one day

727
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,850
you have your answer,

728
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,010
no matter who that is,

729
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,890
just come tell me,

730
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,490
and I will prepare your dowry for you.

731
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,050
You should be overjoyed

732
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,530
and proud

733
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,490
to be sent off to marriage.

734
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:45,610
I understand.

735
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,050
I have taken a closer look at him.

736
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,450
He’s a tall and handsome young man,

737
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,930
but just slightly

738
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,890
not as good as your Grandfather.

739
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,490
Of course.

740
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:57,690
Right.

741
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,890
Shaoyao told me

742
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,690
that Master Mu's classes

743
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:03,170
are difficult to understand.

744
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,370
I knew.

745
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,930
I'm already

746
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,210
looking for some young teachers.

747
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,370
But I didn't find one yet.

748
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,250
Okay.

749
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,130
Then go ahead with your business.

750
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,370
I'll stay a bit longer.

751
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,570
Bye.

752
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,050
Just now

753
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,530
Did you see the way

754
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:24,690
they were riding horses?

755
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,050
At this rate,

756
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,090
she won't master it forever.

757
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,370
She wasn't thinking
about the horse at all.

758
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,450
You speak the truth.

759
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,050
Bring that young man over.

760
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,650
I have something to ask him.

761
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:01,810
Madam Hua.

762
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,130
Today, I won't ask about your career

763
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,730
or your family background.

764
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,330
I will only ask you one thing.

765
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,490
What do you think of

766
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,210
my little girl Hua Zhi?

767
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,050
Just tell me

768
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,530
your genuine thoughts.

769
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:23,570
She has breadth of mind,

770
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,570
and courage,

771
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,690
which is better
than most people in the world.

772
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,290
That's all?

773
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,770
She sees the good sides of people,
and she is always calm.

774
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,490
She has profound thoughts

775
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:33,930
but also is refreshing as a breeze.

776
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,690
You do know something about

777
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,050
what she is like.

778
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,290
However,

779
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,730
you didn't get to the point.

780
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,370
What do you want to hear, Madam Hua?

781
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,290
It's not about what I want to hear,

782
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,330
it's about telling me
what you are really thinking.

783
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,730
I am Zhi's Grandmother.

784
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,170
Today, I will take a bold move

785
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,450
and ask you away.

786
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,890
Mr. Gu.

787
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,050
You don't have to answer me right now.

788
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,570
I only hope you can think it over,

789
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,210
and be true to yourself.

790
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,370
Whenever you have the answer,

791
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,570
and you figure it out,

792
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:09,530
you don't have to tell me.

793
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,890
You know

794
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,610
who wants to know the answer.

795
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:15,450
Okay.

796
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,090
Zhi is that kind of girl

797
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,050
that won't show affection
even though she likes something so bad.

798
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,970
I hope you don't keep her wait too long,

799
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,570
and certainly don't lie to her.

800
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:53,490
Stop gloating.

801
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,450
You looked so scared

802
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,650
when you saw my Grandmother.

803
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,770
I didn't know

804
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,290
you could come back in one piece.

805
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:00,970
Did she get angry?

806
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,250
What did she say to you?

807
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,330
Perhaps she is old

808
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,530
with bad eyesight.

809
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,650
She said you were handsome.

810
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,690
Lady Zhi,

811
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,930
you are young
and can see things clearly,

812
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:13,490
can't you tell how I look?

813
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,050
I didn't pay attention before.

814
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,650
But now I know,

815
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,730
you are good-looking.

816
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,370
Are you going to

817
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:26,930
ride that horse tomorrow?

818
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,170
But make sure

819
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,290
we don't get caught
by Grandmother again。

820
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,250
Yanxi。

821
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:43,170
What do you think of me?

822
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,050
Do a thorough investigation.

823
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,050
Find out what's going on

824
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,570
between the empress dowager
and the Hua Family.

825
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:02,930
Zhi is that kind of girl

826
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,850
who won't show affection
even though she likes something so bad.

827
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,810
I hope you don't keep her wait too long,

828
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,890
and certainly don't lie to her.

829
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,130
I...

830
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:23,570
consider you as my bosom friend.

831
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:41,250
Bosom friend?

832
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:42,890
Yes.

833
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,210
You are the first and only friend
I've made

834
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,410
since I returned

835
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,090
to the imperial capital.

836
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,050
Same here.

837
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,650
I have something to do, I have to go.

839

Hua Zhi.

847
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:41,370
Is being his bosom friend
still not enough?

848
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,410
Young Lady.

849
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,370
Let me do it for you.

850
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:52,650
No need.

851
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:53,570
I can do it myself.

852
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:56,770
Young Lady.

853
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,770
Tell you something.

854
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,850
Miqiu

855
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,530
are even busier

856
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,170
than those nectar-collecting bees.

857
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,850
She cleaned your room

858
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:04,330
inside out.

859
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,130
Nianqiu,

860
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,810
don't busy yourself
with these trivial tasks.

861
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:08,410
You see, in this house,

862
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:09,530
Yingchun is capable of managing affairs,

863
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,810
Fudong is adept at cooking,

864
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,170
and Baoxia?

865
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,170
She is both greedy and lazy
with no desire to improve herself.

866
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,250
She just keeps following me everywhere

867
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,210
like a puppy dog.

868
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:17,570
So now,

869
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:18,530
I don't need anybody to serve me.

870
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,010
What do you want to do for yourself?

871
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,730
Have you thought about it?

872
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,530
Young Lady.

873
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,450
Your sleeve is worn out.

874
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,370
Yeah, you're the only one who noticed.

875
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,330
Young Lady.

876
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,290
I stitched up

877
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,530
your clothes.

878
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,970
How come you left

879
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:26,970
no mending marks on that?

880
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:27,490
I...

881
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,170
I mended it with silk thread.

882
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,210
I used 152 weft threads crosswise,

883
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,810
and 97 warp threads lengthwise

884
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,090
to mend it up.

885
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,690
From one to ten thousand,

886
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:39,170
these words are easy to remember.

887
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,330
Starting today,

888
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,770
I will teach you accounting every night.

889
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,370
Go find Baoxia.

890
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,530
She knows enough

891
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,890
to teach you how to read.

892
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,970
I don't know how to.

893
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:49,170
It doesn't matter.

894
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,770
You mended so well

895
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,650
and even remembered the threads clearly.

896
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,890
It shows that you're focused, careful,

897
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:55,690
and patient as well.

898
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,010
With these three qualities,

899
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:57,770
you can do things with half the effort
but achieve doubled outcomes

900
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,890
from the very beginning.

901
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:00,130
But...

902
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,130
No more 'but'.

903
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,130
Let's give it a try.

904
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,450
If you do well,

905
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,050
I have an important thing for you to do.

906
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,490
It's so hard to

907
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,610
do business today.

908
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:22,090
Right.

909
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,050
Agree.

910
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,250
The shops are crowded together.

911
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,050
No wonder the business isn't good.

912
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:27,730
Not to mention the gloomy vibe

913
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,970
once we get here.

914
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,690
No wonder there's no foot traffic.

915
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,700
[Houfu Longevity Timber Shop]

916
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,170
Yingchun.

917
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,570
Starting from this first shop here,

918
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,570
you go door by door

919
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:51,570
to negotiate the resale price

920
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,530
with these three shopowners.

921
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:55,290
Young Lady.

922
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,370
Are you gonna rent a shop here?

923
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,770
Alright.

924
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,250
I can see

925
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,570
they will be out of business soon.

926
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,370
I can ask for a low price

927
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,250
and make a good deal,

928
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:14,970
Shaoyao,

929
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:16,850
Don't run around,

930
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,890
Fudong.

931
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,370
You're holding too tight.

932
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,490
I didn't run around.

933
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,770
It's crowded here.

934
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,410
Shaoyao.

935
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:24,410
Follow us and be a good girl,

936
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,450
otherwise,

937
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,410
we won't bring you with us

938
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,170
for groceries next time.

939
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,210
No.

940
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,210
I...

941
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,050
I'll help you carry the basket.

942
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:32,810
I won't cause trouble.

943
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,050
Good girl.

944
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:34,450
Let's go.

945
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:35,850
Fudong.

946
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:37,130
Why do we need to buy new materials

947
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,770
all of a sudden?

948
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,370
There are dozens of new faces

949
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,530
in the kitchen.

950
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,210
To sell whom?

951
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,890
Young Lady has her own plan.

952
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,530
Let's go.

953
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,170
Look at that carriage.

954
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,370
It seems to be from the Hua's.

955
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,650
Isn't that Lady Zhi?

956
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,010
Accompanied by two maids.

957
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,570
I've heard
that the eldest daughter of their family

958
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,170
is a gorgeous head-turner.

959
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:02,170
Have you seen her before?

960
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,730
That's because you've had no luck.

961
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,330
One time
when she set up a stall by the street

962
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,330
and was writing calligraphy,

963
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:06,970
I saw her.

964
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,570
She is beautiful.

965
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,130
It doesn't matter

966
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:10,810
since she's just a pastry seller.

967
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:12,610
She is the evil witch

968
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,210
who broke my brother's heart

969
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,010
and acted like nothing happened.

970
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,250
How about this?

971
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,730
We got your back.

972
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,770
We'll go to her,

973
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,610
and you can scold her.

974
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:21,970
Mr. Shen,

975
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,130
are you scared or what?

976
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,370
There's nothing to be scared of.

977
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,210
Today I'll just do a good deed

978
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,170
and get rid of that evil person.

979
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,490
Stop drinking.

980
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:31,970
Hurry up.

981
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,290
Go.

982
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:32,610
Go.

983
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,010
Go.

984
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,610
That's simple, I can do it too.

985
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,690
That's quite impressive.

986
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,290
Lady Zhi,

987
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:46,850
don't go,

988
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:47,970
Let's be friends.

989
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:48,730
Hang out for a while.

990
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:49,290
Go.

991
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:50,050
Just go.

992
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,050
Who are those people?

993
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,490
They're so annoying,

994
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,490
just like those chickens and ducks
we raise at home.

995
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,010
Wait.

996
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,690
They are even worse
than those chickens and ducks.

997
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,530
They've mistaken you for

998
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:58,050
Lady Zhi,

999
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,050
and they want to bully us.

1000
00:42:59,130 --> 00:42:59,890
Go faster.

1001
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:01,770
They want to bully Zhi?

1002
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:02,650
She stopped.

1003
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:03,730
Maybe she likes you.

1004
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:04,730
Go to her.

1005
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,570
Right on.
