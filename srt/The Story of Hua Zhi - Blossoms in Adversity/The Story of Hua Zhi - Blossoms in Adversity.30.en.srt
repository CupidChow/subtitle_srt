00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,510
[Episode 30]

25
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,190
This is where

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,400
we met the second time.

27
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,150
I saw you bleeding that day.

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
And I thought to myself,

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,910
we were bleeding
since our residence got raided,

30
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,630
but as the raider,
you were bleeding as well.

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,710
What an absurd world!

32
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,680
What's the point

33
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,470
that so much blood is shed?

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:29,960
At that time,

35
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,430
I thought you wished to kill me.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,680
Fortunately,

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,120
I didn't act on impulse and kill you.

38
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,150
Otherwise, who would dig
the wedding wine for me?

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,710
And who would help me
pick hawthorn fruits?

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,870
Yanxi.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,080
Thank you for helping us
reclaim our mansion,

42
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,710
so we can live here again.

43
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,240
I am the one who should thank you.

44
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,360
Hua Zhi.

45
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,750
Thank you

46
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,240
for giving me and Shaoyao a home.

47
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,470
Then we will be a family in the future.

48
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,520
No need for such formalities.

49
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,030
But Hua Zhi,

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,310
I'm still afraid.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,430
The closer we get,

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,120
the closer you are

53
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,000
to the dark Palace.

54
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,750
It's alright.

55
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,960
No matter what lies ahead,

56

we'll always
stay by the side of each other

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,590
and keep going.

58
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,030
Compared to all things in the world,

59
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,800
human life is far too short.

60
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,910
Perhaps in an instant,

61
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,800
our hair will turn grey.

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,840
Okay.

63
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,000
Then I'll wait for that day

64
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,360
and see how we look

65
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,680
with grey hair.

66
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,910
Hua Zhi.

67
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,710
I have prepared something for you.

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
Do you remember what we agreed?

69
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,680
I came with Imperial Censor Hua.

70
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,000
His Majesty orders him
to leave the capital.

71
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,510
So I'm leaving too.

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,630
Young Lord,

73
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,070
I once read a line of a poem by Du Fu

74
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,600
in a book.

75
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,390
I will turn into a star after my death
and be never extinguished in the sky.

76
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,390
Her Highness

77
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,800
must have also turned into a star.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,600
One day,

79
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,680
we will also become stars.

80
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,920
Then you can reunite with your mother.

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,510
Really?

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
But the stars are so far away,

83
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,160
I can't see anything clearly.

84
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,920
I don't know

85
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,750
if my mother is even there.

86
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,950
Right.

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,480
I've heard of something

88
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,270
called the armillary sphere.

89
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,000
You can find the stars with it.

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,630
After I leave,

91
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,390
Her Highness will surely

92
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,750
keep watching over you in the sky.

93
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,310
So, cheer up a little

94
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,600
and don't be sad, all right?

95
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,000

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,600
I find the armillary sphere,

98
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,000
I will buy one for you.

99
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Then you can teach me
to recognize the stars.

100
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,310

113

I passed by this garden every day

114
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,190
without ever appreciating its beauty.

115
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,310
But now I think

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,750
it's such a waste

117

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,270
He has little in common

135

with the children,

136
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,190
so he can't get along with them.

137
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,000
And he bites people when he gets upset.

138
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,120
It seems only Duo can handle him.

139
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,190
I agree.

142
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,510

Duo.

155
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,870
What happened?

156
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,240
What happened?

157
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,190

Duo

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,560
fell into the well.

160
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,270
How come?

161
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,040
How could she have fallen into the well?

162
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,190
Duo

163
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,950
fell into the well

164
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,430
because she came in here to look for me.

165
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,560
What?

166
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,120
Duo.

167
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,190
Tell me where it hurts.

168
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,190
What happened to you?

169
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,830
You fell down too?

170
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,240
Aunt Xia,

171
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,630
it was Jian

172
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,680
who got Duo out of there.

173
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Did you use this rope

174
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,480
to get her out?

175
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,870
You kids.

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,560
Why didn't you call for adults?

177
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,870
It would have been too late.

178
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,430
Besides, the mouth of the well
was so small

179
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,920
that even I couldn't get in.

180
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,000
Jian said

181
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,040
he wasn't afraid of the dark

182
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,190
and just jumped down.

183
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,750
He lifted Duo up.

184
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,040
Then I found a rope

185
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,510
to pull them up.

186
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,270
Well done.

187
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,070
You're hurt.

188
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,120
Go to Shaoyao

189
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,190
and let her apply some medicine on you.

190
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,000
I wronged you just now.

191
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:37,790
You are a very good child.

192
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,000
Bolin.

193
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,550
You all are good children.

194
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,840
Thank you, Jian.

195
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,080
Jian.

196
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,150
From now on, you are Duo's brother.

197
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,910
You can also consider me

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,030
as your godmother.

199
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
Okay?

200
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,320
Good boy.

201
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:05,720
Don't worry, Miss.

202
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,200
That child comes every day.

203
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,480
He sits with Duo in the last row.

204
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,600
Although he doesn't understand yet,

205
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,030
but still, he is eager to learn.

206
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,790
Jian has never

207
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,030
seen an academy before.

208
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,150
Mr. Zheng, please
pay more attention to him.

209
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,360
Children have good memories.

210
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,750
It's not too difficult to enlighten him.

211
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,550
Miss.

212
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,750
People said...

213
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,720
Forget it. It's nothing.

214
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,910
What makes it so hard

215
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,840
for you to talk about?

216
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,840
You prevaricated. That was rare.

217
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,320
I went out yesterday

218
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,790
and heard people were gossiping.

219
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,000
They said...

220
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,320
They said...

221
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,480
That Mr. Bai and I had a thing.

222
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,150
The name of the restaurant "Zhiming"
is solid evidence.

223
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,120
Was that so?

224
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
What do you think, Mr. Zheng?

225
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,150
I...

226
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,550
I think

227
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,550
if...

228
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,840
If Lady Zhi and Mr. Bai

229
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,550
do love each other,

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,510
gossip is nothing to be afraid of.

231
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,720
Were you talking about flavor
or something?

232
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,870
I said Fudong made some pastries
with new flavors.

233
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,750
I will ask her to bring you some.

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,360
Great.

235
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,270
Young Lady.

236
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,790
This is bad.

237
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,120
I heard Mr. Bai

238
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,240
rode his horse around the capital

239
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,960
with eighteen loads of betrothal gifts.

240
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,790
And he's heading straight
to our mansion now.

241
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,790
Sir.

242
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,270
They are fast.

243
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,320
What?

244
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,510
They'll arrive at the Hua Mansion
in no time.

245
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,670
Get your job done.

246
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,390
I'm off to fight the enemy
with the Commander.

247
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,270
Close the door behind you!

248
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,030
Thanks a lot!

249
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,200
Thank you.

250
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:06,790
Thank you.

251
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,840
Thanks.

252
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,550
Sack.

253
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,200
Poison.

254
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,320
Machete.

255
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,000
Sir, pick one.

256
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,840
Thanks.

257
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,080
Thanks a lot!

258
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,030
Young Lady, what should we do?

259
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,870
They're really coming.

260
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,480
Thanks a lot!

261
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:28,550
Thank you.

262
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,750
Stop!

263
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,790
You are...

264
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,480
This is Mr. Yan.

265
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,790
Pleasure to meet you.

266
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,120
I am not a lucky person.

267
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,270
My parents have passed away.

268
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,440
So today I had to come in person
to ask for hand in marriage.

269
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:55,870
Miss Hua.

270
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,080
This is the betrothal document.

271
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,790
Mr. Bai,

272
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,910
take your betrothal document
and the betrothal gifts.

273
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,600
Get lost!

274
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,270
I have no grudges against you.

275
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,200
Why do you want to tear apart

276
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,440
Fudong and me?

277
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,910
- Fudong?
- Fudong?

278
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,550
This... this weather...

279
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,120
Congratulations!

280
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,600
[Betrothal Document]

281
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:50,840
Fudong?

282
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,840
You...

283
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:54,960
Madam Qi,

284
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,390
this is all my fault.

285
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,840
Get up.

286
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,790
She did nothing wrong.

287
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:04,840
If someone needs to apologize,

288
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,840
that would be me.

289
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,200
Miss Hua.

290
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,360
I've known Fudong
since the cooking competition.

291
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,030
Later, Zhiming Restaurant opened.

292
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,150
We spent days and nights together

293
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,270
and then fell in love.

294
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,960
We are in a relationship,

295
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:15,870
but we know business is business.

296
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,670
Everything about Zhiming Restaurant
will stay the same.

297
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,000
Please rest assured, everyone.

298
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,120
Fudong.

299
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,750
Why have you never mentioned this to me?

300
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,550
Young Lady.

301
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,790
I didn't mean to keep this from you.

302
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,790
It's just that...

303
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,440
I didn't know
he would show up with betrothal gifts.

304
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,910
If he had not,

305
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,720
you would never have told me?

306
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,480
What were you thinking, Fudong?

307
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,870
I will surely give you

308
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,750
a formal wedding ceremony.

309
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,270
I love Fudong with all my heart.

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,840
If I ever betray her,

311
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,550
I will suffer from endless pain

312
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,510
and never be reincarnated into a human.

313
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,550
I cross my heart.

314
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
Please stop.

315
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,480
I'll listen to you.

316
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,390
Cut it out.

317
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,750
You can trust a man

318
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
when pigs fly.

319
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,670
I'm just asking you one thing.

320
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,870
Zhiming Restaurant

321
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
was won by Zhi and Fudong

322
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,870
after they put in so much effort.

323
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,550
You and Zhi
run the business well together

324
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,270
because Fudong
is an excellent head chef.

325
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,120
If Fudong marries into your family,

326
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,200
will Zhiming Restaurant

327
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,790
become a restaurant

328
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
of you and your wife?

329
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,000
No. That will not happen, Madam Xia.

330
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,240
So this is your concern, Madam.

331
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,030
Fudong and I are mutually in love.

332
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,960
I have already thought it through.

333
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,600
If she is willing to marry me,

334
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,910
I will draw up a new contract

335
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,750
with Miss Hua.

336
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,790
I will transfer my half of the capital

337
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,240
to Fudong.

338
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,630
Then Fudong and Miss Hua

339
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,750
will be the joint owners

340
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,600
of Zhiming Restaurant.

341
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,030
We can put the business thing aside

342
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,270
and discuss it the other day.

343
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,790
But whether to marry you or not

344
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,440
depends on Fudong.

345
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,840
I don't want
to discuss it the other day.

346
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,200
If Fudong turns him down,
we can just forget it.

347
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,790
But if she says yes,
we need to make the contract right here.

348
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,270
No problem.

349
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,150
Am I fortunate enough

350
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,750
to take you as my wife?

351
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,790
Qin,

352
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,600
how many betrothal letters
have you received these days?

353
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,910
Seven or eight, I guess.

354
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,390
Seven or eight?

355
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,840
Why do I only have three?

356
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,080
You're still young.

357
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,750
Why are you in such a hurry?

358
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,320
There are too few good men
in this world.

359
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,200
I have to collect more letters.

360
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,360
Who knows?

361
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,120
I might find one of those
charming young men

362
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,510
like in the storybooks.

363
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,960
When we fell on hard times before,

364
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,600
there were no families
asked for marriage.

365
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,120
Even the arranged marriages

366
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,200
were called off.

367
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,360
After Bai Mingxia asks Fudong

368
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,790
to marry him,

369
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,600
they come to their senses

370
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:45,870
and realize the Hua Family is thriving.

371
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,000
Indeed.

372
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,670
When the mansion caught fire before,

373
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,240
Zhi had people carry

374
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,320
a lot of burnt gold and silver ingots

375
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,550
from the inner courtyard.

376
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,240
The word has spread
throughout the Imperial Capital.

377
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,390
I'm afraid

378
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,670
these men all covet

379
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,670
our Hua Family's dowry.

380
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,440
When Fudong got married,

381
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,270
she left with

382
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,270
at least seven chests of dowry

383
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,440
and they were all full sets
of pure gold jewelry.

384
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,000
We will be way better
than a maid, of course.

385
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,790
I don't care about those.

386
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,670
Anyway,

387
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,630
I am learning how to cook

388
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,840
with Fudong.

389
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,390
I can support myself now.

390
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,030
I just want a husband

391
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,320
who is handsome, tall, and devoted.

392
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,270
Ling, listen to her.

393
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,200
This young girl

394
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,080
is saying such shameless words.

395
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,550
I am just telling the truth.

396
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,910
Listen.

397
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,200
After you get married,

398
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,480
you need money
to provide food and buy clothes.

399
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,270
A tall and handsome husband

400
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,840
isn't of much use.

401
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,840
Such as Mr. Yan

402
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,120
and Mr. Zheng.

403
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,270
They are tall indeed

404
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,600
and also good-looking.

405
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,240
But they are orphans

406
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,840
and also so poor that
they don't even have their own houses.

407
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:40,790
Do you want

408
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,790
to marry a man living

409
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,000
under someone else's roof?

410
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,270
I haven't thought that much about it.

411
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,550
However,

412
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,840
those poor men in storybooks

413
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,550
always end up as zhuangyuan, don't they?

414
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
And that means they will become wealthy,

415
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,750
just like our grandfather.

416
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:55,870
Silly girl,

417
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,670
then go live inside a storybook.

418
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,480
Where is Ling?

419
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,400
Wasn't she just here?

420
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,640
Zheng Zhi, stop right there!

421
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,200
What are you hiding from?

422
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,480
Did you hear everything?

423
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:21,920
The private talk of young misses

424
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,830
should not be overheard by gentlemen.

425
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,000
I didn't mean to.

426
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,000
Rong was just joking around.

427
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,400
Qin has always been like that.

428
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,550
I offer you an apology

429
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,440
on behalf of them.

430
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,350
Qin is not wrong.

431
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,480
If she's not wrong,

432
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,750
what are you apologizing for?

433
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,200
I'm going to prepare for the lesson.

434
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,510
I...

435
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:46,350
I just want to tell you

436
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,440
that not everyone thinks that way.

437
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,680
That's really surprising.

438
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,160
These young misses

439
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,550
really have opened the restaurant.

440
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,590
That's because Mr. Bai is here.

441
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,200
A bunch of unmarried young misses

442
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,750
are less than useful.

443
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,720
I differ.

444
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,200
Previously at Yunlai Restaurant,

445
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,510
Bai Mingxia went all out

446
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:18,960
to manage everything.

447
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,830
But if you ask me,

448
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,110
Zhiming Restaurant

449
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,200
is way more prosperous
than Yunlai Restaurant.

450
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,550
As a merchant,

451
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,400
I don't despise the poor or women.

452
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,550
She does the business well.

453
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,550
I, Sun Xiang,
would look upon her favorably.

454
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,440
Next time,
remember to clean the dirt from the tray

455
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,720
before serving to the customers.

456
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,510
The plates are a mess.

457
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,960
Sort it out later.

458
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,550
Give me the account book
for the past few days.

459
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,070
Is she

460
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,550
the legendary

461
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,790
Jade God of Wealth,

462
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,070
Hua Zhi?

463
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,880
Mister, you're mistaken.

464
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,510
That is Yingchun.

465
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,920
Yingchun?

466
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,640
Which branch of the Hua Family
does she belong to?

467
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,030
She does not belong to any branch.

468
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,200
She's the chief maid

469
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,480
of Lady Zhi.

470
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,830
Don't look down on her

471
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,830
just because she is a maid.

472
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,160
Now in the Hua Family,

473
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,790
everyone knows

474
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,590
Yingchun

475
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,310
is the chief housekeeper.

476
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,310
She takes care of many things

477
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,960
for Lady Zhi.

478
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,030
Seventeen thousand qian.

479
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,590
And here as well.

480
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,680
Madam Xia.

481
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:37,960
Young Lady.

482
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,750
The owner of Sun's Tea Shop, Sun Xiang,

483
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,790
has come here for you.

484
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We have never

485
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,270
purchased tea leaves
from Sun's Tea Shop.

486
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,310
What is he here for?

487
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,920
Please invite him in.

488
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,200
Zhi.

489
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,440
My maternal family

490
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,880
has had dealings with Sun Xiang.

491
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,070
He is considered
one of the top merchants

492
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,720
in the tea business
of the Imperial Capital.

493
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,550
He has been offering tea to the Palace

494
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,200
for many years.

495
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,440
Treat him well.

496
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,270
Yingchun.

497
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,920
Go prepare two bowls of the finest tea.

498
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,680
Yes.

499
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,350
I understood, Aunt Xia.

500
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,680
I came all the way here

501
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,590
and found your residence
exquisite and extraordinary.

502
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,920
The household of an imperial censor
has opened my eyes.

503
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,830
Miss Zhi.

504
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,880
I have heard a lot about you.

505
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Mr. Sun, you're flattering me.

506
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,240
The Hua Family no longer
has an imperial censor.

507
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,680
We are now just commoners.

508
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,000
Miss Zhi, you are being modest.

509
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,680
I have prepared some tea.

510
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,680
Mr. Sun, please have a seat.

511
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,240
Okay.

512
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,550
Jin'e.

513
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,440
How old

514
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,640
is that Mr. Sun?

515
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,310
How come he has not married yet?

516
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,160
Sun Xiang has such a large business

517
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,240
that many people in the Imperial Capital
want to get in with him.

518
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,440
Over the years,

519
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,030
Sun Xiang has not been married.

520
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,270
Openly and in secret,
many people have sent

521
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,070
their daughters

522
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,160
to him.

523
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,590
That was

524
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,400
what I heard.

525
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,920
Maybe he is not a marriageable man.

526
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,790
Rubbish can also be coated
in gold and jade.

527
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,240
Who knows?

528
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,880
To people,
he is an eligible bachelor anyway.

529
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,310
If someday

530
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,830
we can own a dozen of shops

531
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,640
in the Imperial Capital

532
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,160
just like Sun Xiang,

533
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,440
that would be great.

534
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,350
Jin'e.

535
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,590
Step by step, and we'll get there.

536
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,750
Yuniang.

537
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,590
Let me tell you,

538
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,680
Mr. Sun coming here today

539
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,440
is definitely not just for business.

540
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,160
Our Hua Family's daughters now

541
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,070
are as sought-after as glowing coals.

542
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,310
I've already received
at least 30 betrothal letters

543
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,350
just for Ling alone.

544
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,790
I think

545
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,000
Mr. Sun also came here

546
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,720
to see our family's daughters.

547
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,000
Tomorrow,

548
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,720
I will have someone pack separately

549
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,350
the samples
of the three different grades

550
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,790
and send them over to Zhiming Restaurant

551
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,480
for you to taste.

552
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,440
Really appreciate it, Mr. Sun.

553
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,440
When it comes to tea,

554
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,720
we are inexperienced.

555
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,510
So we will need your further guidance.

556
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,550
That won't be a problem.

557
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,160
Then...

558
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,350
I'll take my leave.

559
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,790
Please allow me to see you out.

560
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,550
You've got many things to do.

561
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,680
I don't want to bother you.

562
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,110
Miss Yingchun can walk me out.

563
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,000
I was surprised

564
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,200
you even knew Yingchun.

565
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,880
Everyone who has dined

566
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:35,960
at Zhiming Restaurant

567
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,720
knows Yingchun's big name.

568
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,550
Then I shall see you out, Mr. Sun.

569
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,590
Good.

570
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,310
I'll take my leave.

571
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,510
Please, miss.

572
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,000
Have you ever been with someone?

573
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,960
I never thought you

574
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,550
also had an interest in match-making.

575
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,880
But I don't need that.

576
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,160
Don't you want to know

577
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,550
which family's son I'm talking about?

578
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,720
Sorry.

579
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:16,880
It's okay.

580
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
You don't have to worry.

581
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,070
You aren't hurt, right?

582
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,920
Lady Qin,
you should accompany your mother

583
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,790
in the inner yard.

584
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,350
How did you end up here?

585
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,640
It's fine.

586
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,070
I will pick these up.

587
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,350
I won't trouble you, Yingchun.

588
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,160
Yingchun is busy all day long

589
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,830
helping Zhi.

590
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,680
I wouldn't dare trouble her.

591
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,720
Thank you, Mister.

592
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,720
Mr. Sun.

593
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,480
The main gate is right ahead.

594
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,640
I'll accompany you a bit further.

595
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,750
Okay.

596
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:05,960
Lady Qin.

597
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,830
I was quite surprised.

598
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,310
What you did was really an eye-opener.

599
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,790
Yingchun, you are Zhi's good help,

600
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,590
so you must have seen much more
than I ever have.

601
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,030
I spend all day in the house

602
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,000
and never go outside.

603
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,000
How would I be capable

604
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,640
of opening your eyes?

605
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,270
The first thing I learned from Lady Zhi

606
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,830
is that we cannot daydream

607
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,000
about relying on men.

608
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,350
I thought you had a bad mood today.

609
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,440
It turns out you've taken a liking

610
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,720
to that Mr. Sun, huh?

611
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,110
In this world,

612
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,830
few men are sincere

613
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:36,920
like Bai Mingxia.

614
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,640
And also few women

615
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,830
are as innocent as Fudong.

616
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,920
If you ask me,

617
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,000
since you are so smart

618
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,200
and know so many things about business,

619
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,400
Sun Xiang

620
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,200
might not be willing
to share his shops with you.

621
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,510
Very well.

622
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,920
I just wanted to marry a good man

623
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,830
just like Fudong did

624
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,310
and I had no interest in that Sun Xiang.

625
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,550
But I didn't expect that

626
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,110
an unpleasant pheasant all dressed up
would come out of nowhere.

627
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,590
You...

628
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,400
Then now I'm quite curious

629
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,240
about this Sun Xiang.

630
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,640
You are nothing but a maid.

631
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,110
How dare you speak to me like this?

632
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,310
And you are

633
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,640
just a daughter of a maid.

634
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,510
You...

635
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,550
Who upsets you this time,

636
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,750
Miss Zhi?

637
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,440
Since Fudong got married,

638
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,070
all the girls at home
are eager to get married.

639
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,350
Nothing can hold them back.

640
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,000
It's natural
they want to get married at their age.

641
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,310
Why bother stopping them?

642
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,030
They will blame you if you do that.

643
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,750
That's easy for you to say.

644
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,350
Not exactly.

645
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,590
If anyone ever

646
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:37,750
dares to ask for your hand in marriage,

647
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,750
I'll make sure
he won't survive another day.

648
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,680
Gu Yanxi.

649
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,310
I think

650
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,680
you're getting more and more brazen.

651
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,510
What?

652
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,680
You still want to wield a machete

653
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,000
and tear up
someone's betrothal document?

654
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,880
That was a misunderstanding.

655
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,750
I won.

656
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,790
Be a man of your word.

657
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,270
No way.

658
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:18,790
Come over here.

659
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,160
No.

660
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,640
Come here.

661
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,240
Don't dodge.

662
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,270
Stop it.

663
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,920
It's fine.

664
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,200
They are not broken.

665
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,750
You...

666
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,270
You...

667
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,590
Young man,

668
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,790
we meet again.

669
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,680
Yanxi.

670
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
You came, Yanxi.

671
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,030
This is my brother.

672
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,200
Yanxi.

673
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:00,960
This is my friend,

674
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,160
Shen Huan.

675
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,160
I have something to do today.

676
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,070
I'll take my leave.

677
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,400
Wait.

678
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,400
Mr. Shen Huan, can you find time?

679
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,070
Perhaps we can go somewhere else
for a small talk.

680
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,240
Small talk...

681
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:21,960
Yanxi.

682
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,350
What does it mean?

683
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,400
It's nothing.

684
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,160
I'd like to invite him for a meal.

685
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,400
A meal?

686
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,270
Then take me with you.

687
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,440
We can go together.

688
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,110
Here.

689
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,110
Yanxi.

690
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,920
Thanks, Yanxi.

691
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,920
Yanxi.

692
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,480
Mr. Shen Huan,

693
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,480
how did you get to know Shaoyao?

694
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,440
We were fooling around on the street.

695
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,310
That was my fault.

696
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,640
I shouldn't have teased her.

697
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:39,750
Yanxi.

698
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,960
He's a good person.

699
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,000
Shaoyao.

700
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
Enjoy your food.

701
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,110
I will have a little chat with him.

702
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,680
So what kind of work

703
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,030
do you do for a living?

704
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,240
Nothing proper.

705
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,550
How many fingers are here?

706
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,750
Three.

707
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,510
How many dishes are there on the table?

708
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,830
Eight.

709
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,400
What do you think of Shaoyao?

710
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,720
Shaoyao.

711
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,030
She's very cute.

712
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,720
I'm very happy

713
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,440
being her friend.

714
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,680
Shaoyao has no parents.

715
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
And I, as her brother,

716
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,480
have no fixed abode.

717
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,960
Mr. Shen Huan,

718
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,480
you came from a prominent family.

719
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,270
How come you befriend Shaoyao?

720
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,070
I really haven't

721
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,030
thought about this question.

722
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,110
Shaoyao's different from other girls.

723
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,200
You should be very aware.

724
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:46,510
She likes being with you.

725
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,960
I am okay with that.

726
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,590
But if you ever upset her,

727
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,000
there will be serious consequences.

728
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,240
Shaoyao.

729
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,590
I will show you a trick,

730
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,240
alright?

731
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,550
That's amazing, Yanxi.

732
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,270
Can you do this again?

733
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,240
I want a broken bowl.

734
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,110
Next time.

735
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,640
Let's eat.

736
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,440
Okay.

737
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,750
Sir.

738
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,720
The important documents
found in Lord Xian's Mansion

739
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,030
are all here.

740
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:43,830
Count them first.

741
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,480
Make a list.

742
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,030
Then I will report to His Majesty.

743
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,400
Yes.

744
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,350
Stop pacing back and forth.

745
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,030
You're making me anxious.

746
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,350
I thought

747
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,070
Lord Xian was in his prime.

748
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,680
Who knew he lost his power

749
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,270
in the blink of an eye.

750
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,830
Our father's move

751
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,440
turned out to be a wrong bet.

752
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,000
We are so unlucky.

753
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,790
We wanted to be in-laws
with the Hua Family,

754
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,160
and their home got raided.

755
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,110
We wanted Lord Xian as a backer,

756
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,270
and now he is a spent force.

757
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,160
I'm afraid the thing about Lord Xian

758
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,030
won't be settled peacefully.

759
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,550
Sooner or later,
they will find out we were involved.

760
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,350
I heard His Majesty
has ordered the Security Bureau

761
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,240
to investigate
the remnants of Lord Xian's faction.

762
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,400
Before they come to us,

763
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,440
we still have some time to deal with it.

764
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Who else can we rely on?

765
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,750
Shaoyao is different from other girls.

766
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,750
You should be very aware.

767
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,200
She likes being with you.

768
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,400
I am okay with that.

769
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,310
"Shaoyao likes being with you."

770
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,440
"I am okay with that."

771
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,640
"I am okay with that."

772
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,030
Did he say that?

773
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
He really said that?

774
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,830
"I am okay with that."

775
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,480
Father.

776
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,270
Mother.

777
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,310
Are you waiting for me?

778
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:29,960
Huan.

779
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,400
There is something important

780
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,590
that I want to congratulate you on.

781
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,790
Huan.

782
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,160
Do you know the Transport Commissioner
of the Six Routes, Jiang?

783
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,270
He is in charge of canal transport.

784
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,750
It means his family is prominent.

785
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,480
His wife

786
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,750
has a son and a daughter.

787
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,270
Now they are traveling north by boat

788
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,880
on the way here to visit relatives.

789
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:48,830
Actually,

790
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,720
visiting relatives doesn't come first.

791
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,750
To secure a good marriage

792
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
for their daughter and son

793
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,720
is their main purpose
for coming to the Imperial Capital.

794
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,640
Their eldest daughter, Miss Jiang,
will show up

795
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,590
at the flower viewing festival
at the end of the month.

796
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,830
I've heard

797
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,880
that she's blessed with stunning beauty.

798
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,880
I won't go.

799
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,550
Huan.

800
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,240
Don't you love appreciating flowers?

801
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,310
Just take it as a flower viewing event.

802
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,310
And you can get to know her a little.

803
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,880
It's not a bad thing anyway.

804
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,310
Mother.

805
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,640
It's such a good opportunity.

806
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,880
Let Shen Qi go.

807
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,830
He is a bit older than me,

808
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,790
so he should be the one

809
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,240
to meet the miss.

810
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,270
He still has to prepare for his exams

811
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,480
and doesn't have time for that.

812
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,590
And all day long,

813
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,880
all you do is idling and frolicking.

814
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,510
It's better for you
to settle down sooner.

815
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,240
Mother.

816
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,680
Mother.

817
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,880
I really don't have time to go.

818
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,200
I've been very busy lately.

819
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,830
With what?

820
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,240
With fooling around

821
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,070
with that silly girl

822
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,400
whose background is unknown.

823
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,480
She...

824
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,590
She is not a silly girl whose background

825
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,350
is unknown.

826
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,640
Answer me.

827
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,240
Are you going or not?

828
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,240
No.

829
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,000
Huan.

830
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,070
Do you still remember
the Hua Family at its prime time?

831
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,840
A family boasting four
successful jinshi candidates.

832
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,550
They had xianggong, sheren,

833
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,190
and even a noble title.

834
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,230
But once they lost the Emperor's favor,

835
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,440
they also lost everything in an instant.

836
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,510
Our family...

837
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:18,800
Our family now

838
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,190
is also in a precarious situation.

839
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,670
The slightest mistake

840
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,150
might lead us to end up like them.

841
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,710
Father.

842
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,510
Mother.

843
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,920
Has something happened to our family?

844
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,230
Huan.

845
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,480
It's a long story.

846
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,710
I can only tell you

847
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,920
if

848
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,920
you do what we said

849
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,920
to meet

850
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,920
that Miss Jiang

851
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,760
and she takes a liking to you,

852
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,920
it will be a stroke of fortune
for our family.

853
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,630
Mr. Sun.

854
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,960
I've checked

855
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,710
the quality of that batch of tea.

856
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,590
It's passable.

857
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,150
But you are asking

858
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
for a three-year-long contract.

859
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,070
Isn't it too early for that?

860
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,400
Miss Zhi.

861
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,000
If three years is too long for you,

862
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,110
you can tell me what you think is proper

863
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,190
and we'll discuss it further.

864
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,670
Everything is negotiable.

865
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,960
Why don't I see Yingchun?

866
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,190
She went to the docks for me

867
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,550
to check on
the newly purchased ingredients.

868
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,960
Yingchun is so capable.

869
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,400
That is because she learned

870
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,510
from the best.

871
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:33,840
Miss Zhi.

872
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:34,840
I do have something

873
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,590
that I want to ask you about.

874
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,400
But it may be a bit presumptuous.

875
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,800
Just go ahead.

876
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,710
The...

877
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,760
I heard Miss Qin is a child
born by a concubine.

878
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,070
I wonder she is being raised

879
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,150
by which Madam?

880
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,510
Mr. Sun.

881
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,590
I am discussing tea with you,

882
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,590
but you're totally drifting off-topic.

883
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,320
You keep asking
about the girls in my family

884
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,480
one after another.

885
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,320
Are you now coming to my restaurant

886
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,070
to pick up your favorites on the menu?

887
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,230
So picky and choosy?

888
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,670
Miss Zhi.

889
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,280
Don't get me wrong.

890
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,480
This is absolutely not the case.

891
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,440
Please forgive

892
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,280
my impudence.

893
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,070
Say no more.

894
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:01,800
Baoxia.

895
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,440
See him out.

896
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
Mr. Sun.

897
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,400
Please.

898
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,710
Cut the mushrooms first.

899
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,400
And this lettuce.

900
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,590
Yingchun.

901
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,710
Young Lady, what's the matter?

902
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,960
Sun Xiang

903
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,510
just came by.

904
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,000
Put the matters here aside first.

905
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,030
I'll give you three days

906
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,400
to look into this man.

907
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,880
Why?

908
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,110
It requires a lot of money

909
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,630
to purchase his fine tea.

910
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,190
We need to know
what kind of person he is

911
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,230
before we can decide.

912
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,000
That makes sense.

913
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:42,880
His business.

914
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,150
The affairs of his household.

915
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,070
We need to know

916
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,670
if any of that
matches exactly what he says.

917
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,440
No problem, Young Lady.

918
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,840
What took you...

919
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,320
What took you so long?

920
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,510
Last time,

921
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,360
after the chess fell on the ground,

922
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,400
I searched for so long,

923
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,630
but still couldn't find that pawn.

924
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,800
How do we play without a pawn?

925
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,190
Shaoyao.

926
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:47,670
I'm afraid

927
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,670
I can't hang out

928
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,480
with you every day like before.

929
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,590
Why?

930
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,150
My parents won't let me see you.

931
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,230
So

932
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,030
I can't come here to find you anymore

933
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,630
and you can't

934
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,190
come find me at Zhi's place.

935
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:03,920
Right?

936
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,590
Well,

937
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,800
are we still going shrimp fishing today?

938
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,030
I'm sorry.

939
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,000
Shaoyao.

940
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,510
Alright then, I'm leaving.

941
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,550
If you are going to come to me,

942
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,550
climb over the wall.

943
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,670
But you must be careful.

944
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,550
Shen Huan.

945
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,880
Goodbye.

946
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,800
Shao...

947
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,110
Shen Huan.

948
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:32,920
You zone out frequently.

949
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,150
What's on your mind?

950
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,190
It's nothing.

951
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,000
Standing among these beautiful flowers,

952
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,030
yet you seem to be in a low spirit.

953
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,840
Shen Huan.

954
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,070
Meet my sister.

955
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,630
Mr. Shen.

956
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,360
Nice to meet you, miss.

957
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,440
I have an old friend

958
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,030
over there.

959
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,070
I must go and greet him.

960
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,230
Shen Huan, please accompany my sister.

961
00:39:59,110 --> 00:39:59,840
Jiang...

962
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,480
What do you usually like
to play, Mr. Shen?

963
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,550
I like

964
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,590
elephant chess.

965
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,280
That's a surprise.

966
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,480
I thought

967
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,670
it would be something
like reading or composing poems.

968
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,190
I'm not good at reading

969
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,960
or composing poems.

970
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,440
I like embroidering on the fan surface
in my spare time.

971
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:33,670
That's quite beautiful.

972
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,760
You embroider really well.

973
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,360
You are at the perfect age for studying.

974
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,880
Why not try
to attend the imperial examination?

975
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,550
My brother prefers studying,

976
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,230
but I don't like it as much.

977
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:47,000
That's really a pity.

978
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,510
There are many books

979
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:49,840
in my home in Jinyang.

980
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,960
Classics, History
Masters, and Literature.

981
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,230
Just the books

982
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
of the Masters category alone
take up an entire floor.

983
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,400
Really?

984
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,440
I am interested in the Masters category,

985
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,920
especially those books about

986
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,320
farming,

987
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,110
medicine making,

988
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:00,760
winemaking,

989
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,110
and beverages.

990
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,230
I usually make my own beverages.

991
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,550
Do people like us

992
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,150
need to make beverages ourselves?

993
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,800
You should focus

994
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,320
on the Classics and History categories.

995
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,800
This would be more beneficial
for your career.

996
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:15,920
Moreover,

997
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,960
my father will certainly help you

998
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,920
with all his might.

999
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,400
By the way,

1000
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,760
the cosmetics of the Imperial Capital

1001
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,400
seem not as good as those from Hangzhou.

1002
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,230
As for the brow powder,

1003
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,070
they each have their own strengths.

1004
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:45,840
Mr. Shen.

1005
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,030
Has Shen Huan already

1006
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,670
given his heart to someone?

1007
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,550
How could it be?

1008
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,550
My son somewhat doesn't
live up to our expectations,

1009
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,800
but he has also never lingered

1010
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,070
in those bawdyhouses.

1011
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,110
Even to such a flower viewing event

1012
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,030
with ladies' participation,

1013
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,630
it's his first time to attend.

1014
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:03,070
He's just a bit too shy.

1015
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,550
Please drink some tea.

1016
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,280
What did that Miss Jiang

1017
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,550
talk with you about?

1018
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,230
She said

1019
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,190
the brow powder in the Imperial Capital
was particularly good,

1020
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,760
but she didn't know where to buy it.

1021
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,070
Her family oversees the canal transport.

1022
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,400
All the rarities

1023
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,670
from all over the country

1024
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,840
have to go through them.

1025
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,510
If so,

1026
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,110
why did she need my help

1027
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,840
to find the brow powder?

1028
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:41,920
It seems

1029
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,110
your presentable appearance
was of some use.

1030
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,230
She has taken a fancy to you.

1031
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,550
Seize the opportunity.

1032
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,150
Buy the brow powder

1033
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,400
and deliver it to her.

1034
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,360
Did you hear that?

1035
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,400
Flower hairpins! Pearl hairpins!

1036
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,150
Flower hairpins! Pearl hairpins!

1037
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:03,630
This one is...

1038
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,590
This one is quite good.

1039
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,480
I'll have this one.

1040
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:06,960
Okay.

1041
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,150
Flower hairpins! Pearl hairpins!

1042
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,590
Miss.

1043
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,590
Madam.

1044
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:14,630
Which are the most popular?

1045
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,760
Please show me.

1046
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,030
This one.

1047
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,320
And this one.

1048
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,000
Miss, you seem unfamiliar.

1049
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,590
Do you also live nearby?

1050
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:23,880
Yes.

1051
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,590
My family has just moved in over there.

1052
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,110
Our Ladies and Madams want
to buy some flower-shaped hairpins

1053
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,000
but haven't found a reliable seller yet.
