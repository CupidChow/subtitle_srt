[Episode 10]

25
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,500
I hear that Hua Zhi's girls

26
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,300
get better paied than the others.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,300
I

28
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,500
have nothing to do anyway.

29
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,580
I can share some of the workload,

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,300
so we can worry less.

31
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,220
Madam Hua,

32
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,100
what do you say?

33
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,500
Before,

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,740
for this kind of inside job,

35
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,860
I'd cut your hands

36
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,740
and throw you out.

37
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,740
Madam, please don't kick me out!

38
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,180
I really won't do it again!

Who else is in your family?

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,460
She coughs phlegm all the time.

42
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,500
There're only my mom

43
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,140
and great-aunt at home.

44
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,060

make money by doing others' laundry,

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,260
There's no need to say more.

48
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,860
How much money did you send home
every month?

49
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,780
Including medicine costs,

50
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,260
Five hundred coins.

Chanlu, I used to like her.

52
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,020
I gave her to your mother.

53

I failed to train her well.

54
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,740
Now she did something wrong.

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,900

59
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,660
Within this year,

60
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,060
take five-hundred from my allowance
every month,

61
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,460
and send to her mother.

62
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,780

71
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,540
I only get five-hundred.

73
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,860
to me.

74
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,380
Take a look.

75
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,100
What...

76
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,540
She only get five-hundred coins as well?

77
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,500
Yes.

78
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,420
Indeed, I should get more,

79
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,700
As I now am taking care of
everything in this family.

80
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,620
I should get an extra payment

81
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,940
like you did before.

82
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,420
From now on,

83
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,860
I'll get five-hundred more each month.

84
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,860
Alright, I'm tired.

85
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,180

Madam Xia,

89
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,180
what did Madam Hua say?

90
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,780
Your daughter

91
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,540
really has her mind fixed on money.

92
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,100
Do you know why your Aunt Xia

93
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,820
made such a scene?

94
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,300
In the past, she

95
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,060
handled huge sums money every month.

96
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,180
But now, our family

97
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,500
doesn't have much money left.

98
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,060
I really don't understand

99
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,980
what is she still trying so hard to get.

100
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,980
Your mother's family

101
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,180
is a noble one with an official rank,

102
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
your Aunt Qi and Aunt Wu

103
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,780
are both daughters of officials.

104
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,940
Only her father

105
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,100
is a merchant.

106
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,740
So you think a merchant's daughter

107
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,900
is shallower than the others?

108
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,220
I don't think so.

109
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,380
Your Aunt Xia and her husband
don’t get along.

110
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,380
They fought all the time.

111
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,580
All these years,

112
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,260
things haven't been easy for her.

113
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,460
This daughter-in-law of mine,

114
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,820
she came from lower family,

115
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,460
but she's born ambitious

116
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,660
and proud.

117
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,180
Also, she truly is

118
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,700
smart and talented.

119
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,940
Otherwise,

120
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,100
why do you think I like her?

121
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
Only for her sweet talks?

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,780
The life as a domestic woman

123
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,980
is long and tasteless.

124
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,980
Only being in charge of the whole family

125
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,220
gave her something to do,
something to strive for.

126
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,900
It brought her the confidence

127
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,860
to hold her head high in front of
her sister-in-laws,

128
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,540
also makes those servants

129
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,500
dare not secretly

130
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,220
gossip about her background.

131
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,820
Grandmother,

132
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,700
I used to only feel

133
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,020
that she's annoying

134
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,700
and laughable.

135
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,860
I didn't know

136
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,580
that she's actually pitiable.

137
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,980
Who is it?

138
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,580
You awful girl.

139
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,740
What do you want?

140
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,740
I want to ask you a favor.

141
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,580
You're so capable

142
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,660
that no one can compete with you.

143
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,180
How can I possibly help you?

144
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,780
Aunt Xia,

145
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,580
last night

146
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,700
I went over the accounts all night,

147
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,620
but they just wouldn’t balance.

148
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,420
You?

149
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,340
You can't balance the accounts?

150
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,620
I have already reported it
to Grandmother,

151
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,900
and she scolded me.

152
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,740
She tole me to show it to you.

153
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,140
She also said

154
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,500
if there are more accounts like this,

155
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,220
I should let you go through them first.

156
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,460
Yingchun

157
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,980
has never managed such tasks after all.

158
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,780
We need your help and advice.

159
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,380
Yes,

160
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,260
I need your guidance.

161
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,500
The princess consort commanded me

162
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,580
to bring you something to eat.

163
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,660
If she doesn't want it,

164
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,580
let's eat it.

165
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,780
Quickly, move!

166
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,620
She won't tell on us, will she?

167
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,100
If she knows how to do that,
people wouldn't call her silly.

168
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:37,980
That's true.

169
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,220
Come on, try one.

170
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,260
Is it good?

171
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,380
What happened ten years ago...

172
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,260
What exactly happened?

173
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,660
This, this...

174
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,340
Master Dong.

175
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:49,980
Good.

176
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,300
This old fellow

177
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
is becoming more and more strange.

178
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,740
Spending all day alone,

179
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,500
muttering to himself.

180
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,420
It's quite creepy.

181
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,380
Exactly.

182
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,100
I can't remember it clearly...

183
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:14,980
Shaoyao,

184
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,660
Shaoyao!

185
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,220
Come, come, come,

186
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,140
come over here.

187
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:20,980
Come on.

188
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,140
Children don't memorize things,

189
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,060
and when one gets old,

190
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,540
he can't recall anything either.

191
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,740
I remember now!

192
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,500
Sir,

193
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,860
Dong Da is dead.

194
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,260
Rattle-drum,

195
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,940
have a look!

196
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,860
Miss,

197
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,940
look at this!

198
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,260
This is good.

199
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,820
Slow down.

200
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,820
Miss, look at this!

201
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,820
These are all the fashionable patterns.

202
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,500
Miss,

203
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,460
please take a look,

204
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,540
see,

205
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,540
Get one, please!

206
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:50,900
Wait for me!

207
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,220
Do you have a coin?

208
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,740
Please...

209
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,900
Young lady,

210
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,820
spare me a coin, please!

211
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,140
How could you steal from a beggar?

212
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,180
How could you!

213
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,540
Let me tell you something.

214
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,140
I recently created

215
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:31,740
something new,

216
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,460
called Icy-Camomile.

217
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,220
Summer hasn't even started yet.

218
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,100
Who would want cold food right now?

219
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,780
Exactly.

220
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,700
I was just thinking

221
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,620
to get it ready.

222
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,700
When summer comes,

223
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,660
we can...

224
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,340
The other day,

225
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,820
did you go to Mr. Song's place

226
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,780
to watch the fire puppet?

227
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,980
I think I saw you there.

228
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,820
Shen,

229
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,140
would you like anything else?

230
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,140
No, thanks.

231
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,860
I'm full too

232
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,420
Let's go.

233
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:54,820
Shall we?

234
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,220
Let's go.

235
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:55,900
Let's go.

236
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,140
Mr. Shen,

237
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,860
please wait a moment.

238
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,380
Mr. Shen,

239
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,700
It's eighty coins in total.

240
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,540
Put it on my brother's tab.

241
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,020
Put it

242
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
on my brother's tab.

243
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,780
on my brother's tab.

244
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,740
Here you go.

245
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,740
Baoxia,

246
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,940
eat first.

247
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:29,700
I'll do the work.

248
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,260
Okay.

249
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:30,940
Go.

250
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,220
Mother, Mother,

251
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,220
I want to this!

252
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,260
How much?

253
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,980
Three coins each.

254
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,540
Good.

255
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,140
Thank you.

256
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,460
Thanks.

257
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,260
Dad, I want to that!

258
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,620
Hurry up, let's go.

259
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,260
These are called candied balls.

260
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,700
They're sweet with a bit of sourness.

261
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,820
Do you want to try some?

262
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,340
Is it tasty, girl?

263
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:10,900
Slow down.

264
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,500
Hey,

265
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:19,980
you...

266
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,900
Why are you sitting here?

267
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,660
Get up.

268
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:22,980
Let's go.

269
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,740
Does it taste good?

270
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,540
Come on,

271
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,540
have some more if you like it.

272
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,660
Miss, you've had two.

273
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,580
That'll be six coins in total.

274
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,100
Stop!

275
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,380
You have to pay!

276
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,260
Put it on my brother's tab.

277
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,180
Hold on a moment.

278
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,220
Your brother?

279
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,220
Where is he?

280
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:01,940
Who is he?

281
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,060
You look like

282
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,900
a girl from a decent family.

283
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,980
How come you eat

284
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,740
without paying?

285
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,740
What's your name?

286
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,660
My name is Shaoyao.

287
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,380
Is that even a real name?

288
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,020
Baoxia.

289
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,780
It's alright.

290
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Judging from this wound,

291
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,540
what killed him should be as fine
as a strand of spider silk.

292
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,700
I think he was killed in one strike.

293
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,580
I'm afraid the murderer
is good at martial arts.

294
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,380
Sir,

295
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,700
your sister

296
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,860
is gone missing.

297
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,820
I can't believe this.

298
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,060
Bringing home a kitten or a puppy
is acceptable.

299
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,860
But Hua Zhi, you actually
brought home a full-grown person.

300
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,340
Look, it's going to get dark soon.

301
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
And we can't get her talk.

302
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,060
We can’t just leave her

303
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,180
there on the street, can we?

304
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
Don't be afraid.

305
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,620
My family are all good people.

306
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,660
You can stay here for the night.

307
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,940
Tomorrow, I'll take you
to look for your family.

308
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,460
Is that okay?

309
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,580
But I have a huge family.

310
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,820
You might have to squeeze in

311
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:29,860
Hua Zhi,

312
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,700
I, I've lost my money!

313
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,700
Where is my money?

314
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,340
Are you a fool?

315
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,900
It's right here.

316
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,780
Stop chasing, stop!

317
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,380
It's too dangerous!

318
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,260
Come on, let's count.

319
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,020
I want to know how much we made today.

320
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,300
Boli,

321
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,220
Boli,

322
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,820
time to eat!

323
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,220
Mother

324
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,060
are you tired?

325
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:08,820
I'll do it.

326
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,700
No.

327
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:11,900
Look at your hands.

328
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,740
They're so soft and delicate.

329
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,220
Go spend time with your scripts.

330
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,780
I'll wait for you to finish,

331
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,580
then we go together.

332
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,380
Let me try it!

333
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,460
You two,

334
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,140
it's time to eat.

335
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,420
Let's go, let's go.

336
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,340
Shaoyao,

337
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,540
what happened?

338
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,180
Who is this?

339
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,220
This, this place

340
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,820
is...

341
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,940
It's really nice.

342
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,740
Alright.

343
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,780
I'm glad you like it here.

344
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,260
I'm five years old.

345
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,100
How old are you?

346
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,460
Seventeen.

347
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,940
She's a big girl.

348
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,420
How come Hua Zhi just
brought her home like that?

349
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,540
Here you go.

350
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,700
You can feed the chickens.

351
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,020
No one from her family
is looking for her?

352
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,980
Madam Qi,

353
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,260
we waited until nightfall,

354
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,380
but no one came looking for her.

355
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,100
So I asked her

356
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,980
where does she live,

357
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,180
but look at her.

358
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,060
I thought I couldn't just leave her

359
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,860
out on the street.

360
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,540
What if she really has an elder brother?

361
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,940
He might come looking for her tomorrow.

362
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,540
Poor thing.

363
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,540
Madam,

364
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,140
It's time to eat.

365
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,180
Ttime to eat.

366
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,380
Come on, Duo.

367
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,580
Time to eat, stop feeding

368
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,060
Shaoyao,

369
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,380
come on.

370
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,340
Let's eat.

371
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,140
Let's go, time to eat.

372
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,260
Didn't Grandmother get better
a few days ago?

373
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,180
Why has she started coughing again?

374
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,260
The weather has been
changing rapidly these days.

375
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,500
So she got ill again.

376
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,820
We've already called for a doctor.

377
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,900
Give me back my book!

378
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,900
No!

379
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,500
Let me take a look!

380
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,340
How did the chicks get out?

381
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,740
- Give me back!
- Tale of Mountain and Sea...

382
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,500
I've borrowed it!

383
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,180
I want to read it!

384
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,420
Stop it, stop it!

385
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,580
It's time to eat,

386
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,460
come on, hurry and sit down.

387
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,220
Huilan,

388
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,460
It's time to eat.

389
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,420
Come on.

390
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,340
Why aren't you going in?

391
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,260
I...

392
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,780
How do you usually eat?

393
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,500
I eat inside the house.

394
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,740
Alone?

395
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,060
Try this.

396
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,220
Do you want this?

397
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,340
It's tasty, isn't it?

398
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,900
Who are they?

399
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,020
They're all my family.

400
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,420
This is really good.

401
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,220
This is delicious!

402
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,980
Eat this.

403
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,060
This is tasty.

404
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,140
Can family

405
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,060
have meals together now?

406
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:29,980
Even if they're not family members,

407
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,980
we can still eat together.

408
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:31,620
Aren't you about to

409
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,660
Join us for a meal?

410
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,500
Let's go.

411
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,220
Come on, let's eat.

412
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Come, eat.

413
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:38,940
I'll get you some rice.

414
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,100
- Here.
- Thank you, Aunt Xia.

415
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,500
Here you go,

416
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,700
chopsticks.

417
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,380
Come.

418
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,500
Try this.

419
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:50,820
And this.

420
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,300
You can have as much as you want.

421
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,540
Go on.

422
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,500
Let's eat.

423
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,060
Have some more.

424
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,260
How is she?

425
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,060
This is a prescription.

426
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,620
Madam Hua has a deficiency of lungs.

427
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,220
To eradicate it,

428
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,660
we need time.

429
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:00,980
No.

430
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,460
No, no...

431
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
This won't work.

432
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,420
Silly girl,

433
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,460
what are you talking about?

434
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,100
Sir,

435
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,980
Please ignore her.

436
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,340
This,

437
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,780
replace it with flos farfarae,

438
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,820
mulberry root bark,

439
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:15,900
and platycodon root.

440
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:17,900
Shaoyao,

441
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:18,940
you know pharmacology?

442
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
Flos farfarae,

443
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,100
mulberry root bark,

444
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,060
and platycodon root...

445
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,260
That's a remedy created by
the former imperial physician,

446
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
called Nine-Immortals Powder.

447
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,220
A good prescription indeed.

448
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,060
With your sugession,

449
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,580
it'll surely work better

450
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,460
than my own formula.

451
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,340
Truly amazing!

452
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,180
This girl hasn't even

453
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,940
met Madam Hua yet.

454
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,660
How did she do it?

455
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,500
I heard.

456
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,380
You heard her coughing,

457
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,020
Right?

458
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,300
Sir,

459
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,780
do you think

460
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,980
this prescription is
what Grandmother needs?

461
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:55,740
Yes. Just get all the ingredients

462
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,780
based on

463
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,500
her prescription.

464
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,820
Baoxia,

465
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,420
go back to the city with the doctor.

466
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,340
Take this prescription,

467
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,180
and get three doses from the pharmacy.

468
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,380
Sir.

469
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,060
Hua Zhi,

470
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,460
you brought home a genius!

471
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,940
You've memorized the portrait,
haven't you?

472
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,860
You must find her.

473
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,620
Yes, Sir!

474
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,620
Oh dear,

475
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,620
where in the world are you?

476
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,900
I can't hear it anymore.

477
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,660
Grandmother has stopped coughing.

478
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
You're truly amazing.

479
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,660
Where on earth

480
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,740
did you learn to do that?

481
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,940
From books.

482
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,140
I can read.

483
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,580
Are your father

484
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,620
a doctor too?

485
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,340
Like the one you met just now?

486
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,620
Is there anyone else

487
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,180
in your family,

488
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,100
apart from your brother?

489
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,580
The ones who bring me food.

490
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,060
And a cat,

491
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,500
running around.

492
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:19,980
It was sick. I cured it.

493
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,060
Do you know

494
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,100
where your home is?

495
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,620
A courtyard,

496
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,940
so small.

497
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,500
No chickens,

498
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,620
nor ducklings.

499
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:38,700
Let's go.

500
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,980
Time to sleep.

501
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,500
What's the matter?

502
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,980
I'm so happy today.

503
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,060
I don't want to go to sleep.

504
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,900
Don't worry.

505
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,980
I promise you,

506
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,460
tomorrow will be just as good.

507
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,460
Let's go.

508
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:20,860
Did you find her?

509
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,180
Sir,

510
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,500
we didn't find anything.

511
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,820
Same here.

512
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,340
We didn't find her either.

513
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,700
Sir,

514
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,340
should we go out of town next?

515
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,900
Of course!

516
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,540
The commander didn't sleep all night.

517
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,740
If we can't find her,

518
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,540
we'll die.

519
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,500
Yes, Sir!

520
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,340
I'll have one.

521
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,220
Come back for more if you like it.

522
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:54,940
Alright.

523
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,580
If you wear this,

524
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,100
how is your brother going to find you?

525
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,620
Do you want to be like Yingchun,

526
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,500
selling berries?

527
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,780
Come on, five coins each.

528
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,820
Two for ten.

529
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,820
What is this?

530
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,900
This is called candied-ball.

531
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,180
Sour, sweet, and tasty,
particularly delicious.

532
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,460
Have a try!

533
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,860
candy-ball,

534
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,900
tasty.

535
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,060
Then, how much is this?

536
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,060
Five coins.

537
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,700
It is five!

538
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,340
Then let's have one.

539
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,300
Alright, madam.

540
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:30,820
Here,

541
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,340
here you go.

542
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,660
Shaoyao, you did really good.

543
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:35,940
Good job.

544
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,940
Go sell another.

545
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,900
Mom, I want this.

546
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,500
Candy-ball, five coins.

547
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,260
Delicious.

548
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:42,780
Thank you.

549
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,300
Five coins.

550
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,020
Candy-ball,

551
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,260
delicious, five...

552
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,620
Brother!

553
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,060
Shaoyao,

554
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,100
where have you been all night?

555
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,020
I...

556
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,940
I went to their place.
They have a big yard

557
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,660
with chicks and ducklings!

558
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,060
Thank you for looking after Shaoyao.

559
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,220
How much is this?

560
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,500
Five coins.

561
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,140
Shaoyao...

562
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,780
Five coins!

563
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,340
I'll have one.

564
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,260
Here you go.

565
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,860
One for me.

566
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,100
So, you are her brother?

567
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,540
I didn't expect this either.

568
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,100
Shaoyao is actually with you.

569
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,900
Anything new recently?

570
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,540
No.

571
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,820
I can apologize to you.

572
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,220
But you have to tell me

573
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,500
how I have upset you.

574
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,820
Your sister is special.

575
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,380
You shouldn't have

576
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,420
let her wander around alone.

577
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,820
My bad.

578
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,900
This almost led to a big mistake.

579
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,100
Even my chicks and ducklings

580
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,180
have friends for company.

581
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,460
They run freely every day.

582
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,380
Shaoyao's life
isn't even as good as theirs.

583
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,860
It's my fault.

584
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,580
This is your family matter.

585
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,660
I really shouldn't have interfered.

586
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,620
But this time, thanks to you.

587
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,140
Are you the same with Shaoyao?

588
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,860
She hasn't even seen a family

589
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,860
eating together.

590
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,300
The two of you

591
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,460
shouldn't live like this.

592
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,580
So this is what you're like
when you're angry.

593
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,340
She must have eaten
a lot of your berries, right?

594
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,860
It's okay.

595
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,860
It's just a few coins.

596
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,020
But Shaoyao,

597
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,020
at such a young age,

598
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,340
she's actually a master of pharmacology.

599
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,900
Last night,

600
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,220
she nearly cured
my grandmother's coughing

601
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:27,940
in just one night.

602
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,460
She is now the savior

603
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,340
of my entire family!

604
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,540
You can really cure people?

605
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,340
Yes, I can.

606
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,820
Thank you.

607
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,100
Brother,
why hasn't your scar healed yet?

608
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,460
Have you taken any medicine?

609
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,420
Alright, Shaoyao,

610
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,500
let's head home.

611
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:42,940
Thank Hua Zhi.

612
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,580
Thank you, Hua Zhi.

613
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,900
Go home.

614
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,100
Let's go.

615
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:54,740
Hua Zhi,

616
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,500
bad news!

617
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,820
Our berries

618
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,500
and the lanterns,

619
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,780
have all been copied!

620
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,340
Come with me.

621
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,260
Tell me,

622
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,860
how did you get out?

623
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,740
I wanted to see you.

624
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,780
The door was open, so I came out.

625
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,820
Then how did you meet her?

626
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,100
Who?

627
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,460
Hua Zhi.

628
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,740
Did she come to you?

629
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,780
Or did you find her?

630
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,300
Did she say something to you

631
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,220
before taking you to her place?

632
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,860
I was on the street.

633
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,460
There were so many people.

634
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,140
And then,

635
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,340
there was a big peach.

636
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,260
and a big cat-head.

637
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,620
That red berries

638
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,620
were so delicious.

639
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,100
Six coins.

640
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,660
And then,

641
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,540
she asked me where do I live.

642
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,140
Later she took me

643
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,420
to a very large courtyard,

644
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,820
with chicks and ducklings.

645
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:53,580
And...

646
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,700
They were

647
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,980
a family.

648
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,300
It seems she really doesn't know

649
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,060
who we are.

650
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,540
It's okay now.

651
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,100
Let's go home.

652
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:11,980
What's wrong?

653
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,100
Brother,

654
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,020
are you going to lock me up again?

655
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:17,500
No.

656
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,380
Next time,

657
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,980
I'll take you out.

658
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,620
We can go wherever you want.

659
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,660
Let's go.

660
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:40,980
What's wrong?

661
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,580
Even my chicks and ducklings

662
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,460
have friends for company.

663
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,700
They're running freely every day.

664
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,580
Shaoyao's life
isn't even as good as theirs.

665
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
The two of you

666
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,620
shouldn't live like this.

667
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,140
Shaoyao,

668
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,580
you're not going back.

669
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:15,500
Really...

670
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,580
But you must remember,

671
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,180
don't tell anyone your surname is Gu,

672
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,780
especially Hua Zhi.

673
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,100
If she knows,

674
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,700
she'll never offer you
that delicious red berry again.

675
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,220
So, my surname is Gu?

676
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,260
Let's go.

677
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,900
Why did you come back?

678
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,660
I have a favor to ask.

679
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,900
Sure, anything.

680
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,660
Can Shaoyao

681
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,780
stay a few more says at your place?

682
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Of course, she can.

683
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,340
But why?

684
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,860
Before, when I wasn't in the city,

685
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,100
she's always alone,

686
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:48,780
locked up at home.

687
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,700
Now, I have returned,

688
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,940
but I'm still never at home.

689
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,180
You were right.

690
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,500
This kind of life

691
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,660
shouldn't continue.

692
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,940
My house is full of young girls.

693
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,620
My mother and aunties
will take care of her.

694
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,540
She'll be safe with us.

695
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,500
She can stay as long as she wants.

696
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,340
I don't know how I can thank you enough.

697
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,780
Take care!

698
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,580
For my sister's food and lodging,

699
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,660
three-hundred per month.

700
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,380
Is that alright?

701
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,420
Yes, that's fine.

702
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,260
Are you really taking that?

703
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,180
It's not even enough!

704
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,740
As her elder brother,

705
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,220
don't you forget about her.

706
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,260
When you have time,

707
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,020
come and spend time with Shaoyao.

708
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,140
Okay.

709
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,700
For such a big favor,

710
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,820
I really don't know how to repay you.

711
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,620
If there's anything I can help with,

712
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,340
Please let me know.

713
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,540
If you really want to help,

714
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,020
are you free right now?

715
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,540
Yeah.

716
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,260
Since you have said so,

717
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,260
you're not leaving.

718
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,260
Yingchun, Baoxia,

719
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,420
I'll leave the stall in your hands.

720
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,380
- Sure.
- Alright.

721
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:38,820
Let's go.

722
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,860
Are you tired?

723
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,580
I'm fine.

724
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,060
I could handle two more carts.

725
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,260
This is the last batch of berries.

726
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,380
For the next batch,

727
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,500
we'll have to wait until autumn.

728
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,620
Look at you.

729
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,660
Doing this heavy work,

730
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,980
and you look so happy about it.

731
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,540
I don't always receive

732
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,700
simple tasks like this.

733
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,140
It does make me feel refreshed.

734
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,700
It's getting late.

735
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:22,660
Let's head back.

736
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,580
At this hour,

737
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,740
dinner should be ready at home.

738
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,820
Come home with us.

739
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,260
Sure.

740
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,020
Shaoyao,

741
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,180
let's go home.

742
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,020
Don't look at me. Watch the road.

743
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,700
It was sunny just a moment ago.

744
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,460
And suddenly, here is the rain.

745
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,060
Isn't life just like this,

746
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,340
ever-changing?

747
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,060
Yesterday, Shaoyao came here

748
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:32,980
and said this place is nice.

749
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,020
Today, when I took her out
to sell berries,

750
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,100
she kept looking back.

751
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,980
She didn't want to leave.

752
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,620
I asked her why.

753
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,940
Guess what she said?

754
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,260
What?

755
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,860
She said she want her brother

756
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,820
to take a look at this place too.

757
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,460
This place is indeed very nice.

758
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,180
You and Shaoyao,

759
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,340
you haven't seen each other
for a long time, have you?

760
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,380
Ten years.

761
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,540
I was in the North.

762
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,580
Now my father and brother are there too,

763
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:01,900
also my grandfather.

764
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,420
He's over sixty.

765
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:05,660
I don't know

766
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,100
if he can survive the coldness.

767
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,500
The good people
are protected by the universe.

768
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,260
When I was in the North,

769
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,260
I always said that to myself.

770
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,220
Sadly, now,

771
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,140
these are only words I have

772
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,780
to comfort you.

773
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,980
Am I

774
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,060
causing you inconvenience?

775
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,020
For the sake of Kong Fang,

776
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,980
not very inconvenient.

777
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,220
Fu Dong is getting the food ready.

778
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,540
Dinner will be served in a moment.

779
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,260
Good.

780
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,540
Yingzhen,

781
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,420
Hua Zhi

782
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,980
and that young man,

783
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,980
is there a history between them?

784
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,220
Is that why she brought his sister home?

785
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,820
And now they are chatting outside.

786
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,500
Aren't you going to have a look?

787
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
I don't think so.

788
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,180
Zhi doesn't understand those things.

789
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,940
Come here for a moment, Shaoyao.

790
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:01,900
Come on.

791
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,700
Sit down.

792
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:09,740
Shaoyao,

793
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,580
what does your brother do

794
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,700
For a living?

795
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:21,860
Brother.

796
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,660
See you tomorrow.

797
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:25,700
Go home.

798
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,700
See you tomorrow.

799
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:28,980
Let's go.

800
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,420
Sir,

801
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,140
You're amazing.

802
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,700
How did you know he would be here?

803
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,140
I took a guess.

804
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,660
Really?

805
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,020
I knew someone was following me
earlier today.

806
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,380
Right after Dong Da died,
they set their sights on Shaoyao.

807
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,220
This must have something to do

808
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,180
with the fire back then.

809
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,300
Take him back.

810
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:39,820
Yes, Sir.

811
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,100
Wait a minute.

812
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,580
Blades?

813
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,580
Search him,

814
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,780
look for threads.

815
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,940
There's more than one assassin.

816
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,420
Go back.

817
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,420
We're a step too late.

818
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,780
That man fled into the manor!

819
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,740
Search it.

820
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,220
The pastry newly made by Fudong,

821
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,140
do you like it?

822
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,700
I like it.

823
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,140
Hua Zhi!

824
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,340
- Hua Zhi!
- Hua Zhi!

825
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,220
Don't, please!

826
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:49,980
Hua Zhi!

827
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:00,620
Hua Zhi!

828
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,660
One more step forward,

829
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,060
her head will fall to the ground.

830
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,020
Zhi!

831
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,780
Please don't hurt her,

832
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,180
please!

833
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,020
Hua Zhi!

834
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:11,860
Let go of her!

835
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,500
Sir,

836
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,900
just tell me what you want.

837
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,260
Sir,

838
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,780
Sir, please let her go

839
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:19,860
and take me instead.

840
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,740
She is young.

841
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,820
Let her go,

842
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,980
let her go!

843
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,380
Madam!

844
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,180
Mother, go to your room!

845
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,740
Hua Zhi!

846
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,500
Madam Hua!

847
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,300
Let her go!

848
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,220
We'll give you anything you want.

849
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,380
Everyone, shut your mouths

850
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,100
and make way.

851
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,260
Mister,

852
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,540
you might not know

853
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,820
that the Security Bureau
never cares about human lives,

854
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,100
especially the lives of sinners like me!

855
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:39,980
My life is worthless to them.

856
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:40,940
Having me as a hostage

857
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,900
will do you no good!

858
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,300
You do have a good sense
of self-awareness.

859
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,540
If this crossbow of mine

860
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,860
is fully drawn,

861
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,940
not to mention a woman,

862
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,060
even an ox or a horse

863
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,060
could be pierced through.

864
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,500
No, please no!

865
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,380
Stop!

866
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,220
Don't,

867
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:05,900
Don't do it!

868
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,060
Not to mention her,

869
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,500
even if you strangle everyone here

870
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,020
to death,

871
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,380
I wouldn't let you go.

872
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,180
Hua Zhi!

873
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:17,500
The day your mansion was confiscated,

874
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,780
you cooperated well.

875
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,860
Now, I suggest you do the same,

876
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,940
just do nothing and wait for death.

877
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,260
Move,

878
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,020
don't get in the way.

879
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,220
Is he trying to save my life?

880
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,380
I am now

881
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,420
killing you both.

882
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,340
You can keep each other company.

883
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:31,900
Take the body with us.

884
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,140
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

885
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:42,900
Wait!

886
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,860
Thank you, sir,

887
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,580
for saving my family.

888
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,540
You should thank yourself.

889
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,140
Let's go.

890
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,740
- Hua Zhi!
- Hua Zhi...

891
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,740
Zhi!

892
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,020
Are you alright?

893
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,220
Hua Zhi, are you okay?
