<font size="20">This is Minister Hua's study.</font>

313
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:14,880
<font size="20">Shall we confiscate the things in here?</font>

314
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,080
<font size="20">His Majesty's own words,</font>

315
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,520
<font size="20">get all writings and letters
authored by Hua Yizheng,</font>

316
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,320
<font size="20">leave not a single word.</font>

317
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,400
<font size="20">Yes, Sir!</font>

318
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,520
<font size="20">Search this place.</font>

319
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,080
<font size="20">Move aside, don't get in the way!</font>

320
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,040
<font size="20">It's her.</font>

321
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,560
<font size="20">Why aren't you crying?</font>

322
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
<font size="20">And why don't you run?</font>

323
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
<font size="20">The Emperor owns the world.</font>

324
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,040
<font size="20">What's the use of crying?</font>

325
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,880
<font size="20">And where could I run to?</font>

326
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,040
<font size="20">Yes,</font>

327
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,520
<font size="20">you have nowhere to go.</font>

328
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,240
<font size="20">Wipe it off,</font>

329
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,960
<font size="20">don't dirty my things.</font>

330
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,320
<font size="20">Is this your place?</font>

331
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,920
<font size="20">It belongs to my family.</font>

332
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,240
<font size="20">I borrowed it
for calculations and to read stars.</font>

333
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,440
<font size="20">You can read stars?</font>

334
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
<font size="20">Then how come you didn't foresee</font>

335
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,160
<font size="20">this great disaster of your family?</font>

336
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,320
<font size="20">People are foolish.</font>

337
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,960
<font size="20">They do not know
what goes around comes around.</font>

338
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,840
<font size="20">The lifespan of mortals,</font>

339
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,360
<font size="20">compare with the sun, moon, and stars,</font>

340
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,200
<font size="20">is like dust to the ocean.</font>

341
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,880
<font size="20">The emperor sits high above.</font>

342
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,400
<font size="20">He will not show pity to the Hua family,</font>

343
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,360
<font size="20">and the stars will not, for one person,</font>

344
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,960
<font size="20">or the downfall of a clan, a nation,</font>

345
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,320
<font size="20">show any abnormalities.</font>

346
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,440
<font size="20">So, you have accepted your fate?</font>

347
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,640
<font size="20">It's good.</font>

348
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,000
<font size="20">Without all the wishful thinking,</font>

349
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,520
<font size="20">there will be no disappointment.</font>

350
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,440
<font size="20">I do not accept my fate.</font>

351
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
<font size="20">If there truly is a mandate from heaven,</font>

352
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,000
<font size="20">grandfather wouldn't have been charged.</font>

353
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,360
<font size="20">He wanted to be an honest official,</font>

354
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
<font size="20">not to deceive the people,</font>

355
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,840
<font size="20">nor the emperor.</font>

356
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,560
<font size="20">You all know that he's innocent.</font>

357
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,880
<font size="20">And yet, why was he convicted?</font>

358
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,680
<font size="20">Sir,</font>

359
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,960
<font size="20">It's done.</font>

360
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
<font size="20">All suspicious books and papers</font>

361
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,600
<font size="20">have been collected.</font>

362
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,560
<font size="20">Good.</font>

363
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,160
<font size="20">Take her.</font>

364
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,160
<font size="20">Yes, Sir.</font>

370
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,240
<font size="20">There are a few left here.</font>

371
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,160

<font size="20">What was bestowed by the royal family</font>

412
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,400
<font size="20">isn't a part of the confiscation, right?</font>

413
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,760
<font size="20">There is a manor granted by
the Empress Dowager,</font>

<font size="20">Eh... Are you sure?</font>

418
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
<font size="20">The order was to seize their property.</font>

419
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
<font size="20">Was it you who received the order,</font>

420
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,920
<font size="20">or was it me?</font>

421
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,720
<font size="20">Yes, Sir.</font>

you're already busy with work</font>

472
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,640
<font size="20">yet still made great efforts in writing.</font>

473
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,240
<font size="20">When retirement comes,</font>

474
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,840
