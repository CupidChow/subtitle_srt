00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,060
<font size="20">The truth is, a cousin of mine</font>

00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,660

<font size="20">yesterday,</font>

56
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,140
<font size="20">I bribed him</font>

57
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,020
<font size="20">and asked him to inquire.</font>

58
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,380
<font size="20">How did it go?</font>

59
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,820
<font size="20">His Majesty has made up his mind.</font>

60
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,980
<font size="20">I had already anticipated this.</font>

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,020
<font size="20">But thank you anyway.</font>

00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,900
<font size="20">Your great kindness</font>

63
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,620
<font size="20">will be remembered by the Hua family.</font>

64
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,780
<font size="20">You're welcome, Madam Hua.</font>

65
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,140
<font size="20">There is one more thing</font>

66
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,220
<font size="20">that I would like to say</font>

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,260
<font size="20">and ask you not to take offense to.</font>

68
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,460
<font size="20">Speak freely.</font>

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,020
<font size="20">With our master imprisoned,</font>

70
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,100
<font size="20">your family
has lost the means of livelihood.</font>

71
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,340
<font size="20">How will you manage in the future?</font>

72
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,300
<font size="20">Indeed, we have no way out now.</font>

73
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,380
<font size="20">Madam Xia, worry not.</font>

74
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,940
<font size="20">We are all disciples of the master,</font>

75
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,980
<font size="20">no different from his sons or nephews.</font>

76
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,500
<font size="20">Yesterday, I, Shen, Yu,</font>

77
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,300
<font size="20">and other fellow disciples</font>

78
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,980
<font size="20">discussed this matter.</font>

79
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,900
<font size="20">The urgent matter is to have a man</font>

80
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,420
<font size="20">who can stand up for you</font>

81
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,500
<font size="20">and handle external affairs.</font>

82
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,460
<font size="20">You are right.</font>

83
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,900
<font size="20">Now,</font>

84
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,260
<font size="20">you still possess wealth.</font>

85
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,260
<font size="20">But merely living</font>

86
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,220
<font size="20">with it is not a solution.</font>

87
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,460
<font size="20">In my humble opinion, buying land</font>

88
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,980
<font size="20">and gathering tenant farmers
is the long-term plan.</font>

89
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,700
<font size="20">To maintain</font>

90
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,900
<font size="20">a middle-class household,</font>

91
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,180
<font size="20">at least 15 mu of land are needed.</font>

92
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,300
<font size="20">Also, you need to rent a house</font>

93
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,180
<font size="20">with a few courtyards in the city</font>

94
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,500
<font size="20">to accommodate the entire family.</font>

95
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,260
<font size="20">You can't live in such a place.</font>

96
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,140
<font size="20">That's too little.</font>

97
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,100
<font size="20">It requires at least 35 mu.</font>

98
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,100
<font size="20">Even that's not enough.</font>

99
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,740
<font size="20">I wonder</font>

100
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,900
<font size="20">how much silver one mu of land costs.</font>

101
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,700
<font size="20">Yesterday, we did a calculation</font>

102
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,420
<font size="20">of the total cost.</font>

103
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,940
<font size="20">I wonder if the matriarch is in.</font>

104
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,020
<font size="20">Why not invite her
to discuss this together?</font>

105
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,060
<font size="20">My sister-in-law
doesn't understand these matters.</font>

106
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,180
<font size="20">I am the one who manages the household.</font>

107
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:03,900
<font size="20">Madam Xia,</font>

108
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,340
<font size="20">in my opinion,</font>

109
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,700
<font size="20">you should buy the land first.</font>

110
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,500
<font size="20">Once that's settled,</font>

111
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,500
<font size="20">you can go to the city
to take care of the housing.</font>

112
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,220
<font size="20">Hua Zhi,</font>

113
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,220
<font size="20">I don't have much cash
on hand right now.</font>

114
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,460
<font size="20">I can only buy this much.</font>

115
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,420
<font size="20">In a few days,</font>

116
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,500
<font size="20">I'll bring more to you.</font>

117
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,580
<font size="20">Thank you very much.</font>

118
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,660
<font size="20">We shall consider this aid.</font>

119
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,060
<font size="20">We owe you a favor.</font>

120
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,140
<font size="20">It won't be necessary in the future.</font>

121
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:29,900
<font size="20">It's no bother.</font>

122
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,660
<font size="20">Our two families are supposed to...</font>

123
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,700
<font size="20">to...</font>

124
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,100
<font size="20">On that day, I had prepared
the betrothal letter,</font>

125
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,580
<font size="20">just waiting for my grandpa to return</font>

126
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,500
<font size="20">to visit your family.</font>

127
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,620
<font size="20">But as soon as he came back,</font>

128
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,940
<font size="20">he burned the betrothal letter.</font>

129
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,300
<font size="20">That's when I learned
about what happened.</font>

130
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,460
<font size="20">What's past is in the past.</font>

131
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,100
<font size="20">Now is not the time
to talk about these things.</font>

132
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,340
<font size="20">Let me do it.</font>

133
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,460
<font size="20">Allow me.</font>

134
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,700
<font size="20">What are you doing?</font>

135
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,380
<font size="20">Zhi,</font>

136
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,700
<font size="20">we are saved.</font>

137
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,140
<font size="20">Grandpa can come back?</font>

138
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,620
<font size="20">Thanks to your grandpa's</font>

139
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,100
<font size="20">benevolent students.</font>

140
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,340
<font size="20">They are willing</font>

141
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,900
<font size="20">to come forward to rent a house for us.</font>

142
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,180
<font size="20">It won't be long before</font>

143
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,940
<font size="20">we can</font>

144
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,140
<font size="20">move back into town.</font>

145
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,100
<font size="20">We should spend only what we have.</font>

146
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,180
<font size="20">They're what you've managed to bring out</font>

147
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,700
<font size="20">with much difficulty.</font>

148
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,500
<font size="20">Are you pawning all of them?</font>

149
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,820
<font size="20">These are all just worldly possessions.</font>

150
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,700
<font size="20">Besides,</font>

151
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,340
<font size="20">we have already discussed it.</font>

152
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,220
<font size="20">For the time being,</font>

153
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,060
<font size="20">we'll endure it.</font>

154
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,220
<font size="20">We won't buy any clothes,</font>

155
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,380
<font size="20">bedding, or servants</font>

156
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,540
<font size="20">for now.</font>

157
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,660
<font size="20">We need to save money</font>

158
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,540
<font size="20">to quickly buy land and a house.</font>

159
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,220
<font size="20">Mother,</font>

160
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,660
<font size="20">have you put your things in there too?</font>

161
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,620
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

162
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,820
<font size="20">Jin'e is right.</font>

163
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,220
<font size="20">We, the women and children,</font>

164
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,180
<font size="20">possess only wealth.</font>

165
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,540
<font size="20">If we don't quickly convert it
into a house and some farmland,</font>

166
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,980
<font size="20">we will eventually be unable to keep it.</font>

167
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,460
<font size="20">It might</font>

168
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,020
<font size="20">even bring disaster.</font>

169
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,940
<font size="20">That's right.</font>

170
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,300
<font size="20">When we sleep at night,</font>

171
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,340
<font size="20">the maids' feet</font>

172
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,020
<font size="20">are almost</font>

173
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,100
<font size="20">over my head.</font>

174
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,340
<font size="20">This place is too small.</font>

175
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,020
<font size="20">Right.</font>

176
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,060
<font size="20">I can pawn to exchange money to buy land</font>

177
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,620
<font size="20">and rent a house as well.</font>

178
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,580
<font size="20">Why entrust it</font>

179
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,500
<font size="20">to them?</font>

180
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,420
<font size="20">Don't speak nonsense.</font>

181
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,380
<font size="20">How can you, an unmarried girl,</font>

182
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,780
<font size="20">haggle over prices</font>

183
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,060
<font size="20">with those merchants?</font>

184
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,700
<font size="20">Don't mind her.</font>

185
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
<font size="20">Everything is here.</font>

186
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,060
<font size="20">It's only half the required amount.</font>

187
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,900
<font size="20">What should we do?</font>

188
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,460
<font size="20">I also have some here.</font>

189
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,100
<font size="20">Having promised you,</font>

190
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,020
<font size="20">I must go all out.</font>

191
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,180
<font size="20">I must do it</font>

192
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:58,980
<font size="20">anyway.</font>

193
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,260
<font size="20">I will find a way</font>

194
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,660
<font size="20">to make up for the missing money.</font>

195
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,740
<font size="20">Letting you have</font>

196
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,980
<font size="20">a place to settle is the most important.</font>

197
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,740
<font size="20">This is not a small amount.</font>

198
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,820
<font size="20">Ladies,</font>

199
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,620
<font size="20">I, Chen, swear to heaven</font>

200
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,580
<font size="20">not to take a single penny
of this wealth.</font>

201
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,980
<font size="20">If I handle it alone,</font>

202
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,100
<font size="20">I'm afraid you will worry.</font>

203
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,580
<font size="20">It's better to have</font>

204
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,140
<font size="20">a supervisor.</font>

205
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:17,980
<font size="20">Chen,</font>

206
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,940
<font size="20">though my family is poor,</font>

207
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,940
<font size="20">I am willing to offer
what little help I can.</font>

208
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,140
<font size="20">If you don't mind,</font>

209
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,780
<font size="20">I will take on the role of supervisor.</font>

210
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,060
<font size="20">I, too, will not take a single penny.</font>

211
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,420
<font size="20">Or perhaps I...</font>

212
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,060
<font size="20">Shen,</font>

213
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,020
<font size="20">your grandpa and father</font>

214
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,340
<font size="20">are officials, as Master Hua was.</font>

215
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,780
<font size="20">It is better for you
to stay out of this.</font>

216
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,100
<font size="20">If a supervisor is needed,</font>

217
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,420
<font size="20">it should be someone
from the Hua family.</font>

218
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:36,980
<font size="20">The elders are planning this.</font>

219
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,580
<font size="20">You shouldn't interrupt, little girl.</font>

220
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,420
<font size="20">We women</font>

221
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,540
<font size="20">know nothing
about buying land or a house.</font>

222
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,420
<font size="20">Do we?</font>

223
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,180
<font size="20">You all are men of noble character.</font>

224
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,860
<font size="20">You've helped without any reason.</font>

225
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,660
<font size="20">We are eternally grateful.</font>

226
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,540
<font size="20">Mother,</font>

227
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,300
<font size="20">yesterday, we were talking</font>

228
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,380
<font size="20">about how to find a man</font>

229
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,740
<font size="20">to support the family.</font>

230
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,580
<font size="20">And today,</font>

231
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
<font size="20">three suitable men have come at once.</font>

232
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,100
<font size="20">It's truly the slivering of the cloud.</font>

233
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,460
<font size="20">and misfortune is turning to fortune.</font>

234
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,460
<font size="20">Mister Chen.</font>

235
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,780
<font size="20">Yes, ma'am?</font>

236
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,260
<font size="20">I have a personal matter to ask you.</font>

237
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,940
<font size="20">You are quite handsome</font>

238
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,220
<font size="20">and have a kind heart.</font>

239
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,820
<font size="20">I wonder if you're married.</font>

240
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,580
<font size="20">I am ashamed</font>

241
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,860
<font size="20">that I'm not married.</font>

242
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,700
<font size="20">Good.</font>

243
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,060
<font size="20">Good.</font>

244
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,300
<font size="20">Really good.</font>

245
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,540
<font size="20">Ma'am?</font>

246
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,100
<font size="20">Thank you.</font>

247
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,660
<font size="20">Take care.</font>

248
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,020
<font size="20">Take care.</font>

249
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,860
<font size="20">Mr. Zhong,</font>

250
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,580
<font size="20">you go follow them.</font>

251
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,380
<font size="20">What are you doing?</font>

252
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,460
<font size="20">I still have to study.</font>

253
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,260
<font size="20">What do you think</font>

254
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,300
<font size="20">of your grandpa's students?</font>

255
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,140
<font size="20">Why say such frivolous words</font>

256
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,140
<font size="20">out loud?</font>

257
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,900
<font size="20">It's dirtied my ears.</font>

258
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,900
<font size="20">You foolish girl.</font>

259
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,540
<font size="20">My eyes</font>

260
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,060
<font size="20">have been tempered.</font>

261
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,500
<font size="20">I've seen Chen Zhi.</font>

262
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,300
<font size="20">He carries himself with the air
of wealth and nobility.</font>

263
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,380
<font size="20">And he looks good.</font>

264
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,220
<font size="20">At critical moments,
he can take on responsibilities.</font>

265
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,860
<font size="20">His character is impeccable.</font>

266
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,020
<font size="20">I'll strike while the iron is hot</font>

267
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,740
<font size="20">to make him my son-in-law</font>

268
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,180
<font size="20">so that he can get our family</font>

269
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,100
<font size="20">out of this pit of fire.</font>

270
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,140
<font size="20">I won't marry him.</font>

271
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,980
<font size="20">What do you know?</font>

272
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,740
<font size="20">Your grandma said</font>

273
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,300
<font size="20">if a son-in-law is taken in,</font>

274
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,580
<font size="20">the family business
will be entrusted to him</font>

275
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,020
<font size="20">to let him support the household.</font>

276
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,100
<font size="20">By then, you and I</font>

277
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,020
<font size="20">will be the ones
in charge of the household.</font>

278
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,140
<font size="20">If you take a fancy to him,</font>

279
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
<font size="20">you can marry him.</font>

280
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,940
<font size="20">You foolish girl!</font>

281
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,180
<font size="20">Come back to me!</font>

282
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,500
<font size="20">[Forever Prosperity and Stability]</font>

283
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,860
<font size="20">Miss, take a look at this.</font>

284
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,540
<font size="20">It might suit you well.</font>

285
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,020
<font size="20">The material is all top-notch.</font>

286
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,540
<font size="20">Thank you, Chen.</font>

287
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,860
<font size="20">What's with the formalities?</font>

288
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,620
<font size="20">I almost forgot</font>

289
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,340
<font size="20">that you almost became</font>

290
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,260
<font size="20">Miss Hua's husband.</font>

291
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,020
<font size="20">Chen,</font>

292
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,300
<font size="20">this matter is no joke.</font>

293
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,980
<font size="20">It concerns Shen's future.</font>

294
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,740
<font size="20">Never mention it again in the future.</font>

295
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,140
<font size="20">It doesn't matter.</font>

296
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,980
<font size="20">Fate plays with people.</font>

297
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,260
<font size="20">Rest assured.
I have a sense of propriety.</font>

298
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,540
<font size="20">Shen,</font>

299
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,660
<font size="20">you should hurry back home.</font>

300
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,220
<font size="20">Yu and I will turn these into money</font>

301
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,740
<font size="20">and return the cart to you tomorrow.</font>

302
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,660
<font size="20">Alright.</font>

303
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,940
<font size="20">I followed them the entire day.</font>

304
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,380
<font size="20">I saw it with my own eyes</font>

305
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,500
<font size="20">that the man named Yu</font>

306
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,020
<font size="20">delivered a cart full of goods</font>

307
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,540
<font size="20">into the pawnshop.</font>

308
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,580
<font size="20">And then the one</font>

309
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,780
<font size="20">named Chen went back home.</font>

310
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,340
<font size="20">Thank you, Mr. Zhong.</font>

311
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,260
<font size="20">But you'll have to continue
following them tomorrow.</font>

312
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:12,980
<font size="20">Okay.</font>

313
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,980
<font size="20">Get some rest early.</font>

314
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,500
<font size="20">Take care.</font>

315
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,420
<font size="20">The food sent by Mister Shen</font>

316
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,740
<font size="20">will all be consumed by tomorrow.</font>

317
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:23,900
<font size="20">I wonder</font>

318
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,180
<font size="20">whether he will send it again</font>

319
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,380
<font size="20">in the morning or in the evening.</font>

320
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,260
<font size="20">Concubine Qin,</font>

321
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,340
<font size="20">you have a discerning palate,</font>

322
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,620
<font size="20">always picking the tastiest one.</font>

323
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,300
<font size="20">Where is the tasty one anyway?</font>

324
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,900
<font size="20">It's all coarse food from the street.</font>

325
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,100
<font size="20">Even peddlers and footmen
can afford to eat it.</font>

326
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,820
<font size="20">I wonder</font>

327
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,180
<font size="20">where the snack chef</font>

328
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,020
<font size="20">from Pingjiang,</font>

332
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,500
<font size="20">what are you doing here?</font>

333
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,700
<font size="20">Have some hot porridge to warm up.</font>

334
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,540
<font size="20">Have you had any?</font>

335
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:53,860
<font size="20">I'm not hungry.</font>

336
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,460
<font size="20">Miss, please eat more.</font>

337

<font size="20">you put your belongings in there too,</font>

339
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,180
<font size="20">did you?</font>

340
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,060
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

341
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,500
<font size="20">That little bit of money I have</font>

342
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,620
<font size="20">isn't of much use anyway.</font>

343
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,940

346
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,460

<font size="20">The place for daily affairs</font>

380

<font size="20">Do you know why?</font>

468
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,380
<font size="20">Back then,</font>

469
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,660
<font size="20">it was Qi Ruhai and I who personally</font>

470
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,700
<font size="20">dealt with that matter.</font>

471
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,700
<font size="20">Now, I'm the only one left in the bureau</font>

472
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,500
<font size="20">who knows about it.</font>

473
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,420
<font size="20">In the eighth year of Chengtian,</font>

474
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,620
<font size="20">my maternal family plotted a rebellion.</font>

475
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,300
<font size="20">His Majesty didn't want</font>

476
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,460
<font size="20">to implicate too many people's lives.</font>

477
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,300
<font size="20">So he kept it a secret.</font>

478
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,220
<font size="20">Thus, my mother</font>

479
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,820
<font size="20">and many officials were saved.</font>

480
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,500
<font size="20">Since His Majesty
has raised me by his side,</font>

481
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,780
<font size="20">I have known this since I was a child.</font>

482

<font size="20">Deputy Commander Yuan,</font>

483
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,860

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,100
<font size="20">you actually stooped to such stupidity.</font>

487
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,420
<font size="20">You've underestimated
His Majesty too much.</font>

488
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,020
<font size="20">And you've underestimated me too.</font>

489
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,700
<font size="20">I'm afraid you're not up</font>

490

<font size="20">to this job anymore.</font>

491
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,740

<font size="20">as his right-hand man.</font>

508
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,660
<font size="20">He was beaten to death</font>

509
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,420
<font size="20">because the previous day,</font>

510
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,660
<font size="20">Deputy Commander Yuan
made a secret complaint to His Majesty,</font>

511

<font size="20">exposing his conspiracy against me.</font>

512
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,460
<font size="20">Yuan was confident in his favors for me.</font>

513
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,820
<font size="20">Little did he know that the favors</font>

514
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,060
<font size="20">came from His Majesty,</font>

515
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,380
<font size="20">not him.</font>

516
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,420
<font size="20">As the commander
is loyal to His Majesty,</font>

517
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,060
<font size="20">the Seven-Star Guards

524
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,180

<font size="20">A dog that bites its master to death</font>

536
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,740

00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,140

<font size="20">over the past few days.</font>

623
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,580
<font size="20">Miss, perhaps
you've remembered incorrectly.</font>

624
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,220
<font size="20">The pawner's name is Chen Zhi.</font>

625
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
<font size="20">Miss, you must be joking with me.</font>

626
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
<font size="20">Mister Chen brought the items that day,</font>

627
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,660
<font size="20">only to store them for half a day.</font>

628
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,020
<font size="20">He took them away the same night.</font>

629
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,140
<font size="20">Mister Chen's family</font>

630
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,860
<font size="20">runs a pawnshop of their own.</font>

631
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,540
<font size="20">Why would they pawn things to me?</font>

632
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,820
<font size="20">It seems I've misremembered.</font>

633
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,580
<font size="20">Could you tell me
how to get to Chen's pawnshop?</font>

634
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,620
<font size="20">It's been two days already.</font>

635
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,860
<font size="20">We haven't heard anything</font>

636
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,140
<font size="20">from Mister Chen.</font>

637
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,780
<font size="20">Mister Shen hasn't sent</font>

638
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,860
<font size="20">any food here either.</font>

639
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,260
<font size="20">Huilan,</font>

640
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,620
<font size="20">what's the rush?</font>

641
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,420
<font size="20">Hasn't that servant</font>

642
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,540
<font size="20">already delivered the pawn ticket</font>

643
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,940
<font size="20">into our mother's hands?</font>

644
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,460
<font size="20">They can't run.</font>

645
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,780
<font size="20">Moreover,</font>

646
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,300
<font size="20">buying land and renting a house
is a serious matter.</font>

647
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,180
<font size="20">You can't just rush into it.</font>

648
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,300
<font size="20">If he were to</font>

649
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,260
<font size="20">bring over the deed immediately,</font>

650
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,820
<font size="20">I would be suspicious of him</font>

651
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:50,860
<font size="20">acting too hastily.</font>

652
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,820
<font size="20">Indeed.</font>

653
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,900
<font size="20">Even if you go to the countryside
to buy a cow,</font>

654
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,020
<font size="20">you still have to be picky,</font>

655
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,900
<font size="20">checking out the teeth and all.</font>

656
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,420
<font size="20">As for Mister Shen,</font>

657
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,220
<font size="20">just don't count on him.</font>

658
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,980
<font size="20">His parents</font>

659
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,820
<font size="20">are all about chasing profits.</font>

660
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,740
<font size="20">Can't you see</font>

661
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,300
<font size="20">he didn't mention
the betrothal matters at all?</font>

662
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:09,300
<font size="20">If this matter can't be settled at once,</font>

<font size="20">Mister Chen</font>

664
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,100
<font size="20">should make another visit</font>

665
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,540

<font size="20">And now you're suspecting Chen Zhi?</font>

669
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,580
<font size="20">That bit of money is still money.</font>

<font size="20">Something strange happened today.</font>

677
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,780
<font size="20">My brother saw the jade pendant</font>

678
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,660
<font size="20">I took off the other day</font>

679
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,780
<font size="20">at your home</font>

680
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,660
<font size="20">at a gambling house today.</font>

681
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,220
<font size="20">Father was so angry
that he wanted to ground me.</font>

682
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,980
<font size="20">I was at a loss for words.</font>

683
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,180
<font size="20">I had a hard time getting out.</font>

684
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,940
<font size="20">Someone lost it in the gambling house.</font>

685
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,780
<font size="20">Yes, indeed.</font>

686
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,180
<font size="20">But Chen</font>

687
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,620
<font size="20">clearly pawned this jade pendant.</font>

688
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,020
<font size="20">I'm afraid their pawnshop</font>

689
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,660
<font size="20">has a thief</font>

690
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,580
<font size="20">who's stealing things out.</font>

691
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,780
<font size="20">I just went to Chen's mansion
to look for him.</font>

692
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,620
<font size="20">But the doorman said he wasn't home.</font>

693
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,740
<font size="20">So I came to check the pawnshop</font>

694
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:03,700
<font size="20">to remind him.</font>

695
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,260
<font size="20">Mister Shen, you go back first,</font>

696
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,820
<font size="20">lest your father get angry again.</font>

<font size="20">Mister Chen has arrived.</font>

700
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,980
<font size="20">What was I saying?</font>

701
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,500
<font size="20">Hurry and fetch our mother.</font>

702
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,740
<font size="20">See?</font>

703
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,620
<font size="20">Greetings, Madam Hua.</font>

704
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,540
<font size="20">I have not shown up for two days.</font>

705
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,100
<font size="20">You must be worried by now.</font>

706
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,420
<font size="20">Not at all.</font>

707

in your handling of affairs.</font>

708
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,540
<font size="20">I am ashamed.</font>

709
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:31,780
<font size="20">How so?</font>

710
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,260
<font size="20">I've been going around these two days
trying to borrow money,</font>

711
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,660
<font size="20">hoping to make up the shortfall</font>

712
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
<font size="20">and quickly get the deed.</font>

713
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,580
<font size="20">But the world is cold.</font>

714
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,780
<font size="20">Although my friends and family helped,</font>

715
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,220
<font size="20">it's still not quite enough.</font>

716
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,020
<font size="20">Since we already have the better part,</font>

717
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,260
<font size="20">we could rent the house first.</font>

718
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,460
<font size="20">As for buying land,</font>

719
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,740
<font size="20">we can plan for it gradually.</font>

720

721
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,820

722
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,740
<font size="20">I have an older friend
who is a great scholar</font>

723
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,620
<font size="20">from the capital.</font>

724
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,300
<font size="20">He heard that the Hua Mansion
has a vast collection of books,</font>

725
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,180
<font size="20">including rare editions,</font>

726

<font size="20">twice the market price for these books.</font>

729
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,020
<font size="20">Consider it a loan for reading.</font>

730
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,740
<font size="20">When you can manage your finances,</font>

731
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,740
<font size="20">redemption is an option again.</font>

732
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,260
<font size="20">I didn't expect that Zhi</font>

733
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,460
<font size="20">would make a good deal</font>

734
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,420
<font size="20">by sheer fluke.</font>

735
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,700
<font size="20">I've found</font>

736
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,220
<font size="20">a large dwelling with four rows.</font>

737
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,300

It's of good quality and inexpensive.</font>

to find such a place again.</font>

<font size="20">Chen Zhi is simply not a good person.</font>

777
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,900
<font size="20">He's squandered</font>

778
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,900
<font size="20">all our money on gambling.</font>

779
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,060
<font size="20">You have no proof.</font>

780
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
<font size="20">Do you have evidence?</font>

781
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,780
<font size="20">This is Shen Qi's jade pendant.</font>

782
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,940
<font size="20">He took it off right here</font>

783
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,540
<font size="20">the other day.</font>

784
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,260
<font size="20">Chen Zhi lost it at the gambling house.</font>

785
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,500
<font size="20">Bet again! Big! Big!</font>

786
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,580
<font size="20">Big! Big! Big!</font>

787
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,580
<font size="20">Don't move.</font>

788
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,420
<font size="20">Who's it?</font>

789
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,740
<font size="20">You are so feeble,</font>

790
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,260
<font size="20">and you dare to commit crimes.</font>

791
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,380
<font size="20">Mister Yu, I will ask you something.</font>

792
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,420
<font size="20">If you answer clearly,</font>

793
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,580
<font size="20">I will let you go immediately.</font>

794
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,220
<font size="20">If you lie to me or hide something,</font>

795
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,500
<font size="20">I will send you to the authority</font>

796
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,780
<font size="20">to strip you of your scholar's title.</font>

797
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,820
<font size="20">I'll talk.</font>

798
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,060
<font size="20">This is Yu Zhengyao's statement.</font>

799
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,340
<font size="20">Chen Zhi threatened Yu Zhengyao</font>

800
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,140
<font size="20">to collude with him</font>

801
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,380
<font size="20">to swindle the wealth of our family.</font>

802
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,060
<font size="20">Yu Zhengyao always borrows money
from Chen Zhi</font>

803
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,820
<font size="20">for living expenses.</font>

804
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,780
<font size="20">So he had no choice but to agree.</font>

805
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,380
<font size="20">[Yu Zhengyao]</font>

806
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,740
<font size="20">That pawnshop belongs
to the Chen family.</font>

807
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,660
<font size="20">And he is the owner.</font>

808
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,220
<font size="20">He merely transferred our money
from one pocket to another.</font>

809
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,020
<font size="20">Someone!</font>

810
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,020
<font size="20">Someone!</font>

811
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,820
<font size="20">Someone!</font>

812
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,940
<font size="20">Quick, go call someone!</font>

813
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,380
<font size="20">Mr. Zhong!</font>

814
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,260
<font size="20">Someone!</font>

815
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,140
<font size="20">- Quick, get someone!
- Mr. Zhong!</font>

816
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,380
<font size="20">Chen Zhi,</font>

817
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,940
<font size="20">aren't you afraid of being sued?</font>

818
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,180
<font size="20">Being sued?</font>

819
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,420
<font size="20">I know where this money</font>

820
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,060
<font size="20">comes from.</font>

821
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,860
<font size="20">You guys</font>

822
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,780
<font size="20">smuggled it out secretly.</font>

823
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,300
<font size="20">I dare to take your wealth.</font>

824
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,620
<font size="20">Dare you report to the authorities?</font>

825
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,860
<font size="20">Beast!</font>

826
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,860
<font size="20">You beast!</font>

827
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,020
<font size="20">Then let's strike a deal.</font>

828
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,420
<font size="20">Leave these books with me.</font>

829
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,300
<font size="20">I don't spit out what I take.</font>

830
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,580
<font size="20">These books can't be sold anyway.</font>

831
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,620
<font size="20">I'll take them back,</font>

832
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,060
<font size="20">burn them all as firewood,</font>

833
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,140
<font size="20">and throw away the ashes.</font>

834
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,420
<font size="20">Even if you report me,
you have no proof.</font>

835
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,100
<font size="20">You lowly wenches!</font>

836
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,780
<font size="20">You should feel lucky
that you're not enslaved</font>

837
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,780
<font size="20">and keep your head down.</font>

838
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,060
<font size="20">Yet you dream of fine clothes and food?</font>

839
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,580
<font size="20">How dare you argue with me?</font>

840
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,780
<font size="20">So, there's no room for discussion.</font>

841
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,380
<font size="20">Get lost!</font>

842
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,380
<font size="20">Zhi!</font>

843
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,500
<font size="20">Zhi!</font>

844
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,740
<font size="20">Is Sir Duan
of the Seven-Star Bureau here?</font>

845
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,420
<font size="20">I have an unexpected merit</font>

846
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,340
<font size="20">to present it to you both.</font>

847
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,500
<font size="20">What merit?</font>

848
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,700
<font size="20">Tell me.</font>

849
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,260
<font size="20">When our house was raided,</font>

850
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,260
<font size="20">we smuggled out.</font>

851
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,380
<font size="20">some gold, silver, and treasures.</font>

852
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,740
<font size="20">Today, I'm here to turn myself in.</font>

853
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,020
<font size="20">Where is that wealth now?</font>

854
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,820
<font size="20">It was stolen by this person</font>

855
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,020
<font size="20">and hidden within his pawnshop.</font>

856
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,500
<font size="20">Sir, it's a misunderstanding.</font>

857
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,620
<font size="20">You also need to come with me.</font>

858
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,180
<font size="20">Wait...</font>

859
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,100
<font size="20">Stop!</font>

860
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,740
<font size="20">Nice strength.</font>

861
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,060
<font size="20">But your skills are not there yet.</font>

862
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,700
<font size="20">Sir.</font>

863
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,300
<font size="20">Sir, wipe off the sweat.</font>

864
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,580
<font size="20">Truly impressive, sir.</font>

865
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,460
<font size="20">Shall we take a break and have some tea?</font>

866
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,780
<font size="20">Still a long way to go.</font>

867
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,460
<font size="20">Back when I was in the North Land,</font>

868
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,380
<font size="20">I had to practice daily</font>

869
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,260
<font size="20">for an hour or two.</font>

870
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,620
<font size="20">Who else will spar with me?</font>

871
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,220
<font size="20">I'll do it.</font>

872
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,580
<font size="20">You're not qualified.</font>

873
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,220
<font size="20">Me.</font>

874
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,580
<font size="20">Report!</font>

00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:07,700
<font size="20">Commander,</font>

876
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,260
<font size="20">when stationed
outside the Zihuang Residence,</font>

877
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,620
<font size="20">we've confiscated a new batch
of the Hua family's property.</font>

878
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:11,940
<font size="20">Where did it come from?</font>

879
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,460
<font size="20">Chen Zhi has been captured</font>

<font size="20">and is locked up in prison.</font>

881
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,660
<font size="20">And Miss Hua has also been captured</font>

882
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,300
<font size="20">and is confined outside,</font>

883
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,780
<font size="20">waiting for your judgment.</font>

00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,780

00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,140
<font size="20">you seem quite happy.</font>

887
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,060
<font size="20">Hand over Chen Zhi
to the government office.</font>

888
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,780
<font size="20">Is that Miss Hua called Hua Zhi?</font>

<font size="20">Yes.</font>

890
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,100
<font size="20">So it is her.</font>

891
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,140
<font size="20">Let her go.</font>

00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,940

907
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,860
<font size="20">Are these books so important?</font>

<font size="20">They might be worthless to you.</font>

909
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,420
<font size="20">But to me, they are extremely important.</font>

910
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,780
<font size="20">Speaking of the initial raid
on the Hua Mansion,</font>

911
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,340
<font size="20">His Majesty had instructed</font>

912
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,860
<font size="20">that the manuscripts of Minister Hua</font>

913
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,420
<font size="20">not get into the public domain.</font>

914
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,540
<font size="20">The Seven-Star Guards
searched thoroughly</font>

915
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,300
<font size="20">and only found some</font>

916
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,700
<font size="20">old works that had been published.</font>

917
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,820
<font size="20">Not a single new word was found.</font>

918
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,620
<font size="20">Isn't that strange to you?</font>

919
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,580
<font size="20">My grandpa is old and frail.</font>

920
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,940
<font size="20">He has long ceased to write.</font>

921
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,220
<font size="20">Presumably, he has no new work,</font>

922
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,340
<font size="20">sir.</font>

923
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,700
<font size="20">So naturally, nothing was found.</font>

924
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,540
<font size="20">So that's how it is.</font>

925
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,140
<font size="20">Then it's not surprising</font>

926
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,540
<font size="20">that their work wasn't meticulous.</font>

927
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,500
<font size="20">Can I have the books back now?</font>

928
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,780
<font size="20">I've been bored lately.</font>

929
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,860
<font size="20">I just want to read some books
to relieve my boredom.</font>

00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,220
<font size="20">is quite good.</font>

932
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,620
<font size="20">(Could it be that he knows?)</font>

933
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,900
<font size="20">Miss Hua, you are truly stingy.</font>

934
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,820
<font size="20">You're not willing to lend me
even a few books.</font>

935
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,140
<font size="20">So be it.</font>

936
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,740
<font size="20">Take your book</font>

937
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,780
<font size="20">and get lost.</font>

938
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,580
<font size="20">Thank you.</font>

939
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,860
<font size="20">This is not the place for you.</font>

940
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,020
<font size="20">You two.</font>

941
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,740
<font size="20">Quickly clear these eyesores of books</font>

942
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,580
<font size="20">away from me.</font>

943
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,100
<font size="20">Send them back</font>

944
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,780
<font size="20">to where you found them.</font>

945
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,580
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

946
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,180
<font size="20">Tell those two cheap 'tools'</font>

947
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,340
<font size="20">that starting today,</font>

948
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,740
<font size="20">they don't have to watch
over the Huas anymore.</font>

949
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,460
<font size="20">Yes.</font>

950
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,180
<font size="20">Who among you still has energy?</font>

951
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,420
<font size="20">Practice with me again.</font>

952
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,060
<font size="20">Sir,</font>

953
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,380
<font size="20">let's do it another day.</font>

954
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,700
<font size="20">I'm out of stamina.</font>

955
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,380
<font size="20">I just heard</font>

956
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,420
<font size="20">that Chen Zhi is locked up in jail.</font>

957
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,340
<font size="20">Bring him to the practice ground for me.</font>

958
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,820
<font size="20">Beast!</font>

959
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,340
<font size="20">What a beast!</font>

960
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,620
<font size="20">It's all my fault.</font>

961
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,580
<font size="20">I shouldn't have rushed to tell you.</font>

962
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,180
<font size="20">Now it's all over.</font>

963
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,380
<font size="20">There's no way out anymore.</font>

964
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,780
<font size="20">They say losing wealth
wards off disasters.</font>

965
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,940
<font size="20">But who would have thought that Zhi</font>

966
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,860
<font size="20">would dare
to provoke the Seven-Star Bureau?</font>

967
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,180
<font size="20">What foolishness!</font>

968
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,700
<font size="20">Is it time</font>

969
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,260
<font size="20">to think about these things?</font>

970
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,220
<font size="20">Zhi was taken away by the spies.</font>

971
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,500
<font size="20">Now her life hangs by a thread.</font>

972
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,660
<font size="20">Madam, Mister Shen is here.</font>

973
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:40,580
<font size="20">Madam Xia.</font>

974
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,420
<font size="20">Mister Shen.</font>

975
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,220
<font size="20">I must have been blind</font>

976
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,180
<font size="20">for not seeing</font>

977
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,380
<font size="20">that you were the only integral one.</font>

978
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,500
<font size="20">The other two</font>

979
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,260
<font size="20">are both unforgivable beasts</font>

980
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,540
<font size="20">with rotten hearts.</font>

981
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,980
<font size="20">Mister Shen,</font>

982
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:56,900
<font size="20">what brings you here?</font>

983
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,060
<font size="20">I heard that Chen Zhi
was paraded with a cangue.</font>

984
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,500
<font size="20">Only then did I realize
I was deceived by him.</font>

985
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,660
<font size="20">I failed to see through bad people.</font>

986
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,620
<font size="20">I let you down.</font>

987
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,620
<font size="20">I thought Hua...</font>

988
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,420
<font size="20">that you must be anxious,</font>

989
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,220
<font size="20">so I came.</font>

990
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,340
<font size="20">Chen Zhi came to rob us.</font>

991
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,260
<font size="20">He didn't hurt anyone.</font>

992
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,060
<font size="20">Now he and Hua Zhi</font>

993
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,660
<font size="20">have been taken
to the Seven-Star Bureau.</font>

994
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,020
<font size="20">Mister Shen,</font>

995
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,220
<font size="20">please sit for a moment.</font>

996
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,260
<font size="20">I will have my daughter</font>

997
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,300
<font size="20">- pour you a cup of tea.
- No.</font>

998
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,860
<font size="20">Madam Xia, I'm leaving now.</font>

999
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,820
<font size="20">What's the rush?</font>

1000
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,500
<font size="20">Madam,</font>

1001
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,100
<font size="20">my family has some acquaintances</font>

1002
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,700
<font size="20">among the imperial guards.</font>

1003
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,780
<font size="20">They might be able to speak</font>

1004
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,220
<font size="20">with the Seven-Star Bureau.</font>

1005
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,060
<font size="20">The pressing matter at hand</font>

1006
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:31,900
<font size="20">is to bring Hua Zhi back.</font>

1007
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,260
<font size="20">By the way, Madam Xia,</font>

1008
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,620
<font size="20">I don't have any cash on me
at the moment.</font>

1009
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,540
<font size="20">Once I have raised the money,</font>

1010
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,380
<font size="20">I will immediately send it to you.</font>

1011
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,100
<font size="20">Farewell.</font>

1012
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,900
<font size="20">Ling! Ling!</font>

1013
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,180
<font size="20">Shen Qi is leaving.</font>

1014
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,500
<font size="20">Hurry and see him off.</font>

1015
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,140
<font size="20">Why should I see him off?</font>

1016
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,700
<font size="20">Just do as I say.</font>

1017
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,780
<font size="20">He is</font>

1018
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,020
<font size="20">a true gentleman.</font>

1019
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,340
<font size="20">Don't be foolish.</font>

1020
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,620
<font size="20">Even if he has discussed marriage
with Hua Zhi,</font>

1021
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,060
<font size="20">they are not engaged.</font>

1022
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,540
<font size="20">It's still undecided who will</font>

1023
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,260
<font size="20">get him in the end.</font>

1024
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,460
<font size="20">Don't you know our situation?</font>

1025
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,780
<font size="20">Isn't it shameful enough already?</font>

1026
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,140
<font size="20">We are now at the end of our tether.</font>

1027
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,180
<font size="20">He is our</font>

1028
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,140
<font size="20">only hope.</font>

1029
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,900
<font size="20">Since he's willing to come to see us,</font>

1030
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:19,740
<font size="20">it means he retains</font>

1031
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,460
<font size="20">a thread of old affection.</font>

1032
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:22,820
<font size="20">What if the Shen family</font>

1033
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,860
<font size="20">is willing to lend us a hand?</font>

1034
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,540
<font size="20">Come on. Just go.</font>

1035
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,420
<font size="20">I won't.</font>

1036
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,140
<font size="20">Mother, don't worry.</font>

1037
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,180
<font size="20">I'll go.</font>
