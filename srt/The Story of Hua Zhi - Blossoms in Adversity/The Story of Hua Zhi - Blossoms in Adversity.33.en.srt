00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,200
some smooth operators.

194
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,750
I know.

195
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,440
But Hua Zhi,

196
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,030
I had no choice.

197
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,150
You knew.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,270
You've become soft-hearted

199
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,320
and you pleaded for them.

200
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,440
So this is punishment.

201
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,390
Hua Zhi.

202
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,750
You are well-versed in history books.

203
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,550
I believe you understand

204
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,910
why this would happen.

205
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
I understand,

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,630
but I just can't accept that.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,910
They are not just some names

208
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,600
in a history book.

209
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,550
They are real people!

210
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,270
You are also not a dagger.

211
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,030
You are also a living person
with feelings.

212
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,600
Hua Zhi.

213
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,360
So I can no longer

214
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,320
be the excuse for him

215
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,440
to compel and use you.

216
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,550
Yanxi.

217
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,750
The Shen Family is just the beginning.

218
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,270
How many more

219
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,360
will pay with their lives
for our willfulness?

220
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,870
We have no choice.

221
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,960
There must be another way.

222
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,820
♪The flower that falls upon the heart♪

223
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,860
♪They are purer than snow♪

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,640
♪My love for you♪

00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,040

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,440
♪Amidst the noise♪

227
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,030
I'm sorry.

228
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,130
♪I will spend my life devoting to you♪

229
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,920
♪Will love be fulfilled?♪

230
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,200
♪Tears will answer♪

231
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,230
♪Love is like the gathering mist♪

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,440
♪Interweave the future and the past♪

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:45,970
♪Coming into view in the scene♪

239
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,870
Yanxi.

240
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,390
Just in time.

241
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,360
Come here.

242
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,320
Look at these characters I wrote.

243
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,000
What's wrong?

244
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,600
You look upset.

245
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,390
Had a fight with Hua Zhi?

246
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,390
We are

247
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,840
over.

248
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,080
So soon?

249
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,840
I thought you two

250
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,200
were going to take another month or so.

251
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,600
It's meaningless now.

252
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,600
Good.

253
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,600
Then release
that second-ranking scholar,

254
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,360
Shen Qi.

255
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,120
Release everyone else

256
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,720
except Shen Zhongxing and his father.

257
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Why are you looking at me like that?

258
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,360
It was you

259
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,440
who pleaded with me.

260
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,360
Since you thought

261
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,320
they were wronged,

262
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,960
then I'll release them as you wish.

263
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,390
As you command.

264
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,550
Zhi.

265
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,790
Shen Huan came back.

266
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,440
He came back.

267
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,200
Shen Qi.

268
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,000
How are the others in your family?

269
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,240
Where are they now?

270
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,080
Only my grandfather and my father

271
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,270
are still at the Security Bureau.

272
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,840
The rest had already gone home,

273
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,080
but they are still in shock.

274
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,960
I didn't know what happened,

275
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,200
but early this morning,

276
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,150
there was an imperial edict
of special pardon.

277
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,630
So...

278
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,630
I see.

279
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,150
That man in the mask

280
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,080
is just a bad person.

281
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,960
Shaoyao.

282
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,150
He isn't the bad person here.

283
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,750
How come?

284
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,510
Shen Huan insisted on coming to Shaoyao

285
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,080
and telling her he was safe.

286
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,960
So I came over with him.

287
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,120
Well,

288
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,270
I should go, Hua Zhi.

289
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:48,510
Wait.

290
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,200
Wait a moment.

291
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,360
I'll go with you.

292
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,030
Grandmother, Mother.

293
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,030
Hua Zhi is here to see you.

294
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,200
Zhi.

295
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,110
Why did you come?

296
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,200
Madam Shen.

297
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,750
You must have a lot to deal with

298
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,160
since you just got back.

299
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,240
So I brought some food and herbs

300
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
for you to get by for a while.

301
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,440
Baoxia.

302
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,830
Mother.

303
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:35,920
This...

304
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:36,640
Hua Zhi.

305
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,440
What are you doing?

306
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:39,920
Miss Zhi.

307
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,790
I can accept

308
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,590
the food and herbs.

309
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
But the rest are too valuable.

310
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
We can't accept them for nothing.

311
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,270
In the past,

312
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,790
we had so many acquaintances

313
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,440
in the city.

314
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,110
Now they all keep their distance.

315
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,750
You are the only one who came.

316
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,590
Your kindness

317
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,790
is worth a thousand
in gold you brought us.

318
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Madam Shen.

319
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,070
Do you still remember
that promissory note?

320
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,240
The betrothal gifts you sent to us

321
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,510
along with the betrothal letters

322
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:15,350
back when we arranged the engagement

323
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,270
have all been confiscated.

324
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,510
Now, we can't pay you back.

325
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,160
With embarrassment, I have
written this letter of debt.

326
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,350
Please keep it.

327
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,270
Madam Shen.

328
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,790
Back then, you came to our manor

329
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,110
and wanted to break off the engagement.

330
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,960
But when you saw

331
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,270
what we were going through,

332
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,110
you left without a word.

333
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,160
My grandmother and I

334
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,110
have always remembered your kindness.

335
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,960
Consider all these as the repayment.

336
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,480
Please accept them.

337
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,200
If back then,

338
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,240
Qi and you...

339
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,550
The past is the past.

340
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,440
Madam Shen, Madam.

341
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,240
Please take care.

342
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,680
I shall take my leave.

343
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,270
Qi.

344
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,270
See her out.

345
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:12,750
Hua Zhi.

346
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,030
Thank you.

347
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,480
Don't thank me.

348
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,160
I am the one who feels sorry.

349
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,790
When we were wealthy,

350
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,590
we thought money wasn't an issue.

351
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,030
But now,

352
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,960
money means everything.

353
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,480
This is hardly worth mentioning

354
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,750
compared to what you've done
for my family.

355
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,160
You are right.

356
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,350
I can't thank you enough anyway.

357
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,240
What's your plan next?

358
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,590
Do my best and see how it plays out.

359
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,590
Grandfather and Father

360
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,350
won't be back any time soon.

361
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,880
It all depends on Huan and me now

362
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,030
to support the family

363
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
and take care of Grandmother and Mother.

364
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,720
Shen Qi.

365
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,030
I want to ask you for a favor.

366
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:58,790
There's no need to ask

367
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,590
between you and me.

368
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,590
It's just

369
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,510
that I've lost everything now.

370
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,350
I really don't know

371
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,440
what I can help you with.

372
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,550
I would like to invite you
to be our family teacher.

373
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,070
If I could be of some help,

374
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,200
I'd put in all of my effort.

375
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,350
But my current status...

376
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,030
You are the second imperial scholar
in this year's exam.

377
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,200
It's our honor to have you
as our teacher.

378
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,830
Hua Zhi.

379
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,110
How would I know

380
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,680
it'd be you lending a hand
to me again so soon?

381
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,310
I believe

382
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,000
that one day,

383
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,000
I will cheer for your accomplishments.

384
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,160
I'll be gentle.

385
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,440
Shaoyao.

386
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,590
It is kind of funny, isn't it?

387
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,440
It is you who take care of my injuries

388
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,480
every time I get hurt.

389
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,000
What is the fun of that?

390
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,030
It makes me want to cry.

391
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,960
Don't.

392
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,550
How about this?

393
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,750
I swear to you.

394
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,640
I will never

395
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,070
get hurt so easily, okay?

396
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,480
Are you a fool?

397
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,880
You can't promise that.

398
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:24,830
Now my brother is a teacher

399
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,030
at the Hua Family's academy.

400
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,920
I can't live an idle life

401
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,960
like before anymore.

402
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,160
But there's nothing that I am good at.

403
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,030
Nonsense.

404
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,750
You can play elephant chess,

405
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,510
make little puppets,

406
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,240
solve the nine linked rings,

407
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,440
do the tangram puzzle,

408
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,400
skip stones on water,

409
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,510
make slingshots,

410
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,750
and catch toads.

411
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,720
You can do a lot of things.

412
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,720
It's fine.

413
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,480
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,160
But what you've mentioned

415
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,000
are still idle pursuits, aren't they?

416
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,790
What I mean is

417
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,310
I need to learn something
that can support myself

418
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,110
and provide for my family.

419
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,830
Just like my brother does.

420
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,720
Tomorrow, let's go
to Zhiming Restaurant.

421
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,680
I don't have money for dining out.

422
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,110
Then go earn some money.

423
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,510
Every time after school,

424
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,680
Jian goes there to help out.

425
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,400
Yingchun

426
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,030
pays him every month.

427
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,640
If he can do it,

428
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,270
you definitely can too.

429
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,590
Okay.

430
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,440
Mother, I want
to sleep with you tonight.

431
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,440
You are about to leave home,

432
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,920
and yet you still act like a child.

433
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,310
That's why

434
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,270
I want to spend another night with you.

435
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,440
This is the money I have saved

436
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,680
as well as some jewelry.

437
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,750
It's not much,

438
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,880
but it can be of use someday.

439
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,550
Mother, I don't want it.

440
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,200
Keep it for yourself.

441
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,480
Zhi has prepared a dowry for me.

442
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,310
I know Zhi has prepared
a lot of things for you,

443
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,440
but you are my only child

444
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,720
in this lifetime.

445
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,960
Who else can I give it to?

446
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,830
To me,

447
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,400
you are still a child.

448
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,720
All of a sudden,

449
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,640
you're about to be married off

450
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,590
so far away to be a wife and a mother.

451
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,480
I am

452
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,510
happy for you

453
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,790
and also worried about you.

454
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,270
Mother, don't worry.

455
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,200
Zhengzhi is a good man.

456
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,510
Marriage is not as simple

457
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,720
as you think.

458
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,960
Since I married into the Hua Family,

459
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,880
I've been very cautious

460
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,720
and keeping my head down,

461
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,350
so we get to live safe and sound

462
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,270
up to this day.

463
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,000
Zhengzhi is a good man,

464
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,790
but his family

465
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,920
is illustrious after all.

466
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,110
After you get married,

467
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,720
you must serve

468
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,960
your in-laws and your husband well

469
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,200
and never make any mistakes.

470
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,510
Mother.

471
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,440
I am going to marry someone,

472
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,240
not going to jail.

473
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,440
You're being exaggerated.

474
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,240
You

475
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,510
still don't understand what I said.

476
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,590
I understand.

477
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,400
But I don't like the way you see it.

478
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,070
I will serve my in-laws

479
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,590
and love my husband with all my heart.

480
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,640
I am not marrying Zhengzhi

481
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,750
for his family background.

482
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,720
Destiny has brought us together

483
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,920
and we fell in love.

484
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,640
I don't see myself as inferior to him
in this relationship.

485
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,640
He likes me, so he doesn't care

486
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,270
I am born of a concubine.

487
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,310
Even if

488
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,160
I were a beggar on the streets,

489
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,270
he would still fancy me.

490
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,590
If I didn't like him,

491
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,000
even if he were a descended deity

492
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,830
from the heavens,

493
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,030
I would not marry him.

494
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,440
Right now,

495
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,920
it's normal that you stick together
like the honey and the bee.

496
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,680
If he doesn't love you anymore one day,

497
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,070
you must secure your place

498
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,790
in your husband's home.

499
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,880
I am not afraid.

500
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,440
If he treats me as always,

501
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,400
then I'll treat him the same.

502
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,200
If he treats me badly,

503
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,160
I will get a mutual divorce with him

504
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,510
just like Auntie Hua Xian did.

505
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:24,680
If that day comes,

506
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,030
Zhi will surely take me back home.

507
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,790
Mother.

508
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,510
Will you

509
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,440
let me sleep in this bed then?

510
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,640
Naughty.

511
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,880
Sleep now.

512
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,480
Then put this away.

513
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,750
Mother.

514
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,590
I want to sleep

515
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,000
in your arms like I did
when I was little.

516
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,200
Okay.

517
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
Mother, do you still snore now?

518
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,680
Did I snore?

519
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,200
You always did.

520
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,830
After today,

521
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,240
we never know when we will meet again

522
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,270
since we are
so far away from each other.

523
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,750
I wish you all well

524
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,240
when I am absent.

525
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,440
My mother is getting old,

526
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,880
so Zhi,

527
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,440
please take care of her a bit more.

528
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,590
I just need you to know one thing.

529
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,960
No matter how far Jinyang is,

530
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,680
you can always come home.

531
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,240
Remember, you can always rely on us.

532
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,240
Please rest assured, Zhi.

533
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,960
Now that Rong will be my wife,

534
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,830
I will be the one that she can rely on

535
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,510
and not let her
suffer the slightest grievance.

536
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,680
Then I wish you a blissful union

537
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,960
and may you be joyous every day.

538
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,310
We shall leave now.

539
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,160
A wedding banquet is prepared at home,

540
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,270
so we have to head back now.

541
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,480
We'll visit you when we have time.

542
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,110
Lady Rong, take care.

543
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,110
Go.

544
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,110
Farewell.

545
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,590
Young Lady.

546
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,480
It's already deep into the night.

547
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,960
Why are you still up?

548
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,110
You are already busy in the day,

549
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,790
and now you are staying up
all night long.

550
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,440
Even Mr. Yan...

551
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,110
I'll go to sleep after I finish this.

552
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,550
Stop counting.

553
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,000
There are dark circles under your eyes.

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,920
If you keep this up,

555
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,350
you'll ruin your health.

556
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:06,750
Come on.

557
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,000
You need sleep.

00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,020
♪We are half a world away♪

572
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:39,600
♪But I hear the innermost echo
in my ears♪

573
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,640
Why?

574
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,350
If you miss me,

575
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,960
come find me at Lord Ling's Mansion.

576
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,440
Just don't tell Zhi.

577
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,790
But...

578
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,880
But she

579
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:03,590
will miss you too.

580
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,350
Yanxi.

581
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,350
Can you stay?

582
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,400
When that masked villain

583
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,750
took Shen Huan away,

584
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,790
there was nothing we could do about it.

585
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,070
If you'd been there,

586
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,200
you definitely could have

587
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,270
beaten him to a pulp.

588
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,200
Shaoyao.

589
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,830
I'm sorry.

590
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,720
Be careful with these things.

591
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,270
Don't break any.

592
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,310
Slow down.

593
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,510
Mr. Zhong.

594
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:37,920
Zhi.

595
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,680
Put everything in the storehouse
at the north corner.

596
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,680
And the bed that arrived

597
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,640
a few days ago.

598
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,960
Lock it up with the rest.

599
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,350
It's just taking up space outside.

600
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,880
Slowly.

601
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,830
Slow down.

602
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,720
- Slow.
- It took Zhi and Mr. Yan

603
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,960
a lot of time

604
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,720
before they finally chose that bed.

605
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,480
They were so happy
the day it was delivered

606
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,830
and wanted to place it
in their wedding room.

607
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,350
Who would have thought...

608
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,880
We thought that this time

609
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,030
Zhi finally found a good husband.

610
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,480
I've even embroidered
the mandarin duck quilt cover.

611
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,240
Zhi, those things...

612
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,720
It's okay.

613
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,720
Out of sight,

614
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,480
out of mind.

615
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,720
I'm needed at the restaurant.
I must go now.

616
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,680
Mother, I'm leaving.

617
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,310
Please, this way.

618
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,240
Please go upstairs.

619
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,200
There are private rooms upstairs.

620
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,590
- Okay.
- Please, this way.

621
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,440
Have you two finished the meal?

622
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,110
Good.

623
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,110
Please come again.

624
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,200
Mr. Shen Huan is indeed diligent.

625
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,830
He's completely different from before.

626
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:44,960
He serves customers during the day,

627
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
and after we close at night,

628
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,110
he even helps Fudong

629
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:47,960
tidy things up and take stock.

630
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,720
He leaves late at night every day.

631
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,350
Give him a little extra pay
at the end of the month.

632
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,240
When you have time,

633
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,640
go visit Madam Shen

634
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,440
to see if she needs anything.

635
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,680
Understood, Young Lady.

636
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,030
Waiter, where are our dishes?

637
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,480
I will hurry them up for you.

638
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,440
Don't worry.

639
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,440
Shen Huan?

640
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,790
Isn't this Mr. Shen Huan?

641
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,070
Haven't seen you for some days now.

642
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,400
We thought you were fooling around.

643
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,240
Didn't expect to see you
at Zhiming Restaurant!

644
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,720
He's not here for dining.

645
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,350
Look at his attire.

646
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,640
It looks just perfect

647
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,920
on him.

648
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,240
Please go inside first

649
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,510
even if you want to catch up with me.

650
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,640
It's hard for other customers

651
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
to get in if you block the way.

652
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,270
Who would have thought

653
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,640
that the cocky Mr. Shen Huan

654
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,920
would now become

655
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,590
a humble doorman?

656
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,030
Come on, for the sake of old times,

657
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,640
I'll give you a little reward.

658
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,590
At least you don't have

659
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,790
an empty pocket now.

660
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,960
Thank you so much.

661
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:44,000
There are private rooms.

662
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,920
Please follow me.

663
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,030
Come this way, please.

664
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,720
I thought

665
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,590
he would throw it

666
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,750
on that fop's face.

667
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,310
That fop humiliated him indeed,

668
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,200
but money puts food on the table.

669
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,350
If he still cares so much

670
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,400
about his dignity at this point,

671
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,830
how can he make a living

672
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,400
in this cruel world?

673
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,350
My horse!

674
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
What was that? It pricked me.

675
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,110
Who did this?

676
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,160
Who put the needles on the saddle?

677
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,310
Come on! Help me pull it out!

678
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,720
Help me here too!

679
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,510
Help me pull it out, quickly.

680
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,640
An eye for an eye.

681
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,830
You're ruthless, girl.

682
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,110
Master Mu said

683
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,720
this is chivalry.

684
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,830
Thank you, Shaoyao the hero.

685
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Don't mention it.

686
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,920
It's so late already.

687
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,400
You're still preparing for your lesson?

688
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,280
I'll teach a new chapter tomorrow,

689
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,550
so I need to prepare thoroughly.

690
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,880
Those kids

691
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,760
always ask some

692
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
strange questions.

693
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,630
As the second-ranking scholar,

694
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,590
you find it challenging

695
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,960
to be a teacher at a family academy?

696
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,840
I am so tired.

697
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,190
So tired

698
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,710
that I don't even want to walk anymore.

699
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,800
How about

700
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,550
I share a bed with you tonight?

701
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,920
Just like when we were kids.

702
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,110
We can talk a bit more

703
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,550
that way.

704
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,000
There you go, naughty boy.

705
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,440
I suddenly remembered

706
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,230
when we were little

707
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,400
and I lived next door to you,

708
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,110
I couldn't sleep well at all.

709
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,590
You got up to read
at the crack of dawn every day.

710
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,190
You were so loud

711
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,280
that I wanted

712
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,550
to block my ears.

713
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,030
Honestly,

714
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,550
I even wanted to fight with you.

715
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,920
Was that so?

716
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,630
But I remember

717
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,230
you were the one who'd sleep

718
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,550
until the sun was so high.

719
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,230
And Mother had to wield a stick

720
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,880
to force you to get up for lunch.

721
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,710
Mother couldn't bear to hit me, okay?

722
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,400
But Father was different.

723
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,630
His one stroke was so hard

724
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,190
that I couldn't even get out of my bed.

725
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,590
When we were little,

726
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,920
I always thought you were pathetic.

727
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,030
You were forced to study every day.

728
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,190
And watching a shadow play

729
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,320
seemed like

730
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,480
some enormous mistake.

731
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,000
Grandfather even punished you

732
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,230
to stand still for four hours for that.

733
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,590
And I?

734
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:55,710
I fooled around

735
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,960
and hated to study.

736
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,840
Even when I skipped school

737
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,840
and went to play polo,

738
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,960
Father and Mother would cover for me

739
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,960
for fear that Grandfather
would lecture me.

740
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,550
But I know

741
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,510
Grandfather also

742
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,630
turned a blind eye.

743
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,510
Back then, I thought

744
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,190
I had endless money to spend anyway.

745
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
No matter what I did,

746
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,110
no one

747
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,630
could keep me under control.

748
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,030
So I thought

749
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,880
I might live like that forever.

750
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,880
I envied you when we were kids.

751
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,110
You were so unrestrained

752
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,190
and so free.

753
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,670
But who can live like that forever?

754
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,630
Now I realize

755
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,960
that things will change

756
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,670
and money

757
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,360
won't just pop up

758
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,670
by itself.

759
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,960
Life is so hard.

760
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,800
Don't worry.

761
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,360
I'm still here.

762
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,880
I've been muddled along

763
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,710
for more than ten years.

764
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:04,960
Compared to you,

765
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,960
I've already been a very happy boy.

766
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,550
From now on,

767
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,190
we will work together

768
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,230
to get through the hard times.

769
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,710
I will take some load off you

770
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,360
to make you less stressed.

771
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,550
I earned a good deal
of reward money recently.

772
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,400
I should buy a...

773
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
The madams have been preparing

774
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,670
to hold a banquet for you.

775
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
If you leave without telling them,

776
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,440
they will be very upset.

777
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,710
Shen Qi stays at our mansion now.

778
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,510
But Mr. Zheng is meticulous.

779
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,070
He won't brag about his rank in the exam

780
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,110
and make Shen Qi upset.

781
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,440
Mr. Shen Qi is a magnanimous man.

782
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,670
He would never mind such things.

783
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,000
However,

784
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,630
showing off in front of the disheartened

785
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,280
is not the act of a gentleman.

786
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,800
After I leave,

787
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,920
please say goodbye

788
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,840
to the madams for me.

789
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,670
Guixi County

790
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,590
is hundreds of li away from here.

791
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,590
You go alone to assume your post.

792
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,800
I...

793
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,070
Be safe.

794
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,590
Lady Ling, don't worry.

795
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,510
I am

796
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,070
way more stronger than you think.

797
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,710
It's getting dark.

798
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,030
You'd better hurry on.

799
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,710
Once you arrive safely,

800
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,440
remember to write us a letter.

801
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,590
Lady Ling. Lady Zhi.

802
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,710
If it hadn't been for you,

803
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,510
I'd have long been
a starving corpse on the streets.

804
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,510
I am beyond grateful

805
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,070
for what you did for me.

806
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,070
Please accept my obeisance.

807
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,800
I'm sure we'll meet again.

808
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,590
See you

809
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,670
someday.

810
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:39,230
Well,

811
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,880
Rong was married

812
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,440
and Mr. Zheng had also left.

813
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,960
It suddenly feels so quiet here

814
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,630
after they are gone.

815
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,880
You forgot someone.

816
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,920
You mean Mr. Yan?

817
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,760
I am curious.

818
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,630
What exactly happened

819
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,840
between Zhi and him?

820
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:00,480
I don't dare to ask.

821
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,400
Even if you asked,

822
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,840
Zhi might not tell the truth.

823
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,280
It's not up to us

824
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,280
to make the decision

825
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,480
for them.

826
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,670
It might be the best for them

827
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,230
in this way.

828
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,840
Who knows?

829
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,480
Zhi might be happier without him.

Today's grain price.

Five hundred wen for one dou of rice.

856
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,760
- Five hundred wen?
- Five hundred wen?

857
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:00,670
Five hundred wen?

858
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,760
It was three hundred wen yesterday.

859
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,800
How could it

860
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,630
rise so much overnight?

861
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,550
The price goes up day by day.

862
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,110
But that's not up to me

863
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,670
to decide.

864
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,150
If you don't believe me,
go check the other stores.

865
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,110
There are even stores
selling it for seven hundred wen.

866
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,880
- Seven hundred wen?
- Seven hundred wen?

867
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,510
Seven hundred wen?

868
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,590
Do you want it or not?

869
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,280
Mister.

870
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,590
I will have one dou of rice

871
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,630
and two sheng of wheat flour.

872
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,150
Alright.

873
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,190
Money?

Please come inside.

00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
You want some too, sir?

877
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:35,800
Alrighty.

878
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:36,960
Please help yourself inside.

879
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I have money. I will have one bag.

880
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:39,960
Anyone?

881
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,960
Give me half a dou of rice.

882
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:41,880
Okay.

883
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,230
That's too expensive.

884
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,440
New dishes today?

885
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,030
Not really.

886
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:58,000
It's just we can't
make the dishes on our menu.

and the deer antler ham.

890
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,670
There's nowhere to buy any of them now.

that sell beef and mutton

893
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,150
have raised the prices by fifty percent.

894
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,630
But still, the meat was sold out

00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,400
