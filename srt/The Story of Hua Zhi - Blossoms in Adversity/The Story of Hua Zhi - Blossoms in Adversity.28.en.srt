189
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,080
Don't kill me!

190
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:04,960
Don't kill me.

191
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,440
Don't kill me.

192
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,320
Don't kill me.

193
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,670
Don't kill me.

194
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,080
Lady Zhi, it's done.

195
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,270
Let's go.

196
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,080
What are you doing?

197
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,120
Let's go.

198
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,720
What's wrong?

199
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,670
Young Lady.

200
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,600
I kindly covered him with a blanket,

201
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,200
but he guarded against me
as if I were a thief!

202
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't even know

203
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
when he took the knife from the table

204
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,120
and hid it under the pillow.

205
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,200
He nearly cut me with it!

206
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,320
If you need this knife

207
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,120
to help you sleep tight,

208
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,120
you can keep it.

209
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
But I assure you

210
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
that in this family,

211
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,360
you don't need this

212
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,390
to get a good sleep.

213
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,630
This child is...

214
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,840
Now, apologize to Baoxia.

215
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,910
You did wrong just now.

216
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,910
No need.

217
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,000
He's like a puppy, biting everyone.

218
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,120
He doesn't need to apologize.

219
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,320
Why did you throw things everywhere?

220
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,200
What are these?

221
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,390
These are...

222
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,320
Well...

223
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,120
Jian,

224
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,480
are you worried
that you might get hungry?

225
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,150
Baoxia.

226
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,600
Go to the kitchen and prepare some food.

227
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,670
Prepare as much as possible.

228
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,750
Jian,

229
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,480
I'm going out today.

230
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,840
But I will be back before dark.

231
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,480
Wait here for me,

232
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,000
okay?

233
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,360
In the future, whenever you're hungry,
just let me know.

234
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,750
If you need anything,

235
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,910
you can tell Baoxia.

236
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,080
When I get back,

237
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,150
I will bring you something tasty.

238
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,200
Young Lady,

239
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,150
Mr. Zhong wants to know

240
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,240
if it's time to set off.

241
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:13,720
Let's go.

242
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,870
Be good.

243
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,120
Let's go.

244
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:31,910
Mr. Zhong.

245
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,550
Lady Zhi.

246
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,720
How come you're wearing

247
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,510
the new clothes today?

248
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,000
Of course, I am.

249
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
Today is a big day!

250
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,240
I want

251
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,910
to look good for you!

252
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's go!

253
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,080
Get in, Lady Zhi.

254
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,320
Come on.

255
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:52,360
Eat up.

256
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,360
Just eat to your fill.

257
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,390
Look at you.

258
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,240
Slow down.

259
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll go get you some water!

260
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,120
I can't believe him.

261
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,320
He really knows how to tire me out.

262
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,670
I heard the Security Bureau Guards
put in great effort

263
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,000
to catch a child.

264
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,000
Is that so?

265
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,960
What could a child

266
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,790
possibly do wrong?

267
00:12:59,390 --> 00:12:59,910
I don't know.

268
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,670
They caught a little kid.

269
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Why would they capture a child?

270
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,440
The one in that carriage

271
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,670
must be the Sixth Prince!

272
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,270
They really found him ahead of us!

273
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,150
You, go and report to our master.

274
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,000
The rest of you, follow me.

275
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,200
We cannot let them take the Sixth Prince

276
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,720
back with them.

277
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,870
Yes.

278
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,600
Make a way.

279
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:22,390
The carriage is coming!

280
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:31,910
Yes.

281
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,960
This is Miss Hua!

282
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,080
Miss Hua!

283
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,480
Please, come in.

284
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,670
Please.

285
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,750
Miss Hua.

286
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,390
How wonderful!

287
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,000
This way.

288
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,550
Indeed.

289
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,510
Good.

290
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,440
Good to see you, Miss Hua.

291
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,110
Prepare this private room.

292
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,240
Clean it up nicely

293
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,070
and get the tea ready.

294
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,880
Later, after Miss Hua

295
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,680
visits the kitchen,

296
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,350
she will take a seat here
to watch the competition.

297
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,110
- Move quickly.
- Yes.

298
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,200
Today

299
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,270
is already the seventh day.

300
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,070
Who is there?

301
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,440
He's with me.

302
00:17:59,480 --> 00:17:59,880
Commander,

303
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:00,750
it's done.

304
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,750
Are you sure?

305
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,240
I've been following that man in black.

306
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,400
He went into a small courtyard.

307
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,480
And as soon as he got into the house,

308
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,880
he knelt and apologized to his master.

309
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,590
Did you see his master's face?

310
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,830
At that time,

311
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,160
his face was half-covered.

312
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,550
I couldn't see it clearly.

313
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,310
But I remember his voice.

314
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,310
Who is it?

315
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,640
Eunuch Wei.

316
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,240
Lord Xian's trusted man.

317
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,070
Commander,

318
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,920
let's take action.

319
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,750
I've never raided
a lord's mansion before.

320
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,440
To bring down a lord,

321
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
we need solid evidence.

322
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,640
I saw it with my own eyes!

323
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,790
What exactly is solid evidence?

324
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,240
We'll have it soon.

325
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,680
Fools!

326
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,640
You've sold yourselves out.

327
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,880
And you're not even aware of it!

328
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,160
Please, Your Highness,

329
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,200
enlighten me.

330
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,240
You think the Security Bureau

331
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,350
really found the Sixth Prince?

332
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,550
They only did that

333
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,400
to lure you out!

334
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,590
You think they tried
to capture you alive for interrogation?

335
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,790
Don't they know

336
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,200
that my death warriors would only

337
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,350
commit suicide once they got caught?

338
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,110
That fool

339
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,590
thought he had escaped to safety.

340
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,720
And he ran to report to you!

341
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,830
The inspectors from the Security Bureau

342
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,880
definitely followed him.

343
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,400
Most likely,
they've already discovered you.

344
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,000
I...

345
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,350
I am so sorry!

346
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,640
Now,

347
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,350
it's like holding
the arrow on the bowstring.

348
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,070
It must be released!

349
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,160
Go and call up fifty good fighters.

350
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,160
Have them get armed

351
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
and follow me to the Palace immediately!

352
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,590
I'll show some concern for His Majesty.

353
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,160
Your Highness,

354
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,440
but in the Palace,

355
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,350
the Security Bureau is on guard!

356
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,510
In the end, the Security Bureau

357
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,960
is no more than a dog

358
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,160
by His Majesty's side.

359
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,070
Now even the owner is nearly gone.

360
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,160
Can't we kill the dog?

361
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,270
They sealed the Forbidden Palace.

362
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Merely for that, I can accuse him

363
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,160
of plotting treason.

364
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,200
I'm leading troops into the Palace

365
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,310
to eliminate the traitors.

366
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,720
Who would dare to object?

367
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,510
Go tell those in the Court

368
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,590
to get their reports ready

369
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,920
as a foolproof preparation!

370
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,480
I will

371
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,000
follow your order!

372
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,830
Commander,

373
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,680
do you think Lord Xian will really come?

374
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,000
What if he doesn't come?

375
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,310
Someone else

376
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,480
might hesitate and hold back,

377
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,590
but Lord Xian won't.

378
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,160
Someone like him

379
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,720
is naturally cruel and suspicious.

380
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,720
He only moves forward
and never retreats.

381
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,590
He will lead troops into the Palace.

382
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,790
Can we defeat him then?

383
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,240
Don't you know

384
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,110
exactly how many men

385
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,110
the Security Bureau has?

386
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,400
What should we do then?

387
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,400
Attack them when they're unprepared.

388
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,790
We'll win by striking quickly.

389
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,550
Why are there so many people?

390
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,070
Make way!

391
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,400
My Lord,

392
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
there is news about that child!

393
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,750
Is the information reliable?

394
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,550
An old beggar

395
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,400
saw him clearly!

396
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,680
It was a boy with bruises on his neck.

397
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,440
He never speaks

398
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,590
and tries to hide from everyone.

399
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,920
He got onto
the Hua Family's carriage that night

400
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,880
and left with Miss Hua

401
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,720
and a maid.

402
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,640
What a coincidence.

403
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,400
Where is Miss Hua at this moment?

404
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,350
Today, the Hua Family
is holding a contest at the restaurant.

405
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,880
Miss Hua is at Tangxi Restaurant.

406
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,550
You take half the men to the Hua Family

407
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,550
and search the place thoroughly.

408
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,720
If you let them

409
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,110
run off again,

410
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,880
all of you

411
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,590
should not come back to see me anymore.

412
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,070
Yes.

413
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,400
The rest of you,

414
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,070
follow me to Tangxi Restaurant!

415
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,270
This darn child!

416
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,510
Where did he go again?

417
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,920
Oh, I'm so angry.

418
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,480
The whole family
went out to watch the competition,

419
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,960
leaving me alone to watch the kid.

420
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,110
If he's gone missing, then let it be.

421
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,830
No, I can't.

422
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:01,750
I must let Lady Zhi know.

423
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,240
Why do others
get to watch the competition

424
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,110
and I can't?

425
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,550
I bet on the Hua Family!

426
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,830
Look!

427
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,790
Such a spectacle scene

428
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,880
is probably one of the tops
in the capital!

429
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,880
Just have a seat.

430
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,350
Don't embarrass yourself.

431
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,270
Alright.

432
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,830
[Hua Mansion]

433
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,070
Search!

434
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,000
Search!

435
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:51,510
Yes.

436
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,240
Search the whole place!

437
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,240
You, over there!

438
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,640
Yes!

439
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,200
You, over there!

440
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,200
Miss Hua.

441
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,590
Your Highness.

442
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
It's very lively today.

443
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,270
Miss Zhi.

444
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,160
Young Lady.

445
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,720
Mr. Bai,

446
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,640
I have a friend here

447
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,550
who wants
to have a private talk with me.

448
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,310
Would you step aside for a moment?

449
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,510
Yingchun,

450
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,590
no need to wait on us for now.

451
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,200
Then...

452
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,110
Your Highness,

453
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,000
how can I help you?

454
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,350
Aren't you the owner of a restaurant?

455
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,200
I, of course,

456
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,960
am here to dine.

457
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,440
Let's start with a pot of tea.

458
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,240
I'm really sorry.

459
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,200
I don't know how to make tea.

460
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,790
Just do it!

461
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,920
Cut the chatter!

462
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
This dish has it all,
color, aroma, and flavor.

463
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,640
You...

464
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,200
Look at them.

465
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,590
No.

466
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,480
He's not here.

467
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,960
Look, those people
have all been arrested.

468
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:57,720
No.

469
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,750
No.

470
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,070
Sir, we found nothing.

471
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,270
No?

472
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,310
Then set it on fire.

473
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,240
Block both the front and back gates!

474
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,350
Let's see

475
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,350
who exactly will run out.

476
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,400
Move!

477
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,240
Yes!

478
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,400
Burn it!

479
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:23,720
Excuse me!

480
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,750
Where are the ladies?

481
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:29,070
Hurry over. It's about to start!

482
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,550
How did you get here?

483
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:31,960
Don't mention it.

484
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,880
It's a long story.

485
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,830
Stop asking.

486
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,400
Come on.

487
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,880
Good.

488
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,070
- Good.
- Fighting.

489
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,270
Fudong, fighting!

490
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,070
Fudong!

491
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,200
Fighting.

492
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,310
Fighting.

493
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,750
Fudong, Fighting!

494
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,750
Everyone,

495
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,110
silence!

496
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,000
Honored guests,

497
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,240
thank you for coming here!

498
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,350
Your presence truly brings glory
to Tangxi Restaurant.

499
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,400
However,

500
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,000
starting tomorrow,

501
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,640
this place will no longer
be called Tangxi Restaurant.

502
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:34,960
No longer called Tangxi Restaurant?

503
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,000
You will find out its new name tomorrow.

504
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,680
Let's cut the chitchat.

505
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,830
The first round of this competition

506
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,240
is a contest of knifing skills.

507
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,070
Now,

508
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,160
it begins!

509
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:50,110
- Good.
- Good.

510
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,750
Good!

511
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,590
It has begun!

512
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,590
Look!

513
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm going to take a break.

514
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,440
Boil the water.

515
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,550
What are you crying for?

516
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,680
I'm not dead yet!

517
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,640
Cry again and
I'll throw you in the pot and cook you

518
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,350
to serve with my drink!

519
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,880
Chop all these!

520
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,200

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,200

And it's bustling indeed.

556
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,270
Cousin, long time no see.

557
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,720
Sit down.

558
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,400
It seems that I guessed wrong earlier.

559
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,640
You might

560
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:26,880
really manage to buy yourselves
half a year of time.

561
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,160
By then,

562
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,510
I'll have to add a generous gift

563
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,160
for you.

564
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,750
I'm curious.

565
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,830
Young Lord, what brings you here?

566
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,920
Whatever brings you here, cousin,

567
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,110
surely

568
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,070
is also what brings me here.

569
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,440
I came to eat.

570
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,480
I came to eat as well.

571
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,510
Today, you have to wait
until the competition is over

572
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,510
to be served.

573
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,830
My two honored guests,

574
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,640
I'm afraid you're not going

575
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,480
to have a meal soon.

576
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,750
That's fine.

577
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,720
Then let the competition go on.

578
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:07,680
No, no.

579
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,640
I must think carefully.

580
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,960
Think carefully.

581
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,960
Liang Fugui,

582
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,880
seventy votes.

583
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,750
Fudong,

584
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,110
a hundred and nine votes.

585
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:33,240
First round,

586
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,880
Fudong wins!

587
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,480
- Good!
- Good!

588
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,070
- Good!
- Good!

589
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,960
- Good!
- Good!

590
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,200
Really impressive!

591
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,760
[Hua's]

592
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,310
Good!

593
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,480
- Good.
- Excellent!

594
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,400
Stop throwing things!

595
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:51,790
You lost because she's better than you.

596
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,160
Don't take your anger out
on my kitchenware!

597
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,200
Exactly!

598
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,310
Exactly.

599
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,160
Round two,

600
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,440
cooking-time test.

601
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,350
Now,

602
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,270
begin!

603
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,270
- Good.
- Good.

604
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,350
Sir.

605
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,440
Is the Lord inside?

606
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,400
Yes.

607
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,830
We'll wait here.

608
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,110
Go tell him

609
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,590
that we have searched the Hua Mansion,

610
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,640
and found nothing.

611
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:21,720
Yes.

612
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,000
The old man and the young girl

613
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,440
looked quite like each other.

614
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,270
They are father and daughter.

615
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,920
Today was not a wasted trip.

616
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,000
There happens to be a competition

617
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,270
between father and daughter.

618
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:43,750
It's truly exciting.

619
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,070
- Good!
- Good!

620
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,790
Are you happy watching this game,
dear cousin?

621
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,440
If the father loses,

622
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,400
I'll be happy.

623
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,720
If he wins,

624
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,400
this would be uninteresting.

625
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,160
I'm sure you won't be disappointed,
Your Highness.

626
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,240
Is that so?

627
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,350
Your Highness.

628
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,680
We've searched inside and outside
the building

629
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:12,880
and found nothing.

630
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Eunuch Wei is back.

631
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,510
He found nothing either.

632
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,070
Miss Hua,

633
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,640
there's something
I'd like to ask you about.

634
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,070
But in this place,

635
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,240
I think

636
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,110
you won't speak to me honestly.

637
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,720
How about we go somewhere else?

638
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,160
Wherever I am,

639
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,830
my answers to you will be the same.

640
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,310
Please.

641
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,110
She will not go with you today.

642
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,110
This is unlike the matters before.

643
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
You shouldn't take part.

644
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,310
She's with me.

645
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,480
How could this not concern me?

646
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,720
Gu Yanxi,

647
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,550
you are a clever person.

648
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,750
If we were not both
born into the royal family,

649
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,110
we could probably become friends.

650
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,360
But now,
the situation changes as it pleases.

651
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,150
I can tell you this, though.

652
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,190
After today,

653
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,110
whatever happens,

654
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,550
I, Gu Yangong,

655
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,590
can ensure your lifelong safety.

656
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,710
You'll be rich,
with no responsibilities.

657
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,230
I wonder

658
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,760
when you acquired

659
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,150
this kind of power.

660
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,190
If you truly are so capable,

661
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,150
then let's just talk here.

662
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,880
Alright.

663
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,800
Then let's talk.

664
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,230
The night before last,

665
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,070
in the Grass Lane,

666
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,360
you took away a boy of eight or nine

667
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,400
with your carriage.

668
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,400
Where is he now?

669
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,230
That was my little brother,

670
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,840
Hua Bolin.

671
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,800
Why are you looking for him?

672
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,000
Liang Fugui,

673
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,070
eighty-eight votes.

674
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,960
Fudong,

675
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,510
ninety-one votes!

676
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,150
Fudong has won another round!

677
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,280
Close the window.

678
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,000
That's fast.

679
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,590
Good!

680
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,670
It was a good decision coming here!

681
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,110
- Good!
- Good!

682
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,920
Your Highness, aren't you here
to watch the game?

683
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,400
The winner is determined.

684
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,070
There's nothing left to be watched.

685
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,710
The father has lost two rounds indeed.

686
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,400
But for the last round,

687
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:42,800
who knows

688
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,000
if the young one will win again?

689
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,110
Such a large restaurant.

690
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,070
People are fighting for it.

691
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,320
It's going to be a good show.

692
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,320
Your Highness,
since you're already here,

693
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,710
why not watch closely?

694
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,150
Miss Hua,

695
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,280
think carefully about
how to answer my question.

696
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,510
Before the gong sounds thrice,

697
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,150
you still have a chance
to save your life.

698
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,960
If your answer is wrong,

699
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:07,800
no one

700
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,920
can save you.

701
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,400
Round three.

702
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,710
The two chefs

703
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,920
will each make a special dish

704
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,630
for our guests.

705
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
There are no requirements

706
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,320
on cooking methods or dish types.

707
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,320
The one with the most votes wins.

708
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:25,920
Good!

709
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,440
The competition

710
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,480
begins!

711
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,960
- Good.
- Good.

712
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,150
Good!

713
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,190
Good!

714
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,190
My dear guests,

715
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
thank you all for your support.

716
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:49,510
Today,

717
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,840
I, Liang Fugui,

718
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,840
don't care if I will win

719
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,760
or lose.

720
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,840
Next,

721
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,230
I will present you

722
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,630
my family heritage,

723
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,070
the Roasted Camel Hump!

724
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,000
Go and bring me that dish.

725
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:22,360
Miss Chef,

726
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,670
what will you make for us?

727
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,320
Yeah!

728
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,070
Dear guests,

729
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,110
you will find out soon.

730
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,000
Also,

731
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,800
I'm not called "Miss Chef".

732
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,480
My name is Fudong.

733
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,480
What will you make for us?

734
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,400
- Right.
- What will you make?

735
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,070
This really is a duel of masters.

736
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,000
It's so intense!

737
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,880
Let me try it.

738
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,230
Delicious!

739
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,230
Delicious!

740
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,880
Ms. Fudong,

741
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,150
everyone

742
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,070
has tried

743
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,590
Chef Liang's Roasted Camel Hump.

744
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,070
That flavor

745
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,070
lingers on endlessly.

746
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,070
This dish of yours

747
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,710
must be made of
dragon tendons or phoenix marrow

748
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:29,840
so that you can never win.

749
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,480
What a coincidence.

750
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,960
This dish of mine

751
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,670
is called "Surpassing Camel Hump".

752
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,590
Surpassing Camel Hump?

753
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,150
How come there's
a "Surpassing Camel Hump"?

754
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,230
This camel hump of yours

755
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:58,880
is...

756
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,150
I mean,
it has not even a hint of gamey taste!

757
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,070
It tastes even more delicate
than Bai's camel hump!

758
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,590
And quite crispy, too!

759
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,760
Such a pity.

760
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,000
For a delicacy like this,

761
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,880
I can only have it

762
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,590
once in a lifetime!

763
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,670
Dear guests, don't sign.

764
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,400
In the future,
when our restaurant opens,

765
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,670
this dish will still be available.

766
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,400
Everyone,

767
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,670
make sure to come and try.

768
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,510
Our Hua's "Surpassing Camel Hump"

769
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,400
is not made from real camel hump.

770
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,510
Therefore,

771
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
everyone can afford it.

772
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,150
So it's actually fish!

773
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:39,710
Fish?

774
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,440
She can turn fish into that?

775
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,070
It doesn't have any fishy smell
and didn't fall apart either.

776
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:45,840
Ms. Fudong,

777
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,550
that's truly amazing!

778
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,070
Really amazing!

779
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,190
So impressive!

780
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,400
Really amazing!

781
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,360
Ingenious!

782
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,230
Indeed ingenious!

783
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,190
Where did Zhi go?

784
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,670
Right.

785
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,920
Yeah, where's she?

786
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,320
She vanished as soon as arrived.

787
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,360
The winner is about to be decided.

788
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,230
Where did she go?

789
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,800
Good!

790
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,480
Good.

791
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,110
Impressive!

792
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,230
Really impressive!

793
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,150
The Hua's wins!

794
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,880
Good!

795
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,880
Good!

796
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,320
[Hua's]
Marvelous!

797
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,070
Good!

798
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,670
Excellent!

799
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,150
I gave you a chance.

800
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:02,920
Unexpectedly,

801
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,190
you're a pair of fools.

802
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,590
Guards.

803
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:17,920
Guards!

804
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,480
Allow me, Your Highness.

805
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,070
Guards!

806
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:31,840
Commander!

807
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,280
You are the Commander
of the Security Bureau?

808
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,840
Yes, I am.

809
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,360
Take him down!

810
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:07,760
