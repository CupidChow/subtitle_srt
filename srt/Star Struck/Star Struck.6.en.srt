00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,360
Who is it?

187
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,250
Number 12.

188
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,520
It's me.

189
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,300
Now, number two and number seven are going to kiss.

190
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,160
Who's number two?

191
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:38,910
Who's number seven?

192
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,910
Number two.

193
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,420
I'm number two.

194
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:49,480
What about number seven?

195
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,720
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

196
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,380
He's leaving?

197
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:29,690
Where is he going?

198
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:30,940
Is he seriously leaving?

199
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,610
Did he leave?

200
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,140
Is he drunk?

201
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,720
Impossible.

202
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,120
Found you.

203
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,000
Is it fun?

204
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,930
What do you mean?

205
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,950
Right.

206
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,420
That's just who you are.

207
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,280
You like to see people who like you

208
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,470
hanging onto every look and move you make.

209
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,630
You're someone who likes that.

210
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,730
That's right.

211
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,440
That's who I am.

212
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,080
So?

213
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,110
Do you think I regard you in that way too?

214
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,500
Don't you?

215
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,050
It's not fun at all.

216
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,760
Just be direct and say what you want to say.

217
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,850
I have nothing to say to you anymore.

218
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,770
Why not?

219
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,600
What else can I do?

220
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,410
At your every move, my feelings are swayed,

221
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,750
and I imbue meaning to everything

222
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,270
such that I'm always fantasizing alone...

223
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,740
If I continue to like you like that,

224
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,570
I'll lose my mind,

225
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,480
like a crazy fool.

226
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,839
But... aren't your feelings for me all sorted out now?

227
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,839
All sorted out?

228
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,900
Yes.

229
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,640
All I've been thinking about is you.

230
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,859
What do you think?

231
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,270
Can you still be my friend in this situation?

232
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,020
Can we put our arms on each other's shoulders and hug each other, like nothing happened?

233
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,270
I can't.

234
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,530
Don't go.

235
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,060
Let go.

236
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
I don't want to.

237
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,830
I told you to let go.

238
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,500
Do you think I'll let you abandon me again?

239
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,060
