[Star Struck]

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,130
Catch!

6
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,050
Why did you pass it over there?

7
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,650
I'll protect you.

8
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,890
What's there to see when you're just throwing punches recklessly?

9
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,340
It's not reckless punches

10
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,300
but a formal sports.

11
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,910
That's crazy.

12
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,760
- Jo Yoojae. - Don't say things like that.

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,270
Like what?

14
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,400
Don't say things that'd hurt people.

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,170
Yoojae, let me see.

16
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,539
Jo Yoojae?

17
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,250
Do you want to kill me?

18
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,210
Are you really okay?

19
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,520
Yeah.

20
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:54,450
Still, go to the infirmary quickly.

21
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,950
It's fine.

22
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,370
No. Just in case.

23
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm dead.

24
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,740
That's a relief.

25
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,860
I don't think it's that seriously hurt.

26
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,900
Hey, you did it on purpose, didn't you?

27
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,579
I didn't for real.

28
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:19,890
Hey.

29
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,280
Come over.

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,120
No.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,270
It's better than laying a blanket on the floor.

32
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,550
Come here.

33
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,110
I told you no.

34
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,030
Ouch.

35
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,750
Okay, okay.

36
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,800
This will do, right?

37
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,000
It's comfortable, right?

38
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,500
Not bad.

39
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,730
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,780
For what?

41
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:11,220
I guess I took after my parents. I keep hurting people.

42
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:14,050
I’ll apologize to Jinhwan too.

43
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,790
No, you’re a kind person.

44
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,320
Hey, give me a book.

45
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,080
I told you to study in the study room at the academy.

46
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,810
Why are you here?

47
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,880
I don't want to.

48
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,390
It's hotter with you here now.

49
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,940
I feel awkward with Yoon Chaeyoung.

50
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,990
Did you reject her because of the college entrance exam?

51
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,330
Yes.

52
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,640
Summer vacation is coming.

53
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,110
There are only three months left until the college entrance exam.

54
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,640
I don't want to repeat my senior year.

55
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,240
You understand what I mean, right?

56
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,340
You said I was cute.

57
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,790
Didn't you say I'm cute and pretty?

58
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,150
Yes.

59
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,180
Don't you like me?

60
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,000
I do.

61
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,320
In that case, if we both get into a good university,

62
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,440
can you reconsider me?

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,780
Let's study hard for now.

64
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,490
So if we all get into a good university–

65
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,210
So... Just eat.

66
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,850
Eat up.

67
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,890
What about after the college entrance exam?

68
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,500
What about after it?

69
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,250
Are you going to accept her feelings after that?

70
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,170
Do you think it's possible?

71
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,980
Why not?

72
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,440
Hey.

73
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,200
I rejected her once. Isn't it weird to accept her again?

74
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,780
If one's rejected once,

75
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,600
there's nothing that can be done about it.

76
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,250
Hey, you can at least be friends.

77
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,950
Forget it.

78
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,220
I wish...

79
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,190
I wish tomorrow is the college entrance exam day.

80
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,780
Do you want to finish the exam that badly?

81
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Hey. There's a good thing about universities.

82
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,620
You don't have to take classes you don't want to take.

83
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,690
If we were university students now,

84
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,690
Oh Jaepil would've skipped so many classes by now.

85
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,480
Hey, you. Hanjoon.

86
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,700
You sound exactly like him.

87
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,100
Recite it.

88
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,490
Goodness.

89
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,100
It's so funny, but it's hot.

90
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,950
It's hot.

91
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,310
Hey, let's not stay here.

92
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,080
Let's go to the comic cafe.

93
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,320
Comic cafe?

94
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,330
Yes.

95
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:26,470
There's a big convenience store in front of our academy, right?

96
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,740
There's a new one that opened up there.

97
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,940
It's underground. It's huge.

98
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,820
Really?

99
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,210
It's 1,800 won an hour. It's cheap, right?

100
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,270
Yes, it's good.

101
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,320
Let's go.

102
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,180
Just three hours. My treat.

103
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,730
No, it's my treat.

104
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,770
Okay, it's on you.

105
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,520
What?

106
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,460
I just changed my mind.

107
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,320
No, it's on you.

108
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,950
No, it's on you.

109
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,580
Let's go.

110
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,830
Let's go.

111
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,860
[Everyone needs to purchase a drink]

112
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:09,390
Two lemonades and three hours for two.

113
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,450
I'll pay.

114
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,160
Forget it. You don't have money.

115
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,990
Do you have money, then?

116
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,120
My mom said she won prize money and gave me some.

117
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,330
Here you go.

118
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,039
It's cold.

119
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,360
-Hey. -What?

120
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,100
Let's drink together when we get into university.

121
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,670
You're a model student yet you're thinking about things like this.

122
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,750
Fine.

123
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,050
Who do you think can drink better?

124
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,890
Me, of course.

125
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,210
How can you be so arbitrary?

126
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,410
You'll know in March next year.

127
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,400
I heard you can go on a blind date in college

128
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,710
and get a girlfriend at school.

129
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,250
Are you going to do the same?

130
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,070
I will introduce you to the prettiest girl in our department.

131
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,570
Do you know why?

132
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,290
Because I want to date the prettiest girl in our school.

133
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,250
Kekeke.

134
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,770
I need to use the bathroom.

135
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,160
It's cold. I keep wanting to go to the bathroom.

136
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:15,820
[Hey Seo Hanjoon, are you hanging out only with Yoojae cause you heard he's moving out?]
[What do you mean?]
[Jo Yoojae's father made a fortune in the stock market. Didn't Yoojae tell you? Seriously?]

137
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,420
[Even I heard about it.]
[You're his closest friend yet you still don't know?]

138
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,280
-Hey– -Jo Yoojae.

139
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,940
Hey!

140
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,890
We've already paid. Where are you going?

141
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,420
Here. It's fine now then, right?

142
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,230
Are you mad because I didn't tell you about me moving?

143
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,740
I heard your dad made a fortune in the stock market.

144
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,150
About that...

145
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,680
About that?

146
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,790
Why didn't you tell me?

147
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,170
Do you think I'll be jealous of you?

148
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,300
What are you talking about?

149
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,840
I'm the first person who'd want to congratulate you the most.

150
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,410
I'd be happy for you more than anyone else.

151
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,970
Then why are you angry?

152
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,690
You should've told me first.

153
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,630
Hey.

154
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:31,500
Do you know how much my parents call people to show it off everyday?

155
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,440
That's why the rumor spread. I didn't say anything.

156
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,220
To put it bluntly, it's not my money.

157
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,760
Then you should've told me.

158
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,670
-To me– -I couldn't tell you.

159
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,800
Because of your family...

160
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,380
My family? What about my family?

161
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,520
Your mom is moving to Daejeon.

162
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,120
She said she finally found a job as a kitchen assistant.

163
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,690
Is that so?

164
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,410
You have a friend who can't be happy for you,

165
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,920
you have to worry about him,

166
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,990
and this friend is also poor and pitiful.

167
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,800
You must be having a hard time, Jo Yoojae.

168
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:31,580
You know what?

169
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,120
The fact that my family is poor only made me feel inconvenienced.

170
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,510
But now because of you, it's my first time feeling so embarrassed it's driving me crazy.

171
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,800
Leave me alone then.

172
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,350
I found a place nearby.

173
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,780
Take your stuff and move in.

174
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,920
Don't worry about me.

175
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,110
When I move to Daejeon,

176
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,650
the restaurant over there will be nice to me.

177
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:41,840
I'll hold out until your college entrance exam no matter what.

178
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,480
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,030
For making you suffer because of your incompetent parents.

180
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,940
My son.

181
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,540
What are you going to do now?

182
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,050
What?

183
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,120
School violence?

184
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,980
So that means Seo Hanjoon is hurt only cause Jo Yoojae hit him?

185
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,660
That's right.

186
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,320
What if he hurt his handsome face?

187
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,280
Exactly.

188
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,680
Hey, did you know?

189
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,260
Seo Hanjoon is learning boxing.

190
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,150
Really?

191
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,860
-Yes. -Really?

192
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,360
Oh shit.

193
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,500
[No violence]

194
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,960
Seo Hanjoon, the teacher is asking for you.

195
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,330
-What? Okay. -The teachers seem to know too.

196
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,630
You don't have to go to the teachers' office.

197
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,610
Why are you looking like this?

198
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,240
What do you mean?

199
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,850
Your face is swollen.

200
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,950
I have never pitied you.

201
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,520
You know that, right?

202
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,740
Anyway, I'm sorry.

203
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,800
You're right about how I should've told you from the start.

204
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:26,260
No.

205
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,520
I wouldn't have said it if I were you.

206
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,850
I'm sorry for hurting your face.

207
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,680
Does it hurt a lot?

208
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,570
Yes, it hurts so much. Right here...

209
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,280
Really? Let me see.

210
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,360
Seriously.

211
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,990
Oh, right.

212
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,740
Here.

213
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,290
Here. Help me put this on.

214
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,690
You should've put it on at school.

215
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,630
I didn't do it on purpose.

216
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,950
Why?

217
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,800
Hey. If I look pitiful,

218
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,880
that's when you'd be worried about me.

219
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,750
Come here and put it on for me.

220
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,030
It hurts.

221
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,440
Hey.

222
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,980
Should we live together?

223
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,360
A-a-are you crazy?

224
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,150
No.

225
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,980
You need to find a place after the college entrance exam.

226
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,720
I'm going to move out after I get into college.

227
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,090
What do you think?

228
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,970
Hey, pull yourself together.

229
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,430
You've been doing well. Don't lose at the last moment.

230
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:29,110
I know it's hard for your family.

231
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,580
So we must do well in one go

232
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,950
and get into a university proudly...

233
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,480
and then...

234
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,250
Live together?

235
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,810
Yes. It'd be fun, right?

236
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,970
Yes.

237
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,990
It's going to rain. Let's go.

238
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:58,210
Okay.

239
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,480
Let's go.

240
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,910
It's okay. That's enough.

241
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,840
You're so sloppy. Your shoelaces came off.

242
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:34,350
Let's go.

243
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,860
