00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,020
I'm leaving now.

187
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,090
Okay. Bye.

00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,990
Call me tomorrow.

189
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,420
Okay.

190
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,830
I took it out to throw it away.

191
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,580
Can I throw it for you?

192
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,070
What? Sure.

193
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,040
Bye.

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,109
Bye. Take care.
