[Star Struck]

5
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,020
Star... struck?

6
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,090
Star sign?

7
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,600
Horoscope.

8
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,070
Track star?

9
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,740
Runner.

10
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,270
Star shell?

11
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,940
Flare.

12
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,350
Star struck?

13
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,280
Um...

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,120
One, two—

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,130
No, wait.

16
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,860
I'll get it. I know what it means.

17
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,030
Star struck?

18
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,950
Gosh.

19
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,080
I know what it means.

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,580
Star struck...

21
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,820
[Seo Hanjoon, are you still asleep?
If you don't come out before I count to ten, I'm breaking in.]

22
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,400
Darn it.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
Wait!

24
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,560
You scared me.

25
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,780
Hey, where were you?

26
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,570
Huh? Oh, I just... did my morning exercise.

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,250
Hey.

28
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,760
Don't you know that it's important to take good care of yourself from now on?

29
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,690
Why are you running around in the morning?

30
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,590
Why... are you so nice to me?

31
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,870
Well...

32
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,590
Because we're each other's only...

33
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,410
The only...?

34
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,580
best friend.

35
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,490
Right, best friend.

36
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,700
What is this?
Why did you buy so many things?

37
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,800
Why are the receipts there?

38
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,810
Well,

39
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,710
my mom told me to get this and that to decorate my room.

40
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,250
I see.

41
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,240
You must be really happy to have moved into a big house.

42
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,720
It's not bad, but there's one perk.

43
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,770
What is it?

44
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,600
I can't really hear my parents when they fight.

45
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,850
I can finally be in peace.

46
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,060
Have they been fighting lately too?

47
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,360
I...

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,829
I thought my parents fought all the time because we were poor.

49
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,770
But that wasn't the reason.

50
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,220
We're so rich now, but they're fighting even more.

51
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,440
What do you think is going on?

52
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,570
I'm sure it'll get better gradually.
You've even moved into a big house.

53
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,150
Who knows?

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,510
Once I get into college, I'll move out right away.

55
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,540
If I were you, I would stay in the family's apartment.

56
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,120
I don't want to.

57
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,150
Why?

58
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,860
I can't believe you've forgotten about it.

59
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,200
About what?

60
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,990
Didn't we agree to live together?

61
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,740
Right.

62
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,880
Right?

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,330
Yes.

64
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,770
On that note, let's go to your house today

65
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,480
to eat and study together.

66
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,090
It's been a while since I've had your mom's side dishes.

67
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,120
Um, I can't do that today.

68
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,200
Why?

69
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,550
I'm going to the boxing gym.

70
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,890
Are you going to go clean the gym even right before the college entrance exam?

71
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,230
I'm going to be late. Let's go.

72
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,250
Come on, hurry.

73
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,220
Your gym manager's too much.

74
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,250
Wow, this is awesome!

75
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,540
Me too.

76
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,240
May we ace the college entrance exam!

77
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,490
Ace the exam!

78
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,770
Ace the college entrance exam! Ace the college entrance exam!

79
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,090
May Hanjoon and Yoojae ace the college entrance exam!

80
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,840
Don't you think

81
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,450
it feels like we've traveled to a faraway place?

82
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,880
Yes, it does.

83
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,670
Hey.

84
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:42,050
When we become college students,

85
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,190
let's go on a trip together every vacation.

86
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,070
Just the two of us traveling together?

87
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,720
In our freshman year, we wouldn't have much to spare, so let's go to Busan.

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,400
In our sophomore year, let's go overseas?

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,240
I'm excited just thinking about it.

90
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,020
Right?

91
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,410
Where do you want to go?

92
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,370
I want to go to... New Zealand.

93
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,250
I want to go swimming there. Don't you know that phrase,

94
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,410
"New Zealand from penguin".

95
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,690
Don't you know that?

96
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,680
Why are you suddenly talking about penguins?

97
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,520
They're cute when they walk.

98
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
What about you?

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,340
Well, I...

100
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,700
Wherever I go...

101
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,010
as long as it's with you,

102
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,820
I'd be happy.

103
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,909
Are you okay?

104
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,690
Okay, repeat after me.

105
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,020
"New Zealand from penguin".

106
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,950
Repeat after me.

107
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,950
"New Zealand from penguin".

108
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,070
That's where Jo Yoojae will go!

109
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,190
That's where Seo Hanjoon will go too!

110
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,530
Let's go!

111
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:23,700
Gyeonggido Office of Education, District No. 15, Exam Hall No. 19

112
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,880
Here.

113
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,790
I've read somewhere that

114
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,260
ginkgo leaves bring good luck.

115
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,050
You and I at the same exam hall,

116
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,380
with the leaf of luck.

117
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,610
It's a good sign, right?

118
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,240
It sure is.

119
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,350
Right, I have something for you too.

120
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,180
[May you ace the college entrance exam!]

121
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,410
What's this?

122
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,030
Good luck on your exam tomorrow.

123
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,290
Why did you prepare this?

124
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,010
Now I feel bad.

125
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,230
I didn't prepare anything for you.

126
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,350
It's nothing.

127
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,090
I happened to see it at the convenience store nearby, so I just bought one.

128
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,540
Thank you.

129
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,620
[May you ace the college entrance exam!]

130
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,780
[Ace the college entrance exam
with these chocolate
20,000]

131
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,790
Oh? It's snowing.

132
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,500
[To all the students taking the 2023 college entrance exam, good luck!
We love you and we're rooting for you.]

133
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,350
How was it? Did you try calculating your score?

134
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,920
It's your mom.

135
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh... Mom.

136
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,360
Sorry, I thought you were Yoojae.

137
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,530
You sound so cheerful.

138
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,790
Did my son do well?

139
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,120
It should be a combined deduction of about 8 points for Korean, English, and math.

140
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,950
Mom, Yoojae is calling me now.

141
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,930
Sorry. Hang on.

142
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,540
Fine.

143
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,260
Yoojae is more important to you than me, right?

144
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,110
Good job, my son.

145
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,800
Hey, how was it? Did you do well?

146
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,440
It was okay.

147
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,410
Really? Me too.

148
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,640
It's such a relief for the both of us, right?

149
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,980
You're at home now, right?

150
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,180
Yeah.

151
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,950
I'll go to your house now.

152
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,260
Sure.

153
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,220
Hey, wait.

154
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,440
Why?

155
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,400
Um...

156
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,740
Wait for me. I'm almost there.

157
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,100
Oh no.

158
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,630
Well...

159
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,280
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

160
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,100
This is a temporary place anyway.

161
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,300
The college entrance exam was around the corner and I didn't think it was the right time to bring up other matters.

162
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,050
Are you kidding me?

163
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,630
What?

164
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,400
Then you shouldn't have gotten mad at me that time.

165
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,900
When I didn't mention my family's matters then,

166
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,020
who was the one that made a fuss?

167
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,450
That's...

168
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,750
Yes, you're right.

169
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,290
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,430
You're sorry?

171
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,520
-I didn't want you to worry—
-Seo Hanjoon!

172
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,090
Don't try to preserve your dignity in front of me.

173
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,130
I'm not!

174
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,600
Really?

175
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,470
If that's not it, then why did you buy me something expensive,

176
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,140
when you don't even have enough money to eat?

177
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,970
Why did you buy me something so expensive?

178
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,470
Now that you've seen me move into an apartment and shop pompously at department stores,

179
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,160
did you assume that it was necessary to buy me expensive stuff?

180
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,010
I told you that's not it.

181
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,420
Then what is it?

182
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,710
It was all for your own good.

183
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,270
Was it also for my own good that you didn't tell me?

184
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,920
Yes.

185
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,620
Was it also for my own good that you bought expensive chocolate for me, even though you have to starve all the time?

186
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,030
Yes!

187
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,340
Do you think you're making sense right now?

188
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,290
If you think I'm full of myself, just say it.

189
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,080
Don't try to preserve your dignity like a fool!

190
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,310
I did all that because I like you.

191
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:29,420
What?

192
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,240
Because I like you.

193
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,850
Are you kidding me?

194
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,280
I bought the chocolate that was more expensive than my meals

195
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,320
not because I wanted to preserve my dignity,

196
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,470
but because that's how much I like you.

197
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,440
Because I like you a lot.

198
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,240
Because I like you a lot!

199
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,910
What the hell. What are you talking about?

200
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,310
Why... are you so nice to me?

201
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,520
Well...

202
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:29,080
Because we're each other's only...

203
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,330
best friend.

204
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,130
I want to date you.

205
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,040
What?

206
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,000
I want to date you! You... jerk.

207
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,020
