185
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,820
There's still some of that burdock root side dish left, right?

186
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,860
I can't believe you're so foolish, why haven't you eaten yet?

187
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,370
You ate dinner already? With whom?

188
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,390
When I went to the boxing gym,

189
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,490
because I brought a friend, the gym manager bought us black bean noodles.

190
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,110
A friend?

191
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,050
Yes.

192
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,200
Which friend?

193
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,620
Park Jinhwan.

194
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,760
I see.

195
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,810
The gym manager must think he's your best friend,

196
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,420
and not me.

197
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,270
You don't like going to the boxing gym anyway.

198
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,760
And Jinhwan was just passing by and just wanted to have a look inside...

199
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,310
Darn it.

200
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,360
All that's going on inside is reckless punching. What's there to see?

201
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,870
It's not reckless punching. It's an official sport.

202
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,400
Cut the crap.

203
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,330
Jo Yoojae, don't talk like that.

204
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,770
What do you mean?

205
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,930
Don't say things that would hurt others!

[Hanjoon's mom]

207
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,290
Hello, Yoojae's mom.

208
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,650
Why are you not answering my calls?

209
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:06,080
I get it.

210
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,630
It must be really hectic receiving so many congratulatory calls.

211
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,030
You must be so happy.

212
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,660
As the saying goes, hard work pays off.

213
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,650
That saying really applies to your family.

214
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,860
You're blessed because you're always so kind.

215
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,150
Hello, auntie. I'm Yoojae.

216
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,560
Oh, it's Yoojae.

217
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,200
Gosh, I thought it was your mom.

218
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,040
I think she went out for a while.

219
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,420
When she comes back, I'll tell her you called.

220
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,930
Okay.

221
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,520
Well...

222
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,640
please let her know.

223
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,200
Yes.

224
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,620
Hang on.

225
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,320
My mom is back.

226
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,320
Hello, Hanjoon's mom.

227
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,280
Yes.

228
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,640
I see.

229
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,240
Yes.

230
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,780
