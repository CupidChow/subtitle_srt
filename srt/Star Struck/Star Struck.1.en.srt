[Good night]

184
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,080
Everyone, remember this.

185
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,480
Hello, I'm Seo Hanjoon.

186
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,030
It’s my first day here.

187
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,600
My name is Park Jinhwan.

188
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,910
How long have you been studying here?

189
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,300
For more than a year.

190
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,890
I see.

191
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,650
I got this scar when I was boxing.

192
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,910
I work part-time at a boxing gym.

193
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,960
The gym owner teaches me how to box for free.

194
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,850
I see, boxing...

195
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,800
It's fun. Do you want to try?

196
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,760
What?

197
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,280
Okay.

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,060
Curl your fingers into a fist.

199
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,560
Like this?

200
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,700
You'll hurt your thumb.

201
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,070
You need to loosen your thumb a little and gently hold your fist.

202
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,650
Like this.

203
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,650
One, two.

204
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,080
But if you haven't thrown your punch, put your hand next to your cheek.

205
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,780
Like this.

206
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,770
You got into the first class in with your first test.

207
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,300
[God of Study!]

208
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,650
It's indeed quite shocking.

209
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,350
Hey, Gyu.

210
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,530
Seo Hanjoon was always a top student.

211
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,180
What? Are we in the same class?

212
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,340
No, no. Yoojae and I are in the next class.

213
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,770
Second class.

214
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,320
And Gyu is in... The next, next class. Third class.

215
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,740
[God of Study!]

216
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,660
Watch me, Lee Ingyu.

217
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,940
I will jump from third to first class.

218
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,100
[God of Study]

219
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,370
The God of Study.

220
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,640
Please.

221
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,330
He likes Yoon Chaeyoung.

222
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,540
He likes her, but he never has expectations.

223
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,460
I don't think he's hopeful towards her,

224
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,810
nor does he want to develop anything with her.

225
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,260
It's totally a crush.

226
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
What's wrong?

227
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,970
Nothing.

228
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,500
[Chaeyoung likes Jo Yoojae, right?]

229
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,780
I need to lose weight.

230
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,760
Really?

231
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,970
Look. That's for three.

232
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,560
No, two servings.

233
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,080
-They're cute. -What? They're cute?

234
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,530
They look good together.

235
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,630
Right?

236
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,180
Yes.

237
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,840
-It's pretty. -It's really cute.

238
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,070
Does Jo Yoojae like Yoon Chaeyoung too?

239
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,870
I'm not sure.

240
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,120
Aren't you best friends?

241
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,830
Do best friends need to know everything about each other?

242
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,220
No. I'm sorry.

243
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,270
Looks like I asked something I shouldn't have.

244
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,690
It's none of my business anyway.

245
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,450
I'm leaving.

246
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,560
Okay.

247
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,090
Hanjoon.

248
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,900
Today is your first day at the academy.

249
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,360
Tell me how you feel.

250
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,450
The academy is not as good as I thought.

251
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,670
Listen.

252
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:35,200
That's because you haven't seen the self-study room.

253
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,040
That's right.

254
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,550
The air conditioner is strong.

255
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,620
And there's an air purifier too. The air is so fresh.

256
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,940
I come here every weekend to study.

257
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,300
So come here to study from now on.

258
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,100
Then Yoojae will follow you naturally.

259
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,580
You get me, right?

260
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,030
The 13th question of mathematics, the arithmetic question.

261
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,630
I can't figure it out.

262
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,540
Teach me.

263
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,020
