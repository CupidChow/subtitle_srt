178
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,630
My youngest sister, Fuyuko-chan, is bright and adorable.

179
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,980
She also has many friends at school.

180
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,310
I am proud to call them all...

181
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,420
To call them all your sisters?

182
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,760
Yes.

183
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:25,110
Harue Onee-san is wed, yet helps our father with his business, and...

184
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,230
My apologies.

185
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,060
It must be quite boring to hear me ramble about my family.

186
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,220
I don't mind.

187
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,120
Please, let me hear more.

188
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,740
Well...

189
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,520
Akina Onee-san quit her job in the department store upon marriage.

190
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,630
However...

191
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,910
Natsumi-san? Is everything all right?

192
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:04,850
Well, when you stare at me like that...

193
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,310
I get quite embarrassed.

194
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,120
A-Ah, I see.

195
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,960
I understand.

196
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:25,620
I promise not to stare, but with your permission...

197
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,220
May I...

198
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,380
touch you instead?

199
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,980
I-If that is too much,

200
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,450
I would like to at least come a bit closer.

201
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,440
Takimasa-sama...

202
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,230
Natsumi-san...

203
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,000
Natsumi-san?

204
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,940
Natsumi-san?

205
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,880
Natsumi-san?

206
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,410
Natsumi-san? Natsumi-san!

207
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,700
Natsumi-san? What?

208
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,530
Natsumi-san?

209
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,390
Natsumi-san!

210
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,790
Oh gods...

211
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,830
Water, water.

212
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,070
Ouch!

213
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,270
So you have to wait alone, without knowing when he'll be back?

214
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,070
Long time no see, Natsumi-chan.

215
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:55,510
Since navy men are away for long, it's not so uncommon for their wives to fall for other men.

216
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,600
You've become beautiful.

217
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,860
Seta-kun.

218
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,650
Seta-kun?

219
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,480
Yesterday night...

220
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,590
Takimasa-san and I finally kissed...

221
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,410
Natsumi-san, you're awake!

222
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,360
How are you feeling?

223
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,710
I apologize for last night.

224
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,480
I got ahead of myself.

225
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,050
N-No, I must also apologize for falling asleep.

226
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,500
You passed out due to oxygen deficiency.

227
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,140
In which case, it's my fault.

228
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,380
Oxygen deficiency?

229
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,930
Next time, please breathe through your nose.

230
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,290
Next time...

231
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,010
This is not a topic for the morning.

232
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,290
Agreed.

233
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,440
Shall we get dressed?

234
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:28,320
I asked the innkeeper about various spots we ought to visit.

235
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,690
Let's go a little further to visit there.

236
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,890
Sounds wonderful.

237
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,550
She recommended a sweet shop as well.

238
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,970
Where would that be?

239
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,980
It seems it's close to this shrine here.

240
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,710
What is this marker for?

241
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,050
That was for a delicious udon shop.

242
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,180
Udon? I'd love to give the place a try.

243
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,730
Will you be able to eat both udon and dessert?

244
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,870
I always have room for dessert.

245
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,020
- Ebata-sama!
- Y-Yes! Please!

246
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,980
Pardon me.

247
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,600
Sir, a messenger from the Navy called for you.

248
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,220
His expression hardened in a second.

249
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,090
Sorry, Natsumi-san. I got an urgent call, and I must return to the boat.

250
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,720
We'll most likely be setting sail as soon as I board.

251
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,040
I truly apologize.

252
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,600
It's all right. Please take care out there.

253
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,660
Thank you.

254
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,610
It can't be helped. This is his duty.

255
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,660
We spent the whole night yesterday, didn't we?

256
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,850
That is enough.

257
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,390
That is enough.

258
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,950
What do the other wives do when they're alone?

259
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,500
Ikuko-san told me some wives visit home.

260
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,640
Maybe I should give them a visit for a change as well.

261
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:44,670
But I cannot know when Takimasa-sama will return next.

262
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,110
I will only say this once. Listen well.

263
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,160
And keep still.

264
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,890
I will return to Yokosuka on August 24 after our drills.

265
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,210
- Is that not a militaryー
- Shhhh!

266
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,950
Promise not to tell a soul.

267
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,790
[Sekiya Tokuzo]

268
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,840
One week later, Natsumi found herself back home.

269
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,210
Nacchan?

270
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,250
It's been a while, Fuyu-chan!

271
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,220
- What's the occasion?
- Taki...

272
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,950
I mean, my husband said I could visit home.

273
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,720
What's your husband like? Is he handsome?

274
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,550
- Well...
- Fuyu-chan.

275
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,140
Your mother will scold you for causing a ruckus in front of your house again.

276
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,820
Then it'll be our secret.

277
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,850
Thanks for carrying my bags.

278
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,700
Are you with my father's company? It's nice toー

279
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,930
- By any chanceー
- Long time no see.

280
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:13,910
- What?
- I guess we haven't spoken since elementary school.

281
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Right, Natsumi-chan.

282
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,980
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

283
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,440
Oku-sama.
(*More polite expression of "oku-san")

284
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,610
Would you please confirm this?

285
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,250
My, already? As expected. Thank you.

286
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,180
Natsumi! Welcome home, Dear.

287
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,480
- I'm back.
- Good.

288
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,880
"Sa-ku-ra." Good.

289
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,560
Harue-san. The items you requested.

290
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,650
My, thank you. You were so quick.

291
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,200
Seta Juntaro... Is this really the Seta-kun I knew?

292
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,540
- Mommy, can we go play outside?
- Of course.

293
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,570
- Just be careful.
- We will!

294
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,160
Oh my goodness! they ripped it again...

295
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,960
To think you've forgotten all about me, Natsumi-chan.

296
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,550
No, I... remember.

297
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,610
But you were always chasing me with bugs and snakes.

298
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,640
You stole my books and gave me a weird nickname as well.

299
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,580
My old impression of you is so strong, you seem like a stranger now.

300
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,370
I'm really sorry for all I did when I was a brat.

301
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,950
I guess old memories tend to stick, right?

302
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,500
I honestly thought you'd have forgotten the nickname by now.

303
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,980
How could I? You constantly used it.

304
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,480
Since you no longer go by your maiden name,

305
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,770
I called you by your given name, but was that all right?

306
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,470
It should be.

307
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,370
Do you remember? Your mother once heard me call you "Natsu Mikan."

308
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,440
"Natsu mikan*"?
(*A Japanese summer orange)

309
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,210
I thought I was in for a scolding for sure.

310
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,660
Thank you for always playing with my daughter.

311
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,300
If you like natsu mikans, we have plenty. Here, take some.

312
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,720
I wasn't expecting your mother to misunderstand.

313
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,760
How nostalgic. Those were the days.

314
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,590
- Natsumi, come help me prepare dinner.
- Sure.

315
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,170
- Seta-kun, you'll be joining us, yes?
- Yes.

316
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:36,050
- Thank you for having me all the time.
- Of course.

317
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,520
Oh, you fixed the screen so nicely!

318
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,510
I'll entertain the twins until then.

319
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:43,700
Thank you. I appreciate it.

320
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,950
How ironic.

321
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,350
Her family name changes, and I finally get to call her by name.

322
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,560
Oh my? What a pompous young man.

323
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:07,280
Could he possibly feel a certain way about Natsumi? Oops!

324
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,130
- All together now. Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you.

325
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,420
I've missed this sort of atmosphere.

326
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,090
Your father would have loved to see you, too, Natsumi.

327
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,760
- He's in Osaka on business, right?
- Yes.

328
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,620
He should be back the day after next. Can you stay until then?

329
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,000
Yes, I can.

330
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,390
Will your husband manage at home alone?

331
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,050
Taki...

332
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,740
My husband is on duty for a while.

333
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,990
- How long is a while?
- Well...

334
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,230
Promise not to tell a soul.

335
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,250
It's a military secret. He can't even tell his family.

336
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,380
What's that about?

337
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,140
So you have to wait alone, without knowing when he'll be back?

338
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,790
- Fuyu-chan.
- Well... Yes.

339
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,610
What a coldhearted guy. I feel sorry for you.

340
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:04,060
Fuyu-chan, stop. Don't say that about a man who works for our country.

341
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,750
But that lifestyle sounds so lonely.

342
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,780
Takimasa-sama is kind and cares for me as much as possible.

343
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:16,840
I'm not someone to pity. I'm not lonely, either.

344
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,410
This one.

345
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,770
No.

346
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,550
I fumbled with my outburst yesterday.

347
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,500
I only made everyone worry.

348
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,530
Natsumi-chan.

349
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,180
Do you have a moment?

350
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,890
Come over here.

351
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,750
Welcome home, Fuyu-chan.

352
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,660
I'm sorry about what I said yesterday.

353
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,650
Seta-kun told me more about naval duties on my walk home from school.

354
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,780
I called your husband cold without knowing a thing. I'm sorry.

355
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,990
Don't apologize.

356
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,690
You quite hit the nail on the head.

357
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:14,080
I am a bit lonely after all.

358
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,980
Then I have a great idea.

359
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,940
Gather around, everyone.

360
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,970
But I'm busy.

361
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:29,440
Nacchan, I'm sure that you won't depend on your husband when he goes to work, right?

362
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,440
So let's all teach her how to act sweet on him together!

363
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,070
But I'm busy.

364
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,770
Entertain her; this seems fun.

365
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,970
We shouldn't meddle in the affairs of other couples in the first place.

366
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,060
It'll serve as great reference for Nacchan.

367
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,050
Fuyu-chan, I don't...

368
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,470
Let her do this, Natsumi-chan.

369
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,780
She gave it a lot of thought in her own way.

370
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,620
Nacchan, come here.

371
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,350
I think it would be difficult for you to suddenly act sweet toward him.

372
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,590
So how about this?

373
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,550
"I want ice cream, please?"

374
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,190
- See? So let's start with an easyー
- Yes, we'll get you some.

375
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,740
We have no choice if you insist.

376
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,410
Oh, I feel like you're all treating me like a baby!

377
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,130
Nacchan, now follow my lead and try it on Seta-kun.

378
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,830
Ready, and action.

379
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:22,640
I would like some ice cream.

380
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,050
Keep it casual, all right? That's important.

381
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,890
I want ice cream, please.

382
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,650
Of course.

383
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,020
Perfect. How was that, you two?

384
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,860
I think that was good.

385
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,860
I believe Takimasa-sama would respond by saying,

386
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,650
- "I see no issue with that."
- There's no issue here.

387
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,680
I see no issue.

388
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:53,860
It's a sort of catchphrase of his.

389
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,110
Haru-Nee* , your turn for advice.
(*A casual expression of "an older sister)

390
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,660
A wife supports her husband; she does not depend on him.

391
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,370
Oh, come on...

392
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:07,220
In that case, your mother has an easy trick you can use.

393
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,020
- What?
- Here.

394
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:17,470
First, make a downcast gaze, without looking too far down.

395
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,730
Then, gently grasp your husband's sleeve.

396
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:24,420
Make sure to use your thumb and pointer finger.

397
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,060
Seta-kun, would you?

398
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,350
Yes, madam.

399
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,150
Yes, perfect.

400
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,610
Now slowly gaze up at him...

401
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,240
Tilt your neck,

402
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,710
look him straight in the eyes, and say...

403
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,700
Takimasa-sama?

404
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,830
My, calling his given name sounds so sweet!

405
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,160
Gosh, this is embarrassing...

406
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,770
What a technique! How was it?

407
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:56,080
I think it would be effective.

408
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,620
Men are weak to these sorts of things.

409
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,240
I figured.

410
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:04,720
- She said, "Takimasa-sama."
- If you'll excuse me.

411
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,500
- So?
- What?

412
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,550
How do you feel now?

413
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,070
We're out here on the sea for another two months.

414
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,130
Quit griping, I'll take you to a good res next time we're on land.

415
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,040
"Res" means a high-end Japanese restaurant.

416
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,220
You'd better bring an "inch," Fukami-san.

417
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,150
"Inch" means a geisha one is well acquainted with.

418
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,770
I have no inches.

419
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,230
What? Why not?

420
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,720
Because it's just a hassle.

421
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,600
- See you.
- Later, Sir.

422
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,080
Getting excited for S-play already? What a hasty bunch.

423
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,880
"S-play" is a codeword for "playing around with geisha's."

424
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,080
Conversations of the sort were rather crude to discuss in public.

425
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,870
Hence, the many codewords and slang.

426
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,540
I wonder if Natsumi-san has made it back to her home by now.

427
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,730
Someone's looking rather jovial.

428
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,710
Fukami.

429
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:12,330
You used to be all about work and look at you now, giddy with a wife.

430
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,180
Leave, I am not "giddy."

431
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,510
Your chopsticks are backward.

432
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,280
In any case, quit messing with people like that.

433
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,100
Say, are you going to buy the wife a souvenir?

434
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:38,250
- No.
- Why not bring her flowers like a Western man?

435
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,900
- Flowers?
- Being considerate is important, you know.

436
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,920
Since navy men are away for long,

437
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:49,720
it's not so uncommon for their wives to fall for other men.

438
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,210
What?

439
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:54,510
Natsumi-san would never.

440
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,680
- Your concern is unnecessary.
- What an irritating expression.

441
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,920
Quit en-ing me unconsciously, will you?

442
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,570
"En-ing" is boasting about one's wife or lover.

443
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,320
Oh well, act nonchalant while you can.

444
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,580
Seta-kun.

445
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,560
- Thank you for everything today.
- It was nothing.

446
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,840
How long do you plan on staying?

447
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,620
I'll be heading back once I greet my father tomorrow.

448
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,160
Then we won't see each other for a while.

449
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,290
Next time, I'll be sure to visit with Takimasa-sama.

450
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,690
Right.

451
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,650
Natsumi-chan.

452
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,440
You're smitten with your husband, aren't you?

453
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:42,390
Wh-What? I am not... to that extent.

454
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,260
I simply respect him.

455
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:52,360
You sure? You look like a boiled octopus.

456
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,580
That's because you've suddenly begun to tease me again although I thought you changed.

457
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,000
Don't be mean to me.

458
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,700
Of couse, I put on a nice front.

459
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,770
This is my employer's home, after all.

460
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,730
You haven't changed one bit, Natsumi-chan.

461
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,560
And one more thing.

462
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,230
You've become beautiful.

463
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,350
Well then, take care, Natsumi-chan.

464
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,250
You too, Seta-kun.

465
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,910
Two more months pass, and summer comes to a close.

466
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:38,150
The public was abuzz, as a Japanese swimmer made history

467
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,690
being the first Japanese woman to place on the Olympic podium.

468
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,540
And thus came August 24,

469
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,770
when Takimasa was set to return to Yokosuka.

470
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,550
I want to give my regards to your wife since we're here.

471
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:56,300
I got impatient.

472
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,260
Natsumi-san, you couldn't have!

473
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,640
Takimasa-sama, there is something I must speak to you about.

474
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,370
Takimasa. Your delusions are running wild.

475
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,660
Oh, Ebata!

476
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,350
We're finally back on land so why do you look stiff?

477
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,120
This is how I always look.

478
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,590
You'll scare your wife.

479
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,430
I told you I always look like this.

480
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,180
Does your wife use her maiden name?

481
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,170
Of course not.

482
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,810
Is she cute? Or is she pretty?

483
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,200
Why are you tailing me?

484
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,500
You live the other way. You should go home now.

485
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,110
Why? Do you have to ask?

486
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,940
I want to give my regards to your wife since we're here.

487
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,240
You're just enjoying this.

488
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,020
Hey, hold on now.

489
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,120
- Fukami-san!
- Oh!

490
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,720
Kogiku-chan and... Hisamomo-chan, was it?

491
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,480
- You got us mixed up.
- Yes, it's the other way around.

492
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,620
What brings you to these parts?

493
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,890
Our sisters sent us out on an errand.

494
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,780
We'd love to dine with you again.

495
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,590
But of course.

496
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,840
These two are geisha apprentices, also as known as "Hangyoku."

497
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,560
Where are you headed off to alone, Fukami-san?

498
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,540
Oh, I'm not alon...

499
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,920
He got away.

500
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,350
Why not bring her flowers like a Western man?

501
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:22,120
Being considerate is important, you know.

502
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:34,300
Though he arrived at the florist, our Takimasa is now stumped.
[Flower shop]

503
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,350
Welcome.

504
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,290
Were you looking for anything particular?

505
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:44,270
Erm, well, actually...

506
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,230
I came to...

507
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:52,390
Such frivolous actions are impossible for a Japanese man!

508
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,150
I came to ask for directions.

509
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,240
Is that so?

510
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,040
Well...

511
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,180
Sir, where are you headed?

512
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:08,050
Well...

513
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,590
Well...

514
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,560
Damn, I only wasted time.

515
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,210
Natsumi-san.

516
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,820
Takimasa-sama. Welcome home.

517
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,260
I have returned. Were you waiting by the gates for me?

518
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,740
I think I was grinning wide just now.

519
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,620
I got impatient.

520
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,140
I cannot allow her to see me so lax!

521
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,740
I wonder what happened? He looks particularly grim.

522
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,480
Is he perhaps tired?

523
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,450
- Let us head inside.
- Yes.

524
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,160
[Shibahara Kunimitsu]
[Ebata Takimasa]

525
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,990
I knew it; something is amiss with him.

526
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,380
But how should I ask?

527
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,640
What?

528
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,890
Gaze up at him.

529
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,520
Slowly gaze up at him...

530
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,140
Tilt your neck.

531
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,220
Tilt my...

532
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,720
Oh no, I already made eye contact!

533
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,900
I'm so nervous, I got it all wrong!

534
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,440
Wh-What is with this coy behavior?

535
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,420
No, calm yourself, Ebata.

536
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,690
Natsumi-san.

537
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,100
Yes?

538
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:04,820
My short sword rests on that side. Let go of my sleeve.

539
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,070
Right. Of course, my apologies.

540
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:10,890
No worries.

541
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,990
What is the matter?

542
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,100
My mother and sisters taught me much while I was home.

543
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,980
I see.

544
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,000
Personally, I wouldn't mind if you—

545
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,650
It went so well with Seta-kun, and yet.

546
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,230
"Seta-kun"?

547
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:46,070
Erm, S-Seta-kun?

548
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,000
Did you have a younger brother? Or perhaps a cousin?

549
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,880
No, he is a neighbor and childhood friend.

550
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,860
I met him again after eight years when I visited home.

551
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,780
He hadn't changed at all.

552
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:07,020
It's not so uncommon for navy wives to fall for other men.

553
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,100
No... impossible.

554
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,650
You've become such a beauty.

555
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,690
Seta-kun...

556
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,370
Don't bother with a man who'll leave you lonely.

557
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:18,540
Come to me instead.

558
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,910
I will convince your father one way or another.

559
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,850
Thank you. I'm so happy.

560
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,030
Natsumi-san, you couldn't have!

561
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,750
Takimasa. Your delusions are running wild.

562
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,420
I will prepare dinner.

563
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,340
Please relax, Takimasa-sama.

564
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,940
[Seta-kun]

565
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,080
[Seta-kun]

566
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,290
Who the hell is this man?

567
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,600
Were they secretly fond of each other since childhood?

568
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:58,890
And upon reuniting with him after many years...

569
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,180
What if she made him home-cooked meals?

570
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:08,160
Or... But I've never laid on her lap before!

571
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,210
No, Takimasa. Those are your delusions.

572
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,780
Is everything all right?

573
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,580
Oh, erm, well...

574
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:26,340
You're wearing a smock today.

575
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,040
Yes, to keep my kimono clean.

576
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,080
I embroidered some ocean waves onto my pocket as well.

577
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,390
You're quite dexterous.

578
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,010
Embroidery has always been a favorite pastime of mine.

579
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,820
In situations like these, I ought to compliment her, right?

580
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,180
I...

581
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,990
I see no issue with that.

582
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,050
That's wonderful to hear.

583
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:02,360
Oh gosh, I left the pot on the flame!

584
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,910
Please give me a moment longer for dinner.

585
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:10,740
I'm sure if I lived with her every day, I wouldn't worry about other men.

586
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,390
How does that taste?

587
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,170
I see no issue with it.

588
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:28,850
Just say it tastes good, Takimasa.

589
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,470
Well...

590
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,120
Takimasa-sama, there is something I must speak to you about.

591
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,480
What?

592
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,620
No, can this be?

593
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:46,060
Actually, there is another man I've pined for since long ago.

594
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,410
Takimasa, knock it off already.

595
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,280
Understood.

596
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,780
Go ahead.

597
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,230
Well...

598
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:10,880
How can my cooking taste more like your mother's?

599
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,950
- Oh.
- Yes.

600
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:21,310
I hesitated since you are not one to bring up your parents,

601
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,140
but taste is an important matter after all.

602
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,900
S-So that's what you wished to ask.

603
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:34,810
My mother was frail and seasoned her dishes sparingly.

604
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,070
Then I will also—

605
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,600
But as a child, I always felt it was a bit lacking.

606
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,350
Natsumi-san, your cooking suits my tastebuds far more.

607
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,820
Your seasoning...

608
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,450
is my preference.

609
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:02,770
I am happy to hear that.

610
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,620
The Sekiya household tends to cut down on the sugar.

611
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,920
My mother and sister taught me their cooking tips when I visited home.

612
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,020
Your home.

613
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,530
If I may ask,

614
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:25,980
is this Se... Se...

615
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,000
Were you able to relax while you were home?

616
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,810
Yes, quite a bit. Thanks to you.

617
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,270
That's great to hear.

618
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:42,360
Was the whole family doing well?

619
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,510
Yes, they were.

620
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:50,850
My father wanted to meet you, Takimasa-sama.

621
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,530
My nieces were bounding with energy as well.

622
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,290
Fuyu-chan and Seta-kun were also—

623
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:03,260
Is that... Se-what's-his-name,

624
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,090
a childhood friend of yours?

625
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,420
Yes.

626
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,530
He's always been quite the bully. When I visited the other day...

627
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:15,230
You're smitten with your husband, aren't you?

628
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,510
Oh gosh, don't remember!

629
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:24,450
But enough about him.

630
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,610
Why is she turning red?

631
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,690
Does she really...

632
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,950
No, it can't be!

633
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:49,410
When I am finished, please prepare the bath for me posthaste.

634
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,960
I request you bathe quickly as well.

635
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:54,940
Pardon? I mean...

636
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,420
Yes, of course.

637
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:02,000
Tonight, we will see our first night to its end.

638
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,220
Pardon?

00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,860
I am only here to assist.

649
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,710
How graceful!

650
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:48,900
I imagined what it would be like to have a child like you, Takimasa-sama.

651
