1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:04,910
The year is 1937.
[Katsudo-Benshi]

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:11,550
One year has passed since
Natsumi wed the navy sub-lieutenant, Takimasa Ebata.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,850
This is also when Takimasa meets Natsumi's father
for the first time.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,840
Meanwhile, matchmaking was underway
between Fumiko and Fukami.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,920
If I am to marry, I shall quit my work.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,820
While touring the ship Takimasa is stationed at,
Natsumi witnesses him with a woman.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,460
She's a bit close, is she not?

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,970
However, the incident turns out to be a misunderstanding.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,470
I am the only woman who is privy to your "yeah".

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,980
Yeah.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,510
Fuyuko, boil the water.

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,910
- Prepare the alcohol and cotton as well.
- Right.

13
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,820
Don't forget a hot water bottle.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,470
Harue, I've come to help.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,820
Perfect timing, Natsumi. Get her some drinking water, will you?

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,270
I've never witnessed a pregnancy before.

17
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:08,540
I ought to help with the heavy-lifting.

18
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,580
This will take a while, so please make yourselves comfortable.

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,760
Pardon? But...

20
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,830
Alright.

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:17,450
The guest house is all yours, Mr. Takimasa.

22
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,720
- Right...
- Come on in.

23
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,460
Y-Yes, sir.

24
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,720
I am Yoko Yoshimori, a second year at Saint Aria Girls School.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,880
Shuichi Yoshimori, Grade 4 at Jinjo Elementary.

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,580
I am Ryunosuke Fukami, a sub-lieutenant of the Imperial Navy.
Nice to meet you both.

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,410
This is my younger brother and sister.

29
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,900
I'm terribly sorry, but they insisted on coming along.

30
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,420
Perhaps I should have left them at home after all...

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,250
We have come to ask you a number of questions today.

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,630
- We must find his faults, and tell Father.
- We must find his faults, and tell Father.

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,690
Their intent is glaringly obvious.

34
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,020
Though I'd like this to go without much fuss...

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,350
This man plans on messing with these kids.

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,890
- Say, perhaps we...
- I understand you're deeply concerned for your sister.

37
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,560
Ask me anything.

38
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,050
Thank you, sir.

39
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,750
First, why have you invited her out today?

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,200
Heading to Tokyo is a trip for us.

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:27,210
It's my day off, so I thought to invite Ms. Fumiko
to a play I thought she would enjoy.

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,220
He gets passing marks so far.

43
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,760
- Now to the real question.
- Go ahead.

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,520
Why did you choose our sister?

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,950
We will have our father call off the matchmaking,
if we deem your answer unworthy.

46
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,380
As this is her first birth, it will last into the night,

47
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,530
or early into the morning.

48
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,370
That long?

49
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,180
Was it like this for you too, Harue?

50
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,050
Yes. I suppose you wouldn't know,
because I gave birth at a hospital.

51
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,650
Mother, I will watch over her.

52
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,810
Please do.

53
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,680
What should I do?

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,560
Help us see this through.
You'll need this knowledge for the future.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,750
That's right.

56
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,040
Mr. Takimasa may not be around when my time comes.

57
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,820
I may need to rely on Mrs. Ikuko, or experience childbirth at home.

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,350
I ought to be prepared for anything.

59
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:30,700
I'd like Nacchan to watch over me.

60
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:38,420
I've told my folks I was looking for an individual
whom I could entrust the home to.

61
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,650
But the truth is,
I simply wish to get better acquainted with Ms. Fumiko.

62
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,380
That is why I'm incredibly jealous of the knowledge
you two must share.

63
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,400
We're experts when it comes to our older sister.

64
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,790
But our mouths are sealed.

65
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,870
Darn, what a shame. I'll have to study up.

66
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,440
Is making conversation with her the best way to learn more?

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,690
Definitely. Our older sister loves novels, and -

68
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,750
She can name flowers, and birds too!

69
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,260
Really now? Your older sister is amazing.

70
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,780
This man is fishy.

71
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,510
Her expressions are easy to read.

72
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,580
If you do marry our sister, where would you two live?

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:28,290
At my family's second residence in Hayama.
But she's free to return home while I'm away.

74
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,160
Or you two can come visit her instead.

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,350
- He's trying to appease us.
- Will she ever struggle for money?

76
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,270
My job pays, no worries.

77
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,440
But I cannot imagine Ms. Fumiko would mismanage money anyway.

78
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,150
- Flattery?
- Are you really going to make her quit her job?

79
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,060
Unfortunately, my parents insist.

80
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,530
But I'd want her to put those skills to use regardless.

81
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,820
N-No, maybe it's all just talk.

82
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,230
How amusing.

83
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,390
Mr. Fukami's a nice guy.

84
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,350
This calls for something desperate. I'm sorry, dearest sister!

85
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:15,330
The other day we went out for dinner,
when we saw navy men messing with numerous geisha.

86
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,890
Do you not play around with geisha yourself?

87
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,150
Well...

88
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,020
I won't deny I do.

89
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,930
I knew it. My sister doesn't deserve a man who -

90
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,470
But Ms. Fumiko has made all other women
look like mere mannequins to me.

91
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,040
She's truly a sinful woman, you know?

92
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,870
I never realized how draining childbirth was.

93
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,050
- Does it still hurt?
- No, the pain has died down a bit.

94
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,390
Thank goodness.

95
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,990
So it doesn't hurt all the time.

96
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,760
What's wrong?

97
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,920
Tell me.

98
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,020
I never realized what an ordeal childbirth would be.

99
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,130
I'm uncertain if I'll manage when my time comes...

100
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,950
Then watch your sister's fortitude, and remember it well, alright?

101
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,600
Ouch, ouch...

102
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,620
It hurts...

103
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,750
Stay strong...

104
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,120
[Episode 9]

105
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,140
I can't help but be curious.

106
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,760
Excuse me, Mrs. Natsumi.

107
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,750
Yes?

108
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,830
Is something the matter?

109
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,840
No, I only hoped to check in,
since it was taking quite some time...

110
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,610
I'm sorry I've worried you.

111
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,270
The birth will most likely take till morning.

112
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,860
That long?

113
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,510
- Nacchan...
- I'll be right there!

114
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,570
I-Is there anything I can do?

115
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,570
I will call if we need assistance, if you could just wait for now.

116
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,840
- I understand.
- Thank you.

117
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,230
- Of course.
- Then if you'll excuse me.

118
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,620
Wait, for now...

119
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,020
I think he's a good guy.

120
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,290
Perhaps. Still...

121
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,400
Something about him doesn't sit right with me.

122
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,810
Thank you for entertaining their whims.

123
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,520
What do you mean?

124
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,310
You answered their questions more readily than I expected.

125
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,170
I enjoyed myself.

126
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,800
And that last question of theirs.

127
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,270
She has made all other women
look like mere mannequins to me.

128
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,250
She's truly a sinful woman, you know?

129
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,220
You did a fine job evading their accusations with that statement.

130
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,740
Ms. Fumiko.

131
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,210
Though I did tease a bit,
I strived to answer their questions honestly.

132
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,970
In other words...

133
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,880
I don't appreciate being accused of "evading the question".

134
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,950
My apologies. I take back what I've said.

135
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,250
You owe me one.

136
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,320
Say, you two.

137
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,000
Since you've come all this way,
how about I take you someplace nice?

138
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,450
Come on.

139
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,410
Cold!

140
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,000
Seems like I still have a ways to go...

141
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,920
- Did you say something?
- No.

142
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,810
I only hope this will warm them up to me.
I'd rather not resort to desperate measures.

143
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,370
Desperate measures?

144
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:48,550
Well, they are the ones doubting
their respectable sister's keen eye for...

145
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,910
Not another word. They'll begin sulking.

146
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,760
Fumiko!

147
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,200
We can't have that now, can we?

148
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,840
Yes?

149
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,850
You finally looked my way.

150
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,430
I suppose.

151
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,210
Can't get a rise out of her, no matter how I try, huh?

152
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,420
Fumiko.

153
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,160
What's the matter, Yoko?

154
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,830
Here's my chance to get revenge.

155
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,030
Did you see how he was trying to act suave?

156
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,970
Well actually, he was chasing away a bee for...

157
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,610
Hush now, Yoko.

158
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,560
How about you go buy some ice pops with Shuichi?

159
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,440
Okay.

160
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,330
Did you perhaps notice?

161
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,520
I heard the buzzing.

162
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,790
I look so lame.

163
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,420
I will forget it ever happened, if I no longer owe you from earlier.

164
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,590
No, feel free to remember my shame all you like.

165
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,330
Seeing that expression alone is worth my embarrassment.

166
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,510
- What did your husband need?
- He was worried because it was taking so long.

167
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,780
I never took him to be the type to worry.

168
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,820
Your husband was worried for you too, Aki.

169
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,610
Right, because I'm due earlier than anticipated.

170
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:02,810
But his presence doesn't help me now.
He ought to come back tomorrow.

171
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,520
You're so strong, Aki.

172
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,140
I certainly think my sister is strong.

173
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,770
But I had another thought cross my mind.

174
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:20,320
"Can't you only say that,
because your husband can come by tomorrow morning?"

175
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,810
If he were instead out at sea...

176
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,850
Ow...

177
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,960
How could I even entertain such a thought?

178
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,900
I am the absolute worst.

179
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,130
Aki is the one going through a difficult time now.

180
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,480
She even encouraged me despite the circumstances.

181
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,990
Although I did ask you to wait...

182
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,170
I never meant right out at the door.

183
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,000
My apologies. Did you need anything?

184
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:42,900
I feel as though you would watch over me
no matter how far apart we were, Mr. Takimasa.

185
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,710
Mrs. Natsumi?

186
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,400
I will do my best, Mr. Takimasa.

187
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,900
Y-Yes?

188
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,590
But you will catch a cold if you sleep out here.

189
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,850
Please either rest in our guest house, or...

190
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,310
I will bring you a blanket and a pillow.

191
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,840
I can carry those over myself.

192
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,990
Mrs. Natsumi, please return to your sister.

193
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,010
Thank you.

194
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,850
Then I will choose this one.

195
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,940
I hope your siblings made it home safe and sound.

196
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,040
They're familiar with the trains. They will manage just fine.

197
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,260
How beautiful.

198
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,820
I wanted to light them with you, Ms. Fumiko.

199
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,600
Ms. Fumiko.

200
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,260
If I were to die, what would you do?

201
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,470
Come again?

202
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,050
My line of work is unpredictable, so I thought to ask.

203
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:21,000
That is quite the inconsiderate question to ask your betrothed.

204
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,100
I wouldn't ask any ordinary woman.

205
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,980
But I was curious to hear your answer.

206
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,130
If something of that sort were to occur...

207
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,440
Then I would simply consider a different path in life for myself.

208
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,230
I expected nothing less, Ms. Fumiko.

209
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,060
Shall we get going?

210
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,240
Yes.

211
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,040
OW!

212
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,750
W-What the...

213
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,720
Morning, Taki.

214
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Good morning, sir.

215
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,290
He has terrible eye bags.

216
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,540
Ouch!

217
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,700
S-Sir, what is this wailing?

218
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,320
The baby's about to come.

219
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,410
That damn hag!

220
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,720
What's got you so worried about a family of all women?

221
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,460
The hell's wrong with four sisters?

222
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,950
I hear childbirth is as painful as taking a whole watermelon
out of your nostril.

223
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,970
A whole watermelon?

224
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:52,990
Personally, I think putting the watermelon in your nose
would hurt plenty on its own.

225
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,440
- Wouldn't you agree, Taki?
- Y-Yes, sir.

226
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:05,030
So if Mrs. Natsumi and I had a child,
I would be putting her through the very same pain, right?

227
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,580
Not to mention in my case, I would most likely be absent...

228
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,620
Mr. Takimasa.

229
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,880
Thank you for accompanying us throughout that long process.

230
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,910
And a job well done to you as well, Mrs. Natsumi.

231
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,100
I am truly glad it was a safe delivery.

232
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,010
As was I.

233
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:41,190
Please dry up those unsightly tears. You're a father now.

234
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:48,130
I won't be able to celebrate alongside her,
nor provide any comfort.

235
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:56,070
Watching Aki, I had to wonder what it would be like for myself...

236
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,450
What?

237
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,360
Well...

238
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,370
Mr. Takimasa, what do you think of children -

239
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,120
Let us not.

240
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,440
Does Mr. Takimasa not want children?

241
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,200
Use your words, and tell your wife exactly what's on your mind.

242
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,200
You are more important to me than anyone else, Mr. Takimasa.

243
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,290
Taki, we've been deployed.

244
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,160
I... did not cut your hair.

245
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,910
Natsumi, are you home?

246
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,730
Mrs. Ikuko!

247
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,490
I brought some edamame to share.

248
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,690
Wow, thank you!

249
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:05,490
They're one of Taki's favorites as well.

250
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,630
Is that so?

251
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,180
One of Mr. Takimasa's...

252
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,690
What is it, dear? Is everything alright?

253
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,730
I see. So that is what happened.

254
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,990
Perhaps Mr. Takimasa does not want children after all.

255
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:32,310
He certainly may have had that opinion in the past.

256
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,660
Still, what a troublesome boy.
He cannot brush off something so important.

257
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,160
Indeed...

258
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,990
Ah, children...

259
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:52,470
Sorry, dear. I was simply reminiscing.

260
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,600
Long ago, I had my fair share of trouble
regarding children as well.

261
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,090
The year I graduated from school, I fell deeply ill.

262
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,130
I then left my home in Yokohama to receive treatment here.

263
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,530
At that time, my grandparents owned this manor.

264
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,800
One day,

265
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:30,250
my grandfather, who adored the Navy,
brought home Mr. Kunimitsu.

266
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,010
We spoke a number of times and eventually,
I came to think he was a wonderful man.

267
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,410
But I told myself I could not love him.

268
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,660
I held my feelings close to heart.

269
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,790
Why?

270
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:58,310
Because my illness prevented me from having any children.

271
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,020
I was very clear about this to Mr. Kunimitsu as well.

272
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:12,000
I thought we would never see each other again.

273
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,280
Except, half a year later...

274
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,650
Ms. Ikuko. Would you please marry me?

275
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,720
Sir. I cannot give birth to any children.

276
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,370
I do not desire children.

277
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:34,380
I simply wish to grow old with you.

278
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,450
Following our marriage, we were not blessed with any children.

279
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,880
However, I often cared for Mr. Kunimitsu's many subordinates.

280
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,220
With Taki in our lives,

281
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,030
I felt what it was like to have a son.

282
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,990
And I have shared with you, what I would to a daughter of mine.

283
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,190
So I have lived a very fulfilling...

284
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:10,460
What?

285
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,460
Oh dear, you don't need to cry waterfalls.

286
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,680
M-My apologies, ma'am.

287
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,450
But after hearing your story, I couldn't help myself...

288
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:22,170
No rubbing your eyes, dear. You'll only irritate them!

289
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:37,750
Mr. Kunimitsu's straightforward honesty from back then

290
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,860
is the reason I am so happy now.

291
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,190
Natsumi, you must also tell Taki exactly how you feel.

292
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,990
Mr. Takimasa, what do you think of children -

293
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,610
Let us not.

294
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,050
There you are, Ebata.

295
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,080
What's got you all spaced out?

296
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,240
I wonder if I'll be as troubled as you are over my Engage.

297
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,350
Engage is navy slang for "fiancé" or "fiancée".

298
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,070
You got engaged? I hadn't heard!

299
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,400
What a delayed reaction.

300
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,820
I'd only reported it to the higher-ups.

301
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,970
Who's your partner? Mrs. Natsumi's friend?

302
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,260
Yeah.

303
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,160
That's great.

304
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,920
Mrs. Natsumi will be so happy.

305
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,300
Your life seriously revolves around your wife now.

306
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,870
So you're finally Mary-ing.

307
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:54,850
Mary is short for "getting married", or "to marry".

308
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,260
Fukami, you're getting married?

309
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,620
Seriously?

310
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,350
Are you really?

311
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,490
- Yeah.
- Yes!

312
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,250
Finally!

313
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,750
My sister will stop pestering me!

314
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,280
I won't have to act as a messenger for random ladies.

315
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,430
And no more worrying about Fukami
becoming our father-in-law.

316
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,060
Look at you, you MMK.

317
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,800
MMK stands for, "the ever-popular ladies' man".

318
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,640
Who's the lucky lady?

319
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,830
Someone you all don't know.

320
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,710
- You know her, Ebata?
- Can't say I do...

321
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,350
Here, here! I do!

322
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,630
I saw Fukami walking with a lady the other day.

323
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:43,770
She was more beautiful than cute,

324
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,610
but definitely wasn't my type of girl.

325
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,430
She looked like she had a stiff and stuck-up personality, too.

326
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,540
- Say what?
- C-Calm down!

327
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,110
They're only exaggerating to liven up the place.

328
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,020
- Right?
- Yeah. We'll head out now.

329
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,110
Don't say it, I know I'm not acting like myself.

330
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,250
I like this version of you though.

331
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,860
- Huh?
- Now I get to poke fun at you.

332
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,800
Yeah? Try me if you dare.

333
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,550
Go on.

334
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,660
Shove off, man.

335
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,310
So.

336
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,790
What's on your mind?

337
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,030
You noticed?

338
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,810
I bet it has to do with your wife, again.

339
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,740
Don't rub it in...

340
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,650
Did you two fight?

341
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,230
Something like that.

342
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,990
There's only one piece of advice I can give you.

343
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,910
You never explain yourself properly.

344
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:15,560
Use your words, and tell your wife exactly what's on your mind.

345
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,110
- Welcome home.
- Yes...

346
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,420
Will you have dinner immediately?

347
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,000
Well...

348
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,220
- Actually -
- Actually -

349
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,940
Go ahead, Mrs. Natsumi.

350
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,430
No, you first, Mr. Takimasa.

351
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:48,860
In that case, there is something I'd like to discuss with you.

352
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,020
I'm terribly sorry for my actions yesterday.

353
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,420
I believe I caused a misunderstanding with my statement.

354
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,580
I had also wished to speak about that.

355
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,060
What?

356
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:18,560
Mr. Takimasa. Do you not want children?

357
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:26,160
That was what I had thought, yes.

358
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,450
I no longer have a home to inherit.

359
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,990
I had no need for a spouse, nor children.

360
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,000
I assumed I would live, and die alone.

361
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,160
But then I married you, Mrs. Natsumi.

362
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,980
And I learned how reassuring it was to have a home to return to.

363
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,880
I believe having a child with you would be exciting.

364
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,030
- In that case -
- However...

365
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:05,030
I never realized how challenging childbirth truly was.

366
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,010
I do not want to make you go through such -

367
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,200
I will be okay.

368
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,680
I will manage just fine.

369
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,220
Helping Aki has prepared my heart for it.

370
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,430
That is not my only worry.

371
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:32,210
Mrs. Natsumi. I will surely end up leaving you alone.

372
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,930
I am fully prepared to give birth to a child alone.

373
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:47,050
Perhaps you will be out at sea, unable to rush to my side.

374
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,030
But I will be okay.

375
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:55,490
Why do you insist?

376
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,540
Because...

377
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:06,210
I wish to have your child, Mr. Takimasa.

378
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:15,840
Because you are more important to me than anyone else.

379
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,010
I'm certain a child with your features would look adorable.

380
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,620
No, a child with your features would be far more adorable...

381
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:35,210
We had a similar conversation quite some time ago, haven't we?

382
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,990
Yes, we did.

383
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,830
I understand.

384
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:57,200
If you have made your resolve, then I will ready myself as well.

385
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,950
I am glad we were able to talk about this.

386
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,050
As am I.

387
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:17,420
There is just... one thing I must ask you to forgive.

388
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:19,150
Yes?

389
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:27,750
When I am giving birth, I may scream a plethora of things.

390
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,440
One being, "Why aren't you around at a time like this!"

391
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,950
But please forgive me if I do.

392
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:46,210
You are allowed to say that wherever, whenever,
and however many times you wish.

393
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:05,680
One of my colleagues taught me a way of enjoying sake
for people who dislike the strong taste.

394
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,090
Really?

395
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,050
Let us try it together after our bath tonight.

396
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,600
Yes.

397
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,690
How is that?

398
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:33,020
It's still quite bitter.

399
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,550
May I have a taste?

400
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,010
Here.

401
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,000
I added too much alcohol.

402
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,490
I'll adjust the ratio.

403
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:48,050
Mr. Takimasa.

404
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:55,800
That was the side...

405
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:02,500
I... drank from.

406
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,790
I see no issue with that.

407
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,600
This is sweet and delicious.

408
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,400
You have discovered the perfect ratio!

409
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,150
I'm glad to hear it.

410
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,280
That's practically all cider though.

411
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,480
Take care not to drink too much.

412
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,180
I will be careful!

413
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:36,040
Your salute is off.

414
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,320
I'm glad she seems to be enjoying herself.

415
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,770
You can't pour your own drink!

416
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,760
Right, my apologies.

417
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,150
I practiced pouring the other day.

418
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,550
I see.

419
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,380
Go ahead.

420
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,770
It's delicious.

421
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,050
Phew!

422
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,480
No, not phew.

423
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:08,400
- Huh?
- I was certainly drunk.

424
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,120
I apologize for acting so brash.

425
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,460
Oh, is that all?

426
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,410
Manners are nonexistent when drinking. Act however you'd like.

427
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,920
- However?
- Yeah.

428
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,220
My colleague Kumagai, for example,
once crashed through an entire folding screen at a restaurant.

429
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,940
What?

430
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,650
Admittedly, so did I.

431
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,320
Really?

432
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,810
Your drunk nature is cute
compared to what I've experienced.

433
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,850
Don't feel self-conscious.

434
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,840
Is that so.

435
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,570
Yeah. It is.

436
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:57,990
Does that mean I can get away with anything,
and blame it on the alcohol?

437
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,210
I want to be closer to Mr. Takimasa!

438
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,030
No, that is far too embarrassing to say aloud.

439
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,860
I must think of something else... Yes, I know!

440
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,780
I want him to stay with me forever.

441
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,450
No, what am I thinking?

442
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,790
I can wallow in my loneliness when I am alone.

443
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,610
Mrs. Natsumi, you practically drained the -

444
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:45,540
May I sit there?

445
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,970
What?

446
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,990
Here?

447
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,880
I've gone and done it.

448
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,460
What am I blabbering about?

449
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:03,290
I'm terribly sorry, please forget that.

450
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,670
Mrs. Natsumi.

451
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,690
Are you drunk?

452
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,660
I see.

453
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,980
So am I.

454
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,560
Then I suppose there is no one to blame but the alcohol.

455
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,980
Indeed.

456
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,600
I drank quite a bit tonight.

457
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,460
So did I.

458
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,790
Mrs. Natsumi.

459
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,450
May I K.I. you?

460
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,830
Thank goodness.

461
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:00,320
What does K.I. mean?

462
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,790
It refers to kissing, in navy slang.

463
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,970
I've never used the term, until now.

464
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:31,520
And I have never initiated a K.I., until now.

465
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,560
- A firefly.
- What?

466
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,330
Is it firefly season already?

467
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,050
I wonder if that actually was a firefly.

468
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,750
I suppose I won't reach it from here though.

469
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,460
In that case...

470
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,640
Shall we step outside?

471
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,300
M-Mr. Takimasa, you do not need to go to such lengths!

472
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,040
- Y-You're barefoot!
- This is nothing.

473
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,060
Now please, catch as many as you'd wish.

474
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,450
I would feel bad capturing them.

475
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,930
I will simply watch them up close...

476
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,680
- Huh?
- Where did it go?

477
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,720
Over there.

478
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,880
It has disappeared again.

479
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,440
I suppose this is a sign.

480
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:58,860
It seems your secret firefly spot is calling for us.

481
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,910
I see.

482
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:05,930
In that case, shall we go there tomorrow?

483
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,450
It is our household tradition, after all.

484
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,040
I want to see them.

485
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,070
I want to see them next year,

486
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,530
and in the many years to come.

487
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,810
We can make it a household tradition of ours.

488
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,660
That, it is.

489
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,650
Shall we get going?

490
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,120
Yes.

491
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,950
Taki.

492
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,420
Commander Shibahara.

493
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,650
We've been deployed.

494
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,390
A vessel of unknown nationality
may have collided with a Navy vessel of ours.

495
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:24,700
They're calling for reinforcements.

496
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,180
Depending on the circumstances...

497
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,630
we may have to join the front.

498
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,930
I will be there shortly.

499
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:34,080
- Hurry.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,160
I will head out to duty.

501
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,110
I understand.

502
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,640
I'm terribly sorry...

503
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,510
Do not be. I will prepare your uniform right away.

504
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,700
Thank you.

505
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,000
I will be off.

506
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,720
Please take care.

507
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,450
I... did not cut your hair.

508
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,230
I promise I will return. Please wait for me.

509
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,800
I will return before firefly season comes to a close.

510
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,290
Alright.

511
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,750
Okay.

512
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,630
Hurry!

513
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,580
10 miles till our destination.

514
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,380
I've fixed the deck.

515
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:12,630
Our electrical systems are down, and not coming back up.

516
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,500
Our comms are down as well.

517
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,490
Have you checked our main switch board?

518
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,350
Not yet.

519
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,400
- Hurry.
- Yeah.

520
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:24,810
Fukami!

521
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,980
You alright?

522
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,550
Ebata, go. Hurry.

523
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,640
Hurry!

524
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,840
Alright!

525
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:57,230
[DANGER : Highly Electrical]

526
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:03,420
An Imperial Navy ship has been caught in a storm
off the South Pacific.

527
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,470
The area has been affected by violent winds,

528
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:09,440
cutting off communications from the deployed ship.

529
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,210
We are currently attempting to confirm if,
and how many casualties there may have been.

530
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,840
I repeat.

531
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,860
An Imperial Navy ship has been caught...

532
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:44,970
The tide known as war, swallows whole the happiness
of each and every individual involved.

533
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:54,000
Many lovers were torn apart by the waves,
never to see each other again.

534
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:00,050
Make sure you treasure your beloved, okay?

535
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,840
It will be alright.

536
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,500
You are never alone.

537
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:10,650
I want to stay smiling, without fail.
