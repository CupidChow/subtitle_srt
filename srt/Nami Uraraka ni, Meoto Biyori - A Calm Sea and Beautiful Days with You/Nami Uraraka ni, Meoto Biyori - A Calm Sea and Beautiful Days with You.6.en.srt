Natsumi has wed the navy sub-lieutenant, Ebata Takimasa.

- Could you pass on a message to Fumiko-san for me?
- Yes.

Natsumi's maiden heart becomes thoroughly excited with this development.

Look, there's Fumiko-san.

Though some applaud this new concept of "marrying for love,"

23

most scorn the sight of an unmarried man and woman together.

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,350
I am aware.

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,690
We must keep watch over them, and if trouble comes their way,

26
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:26,310
we are to claim they met by pure coincidence.

27
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,180
Understood.

28
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,710
But if I may ask, why are we dressed this way?

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,480
To keep them from noticing we're tailing them.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,420
You seem to be enjoying this.

31
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,090
I cannot help it; I've never witnessed a rendezvous before.

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,900

I'm glad you and your wife managed to patch things up.

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,380
As am I.

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,000
Make sure to please your wife every once in a while, okay?

- Please her?
- What?

Don't tell me you've never pleased her before.

I'm quite surprised you arrived before our scheduled time.

79
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,930
I heard the navy expects one to arrive five minutes early.

80
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,810
That only applies to our duties.

81
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,920
But in that case, I should have arrived five minutes earlier as well.

82
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,130
I could have been captivated by your profile a moment longer.

You say such cringy dialogue with a straight face.

84
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,100
I feel both disdain and a minuscule shred of respect for you.

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,550
What an unexpected reaction.

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,250
Did you hear that just now, Takimasa-sama?

Oh, how dreamy!

88

Is that the sort of thing she wants to hear?

Excuse me.

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,590
I'll be frank. Please do not use Natsumi-san to do your bidding.

96
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,910
You had her pass the message along, knowing I couldn't refuse, right?

97
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,830
Of course not! You're only 80% correct with that claim.

98
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,030
However, thanks to her, we get to have a nice, long chat today.

Are you able to pick up on their conversation, Takimasa-sama?

00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,390
I can read the lips of your friend.

101
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,120
But not Fukami, as I can't see his lips from here.

102
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,880
The real issue is these glasses. I'm not entirely used to them...

103
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,340
Then may I try them on?

104
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,020
Of course.

107
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,500
I'll get straight to the point.

108
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,610
I believe...

109
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,840
you are an ideal marriage candidate.

110
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,530
I will request a matchmaker, of course.

111
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:00,580
But I wanted to hear your thoughts on the matter first, Fumiko-san.

112
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,910
You've chosen a woman who speaks out against men.

113
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,000
People will call you eccentric.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,710
Am I truly that odd?

115
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,140
I require no affection from this relationship,

116
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,140
nor would I appreciate support from the sidelines.

117
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,950
I would rather wed a woman who can take charge of the home and is my equal.

118
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,210
In other words, you believe such "feelings" are not necessary?

119
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,900
If you are referring specifically to romantic emotions...

120
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,950
Then yes, feelings are a hindrance.

121
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,190
Loving before marriage will lead you to hold expectations for your partner.

122
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,020
And if they betray those expectations, you'll be disappointed.

123
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,820
Expectations are nothing but trouble.

124
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,610
Besides, marriage is simply an act to propagate the household.

125
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,730
It is a means to create a successor for the family line.

126
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:57,990
So long as we both fulfill our duties, I believe we're free to do whatever we please.

127
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:02,830
You make... a fair argument.

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,260
I knew you would understand, Fumiko-san.

129
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,440
- In that case...
- I will keep this perspective in mind for the future.

130
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,210
Am I not an ideal pick? We share similar values.

131
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,380
I dislike men who place their elbows on the table.

132
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,930
I reckon you thought of that just now.

133
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,370
What a shame.

134
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,710
Fumiko-san, though we'd be no match to them,

135
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,660
I truly believed we could become a nice family.

136
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,950

- Yes, "them."

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,220
Please excuse the rude statement I am about to make.

177
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,080
What do you think of Ebata and his wife?

178
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,080
I reckon the two haven't deepened their relationship yet.

179
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,960
At the very least, he'd have lent his coat to her by now.

180
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,420
Maybe they even hold hands, falling asleep, the few times he is home.

181
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:03,800
As for kissing... No, they had to have gotten that far.

182
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,380
But I predict someone passed out due to oxygen deficiency.

183
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,980
Natsumi-san? Natsumi-san!

184
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,060
I'd say that's the extent of their progress.

185
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,600
They have yet to go any further. This much I'm certain.

186
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,330
How could this be?

187
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,740
How did he...

188
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,180
We haven't told a soul about any of this!

189
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,580
How did he know about the oxygen deficiency?

190
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,970
Yes, Fukami poked fun at me for our first night.

191
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,230
Boasting about your wife already, are you?

192
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,080
We haven't done anything of that nature yet.

193
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,980
Besides, it's nothing we need to hurry.

194
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,900
You told him of our first night?

195
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,790
Of course not!

196
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,580
- Oh?
- What?

197
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,470
When did they...

198
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,550
Excuse me, have you seen the people who were sitting here?

199
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,480
Yes, they left a moment earlier.

200
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,020
Earlier? Thank you.

201
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,590
It seems they've left.

202
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,950
Is that so?

203
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,440
Excuse me, is it possible to take these out?

204
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,900
My apologies, Ma'am. We're dine-in only.

205
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,080
I see.

206
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,210
- What are they doing?
- It seems we cannot take out.

207
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,430
Then let us head out, after we finish our orders.

208
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,020
Yes.

209
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,600
What?

210
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,100
I never knew you had such a smile in you.

211
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,430
Unexpected, right?

212
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,680
Please don't take my line.

213
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,180
My apologies, Madam.

214
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,610
Are you on good terms with Ebata-san.

215
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,470
You two seem like complete opposites.

216
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:05,820
We get along because we're opposites.

217
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,510
He's an honest, sincere fellow.

218
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,250
I enjoy watching him unravel when I poke fun at him.

219
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,360
You have quite a mean streak.

220
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,310
I feel at ease around an honest guy like him.

221
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,670
I can entrust my back to him

222
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,460
when our lives are on the line.

223
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,630
Was that a bit much?

224
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,820
Perhaps I feel a similar way.

225
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:46,000
Natsumi-san is kind and pure. I find that I cannot leave her be.

226
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:53,380
Yet watching her somehow puts me at ease.

227
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,440
It seems we're quite similar after all.

228
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,530
Well...

229
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,150
Well?

230
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,380
I cannot say I agree in the slightest.

231
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,930
Still no good, right?

232
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,090
You're a stubborn one.

233
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,220
You hoped for someone who was your equal, were you not?

234
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,740
Touché.

235
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,210
I had hoped to tail them for Natsumi-san's sake,

236
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,660
yet we ultimately lost them.

237
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,880
Perhaps this attitude of mine is why...

238
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,440
I reckon the two haven't deepened their relationship yet.

239
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,930
Takimasa-sama.

240
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:43,390
M-My apologies! The door, right, I closed it.

241
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,850
- I was not aware you were changing!
- No worries!

242
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,850
- I promise I did not look.
- It is all right!

243
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,690
- It was an accident!
- I am now clothed.

244
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,670
You may turn around.

245
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,720
My mother sent us a letter.

246
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,540
She asked when we would come to visit.

247
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,620
Shall I answer by telling her we will visit around New Year's?

248
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,760
Yes, please do.

249
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,570
[Dear Natsumi...]

250
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,810
Right, there's still something I can do for Natsumi-san's sake!

251
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,270
- Let us go.
- Pardon?

252
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,260
Let us visit as soon as possible.

253
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,870
I apologize for how long it has taken me to come and greet you all.

254
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,980
I am Natsumi's mother, Satsuki.

255
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,380
I am her eldest sister, Harue.

256
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,370
I am her older sister, Akina.

257
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:48,520
This is Ichiko, and this is Rinko.

258
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,120
Unfortunately, our husbands had urgent business to take care of in Osaka.

259
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,000
I see.

260
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,680
Are they perhaps... avoiding me?

261
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,090
I can feel their stares digging into me like daggers.

262
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,610
So this is the man who didn't show at their wedding.

263
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,030
It's high time we see what he's made of.

264
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,670
Has Natsumi been providing well for you?

265
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,980
I'm certain my tutelage was lacking in some manner or another.

266
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,150
No, I owe plenty to Natsumi-san.

267
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,210
She has changed my life on land for the better.

268
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:35,410
I am truly grateful to have married her. She is wasted on a man like myself.

269
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,740
It sounds like everything has been going well.

270
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,500
Nacchan looks so happy!

271
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,530
- But...
- That won't be enough to gain our approval.

272
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,980
Right?

273
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,850
I'm absolutely relieved.

274
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,070
I knew my insistence would pay off.

275
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:58,500
Yes, having you both meet beforehand worked out indeed.

276
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,830
What?

277
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:07,760
Your father tried to rush the marriage. Thank goodness I convinced him otherwise.

278
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,360
What? I never knew they met beforehand.

279
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,370
We assumed it wasn't anything you both needed to know.

280
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,620
This is the first time I'm hearing it!

281
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,480
Takimasa-kun, do you remember?

282
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,620
Shibahara-san told me she left a wonderful first impression on you.

283
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,350
What? O-Oh, yes. I remember.

284
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,780
Nacchan, you remember this as well?

285
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,890
O-Of course!

286
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,620
This is bad. I have to remember.

287
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,570
What to do? I have to remember.

288
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,730
But now that I've lied, I can't ask...

289
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,100
Natsumi? Do you truly remember meeting him?

290
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,850
Yes, of course.

291
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,720
Nacchan, those ohagi were delicious! Where were they from?

292
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,290
From my husband's childhood friend's shop in our neighborhood.

293
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,390
More importantly, are things really going well with your husband, Natsumi?

294
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,440
Is anything troubling you? Has he ever put you in a fix?

295
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
Does he bring you discomfort?

296
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,030
Is he still leaving you home alone?

297
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:19,780
Calm down, you two.

298
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,560
You'd best speak your mind here.

299
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,310
You don't need to worry―

300
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,260
Of course, we do.

301
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,150
We know practically nothing about your husband.

302
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,640
Yes, exactly.

303
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,830
Takimasa-sama treats me well.

304
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,590
When we visited an inn, we viewed the stars together.

305
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,170
The stars.

306
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,840
And in the summer, he took me around town.

307
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,560
We've also promised to see some fireflies together next year.

308
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,870
Gosh, how romantic.

309
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,400
The other day, he helped me tail someone as well.

310
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Tail someone?

311
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,030
My friend was meeting with a man on her own.

312
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,370
I was worried so we followed them in disguise.

313
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,410
I see. How courteous.

314
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,450
And? What else?

315
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,930
Well... Over here, Fuyu-chan!

316
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,970
Her letter wasn't exaggerating.

317
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:22,050
I suppose not.

318
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:26,360
If anything, he seems to really cherish her.

319
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,180
Maybe he's more dedicated than we thought.

320
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,260
Still, Natsumi's husband...

321
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,260
One, he didn't attend their wedding.

322
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,190
Two, he is often away for long periods, due to his work.

323
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,040
Three, he hadn't come to greet his wife's family, let alone her parents.

324
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,140
Four, he looks stoic.

325
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,500
Five, he can't even say something is "delicious."

326
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,750
"No issue"? Well, I see plenty.

327
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,290
And you only called Natsumi―
[Try again]

328
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:56,240
You only called Natsumi's food delicious while she was asleep.

329
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,030
Of course, her sisters would worry.

330
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,850
We cannot accept him just yet.

331
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,020
Although it seems he treats you well...

332
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,180
He really ought to take the lead like a man.

333
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,840
Well...

334
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,910
What should I do? I'm sullying Takimasa-sama's reputation!

335
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:26,270
Takimasa-sama's duty is of great importance to the country.

336
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,730
As for his manliness...

337
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:32,250
M-My apologies! The door, right, I closed it.

338
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,390
- I was not aware you were changing!
- No worries!

339
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,360
Yes, he had quite a set of abdominal muscles!

340
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,070
- What?
- I mean...

341
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,580
Sorry, my mistake.

342
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,630
- What's that?
- Tell us more.

343
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:46,980
- What?
- Yes, what's that supposed to mean?

344
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,660
Fuyuko, it's time you head to bed.

345
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,280
- But I want to know, too.
- You must be tired.

346
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,130
- Good night.
- Night.

347
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,980
And where are you going?

348
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,000
Now then, Natsumi. How are your nights faring?

349
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,320
Fuyuko.

350
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,690
How is he at night?

351
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,600
Is it true? Do military men have a... strong drive?

352
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,390
Wh-Wha—

353
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,270
I heard they ask to do it several times a night.

354
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,740
My goodness, that sounds quite exhausting.

355
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,540
But conceiving children is important business.

356
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:39,400
I'm sure we can give you advice, so tell us everything in detail.

357
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,060
Well...

358
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,470
We...

359
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,210
We?

360
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:52,830
We haven't done the act yet.

361
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,790
Wh-What? Hold on.

362
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:04,410
B-But you two have been married for...

363
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,520
Over half a year, yes?

364
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,060
Takimasa-sama isn't home often due to his naval duties.

365
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,670
As such, he said we ought to get better acquainted first.

366
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,050
- Still, that is quite...
- Yes.

367
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,660
Is our predicament so strange?

368
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:30,470
While I cannot interject much in the matters of other married couples,

369
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,980
having children is an essential part of being a husband and wife.

370
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,060
Yes, quite so.

371
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,980
Natsumi, does the wait not bother you?

372
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:47,600
I... feel that my heart is entirely not ready yet.

373
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,320
Nacchan?

374
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,800
Let's call it here for the night.

375
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,000
Wait right there.

376
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,330
No issue here...

377
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,440
I knew my insistence would pay off.

378
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,960
Yes, having you both meet beforehand worked out indeed.

379
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,730
How does that taste?

380
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,400
Yes, I see no issue with it.

381
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,660
No issue, he says!

382
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,510
It's a catchphrase of Takimasa-sama.

383
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,510
- Is that so?
- My apologies.

384
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,410
It's no worry at all.

385
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,100
Somehow the staring feels... different today.

386
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,870
Nothing, after half a year?

387
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,760
My condolences.

388
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:18,550
- Takimasa-san, are your abdominal muscles quite refined?
- Oh, really?

389
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,310
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

390
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,250
- Fuyu-chan said something strange, that's all.
- Strange? I just said―

391
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,150
- No!
- Fuyuko! Enough.

392
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,570
- Shh.
- Aw, I can't ask?

393
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,060
Muscles?

394
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,690
Breakfast sure tastes better with a full table.

395
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,660
What muscle?

396
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,200
Oh my...

397
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,320
What am I missing?

398
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,760
I'm once again glad you two met before marriage.

399
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,030
Right, I almost forgot.

400
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,670
I almost forgot.

401
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:56,170
I must remember when we met!

402
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:02,010
If I don't remember the meeting, it couldn't have been anything official.

403
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:08,080
In other words, it's likely, we met someplace Natsumi-san frequented.

404
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,940
If we met anywhere, it must have been close by.

405
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,370
In that case, if I suggest we take a walk and take Takimasa-sama around...

406
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,820
Natsumi-san.

407
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,800
Could I ask you to possibly give me a tour around the neighborhood?

408
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,700
Of course.

409
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,560
Thank goodness he asked.

410
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,060
- So about those muscles...
- Mother.

411
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,650
- My...
- Fuyuko!

412
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,200
What?

413
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:45,690
So this is the school you attended.

414
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,810
Yes. I have many nostalgic memories here.

415
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,180
I often played tag in these streets with the other children.

416
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,840
What a lovely shrine.

417
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,020
My family used to frequent this shrine every new year.

418
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,830
This town is full of jovial memories for me.

419
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,430
I only need to pick the right spot.

420
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,890
Then I'm sure to remember!

[Hatsune Station]

422
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,190
I can't recall a thing!

423
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:40,130
I would ride the train from this station to school.

424
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,830
I see.

425
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,300
What else...

426
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:55,010
I fell ill at this station at the beginning of last year.

427
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,680
Is everything all right?

428
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,110
My friend accompanied me, even though she was ill...

429
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,970
I shall carry her to a doctor.

430
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,740
Never mind.

431
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:24,000
This is one story I cannot tell Takimasa-sama.

432
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,030
Well, um...

433
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,440
Oh!
[That Night | Now showing at WakakusaTheatre]

434
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,210
Around this time last year, I went to the theatre with my parents.

435
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,690
I remember feeling especially drowsy, except...

436
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,790
He's sleeping without care.

437
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,480
He must be tired.

438
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,850
Somehow I feel my eyes shutting as well...

439
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:02,470
I awoke with the applause signaling the show's end.

440
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,430
I've experienced something quite similar.

441
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,740
Thank goodness I'm not the only one.

442
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,000
Commander Shibahara had taken me to a show after an all-night shift.

443
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,770
I fell asleep as soon as it began.

444
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,200
When I woke partway through, I noticed the person next to me was asleep as well.

445
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,600
Guess I'll get a bit more sleep myself.

446
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,950
I was asleep until the very end.

447
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,170
What an incredible coincidence.

448
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,780
Wait.

449
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,800
Now that I think about it...

450
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,740
Say, what did you think of the individual next to you?

451
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,550
Next to me?

452
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,690
Oh, the sleeping lady.

453
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:08,340
I suppose she seemed to go at her own pace?

454
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:11,750
Then I'll get that underway.

455
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,240
Pardon?

456
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:21,920
Did your folks ask you anything odd after the show by any chance?

457
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,260
Now that I think about it...

458
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,060
Watch your finger, Dear.

459
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,380
You're doing great.

460
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,710
I wonder how that went.

461
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:35,270
Natsumi, did you think anything of the young lad next to you?

462
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:40,580
Next to me? Perhaps she meant the individual who was asleep.

463
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,200
I suppose he was fine.

464
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,340
My, is that so?

465
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,780
This must be it!

466
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,960
What?

467
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:07,110
Judging by your reaction, did you not remember either?

468
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,900
You as well, Takimasa-sama?

469
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,570
It'd be more surprising if we did.

470
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,270
Agreed. I wonder if Ikuko-san knew.

471
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,380
I will have to ask.

472
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,860
With that settled, shall we head back?

473
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,820
Yes.

474
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,060
Minmi?

475
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,600
Hisa-chan?

476
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,460
I knew it was you, Minmi!

477
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,010
It's good to see you!

478
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,010
"Minmi"?

479
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,030
Would this man be the one you wrote about?

480
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,920
Yes. He's my husband.

481
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,440
It's a pleasure to meet you.

482
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm Minmi's friend, Saejima Hisa.

483
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,850
Thank goodness.

484
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,430
I was so worried to hear of your sudden marriage.

485
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:16,910
I thought you'd still have unresolved feelings to work out.

486
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:18,810
- "Feelings"?
- Remember?

487
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:22,300
After you collapsed and that man saved you,

488
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,520
you'd search for him here every weekend afterward.

489
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,320
- Did you find him?
- No...

490
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,630
Hisa-chan, you're the only one who saw his face.

491
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,300
What about that station attendant?

492
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,380
No.

493
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,700
I think he looked a bit scarier.

494
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,400
D-Don't say that about him...

495
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,010
We used to peek around these corners all the time,

496
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,420
but we never ended up finding him. You were so down about it.

497
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,230
I was worried you'd never forget about him.

498
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,200
T-That was over a year ago.

499
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,090
Well, I only wished to thank him.

500
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:04,830
No, that was the beginning of a romance, I tell you.

501
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,350
It was not! I truly hoped to thank him, that is all.

502
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:11,040
- Hey, Takimasa-sama will misunderstand!
- Now, now. Don't be so embarrassed.

503
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,580
- Hisa-chan!
- It's all right.

504
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,980
I understand this was all in the past.

505
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,550
- Come now, don't say something so sad.
- Hisa-chan, please...

506
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,850
It was the moment you two first met.

507
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,950
I was shocked to see your husband's face, truly.

508
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,690
How did you two reunite with each other?

509
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,150
What?

510
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,570
Oh?

511
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,890
What?

512
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,290
What?

513
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:49,290
Is everything all right?

514
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:52,020
Back then, I assumed a station attendant had assisted me...

515
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,450

00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,970

00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,650
Yes, Sir.

00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,700
- Ah, right.
- My apologies.

00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,520
Please put up with this while we travel.

523
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,860
I must thank him for his trouble.

524

But for now, I only wish to sleep...

00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,680
Did that help you to remember?

526
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,100
I will... make an effort to do so.

527
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,110
I believe fate was at play, somehow.

528
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,990
May I... get a bit closer to you?

529
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,280
- See you again.
- See you.

530
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,120
To think such a thing could truly happen.

531
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,260
Thank you again for your help back then.

532
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,590
Truth be told, I don't remember the occurrence myself.

533
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,120
I see.

534
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,950
- My apologies.
- No, it's all right.

535
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,810
If I may, could I see your hat?

536
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,270
What?

537
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,690
I suppose if it's for a moment.

538
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:16,100
You covered my face like so, to keep my identity under wraps.

539
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,620
Did that help you to remember?

540
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:24,630
I will... make an effort to do so.

541
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,740
Thank you.

542
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:41,810
To think I was unknowingly being arranged to wed my savior.

543
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,200
This is almost like a miracle.

544
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,860
Or perhaps this is fate?

545
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,850
Y-Yes?

546
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,980
What is it?

547
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:22,090
♫ And my unreliable responses ♫

548
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,940
♫ I'm crying underneath. I love you ♫

549
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,990
♫ I managed to lie and say, "I'm not bothered" ♫

550
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,630
♫ But I want you to understand that I feel uneasy sometimes ♫

551
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,030
♫ My love for you grows stronger and it's like a roller coaster ♫

552
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,070
♫ Will it reach you while spinning, shaking, and crashing? ♫

553
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,840
It seems the train will be a while longer.

554
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,050
♫ Shooting stars are shining brightly ♫

555
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,970
♫ I'll tell you the rest of what I was going to say ♫

556
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,740
♫ Hooked on you. I say, "I love you." ♫

557
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,520
♫ Stay in my sight forever ♫

558
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,880
Here you go.

559
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,400
Thank you.

560
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,160
To think that was you, Takimasa-kun.

561
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,790
I heard you left your information with the clinic so they would bill you for the charges.

562
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:08,630
I had entrusted my husband to deal with what came after,

563
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,000
but he instead entrusted you with our daughter's hand!

564
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,490
♫ Will you stay with me forever? ♫

565
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,390
♫ Will you stay with me forever? ♫

566
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,420
♫ Stay with me forever ♫

567
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,720
Shall we turn in soon?

568
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,280
Yes.

569
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:54,180
It seems our match was neither the work of fate nor a miracle.

570
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,750
Perhaps.

571
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,410
Even so...

572
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,930
I believe fate was at play, somehow.

573
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:19,500
The fact remains that you saved me that day, Takimasa-sama.

574
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,010
Natsumi-san...

575
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,240
This was fate.

576
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,810
May I... get a bit closer to you?

577
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,410
I will not force you, of course.

578
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:45,800
It is... quite warm, is it not?

579
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,450
Yes.

580
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,920
Takimasa-sama?

581
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,290
I know I made the suggestion,

582
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:12,150
but if you stick so close, I...

583
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,890
I cannot...

584
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,490
Natsumi-san.

585
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,080
Yes?

586
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,450
If...

587
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:22,860
If you still feel anxious...

588
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,250
No, of course not.

589
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,830
The...

590
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,890
The only person I wish would touch me...

591
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,200
The only person I wish would embrace me...

592
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,590
Will forever be...

593
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,850
you, Takimasa-sama.

594
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,240
I feel the very same.

595
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,560
Even when we are apart,

596
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,880
I'll make sure you won't forget me.

597
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,330
Natsumi-san.

598
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:22,200
You're beautiful.

599
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,990
A gift?
[Preview]

600
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,650
You won't be getting one for yourself, Takimasa-sama?

601
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,140
- Could you repeat―
- No.

602
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,620
There has been development between these two!

603
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,610
I'd like you to rely on me. We're a family now.
[This drama is fiction.]

604
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:56,300
I've decided to make this year end celebration a special one for Takimasa-sama.

605
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,880
♫ I am in love with you ♫
