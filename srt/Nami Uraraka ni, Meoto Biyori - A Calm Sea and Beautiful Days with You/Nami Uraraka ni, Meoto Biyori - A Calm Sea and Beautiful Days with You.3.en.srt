Natsumi has wed navy sub-lieutenant Ebata Takimasa.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,050
Though these two began as an awkward couple at first,

4
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,140
they slowly, yet surely, bridge the gap between them.

And on their honeymoon trip, they finally...

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,350
However, Takimasa was once again called to duty.

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,160
Natsumi then decides to visit home,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,130
and she reunites with a childhood friend, Seta Juntaro.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,040
Takimasa, who returns at summer's end two months later,

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,440
hears Natsumi mention this "Seta."

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,690
Lost in a jealous inferno, Takimasa makes a choice.

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,480
Tonight,

we will see our first night to its end.

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,180
Well, may I have a moment?

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,060
Of course.

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,490
Welcome home, Takimasa-sama.

18
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,350
I'm truly glad to see you unharmed and well.

19
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,630
I was so elated that I missed my chance to welcome you home earlier.

20

What was I so afraid of?

21
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,710
Natsumi-san was earnestly waiting for my return.

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,910
was to get acquainted with each other, and yet...

Would you like to take a stroll around here tomorrow?

Yes?

34
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,370
I have a question regarding our stroll around here.

35
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,590
What am I to wear exactly?

36
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,890
- Huh?
- Does this stroll require a formal kimono?

37
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,400
Or am I to dress Western as I did before?

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,340
I thought long and hard about it, but I'm getting confused.

39
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,600
I'd suggest something informal.

40
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,230
Pardon?

41
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,530
If anything, you should wear something like loungewear.

42
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,840
I plan on heading out like this.

43
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,340

Let's both bathe early today and head out to cool off in the evening.

Sure.

46
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,060
Takimasa-sama, is this dress all right?

47
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,700
This sort of style is what they call a "summer dress."

48
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,970
A "summer dress"?

49
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,910
I see. It certainly doesn't look stifling.

50
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,060
Yes. My older sister, Akina Nee-san, gifted this to me.

51
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,760
It sees quite a bit of use in the summertime.

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,330
I hear these dresses are called "flaps" as well.

53
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,930
"Flaps"?

54
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,250
It comes from the way these dresses "flap" when girls walk in them.

55
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,430
I see. Flaps.

56
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,410

00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,960
Now then, let us first pick a fabric.

178
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,670
Do you have any preference for the number of buttons, vent designs, or lapel shapes?

179
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,920
No, not particularly.

180
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,520
Understood. Then I shall give a more thorough explanation as we choose your fabric.

181
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,060
I'm outside my element. Could I ask you to choose, Natsumi-san?

182
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,820
Fashion is not my area of expertise as well.

183
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,170
Please take all the time you need.

184
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,660
A color that would suit Takimasa-sama...

185
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,830
A color that would suit him...

186
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,700
Do you possibly have white fabric?

187
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,290
White... does not suit him in the slightest.

188
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,150
Even I know this isn't right.

189
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,560
Keep in mind, the suit is not tailored to your body as well.

190
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,270
We shall choose a different color.

191
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,740
- Right this way then.
- Yes.

192
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,400
If you have any thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

193
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,390
But Daddy said I shouldn't bother you.

194
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,600
I don't mind.

195
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,970
- You've studied, haven't you?
- Sir.

196
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,310
Please let him.

197
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,520
Really?

198
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,000
Go ahead.

199
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,240
Come here.

200
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,820
Mr. Navy, you're tall and have a good build

201
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,220
so you need a color that'll make you look sharp!

202
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,680
- Like this?
- No, that's a checkered fabric.

203
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,020
Right.

204
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,710
But if you want a pattern, try stripes.

205
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,540
Dark blue would be perfect too!

206
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,810
And, and...

207
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,970
Are you listening, Mr. Navy?

208
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,810
I am.

209
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,980
Okay, because I also like this fabric.

210
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,120
Here you go.

211
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,420
Wait here while Mr. Navy is getting measured, okay?

212
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,720
I mean, wait here, please!

213
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,240
Of course. And thank you for helping us choose a fabric.

214
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,200
I bet his suit will turn out wonderful.

215
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,040
Oh! Do you want to see our cuff buttons?

216
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,520
About Mr. Navy's shirt, it has French cuffs, but I think the buttons are too plain.

217
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,230
Found them!

218
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,790
These buttons are all so beautiful.

219
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,390
Right?

220
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,290
Do you have any with dragonflies on them?

221
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,270
Maybe.

222
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,180
But why dragonflies?

223
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:48,640
Dragonflies are a symbol of victory because they only fly forward.

224
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,780
They're known to bring good fortune during a war.

225
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,240
- Good fortune, during a war?
- Yes.

226
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,280
Long-lasting fortune is important for any battle.

227
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,050
They keep our soldiers safe.

228
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,230
I was hoping it could be a lucky charm.

229
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:07,260
Then I'll look for a dragonfly button with you!

230
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,270
Thank you, that helps!

231
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,050
That would be all for your measurements.

232
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,170
Thank you again.

233
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,950
No, that's wrong!

234
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,350
You have a good eye.

235
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:24,600
Is this a cherry blossom? That would suit his uniform.

236
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,810
- Come on, keep looking.
- Yes, right.

237
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,530
Is something the matter?

238
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:33,270
No. Nothing.

239
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,300
Found one!

240
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:40,880
I was just thinking perhaps children aren't so bad after all.

241
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,200
That took quite a bit longer than expected.

242
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,090
But it was a fun experience.

243
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,640
And Shohei-kun was just so cute.

244
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,980
I couldn't help imagining what it would be like to have a child like you, Takimasa-sama.

245
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,950
I'm sure they would be absolutely adorable, boy or girl.

246
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,250
I'm sure the child would look cuter if they looked more like you, Natsumi-san.

247
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,970
C-Cute...

248
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,420
F-Father.

249
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,020
I wonder if that is what your kids will call you someday.

250
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,400
- M-Mother.
- Eep!

251
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,690
I suppose we're getting ahead of ourselves.

252
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,420
I shall take your coat!

253
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,760
- My apologies.
- No, thank you.

254
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,850
Well...

255
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,590
Personally, I would prefer it

256
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:15,640
if you continued to call me by my... given name.

257
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,410
The restroom calls for me.

258
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:37,480
How should I hand this to him?

259
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,480
Do I simply say, "Here you go"?

260
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,040
Perhaps I should say a bit more formally? But that requires courage.

261
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,110
Maybe I ought to sneak it onto his shirt.

262
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:53,100
No, that feels a bit melancholic.

263
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,520
If anything...

264
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,820
He isn't going to war or anything. Is wishing him good fortune a bit much?

265
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,740
Is something the matter?

266
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,990
No, not at all.

267
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,060
What were you doing up so late?

268
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,140
- I was jotting down what we've spent in our accounting book.
- I see.

269
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,780
I also keep a diary so I may be up a while longer.

270
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,780
I suppose I should write in my journal as well.

271
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,360
Takimasa-sama, you keep a journal, too?

272
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,330
I only jot down quick sentences, nothing too elaborate.

273
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,650
What to write about...

274
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,760
Welcome to the Kusakabe Tailor!

275
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,640
It seems our entries will be rather similar today.

276
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,660
[The end]

277
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,120
You write quite a bit.

278
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,180
Yes. I wrote about the tailor and my hope to have children one day.

279
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,820
You mean...

280
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,900
As such, I must ask you for a favor.

281
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,390
Would you visit a shrine with me that will bless us with a child?

282
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,560
In case you are unaware, I will mention this verbally.

283
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,920
Children are conceived with the same act as the full "first night."

284
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,490
O-Of course, I realize you had no such intent, so let us call it here.

285
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,710
R-Right.

286
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,580
Natsumi-san.

287
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,360
Yes?

288
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,980
Is there something stuck within your kimono?

289
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,580
It feels like a pebble or something similar.

290
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,120
A pebble?

291
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:20,210
Right, I hid it there earlier.

292
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,940
If it's something important, be sure to store some place safe.

293
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,310
Oh, no, this is...

294
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,820
Takimasa-sama.

295
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,330
I would like you to have this.

296
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,500
May I open this?

297
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,080
Go ahead. Apologies if it's a bit warm because of my body temperature.

298
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,930
I bought this at the tailor's today.

299
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:00,320
Dragonflies are symbols of good fortune during war so...

300
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,890
He smiled.

301
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,630
Thank you.

302
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,290
I will treasure them.

303
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,300
Thank goodness, I was quite worried about the gift.

304
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,780
Why is that?

305
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,640
I thought praying for good fortune was a bit much

306
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,290
because you're not going to war or anything.

307
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,100
I hear we withdrew from the negotiations in London this past December.

308
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,670
A fair call.

309
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,500
If they decreased our vessels any further, we'd practically have no manpower.

310
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:41,140
I suppose this means the navy's long break is coming to its end.

311
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,590
Anything could happen from now on, right?

312
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,910
Takimasa-sama?

313
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,430
Is something wrong?

314
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,820
No, everything is fine.

315
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,400
I was simply thinking I'd forgotten about my duty while being home.

316
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,010
That's good to hear.

317
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,460
What?

318
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,120
You were able to relax, both body and mind.

319
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,960
How could I be so rude?

320
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,840
Your duty is important. I'm sorry.

321
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,320
No, rather...

322
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,850
I've never felt as well rested as I do now.

323
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,890
Okay.

324
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,170
You look tense. May I ask why?

325
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,680
I am thinking of ironing your uniform.

326
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,730
I see. Thank you, I appreciate it.

327
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,150
Please save your gratitude.

328
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,240
After all, I've burned my father's suit once before.

329
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,520
Let's give it a try with this cloth first.

330
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,850
It's not burned.

331
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,980
This is the real thing.

332
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,210
Takimasa-sama, this will not be particularly interesting to watch.

333
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,720
No, you see...

334
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,480
To tell you the truth, tomorr...

335
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,640
I know very little about ironing.

336
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,850
If you wouldn't mind, may I stay and watch?

337
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,500
Of course.

338
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,690
Oh, what impeccable work.

339
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,100
Anyone can do this much, at least.

340
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:16,500
Right! You've taken the effort to clean my uniform. What say we...

341
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,470
Go take a photograph together?

342
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,310
- What?
- My, then you must get dolled up!

343
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,080
- I shall lend you some clothes.
- When did you come here?

344
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,470
Shall she dress a bit more mature, like the classic young wife?

345
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,160
Or perhaps like a Western career woman.

346
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,800
But a ladylike dress would also be lovely!

347
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,740
Too bad a parasol would only be a bother in the studio.

348
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,450
Maybe I'll do her make up and have her show her arms like an actress!

349
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,120
Taki-kun, what is your preference?

350
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,370
My preference? Well...

351
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,020
I think she'd look spectacular in anything.

352
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:02,350
I have none.

353
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,360
None at all?

354
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,270
Goodness, Taki-kun. If you're going to say that, wait out there.

355
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,790
We'll make the choice ourselves.

356
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,400
I was trying to compliment her.

357
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,740
Goodness. Taki-kun could have a bit more tact.

358
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,870
He's never been so good with women, that boy.

359
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,870
Now then, how about we change your hair to make you look more mature as well?

360
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:42,060
Thank you, that would be wonderful.

361
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,690
Is Shibahara-san not home today?

362
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,700
Kunimitsu-san returned to the boat earlier this morning.

363
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,890
Already? But he was only back a few days.

364
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,430
- Face forward for me, Dear.
- So sorry.

365
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,980
As second-in-command, my husband is never around for long.

366
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,850
Short stays are common for all navy folk around this time.

367
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,700
Then that means...

368
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,610
Takimasa-sama will also...

369
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,560
Talk to him. Taki-kun will accept whatever you have to say.

370
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,610
That much I will guarantee.

371
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,360
Now let's get you dolled up and give Taki-kun a big surprise!

372
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,020
Talk to him...

373
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,150
About what?

374
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,620
So? How about it?

375
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,740
I see no issue here.

376
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,230
Do I ask when he will depart?

377
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,760
Taki-kun. You, too. Hurry and get dressed.

378
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,870
Oku-sama, please sit on the couch here.

379
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,630
Do I ask when they set sail?

380
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,770
Or when he will come home?

381
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:32,860
But if I ask, Takimasa-sama will only struggle to give an answer.

382
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,060
No need to be so nervous, Oku-san.

383
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,970
We won't be taking your souls here!

384
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,040
Right, I suppose not.

385
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,650
Natsumi-san? What's wrong?

386
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,340
Our photographs will be ready...

387
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,450
around tomorrow afternoon.

388
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,700
Please... Please tell me you'd like to come get them with me.

389
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,640
Is that so?

390
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:21,840
Then please send them my way when you can.

391
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,660
I will.

392
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,890
All right, please stay still.

393
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,180
Ready, and...

394
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,450
"Send them my way."

395
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,260
Natsumi-san, do you have a moment?

396
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,860
Yes, come on in.

397
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:12,950
I apologize for my odd response at the photography studio.

398
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,320
- Truth be told...
- No, I understand.

399
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,730
Tomorrow, you... yes.

400
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,850
Which is meant to be something that you couldn't speak in public, right?

401
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,620
In which case, have you finished packing?

402
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,660
Is there any way I can help?

403
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,030
Shall I iron your uniform again?

404
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:39,640
No, that will not be necessary.

405
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,750
Yes, I figured. My apologies.

406
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,510
I'm sorry. Some dust got in my eyes.

407
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,670
I'm so lonely...

408
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,400
Please wait right here.

409
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,580
He's off to serve our country.

410
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,890
I have deeply failed as his wife.

411
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:14,790
I have no method nor words to cure your loneliness.

412
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,490
So instead,

413
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,700
I will follow in my parents' footsteps.

414
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,670
Whenever my father left for duty, he had my mother cut his hair.

415
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,230
It marked his resolve, to cut away the reluctance to depart,

416
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,160
and it was also his promise to return home.

417
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,300
So, Natsumi-san,

418
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,860
please cut my hair.

419
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,580
Return home?

420
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,420
W-Would you rather not?

421
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,870
This was all I could think of.

422
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,520
What should I...

423
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,170
Please allow me to cut your hair.

424
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,340
This is the first time I've spoken about them since they passed.

425
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:33,600
You can't support your husband as a navy wife at this rate.

426
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,910
My name is Yoshimori Fumiko.

427
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,990
I am only here to assist.

428
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:39,190
How graceful her smile is!

429
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:15,910
At a glance, my father seemed like a strict man.

430
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:20,760
To cut my hair is to "cut" away my reluctance to leave.

431
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,450
Yet at times, I could not tell if he was joking or not.

432
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,930
Meanwhile, though my mother was a serious individual...

433
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,380
My hand slipped.

434
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,750

435
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,030
S-Sure.

436
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,250
That's impressive.<:i>

437
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,780
She had an odd streak to her as well.

438
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,440
Thinking back, perhaps my folks were an eccentric pair.

439
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,770
They sound like wonderful parents.

440
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,620
I would have loved to meet them.

441
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,540
This is the first time I've spoken about them

442
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,240
since they passed.

447
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:35,450
Have I forced you to recall a sad memory?

448
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,970
No.

449
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,080
Please, continue cutting.

450
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,910
Thank you for the meal.

451
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,540
This is delicious.

452
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,500
Really?

453
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,010
Yes.

454
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:34,850
I practiced, hoping you would enjoy it.

455
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,810
You did? Thank you.

456
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,970
Oh, this much is nothing...

457
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,120

Please take care of yourself out there.

Natsumi-san.

462
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,390
Please take care and be safe.

463
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,410
Thank you. I'm going.

464
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:54,230
Now let us jump forward a month later.

465
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,900
- Natsumi-chan, could you carry this over?
- Certainly!

466
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,990
They go in the guest room.

467
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,510
Yes!

468
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,410
Natsumi was busy preparing for the "Floral Fleet Commune,"

469
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,960
a gathering held by naval wives.

470
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:30,230
The front of the sitting cushions are on... this side.

471
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,490
- Why are you fumbling about?
- I'm sorry, Ma'am!

472
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,790
Our poor flowers are ruined.

473
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,480
I haven't seen you around. You must be a new face.

474
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:06,110
What is your name?

475
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,170
I am Ebata Natsumi, Ebata Takimasa's wife.

476
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:19,670
So you are... Well, I am the President of the Floral Fleet Commune.

477
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:24,850
Oh my. I've been watching you work, but you're slow to arrange the sitting cushions.

478
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:27,710
Can't you pick up the pace?

479
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:34,050
You can't you support your husband as a navy wife at this rate.

480
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,940
- And if I may add—
- Ma'am, I think she's heard plenty.

481
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:44,980
Although she may be slow, she is quite thorough with her work.

482
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,780
She's even placed all the sitting cushions facing forward.

483
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,750
I suppose she has, yes.

484
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,830
But these flowers...

485
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:58,760
I had left them haphazardly finished. The fault is mine alone.

486
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:02,300
I shall just set them again.

487
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:06,560
If anything, I wasn't satisfied with my work so this is perfect.

488
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,010
I suppose if you insist, Fumiko-san.

489
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:15,270
Though do be careful in the future.

490
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,810
My apologies, Ma'am.

491
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:24,740
Thank you for your aid.

492
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,000
It's nothing to worry about.

493
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,630
And you are...

494
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,710
My name is Yoshimori Fumiko.

495
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,060
Yoshimori-san.

496
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,530
Just call me Fumiko.

497
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,560
Yes, Fumiko-san.

498
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,860
Let us clean this up right away.

499
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,410
Yes, Ma'am.

500
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:48,050
That is all for a summary of today's agenda.

501
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:53,140
I shall also hand you a list of our attendees, as well as a seating chart.

502
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,140
Please memorize their names, as well as their husbands' ranks.

503
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,470
- Yes, Ma'am.
- I will guide our guests to their seats.

504
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,780
Natsumi-san, you shall serve them tea.

505
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,920
Please put a name to their face at that time.

506
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,180
According to this chart, I am seated higher than you.

507
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,980
Should I not be the lowest seat?

508
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,900
No, this is correct.

509
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,980
I am only here to assist.

510
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,420
The president you met earlier is my aunt so sometimes I am called in.

511
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,310
I see.

512
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,670
I am not an official member of this gathering.

513
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,730
I am not married either.

514
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:36,340
I had assumed you were my elder.

515
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,910
- I am.
- Pardon?

516
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,630
I'm so terribly sorry.

517
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,870
It's all right. I'm used to it by now.

518
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:51,600
Many consider my typist profession a temporary job I pursue

519
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,290
- and have pestered me to marry—
- A typist?

520
00:43:56,050 --> 00:44:00,500
I dreamed of becoming a typist back when I attended school!

521
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,220
What a wonderful job indeed.

522
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:13,820
I was told I had neither the grades

523
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,700
nor speed to pursue the profession, though.

524
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,110
But now I understand.

525
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,190
You gave a perfect summary of today's agenda

526
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,630
and even prepared a seating chart.

527
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,800
As expected of a working individual; so attentive with an open mind.

528
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,780
How graceful her smile is!

529
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,100
She's like the protagonist of an illustrated novella!

530
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,420
I shall continue my explanation.

531
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:46,630
When greeting my aunt, beware to never interrupt her.

532
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:53,920
Are you listening, Natsumi-san?

533
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,290
Yes, of course.

534
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,240
Natsumi-san.

535
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:14,740
The Floral Fleet Commune was about to begin.

536
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:20,230
♫ I managed to lie and say, "I'm not bothered" ♫

537
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,900
♫ But I want you to understand that I feel uneasy sometimes ♫

538
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,200
♫ My love for you grows stronger and it's like a roller coaster ♫

539
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,550
♫ Will it reach you while spinning, shaking, and crashing? ♫

540
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:34,520
♫ Tonight's love story; shooting stars are shining brightly ♫

541
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,030
♫ I'll tell you the rest of what I was going to say ♫

542
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,490
What? Who?
[Preview]

543
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,200
Is it something you cannot tell me?

544
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,920
You cannot call yourselves husband and wife.

545
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,580
Perhaps you shouldn't have gotten married to me at all.

546
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,680
I believe you, too, shall simply build a relationship of your own, Natsumi-san.

547
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,500
Cute.
[This drama is fiction.]

548
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:05,060
♫ I'll call your name many times or even tens of thousands of times ♫

549
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,960
♫ I am in love with you ♫
