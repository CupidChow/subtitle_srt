1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,700
The year is 1936 (Showa 11).

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:07,300
Natsumi has wed the navy sub-lieutenant, Ebata Takimasa.

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,900
Though these two began as an awkward couple,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,800
they're slowly bridging the gap between them.
[Katsudo-Benshi]

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,800
Would you please tell me everything?

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,450
You'll be burdened with its weight.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,300
That is my exact wish.

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,100
Please, let me shoulder this burden with you.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,100
Takimasa shared his difficult past with Natsumi.

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,030
I ought to storm their place myself.

11
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,500
It's alleviating to have someone get angry for your sake.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,900
I'm glad I spoke to you about this, Natsumi-san.

13
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,940
And the two grew closer than ever before.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,400
However, a few weeks after Takimasa departed once more...

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,800
They sunk.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,620
The vessel capsized in a storm, and they sunk.

17
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,840
Nothing.

18
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,900
Please cut my hair.

19
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,800
It marked his resolve, to cut away the reluctance of departing,

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,040
and it was also his promise to return home.

21
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,150
Cutting his hair was a promise to return home.

22
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,900
He's okay.

23
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,440
Everything is okay.

24
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,230
Please... Please return home safe.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Thank goodness! I'm glad that you're safe!

26
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,700
Takimasa-sama?

27
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,640
Natsumi-san.

28
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,300
Thank you for all that you've done.

29
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,700
Farewell.

30
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,870
Takimasa-sama!

31
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,830
Ouch!

32
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,700
Natsumi-chan, I received some sweet potatoes. Would you also...

33
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,220
What's wrong?

34
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
My, you're bleeding!

35
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,300
Perhaps this is a bad omen.

36
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,800
What?

37
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,820
I dreamed of Takimasa-sama last night.

38
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,420
He bade me farewell.

39
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,180
I feel so utterly lost, and...

40
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,900
Natsumi-chan, calm yourself.

41
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:32,300
Did someone say something to worry you?

42
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,980
I heard...

43
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,440
the ship sank.

44
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,800
Was it Junko-chan by any chance?

45
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,800
Yes, Ma'am.

46
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,820
I'll start with the important news, so listen well, Dear.

47
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,500
The vessel that sank was not Taki-kun's ship.

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,100
He is safe and sound.

49
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,100
You must have been so anxious.

50
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,940
When Junko-chan got married in January two years ago,

51
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,500
an accident with a torpedo boat occurred in March of that year.

52
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,670
The year after, there was an accident involving a destroyer ship.

53
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,840
She worries about the possibility of another accident

54
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,800
this year as well.

55
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,900
I see.

56
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,600
But her worries aren't unjustified.

57
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,100
An accident could occur tonight.

58
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,300
An emergency could crop up tomorrow.

59
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,960
That is what their line of work entails.

60
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,840
Make sure to remember this, Dear.

61
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,500
Marrying Takimasa-sama comes with several factors.

62
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,500
There is the fun we have in each other's company.

63
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,880
There is the loneliness that comes from solitude.

64
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,250
Yet above all else...

65
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,100
I must remember that anything can happen at any moment.

66
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,400
There is a need for resolve and a readiness of heart.

67
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,600
Just like Takimasa-sama steels himself out at sea.

68
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,500
My, this looks delicious!

69
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,600
I hope it suits your taste buds.

70
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,780
And this is in return for those sweet potatoes you gave me the other day.

71
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh please, you don't have to.

72
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,400
I also wish to apologize for my actions

73
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,100
when we ate curry with Fumiko-san.

74
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,880
Apologize?

75
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,500
Truth be told, I only pretended to be asleep.

76
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,600
I've truly pushed her into an unfair predicament.

77
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,900
Ideally, the two would have met before marriage.

78
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,100
I ought to have gotten her better acquainted with Taki-kun.

79
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,700
I ended up eavesdropping on your conversation, Ikuko-san.

80
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,740
I should have told you about those things face to face, Natsumi-chan.

81
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,240
- I'm truly sorry.
- Please, don't apologize.

82
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,700
Admittedly, I was a bit confused at first.

83
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:41,490
I knew nothing about Takimasa-sama or the navy.

84
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,400
And the marriage itself was all so sudden.

85
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,300
I didn't know my left from my right, and I was totally at a loss.

86
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,300
But now...

87
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Now, I choose to remain here of my own will.

88
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,500
Natsumi-chan...

89
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,600
♫ Hey, the "sorry" that I was about to say yesterday ♫

90
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,310
♫ And my unreliable responses ♫

91
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,300
♫ I'm crying underneath. I love you

92
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,160
♫ I managed to lie and say, "I'm not bothered" ♫

93
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,870
♫ But I want you to understand that I feel uneasy sometimes ♫

94
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,210
♫ My love for you grows stronger and it's like a roller coaster ♫

95
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,510
♫ Will it reach you while spinning, shaking, and crashing? ♫

96
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:39,520
♫ Tonight's love story; shooting stars are shining brightly ♫

97
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,180
♫ I'll tell you the rest of what I was going to say ♫

98
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,800
♫ Hooked on you. I say, "I love you." Stay in my sight forever ♫

99
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,640
♫ In the next life or even past ones, I'll always want to see you ♫

100
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,200
♫ Hooked on you all the time. I'll tell you so just listen ♫

101
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,140
♫ I'll call your name many times or even tens of thousands of times ♫

102
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,220
♫ Will you stay with me forever? ♫

103
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,210
[A Calm Sea and Beautiful Days with You]

104
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,960
[Episode 5]

105
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,300
It was early November, and autumn was brisk,

106
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,520
when Takimasa sent word of his return.
[I will return the day after tomorrow.]

107
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,430
I'll have to cook a feast!

108
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,400
My throat...

109
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,870
Natsumi-chan!

110
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,200
Natsumi-chan, are you home?

111
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,340
I'm coming on in, Dear.

112
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,200
I received some delicious persimmons. Would you like to...

113
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,000
Natsumi-chan! What happened?

114
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,300
Are you all right?

115
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,120
Reporting home safe and sound!

116
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,390
What matters most in an argument is keeping the tide in your favor.

117
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,000
Work is no excuse, that imbecile.

118
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,100
Have I made you so angry, you refuse to speak with me?

119
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,320
My condolences.

120
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,630
Why has this happened?

121
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,830
Goodness, you can't push yourself, Dear.

122
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,100
I've prepared some grated daikon and honey to soothe your throat.

123
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,040
Can you wake up?

124
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,110
- Thank you...
- It's nothing.

125
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,000
Make sure to take this prescribed medicine as well.

126
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If I bring you some porridge tonight, will you eat it?

127
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,590
Yes.

128
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,100
I apologize for the trouble.

129
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,820
It's no trouble at all.

130
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,100
Rather, my husband and Taki-kun never fall ill

131
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,000
so I'm enjoying the chance I get to play nurse.

132
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,770
But this is no time for my own amusement.

133
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,650
Take this, and stay warm, all right?

134
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,220
Yes, Ma'am.

135
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,070
Takimasa-sama's returning home today!

136
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,360
No fever. No cough.

137
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,530
Still a bit of a sore throat, though.

138
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Excuse me. Natsumi-san, are you in?

139
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,110
Yes.

140
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,500
I understand your circumstances.

141
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,490
So I am to act as an interpreter,

142
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,320
to keep your husband unaware of your illness?

143
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,480
I'm sorry, I know you only came to visit...

144
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,600
Please, don't force yourself to speak.

145
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,700
You'll only make it worse.

146
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,400
I have a feeling he'll catch on as soon as I leave, but...

147
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,110
I understand. I will be here to help.

148
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,700
"Thank you very much."

149
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,100
You're quite welcome.

150
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,900
Where are you headed?

151
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,100
I am off to greet him.

152
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,500
By the front gates.

153
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,080
You needn't do that. He's no child.

154
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,200
She eats like a squirrel.

155
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,400
Pay me no mind.

156
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,900
There you are.

157
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,800
You haven't fully recovered yet.

158
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,670
- In that case.
- "In that case"...

159
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,010
- May I...
- "May you"?

160
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,300
A wife's work included making winter gear for the encroaching cold.

161
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,600
Is that for your husband?

162
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,280
And yours?

163
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,850
It's for myself, of course.

164
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,400
Please stir that well.

165
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,200
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

166
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,000
Are you all right?

167
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,900
A job well done.

168
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,700
He's far too late.

169
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,200
I hope his schedule has simply changed.

170
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:13,500
However, what if there was some sort of accident?

171
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,760
No. I decided to stay strong.

172
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,900
Thank you for staying as late as you have.

173
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,870
I chose to stay of my own accord. It was no trouble at all.

174
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,300
Rather, is everything all right? You seem to be steeling yourself...

175
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
The entryway!

176
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,600
You must be his wife.

177
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,900
I'm terribly sorry he's late.

178
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,350
His senior officers kept forcing drinks onto him.

179
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,700
He reeks of alcohol.

180
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,090
Ebata, wake up. You're back home.

181
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,930
Home?

182
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,440
Look, your wife even came to see you.

183
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,700
Natsumi-san!

184
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:34,140
Ebata Takimasa, reporting home safe and sound from his year-end drills.

185
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,700
We finally get some quality—

186
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,230
Natsumi-san? Why?

187
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,350
Are you... angry?

188
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Why?

189
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,000
My condolences.

190
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,060
Let us head on in.

191
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,770
These dishes...

192
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,490
Were they not for your husband?

193
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,540
Thank you.

194
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,040
Do you worry for your husband?

195
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,230
I shut him...

196
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,370
out and...

197
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,800
- A cold.
- You're worried he'll catch a cold out there.

198
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,030
I believe he'll manage. He has most likely gone to Ikuko-san's.

199
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,210
I'll lend you the bedding; set them up yourselves.

200
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,020
Yes, Ma'am.

201
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,770
Why has this happened?

202
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,100
Why?

203
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,650
If I may add my own two cents.

204
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:23,560
What matters most in an argument is keeping the tide in your favor.

205
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,690
Since we have time tonight,

206
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,600
shall we discuss our tactics and prepare for his return tomorrow?

207
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,450
Yes.

208
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,200
I greatly appreciate...

209
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,790
Do not force yourself.

210
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,950
You will only make it worse.

211
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,030
I'm terribly sorry for arriving home yesterday intoxicated,

212
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,810
but I ask that you understand.

213
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,920
I cannot turn down my superior officers if they wish to drink.

214
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,790
This sort of activity serves as a sort of bonding exercise.

215
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,350
It is a necessity for a harmonious work environment.

216
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,140
I know this may all sound like an excuse.

217
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,680
But I ask that you consider this part of my work and forgive me.

218
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,090
Work is no excuse, that imbecile.

219
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,110
Imbecile.

220
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,650
What's up with Haru-Nee*?
(*An older sister)

221
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:33,480
She's at war with her husband. He came home after midnight in a drunken stupor.

222
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,160
Oh, that explains it.

223
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,980
"Work" doesn't make this any less excusable.

224
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,990
If this is part of his work, I suppose it can't be helped.

225
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,300
Why is she whispering to her?

226
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,770
And who is this?

227
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,700
Allow me to answer in her stead.

228
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,750
Right.

229
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:02,620
She fully understands your reasoning.

230
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,920
- Thank goodness.
- However...

231
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,640
Using your duty as a shield is a rather cowardly tactic, isn't it?

232
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,380
I told the man he was a coward.

233
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,360
Impressive, Haru-Nee!

234
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,990
That's no way to call your husband who's working hard.

235
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,470
- But, Father...
- In any case, Fuyuko. How was Natsumi faring?

236
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,710
Yes, was she doing well?

237
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:32,040
She was. Her husband happened to be home as well.

238
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,770
The one who missed their wedding?

239
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,610
Harue. What was he like?

240
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:39,180
Surprisingly, he seemed like a nice guy.

241
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,100
He brought back caramels as a souvenir for Nacchan.

242
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,000
- My...
- Four pieces, though.

243
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,470
What? Only four pieces? Unbelievable.

244
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,210
Unbelievable.

245
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,460
Unbelievable.

246
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,560
While I do not know where you drank, could you not have sent a message home?

247
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,870
Could you not have stepped out and briefly shown your face here?

248
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,440
Your wife truly anticipated your return.

249
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,040
Have you stopped to think how worried she was when you failed to return home?

250
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,820
I never said all that!

251
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,780
Please do not shift the blame from yourself.

252
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,710
W-Well...

253
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,960
If you don't mind.

254
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,070
He has come to apologize because he recognizes his errors.

255
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:28,310
And what's so wrong about prioritizing his work?

256
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,690
I'd say shutting out the working husband is far more rude.

257
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,030
Don't be so rude to your younger sister's husband.

258
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,080
So what if his souvenir was measly?

259
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,130
A man's worth isn't chalked up to gifts.

260
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,030
A man's duty is to provide for the family in the first place.

261
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:45,290
Of course, he'd prioritize his job.

262
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:48,310
I see you still dedicate everything to your work as well, Father.

263
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:51,030
That is why you accepted Natsumi's husband, isn't it?

264
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,150
What do you mean?

265
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,150
With military power on the rise,

266
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,360
providing munitions will be critical for our company's future.

267
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,950
- So he sent his daughter to a military man—
- Enough.

268
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,960
You're sullying dinner.

269
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,330
Keep quiet, will you?

270
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,340
Would you keep quiet, Sir?

271
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,760
No, I shall not.

272
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,200
- Erm...
- You claim this activity was for "work."

273
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,520
Yet I believe you lot fooled around instead.

274
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,340
Maintaining relations with our superiors is proper "work."

275
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,170
- In modesty.
- Which we were, as we left the party early.

276
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,090
- That is a subjective assessment.
- And how else to judge?

277
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,600
By being objective instead.

278
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,990
And if I may ask, who are you? Is this any of your business?

279
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,070
I am Ebata's associate. Likewise, is this any of your business?

280
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,670
All right, I get it!

281
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,950
This is an issue between my wife and I.

282
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,090
Natsumi-san and I will resolve this amongst ourselves.

283
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,840
Are you certain?

284
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,260
I understand.

285
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:04,980
Then I suppose I'll leave it at that.

286
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,080
How about we give these two some space, Madam?

287
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,610
"We"?

288
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,240
I will visit again.

289
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,930
Shall we go inside?

290
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,960
What to do? This is quite awkward.

291
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,570
All right, I'll lose him at the crossroads ahead.

292
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,820
That was some fine work on your part, Madam.

293
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,260
What ever do you mean?

294
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,190
Get angry for someone else's sake and that person's anger dies away.

295
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,800
You prevented a fight and conveyed the wife's frustrations.

296
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,540
Was that your intent all along?

297
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,740
Aware of that, did you intervene on purpose?

298
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,650
Helpful, wasn't I?

299
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:21,140
I will not deny that I was attempting to aid those two.

300
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,340
I suppose I hadn't introduced myself yet.

301
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,330
The name's Fukami Ryunosuke.

302
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,130
"Fukami"? So this is the rumored bachelor.

303
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,440
I'm Yoshimori Fumiko.

304
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,160
Fumiko-san. What a pretty name.

305
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,170
Say, how about joining me for a spot of tea?

306
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,010
- No, thank you.
- Then at least allow me to walk you home.

307
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,910
No, thank you.

308
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,710
A "nice" personality? I almost have to laugh.

309
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,880
This man is nothing but a charlatan.

310
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,590
Well...

311
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,540
I'd never seen Fukami argue with a woman before.

312
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:38,390
Was that woman your friend? She had quite a sharp tongue.

313
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,190
Have I made you so angry that you refuse to speak with me?

314
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,720
My...

315
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,180
What?

316
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,420
"My throat."

317
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,740
Have you... caught a cold?

318
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,530
I'm so sorry, I wasn't aware of your circumstances.

319
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,290
Of course, you would be angered to see me return intoxicated.

320
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,550
I'm truly sorry for my blunder.

321
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,610
[Wel]

322
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,590
[Wel]

323
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,140
"Wel"?

324
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,370
"Co"...

325
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,210
"Me."

326
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,050
"H"...

327
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,400
"O"...

328
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,270
"M"...

329
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,580
"E."

330
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,010
I'm home.

331
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,140
I will return at Nineteen Three Zero tonight.

332
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,890
Nineteen...

333
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,780
That would be 19:30, I think.

334
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,980
Understood.

335
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,430
Your voice.

336
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,870
I'm glad it has returned.

337
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,250
As am I.

338
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,560
Would you like something specific for dinner tonight?

339
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:38,000
In that case, may I request something with meat?

340
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,800
Of course.

341
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,830
- I will see you then.
- Take care.

342
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,090
Would this be considered...

343
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,800
a newlywed life?

344
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,550
We see each other off in the morning...

345
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,160
Takimasa-sama, your tea leaf has stood up.

346
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:21,810
- Eat our dinners together...
- It has. That's a good omen for tomorrow.

347
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:27,650
And chat idly before heading to bed.

348
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,210
Oh, how fun!

349
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:48,170
♪ Daikon, daikon, grows all flavorful ♪

350
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:53,140
♪ Daikon, daikon, grows all flavorful ♪

351
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,580
- Natsumi-san.
- Yes?

352
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Could I ask you to wash and iron my shirt?

353
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,390
Yes, I shall take it off your hands.

354
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,740
Thank you for everything you always do.

355
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,710
If you'll excuse me.

356
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:44,950
These past few days have been filled with nothing but fun.

357
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:48,790
I'm truly happy to hear that.

358
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,930
It's a relief to see you two getting along well.

359
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:55,760
I'm sorry, you've come to visit after work, yet I've gone on and on...

360
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,600
I don't mind.

361
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,550
I had to visit Ikuko-san as well, anyway.

362
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,060
Is that so?

363
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:08,150
Actually, I had hoped to thank you for visiting while I was sick. Please, come on in.

364
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,410
The ohagi from this cafe is especially delicious.

365
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,340
Thank you.

366
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,560
Were you all right after leaving our place the other day?

367
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,100
Pardon?

368
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,840
You two had quite the quarrel so I was worried to leave you both...

369
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,490
Well, that individual was...

370
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,520
That was some fine work on your part, Madam.

371
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,560
There's much I can say, but simply put...

372
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,340
A fine man, I suppose...

373
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,850
Does she mean to say...

374
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,050
"Although we got off on the wrong foot, he is a fine man after all."

375
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:09,430
Is that it?

376
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,540
But as I recall, Fumiko-san had no interest in marriage.

377
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,240
This anxious expression can only mean one thing.

378
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,440
"My nights have been sleepless, thinking about him."

379
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,360
Goodness, I knew it!

380
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,560
Natsumi, you're letting your maidenly delusions get the best of you.

381
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,950
I cannot tell Natsumi-san he was an absolute charlatan.

382
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:45,400
Well, although my question may be rude,

383
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,250
may I ask what you see in your future, Fumiko-san?

384
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,850
My future?

385
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,280
Yes, for example...

386
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,430
Are you considering marriage, perhaps?

387
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,830
My apologies, this must be a touchy topic.

388
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,440
Not at all.

389
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,380
I believe my time will have to come eventually.

390
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,330
That is why Ikuko-san called me here in the first place.

391
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:27,360
Your parents have asked me to convince you and to be your eventual matchmaker.

392
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:33,390
In other words...

393
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,950
"I believe I could consider marrying this man."

394
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:43,150
Is that so!

395
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:45,050
Natsumi, you're getting the wrong idea.

396
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,020
Very well.

397
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,010
Please allow me to aid you.

398
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,340
Pardon?

399
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,250
In that case...

400
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:13,250
I shall take you up... on your offer?

401
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,600
That settles it!

402
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,850
Takimasa-sama.

403
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,520
May I ask you for a favor?

404
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,170
Of course.

405
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,000
Well...

406
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:46,960
How to put this...

407
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:57,270
Would you please tell me more about your friend who visited the other day?

408
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,840
What?

409
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:04,870
Natsumi-san, don't tell me. Has the MMK seduced you as well?

410
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:09,920
MMK stands for "the ever-popular ladies man."

411
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,510
Why do you wish to know of Fukami?

412
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,910
Ah, so that is the rumored Sub-lieutenant Fukami.

413
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,390
"Rumored"?

414
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:27,210
Truth be told, a friend of mine is... interested in him.

415
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:34,070
So Natsumi-san has no interest in him.

416
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,860
That is why I wish to bring the two of them together.

417
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,310
Takimasa-sama, please lend me your assistance.

418
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,430
- No, I...
- Please?

419
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,830
I suppose I'll do what I can.

420
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,340
Thank you!

421
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,520
Then if you'll allow me. Fukami-san is still a bachelor, right?

422
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,790
- Yes.
- And he is not yet engaged, is he?

423
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,470
- Correct.
- Is he arranged to see someone?

424
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,770
Are there any other women he fancies?

425
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,920
- What is his family like?
- N-N-Natsumi-san!

426
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,700
So she used me as a sacrificial pawn. I like that.

427
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,800
They have mutual love!

428
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,190
You look wonderful.

429
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,800
Did you make this, Natsumi-san?

430
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,100
Yes.

431
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,170
Thank you very much for the delicious tea and snacks.

432
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,990
Of course.

433
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:36,880
So why exactly have I been called here today?

434
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,310
I had a question to ask you, Sub-lieutenant Fukami-san.

435
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,810
It was faster she asked you directly.

436
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,530
Wow, pushing it all to me, right?

437
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:47,740
Do you recall my friend you met here the other day?

438
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,640
Fumiko-san? Yes, of course.

439
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,010
And if I may pry, what did you think of her?

440
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,450
I thought she was a wonderful woman.

441
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,620
My goodness, they have mutual love!

442
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:14,960
To have that happen after one fateful meeting... This is like a novel!

443
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,350
How romantic!

444
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:19,450
You're not one to be interested in one woman in particular.

445
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,300
Is marriage on your mind?

446
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,080
Of course not. I have no intent on marrying her.

447
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,340
What?

448
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,570
No intent at all?

449
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,100
But you called her a wonderful woman earlier.

450
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:43,210
Holding a woman in high regard and hoping to marry her are two different things, right?

451
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:50,490
Now that I think about it, although Fumiko-san called him a "fine man"...

452
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,890
I believe my time will have to come eventually.

453
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,170
Perhaps that meant...

454
00:40:56,170 --> 00:41:00,040
Although I don't wish to, I must consider marriage eventually.

455
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,950
But make no mistake, I am not thinking of any suitor in particular.

456
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,020
Is that what that was?

457
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,130
Oh gosh, I've gotten completely ahead of myself.

458
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,260
Natsumi-san?

459
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,880
I thought your wife was the quiet type, but she's actually quite expressive.

460
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,710
Well...

461
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:24,380
Sir, could you please forget our conversation today?

462
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,600
I had made a fatal misunderstanding.

463
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,620
How so?

464
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:35,130
I now recall Fumiko-san used your name

465
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,150
to divert the conversation of marriage away from her.

466
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:42,140
- Why him?
- Quit pointing fingers.

467
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:48,270
The naval wives were attempting to find someone for Fumiko-san.

468
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,750
That is when she brought up your name.

469
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,770
Raising his name will divert the conversation, won't it?

470
00:41:56,770 --> 00:41:59,280
What a peculiar individual.

471
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,970
So she used me as a sacrificial pawn.

472
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,990
No, Sir. That was not what I—

473
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,700
What an interesting person indeed.

474
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,910
I like that.

475
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,710
What?

476
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:13,830
Oku-san. Could you pass on a message to Fumiko-san for me?

477
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,970
Yes?

478
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,970
Hello, Fumiko-san?

479
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,260
Yes?

480
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,130
I'm terribly sorry to call you on your day off.

481
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,450
To cut to the chase,

482
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,240
I have a message from Sub-lieutenant Fukami-san.

483
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,380
He says he wishes to speak to you once more

484
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:44,390
and will be waiting at "Cafe Kizuna" at 2:00 p.m. next Sunday.

485
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:47,050
That was his message for you.

486
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,990
I apologize, my hastiness is to blame.

487
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:55,050
If you'd rather not, I can turn him down in your stead.

488
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,450
- As I thought, should I...
- No, I do not mind.

489
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,620
Please tell him I will see him there.

490
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:11,830
Oh, um... I will.

491
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:17,670
Then, if you'll excuse me.

492
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:34,110
An unmarried man and woman, meeting alone?

493
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:38,270
Natsumi-chan, if you've finished your business, let us have a snack!

494
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,000
- Could this be...
- Natsumi-chan?

495
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,540
Hello?

496
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:49,680
A rendezvous for two?

497
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,870
Have you changed, Takimasa-sama?

498
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,310
One more moment.

499
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,270
Well, I've finished.

500
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:03,070
Although, perhaps this is a bit embarrassing...

501
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:05,690
♫ And my unreliable responses ♫

502
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,270
♫ I'm crying underneath. I love you ♫

503
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:12,390
♫ I managed to lie and say, "I'm not bothered" ♫

504
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,610
♫ But I want you to understand that I feel uneasy sometimes ♫

505
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,460
How nice! You look wonderful.

506
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,370
As do you, Natsumi-san.

507
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:22,140
- Really?
- Yes.

508
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,270
Now put these on.

509
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,180
Glasses?

510
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:36,430
♫ Hooked on you. I say, "I love you." Stay in my sight forever ♫

511
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:39,450
And one more thing.

512
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,120
I shall wrap it around you.

513
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,330
Please do.

514
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:55,300
♫ I'll call your name many times or even tens of thousands of times ♫

515
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,020
♫ Will you stay with me forever? ♫

516
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,290
♫ Will you stay with me forever? ♫

517
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,500
♫ Your profile illuminated by the moonlight ♫

518
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,550
Did you make this, Natsumi-san?

519
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,030
Yes.

520
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,090
Thank you.

521
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,220
You're quite welcome.

522
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,060
♫ Saying "I'm home" and "Welcome back", we bounce happiness off each other ♫

523
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,460
♫ The flower of love blooms casually by our side ♫

524
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,550
♫ We'll be together forever ♫

525
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:26,320
Shall we?

526
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,390
Yes.

527
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:34,220
♫ Hooked on you. I say, "I love you." Stay in my sight forever ♫

528
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:40,570
♫ In the next life or even past ones, I'll always want to see you ♫

529
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,120
Perhaps this is fate?
[Preview]

530
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,340
I reckon the two haven't deepened their relationship yet.

535
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:01,120
♫ I'm in love with you. ♫

536
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,790
♫ Forever ♫

537
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:05,130
♫ Please! Along with those tears ♫

538
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,450
♫ Your prayers seem about to overflow ♫

539
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,050
♫ I'll go wipe them off right away, so call me ♫
