The year is 1937 (Showa 12).

00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,890
Natsumi has wed the navy sub-lieutenant, Ebata Takimasa.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,090
The two celebrated their first new year together.

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,720
Takimasa also gave Natsumi his very first gift to her.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,180
It's a ring... to commemorate our marriage.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,230
Hearing how making adjustments to the ring will take a month, Takimasa says...
[Katsudo Benshi]

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,100
May we come to retrieve our rings in June or July, which is six months from now?

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,600
I promise the two of us will come to receive them together.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,630
I left you for our photographs so I wanted to retrieve our rings together.

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,380
Although I will keep you waiting for a while...

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,220
It's all right. I will wait, however long it may take.

12
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,940
And so, Takimasa left for the seas once more.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,220
What bone-piercing chills...

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,510
I can't help but shiver...

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,890
So cold... so chill...

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,680
"The crisp pale air of the morning..."

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,660
Yes, let's go with that.

18
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,330
February brings an onslaught of colder days.

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,220
I will be sure to pen a letter to you today, Takimasa-sama.

20
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,010
"I start my mornings by prepping coal for warmth."

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,230
Is it about time?

22
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,500
Kotatsu, kotatsu*...
(*A heated table; in this era, heated with charcoal)

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,790
Oh, sweet kotatsu!

24
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,290
Kotatsu...How warm...

25
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:11,700
"In cold mornings, I'm grateful to our wondrous kotatsu every day."

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,440
Yes, this is it!

27
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,320
I have to put away my bedding...

28
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,030
Oh, my.

29
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,320
Now it's time for breakfast.

30
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,490
Right, Takimasa-sama's yukata*.
(*Used as a sleepwear or a summer kimono)

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,360
I suppose it's about time I give it another wash.

32
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,990
It's not as if his scent remains anymore...

33
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,800
As a way to distract myself from the loneliness,

34
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,400
I wear Takimasa-sama's yukata to sleep every night.

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Though after a month, his scent has unsurprisingly fully faded away.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,430
No, I cannot write that. He will despise me for my immodesty!

37
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,690
Do you have nothing to write about? I'm quite surprised.

38
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:20,400
I tend to write about seasonal flowers and other mundane things of the sort.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,540
That already sounds wonderful, Dear.

40
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:30,800
But I wish to write about more exciting or entertaining occurrences.

41
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,950
Is that so?

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,410
Ikuko-san, what do you always write to your husband?

43
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,450
My husband is quite wordy so sending a reply is lengthy enough.

44
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,820
How wonderful! Takimasa-sama always writes...

45
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,670
Only three...

46
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,710
I mean, three whole lines.

47
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,410
You are right to say "only," Dear.

48
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,360
In that case, how about you write about something that made you excited?

49
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,960
You're quite dexterous, I see.

50
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,250
Sewing has always been a hobby of mine.

51
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,180
I enjoy going through the motions with needle and thread.

52
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,150
It helps put my mind at ease.

53
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,700
That would be too embarrassing!

54
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,980
No problem at all.

55
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,780
I also wish to assure Takimasa-sama

56
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,870
and to convey that the home is safe in my care.

57
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,520
I see.

58
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,360
Then there are some things a new wife must keep in mind.

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,580
She must be aware of her husband's hobbies, and get along with their neighbors.

60
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,470
She must also take good care of her husband's in-laws, siblings, and other relatives.

61
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,860
- I believe those are the basics to cover.
- His hobbies.

62
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,420
- But you really don't—
- That's it, Ma'am!

63
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,430
I found it! Our shogi* set!
(*Japanese chess)

64
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,520
I will learn to become a worthy shogi opponent for Takimasa-sama.

65
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,450
Ikuko-san, do you know how to play?

66
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,110
- Somewhat, yes.
- Then, please, teach me.

67
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,430
Seeing you reminds me of my old self, Natsumi-chan.

68
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,250
- What?
- Long ago, I used to run from all my housewife lessons.

69
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,560
I especially disliked doing housework.

70
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,420
I cannot even imagine.

71
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,150
After I had gotten married,

72
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,440
I vowed to do everything and anything for Kunimitsu-san.

73
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,990
Except, the burden of that work was apparently written right on my face.

74
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,110
So one day, my husband finally spoke up about this.

75
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,060
He said, "I didn't marry you so that you would become my sitter."

76
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,760
"I married you so that I could see you do what you love, right at your side."

77
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,830
Goodness, I feel flustered simply thinking about his words!

78

As am I, Ma'am.

79
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,790
In any case, I believe Taki-kun is the same.

80
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:12,620
I'm sure he'd rather hear you were smiling happily back at home.

81

82

Yes, absolutely!

91
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,130

Takimasa will be returning home today.

174
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,530
[Beer Hall Tomoe]

175
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,700
Have you told Natsumi about our meeting tonight?

176
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,020
No, Sir.

177
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,450
As you requested in your letter.

178
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,960
No need to be so stiff.

179
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,900
We finally get to talk.

180
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,420
- Let's enjoy ourselves, all right?
- Y-Yes, Sir.

181
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,940
Eat up.

182
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,840
Thank you.

183
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:17,370
I thought we'd be able to chat over a drink or two at the ceremony like this, but...

184
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,100
My deepest apologies, Sir.

185
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,090
Woah, you spooked me.

186
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:27,160
You had your duty. Don't worry about it.

187
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,920
Thank you, Sir.

188
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,190
- Take a seat.
- Right.

189
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,900
How's the Navy been? Busy?

190
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,620
Sir, regarding military information, I...

191
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,580
Yes?

192
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,490
What was that?

193
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,030
Something felt odd about his reaction.

194
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,660
Will I make a bad impression by not divulging the information?

195
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:59,400
Business at the Navy is the same as ever.

196
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,010
Sounds tough.

197
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,880
I suppose military men are always busy.

198
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,480
Great work out there.

199
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,830
I am only doing my duty, Sir.

200
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,690
Another drink for you, Mr. President.

201
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,380
Thanks.

202
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,440
It seems like our order hadn't gone through after all.

203
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,080
I've brought your sausages as well.

204
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,650
- Thoughtful as ever.
- Excuse me.

205
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,150
Do we require extra plates?

206
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,500
- I shall grab those—
- It's fine.

207
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,940
Sit and enjoy your drinks, you two.

208
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

209
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,130
Say, Juntaro. You were recently certified to serve, weren't you?

210
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,940
Yes, Sir. I narrowly avoided being conscripted next year.

211
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,490
I was worried you'd be sent to Shanghai.

212
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,550
Because our sailors have been killed there.

213
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,220
Ain't that right, Takimasa-kun?

214
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,300
Sir, as for that case...

215
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,750
Apologies, Sir.

216
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,500
I cannot discuss military secrets, even with family.

217
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,820
Am I putting you on guard?

218
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,950
I'm only making small talk.

219
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,140
A-Apologies, Sir. Call it... a habit, done out of duty.

220
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,940
"Small talk," right?

221
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,230
How dare you say that?

222
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,990
Sir, why are we meeting Ebata-san today?

223
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,360
To drag out any information on the Navy as much as we can.

224
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,540
I wonder how much I can squeeze out of him.

225
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,960
Or so you told me.

226
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,130
What a crafty man indeed.

227
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,910
Well, that's not my problem, though.

228
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,510
Good luck, Ebata-san!

229
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:52,330
Still, if you can't discuss work to any degree, doesn't that put Natsumi in a bind?

230
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:59,600
She has come to understand my circumstances over the months.

231
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,410
"Understand"?

232
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,600
I have asked our landlord, Shibahara-san, to check on her every once in a while.

233
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,810
I also make sure to provide her with enough money to live in comfort.

234
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,880
I strive to cause her no hardship whatsoever.

235
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,490
Hence the harmonious marriage, right?

236
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,080
What?

237
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,660
At least, that was my impression when I visited.

238
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,380
- Really now.
- Well...

239
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,880
Is this what's considered a "harmonious marriage"?

240
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,830
After my parents passed, "family" became an alien concept to me.

241
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,790
And I had assumed I was fine with that.

242
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,140
I had no household to inherit.

243
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,510
I had no interest in children or passing on my family name.

244
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:52,280
I thought I would be satisfied, dedicating my life to this duty.

245
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,150
And yet...

246
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,940
Welcome home, Takimasa-sama.

247
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,310
I'm truly glad to see you unharmed and well.

248
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,590
I have now grown accustomed to sharing meals face-to-face with Natsumi-san.

249
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,310
We sleep side by side, and share mundane occurrences.

250
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,390
Although what we do is nothing special,

251
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,400
if this contentment I feel is what you call a harmonious marriage...

252
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,170
Then I owe it all to Natsumi-san.

253
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,540
- Sorry, Sir. I should not have rambled...
- What?

254
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,470
You care for my daughter to that extent?

255
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:45,880
I thought you were a scumbag for ditching the wedding and only someone to be used for work.

256
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,280
What?

257
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,530
But I was absolutely wrong.

258
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:56,140
My son. Let's drink ourselves full tonight!

259
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,980
Oh, right! I'll follow Shibahara-san's suit and call you "Taki."

260
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,510
Taki. My son!

261
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,700
Taki.

262
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,500
Yes, Sir?

263
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,470
Taki.

264
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,760
Yes, Sir!

265
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,490
Oh, Taki!

266
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,740
You must be relieved he approved of you.

267
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,140
- Right...
- Taki, Taki, my son, Taki!

268
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,790
Well...

269
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,410
Truth be told...

270
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,750
I liked your wife.

271
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,700
She was my first childhood crush.

272
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,890
And before I knew it, a decade passed in the blink of an eye.

273
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,980
But I'll move on from her.

274
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,980
When I see her with you, it's clear there's no room for me anymore.

275
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,370
- Well...
- Please, don't console me.

276
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,430
I'll only seem more pathetic.

277
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,040
That really got things off my chest.

278
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,690
Ebata-san.

279
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,070
Please take good care of her.

280
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,450
Of course.

281
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:43,520
- Ta-Ta-Takimasa!
- Shut up, you drunk!

282
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,380
Are you all right, Mr. President?

283
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,840
Welcome home. I've prepared simmered flounder for us tonight.

284
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,740
I-In that case, I will have it for breakfast tomorrow.

285
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,130
What?

286
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,290
I had dinner out in town.

287
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,810
Is that so?

288
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:09,820
I'm sorry I didn't send word.

289
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,460
That's all right.

290
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,150
Did you perhaps have alcohol tonight?

291
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,200
Yes, just a bit.

292
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,400
Who were you dining with?

293
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,340
Erm...

294
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,340
Taki's a serious bloke; don't tell Natsumi about tonight.

295
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,770
If she hears I cried, I'll lose all face as a father!

296
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,380
I drank with some colleagues of mine.

297
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,270
He averted his gaze.

298
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,990
I shall get changed.

299
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,600
He cut the conversation short.

300
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,560
He was definitely with a woman.

301
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,270
Quiet! Natsumi will hear you!

302
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,490
You heard what Nacchan had to say. It's an obvious assumption.

303
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,850
And I agree with you.

304
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,190
But if we're so clear about it, Natsumi will only feel worse.

305
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,350
I was so relieved to hear he was her first crush.

306
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,910
- Poor Nacchan...
- What's this about Nacchan?

307
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,400
She was asking how to better get along with her husband, is all.

308
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,000
I know. How about she wear some makeup?

309
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,610
Makeup?

310
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,440
The novelty of marriage slowly wears off, does it not?

311
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,020
- So...
- She wears makeup, for a bit of a change?

312
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:43,050
- Great idea.
- And sometimes the woman ought to take initiative with...

313
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,630
With...

314
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,860
- I know.
- Yes, Fuyuko?

315
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,150
How about they go to the zoo together?

316
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,650
That's where you want to go, is it not, Fuyu-chan?

317
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,180
- No, you make a point.
- What?

318
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:06,580
A change of scenery and a change of face is sure to rejuvenate their relationship.

319
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,130
Still...

320
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,840
[Visiting the Ship]
[We're holding a viewing of the ship only for family members.]

321
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,840
Around this time, there was development on Fumiko's end as well.

322
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,360
She had received a telegram from Fukami.

323
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,050
"My father is proceeding with the matchmaking."

324
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,800
"It will be the day after tomorrow."

325
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,360
Fumiko.

326
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,170
You are a strong girl.

327
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,070
You will grow into a fine woman, befitting of this kimono.

328
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:48,200
You will become strong, independent, like these golden ray lilies.

329
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,580
Mother, wait!

330
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,900
Mother?

331
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,940
Mother!

332
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,380
I haven't dreamt of my mother in a long while now.

333
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:09,360
Am I... nervous? What a bother indeed.

334
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,620
Curl...

335
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,000
Okay then.

336
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,010
Dear, I've brought...

337
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,450
Oh, Natsumi-chan! Are you heading out to the ship?

338
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,880
Yes, Ma'am.

339
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,410
You've done your makeup. How adorable!

340
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,000
Taki-kun will be overjoyed.

341
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
I hope so, too.

342
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,190
Did you curl your lashes?

343
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,380
- Yes.
- Did you really?

344
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,240
Aunt, I will be in your care today.

345
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,550
Fumiko-san, why are you not wearing your furisode*?
(A long-sleeved kimono for unmarried women)

346
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,580
And lilies are summer flowers, right?

347
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,400
Do you realize why you are here today?

348
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,430
Yes. I am here for a matchmaking.

349
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,810
One I should be grateful for, at that.

350
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:24,280
It cannot be helped. Please at least act amicable, alright dear?

351
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,900
A bachelor of his caliber is practically unheard of.

352
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,710
I was even considering him for my youngest, you know?

353
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,810
He has already arrived.

354
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,490
I'll be in your care.

355
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:41,180
I had also considered wearing some furisode at first.

356
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,910
But I dared to choose this one, considering the ordeal I suspect today will be.

357
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,000
Especially with this man as my opponent.

358
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,960
Please, have a seat.

359
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,510
I feel ill...

360
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,010
I've become seasick.

361
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,250
Where could Takimasa-sama be?

362
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,820
A sailor had directed me to wait here, but...
[For first aid]

363
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,260
That woman in the red kimono certainly stands out.

364
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,630
Takimasa-sama?

365
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,390
I've never seen Takimasa-sama initiate conversation with a woman.

366
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,270
She's a bit close, is she not?

367
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,410
Keep this a secret from Oku-sama, will you?

368
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,740
I shall.

369
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,060
No, Takimasa-sama would never!

370
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,500
Stay steady. Keep calm.

371
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:23,860
I am Shibahara, the matchmaker for today.

372
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:29,920
Though I am most certainly no professional,

373
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,800
I shall do my utmost best for both families with us today.

374
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,220
I apologize for being the sole representative of our family today.

375
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,400
My husband leaves all matters of our household to myself.

376
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,040
Her father is similar in that regard.

377
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,670
Though this is where her mother would attend in his stead...

378
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,270
It's a pleasure to finally meet you...

379
00:25:54,270 --> 00:26:00,800
Is what I would say, if we were not already acquainted through a colleague of mine and his wife.

380
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,140
- A colleague?
- Ebata.

381
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,800
Then the wife is... Natsumi-san, right?

382
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,300
- Yes, Ma'am.
- So we are proceeding as "acquaintances."

383
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:18,180
That is why I wish to speak to Fumiko-san from the heart.

384
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,570
I look forward to our chat today, Fumiko-san.

385
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:24,540
Goodness, I'm glad you said that.

386
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,380
She is quite nervous, see.

387
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,500
That is not entirely a lie,

388
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,590
and yet,

389
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:40,100
"I've cast a helping hand. Now say whatever you wish."

390
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,540
I can almost hear his gloating voice.

391
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,030
And it gets on my nerve a little bit.

392
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:51,530
Fukami, I often see you playing shogi on the ship, do I not?

393
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:55,110
Yes, Sir. I also enjoy chess and poker.

394
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,740
Though the latter is forbidden onboard now.

395
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,840
Poker is no good.

396
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,460
Those bets were getting far too serious between you lot.

397
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,490
What do you do on your days off, Fumiko-chan?

398
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,120
Let me see...

399
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,360
I recall she wrote about enjoying Western novels.

400
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,440
- Recently, I have taken to lace knitting.
- What?

401
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,550
I especially tend to get absorbed in knitting complex patterns.

402
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:28,640
I do not need your "considerate" helping hand, thank you very much.

403
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,600
You really don't need to pretend with me though.

404
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,890
- Do you read any Western texts?
- I prefer Japanese literature.

405
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:42,880
This is the quickest way to appease the audience, you know?

406
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,460
Your stubborn refusal makes me want to tear down your mask all the more.

407
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,480
I believe some typists deal with Western writings, no?

408
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
If you so insist, go ahead. Try to best me.

409
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,960
My work centers around Japanese texts.

410
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,180
I am overjoyed to see the conversation is so lively.

411
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,990
- You two get along quite well.
- What?

412
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,230
My, I must agree.

413
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,610
Fumiko-san, just to confirm...

414
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,760
Yes, Ma'am?

415
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,860
You will quit your work when you get engaged, right?

416
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,960
My husband was quite worried, see.

417
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,260
Mother, I told you not to bring that up here. It's no easy answer to give.

418
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,010
But it is the most important question of all, is it not?

419
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:34,040
Well...

420
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,770
Yes, I will quit.

421
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,190
Thank goodness. That is a relief to hear.

422
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,220
Excuse me, Ma'am.

423
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,640
Some water for you.

424
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,460
Oh... thank you.

425
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,200
No need to get up, Ma'am. Please, stay seated.

426
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,960
Thank you.

427
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,540
And you are...

428
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,810
Petty Officer Second Class, Ichihara, Ma'am. I am sub-lieutenant Ebata's subordinate.

429
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,090
Petty Officer?

430
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,240
His errand boy, Ma'am.

431
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,610
- Oh goodness, my husband is...
- Ma'am, no need.

432
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,640
My husband is always in your care.

433
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,280
Likewise, Ma'am.

434
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,400
Oku-sama, there's something I wish to tell you, if I may.

435
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,050
Thank you for marrying Sub-lieutenant Ebata.

436
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,370
Pardon?

437
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:45,380
I never know what's on Sub-lieutenant Ebata's mind.

438
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,690
He's like the embodiment of duty.

439
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,570
Frankly, I find him hard to handle.

440
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,980
- Is that so...
- However!

441
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:59,490
Around spring of last year, his edges began to round out.

442
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:05,150
He's even begun to speak of things aside from work.

443
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,190
I believe this was all your influence, Oku-sama.

444
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,790
But please keep this all a secret from Sub-lieutenant Ebata.

445
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,470
I'd get a scolding if he knew.

446
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,820
Natsumi-san.

447
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,200
Takimasa-sama...

448
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,670
I'm terribly sorry I'm late.

449
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,030
How are you faring?

450
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:29,510
I feel much better, thanks to Ichihara-san here.

451
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,140
I shall excuse myself.

452
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,020
- Thank you again.
- Sure thing, Ma'am.

453
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,910
Takimasa-sama.

454
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,530
Yes?

455
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,100
Who was that individual you were speaking to earlier?

456
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,480
Earlier?

457
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,880
I happened to see you two conversing from the window here.

458
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,190
The individual was wearing a red kimono...

459
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,720
What?

460
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,190
You could call that person... a friend, I suppose.

461
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,790
What do you mean, "you suppose"?

462
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,190
Is that so.

463
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,970
Is he lying to me?

464
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,530
You can tell me who this was.

465
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,900
I'm sorry, but they requested secrecy.

466
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,640
Keep this a secret from your wife, will you?

467
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,410
I shall.

468
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,220
I see...

469
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,000
Both of them were so nervous, weren't they?

470
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,250
I feel utterly exhausted.

471
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,480
Fumiko-san. Great work in there.

472
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,410
How about we both slip out while we have the chance?

473
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,620
Since our attendants are entertaining themselves and all.

474
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,270
I suppose they are.

475
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,780
I also wanted to apologize for the hastiness of this matchmaking.

476
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,400
It seems my father caught wind of us somehow.

477
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,450
He took action before I could intervene.

478
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:21,900
Your telegram allowed me the time to steel myself.

479
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,780
Don't feel bothered.

480
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,060
Still, I was quite surprised today.

481
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,540
I never imagined you would allow these talks to proceed so smoothly.

482
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,450
I was rather excited to see where this would go

483
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,520
if we really let ourselves loose.

484
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,090
What a "wonderful" personality you have.

485
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,230
I shall take that as a compliment.

486
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,110
Although your efforts have made this matchmaking a success.

487
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,950
Now I can visit you whenever I wish, Fumiko-san.

488
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:10,160
I would say that sort of line is highly unbefitting for a navy man like yourself.

489
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,800
Over half your year is spent at sea, after all.

490
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,190
Touché.

491
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,990
Now that's the Fumiko-san I'm more familiar with.

492
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,860
And before I forget, regarding your job.

493
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,680
I'll convince my folks to change their minds later.

494
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,520
You don't want to quit, do you?

495
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,410
Fukami-san.

496
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,940
Your kindness to me is like a newborn child's blanket.

497
00:33:55,300 --> 00:34:00,810
It is warm, soft, and sickly-sweet.

498
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,420
If I lose focus for even a second, it tempts me to rely on you.

499
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:10,020
Fumiko-san?

500
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,820
- Why have I even come here today?
- What?

501
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:22,210
I was so excited to finally visit your boat, yet now I cannot move a step further.

502
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,810
This is the "gunroom." It is where our soldiers eat and relax.

503
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,650
I often chat with Fukami in this very room as well.

504
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,170
I see.

505
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,240
I am happy you have come to visit today, Natsumi-san.

506
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:56,770
Although this room should be all too familiar to me,

507
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:01,950
your presence has made it feel brand new all over again.

508
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,440
Sometimes the woman ought to take initiative.

509
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,590
Natsumi-san?

510
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,540
Are you feeling ill again?

511
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,080
Wh-What did I almost do just then?

512
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,190
Wh-What did I almost do just then?

513
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,930
That absolute womanizer.

514
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,460
I've been beat, haven't I?

515
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,580
She's so cu...

516
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,250
However...

517
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,110
Tell your father this.

518
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,760
If I am to marry, I shall quit my work.

519
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,090
I am fully aware a wife's job is grueling,

520
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,420
and it won't leave me enough time to work as a typist on the side.

521
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:22,020
But my working experience and knowledge is a coveted asset.

522
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:25,850
As such, wasting this potential will be a loss for your household.

523
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,690
I shall head on back inside.

524
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,260
Golden ray lilies?

525
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,550
How befitting.

526
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,170
Ebata. Your report here...

527
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,570
Was there some error, Sir?

528
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:55,010
Oku-san, may I borrow Ebata for a bit?

529
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,280
Ebata.

530
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,790
Coming, Sir.

531
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,570
Wh-What did I almost do just then?

532
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,230
And within Takimasa-sama's place of work?

533
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,710
How immodest!

534
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,150
No, shameless. How shameless I am!

535
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,330
Where is a hole to bury myself in?

536
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,190
I must reflect on my actions!

537
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,120
Natsumi-san, I apologize for the...

538
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,300
- Does your head ache?
- N-No, well...

539
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,960
Have you finished already?

540
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,610
Yes. Are you all right?

541
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,040
- Yes, I am fine.
- Please, give yourself a moment to rest.

542
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,420
I will bring you another cup of water.

543
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,780
That woman is...

544
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,000
It's okay. Everything will be okay.

545
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,840
I am Takimasa-sama's wife.

546
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,630
Sakai-san? The ohagi seller?

547
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,570
Taki?

548
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,390
What?
[Sweet Shop Sakai | Ohagi]

549
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,730
Yoshiharu? Is that you?

550
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:31,160
Now, now. Call me "Yoshiko."

551
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,040
I've come bearing ohagi for you all today.

552
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,170
Wh-What's with this outfit?

553
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,150
[For first aid]

554
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:56,130
It seems the matchmaking will proceed without hitch.

555
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,760
What a relief for you, right, Dear?

556
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,020
Yes.

557
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,510
And one more thing. Fukami-kun had a message for you.

558
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:07,780
Her lily patterned kimono suited her beautifully.

559
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,900
Like a golden ray lily, blooming with dignity atop a mountain.

560
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,000
Or so he said.

561
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,630
You must not let a catch like him escape, you hear?

562
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:24,650
Now let us discuss our next steps. First, we must...

563
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,940
Like a golden ray lily...

564
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,520
You will grown into a fine woman, befitting of this kimono.

565
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:46,010
"Beautiful," you say?

566
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,520
That absolute womanizer.

567
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,030
Nii-san*.
(A big brother)

568
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,140
What's up, Toraji?

569
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,270
Nii-san, what's up with you?

570
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,380
You're in a good mood for once.

571
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,090
Matchmakings usually leave you bitter.

572
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,840
Are you planning on marrying this girl?

573
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,660
Yes. That's the plan.

574
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,220
I see. Congrats!

575
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,420
Right...

576
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,190
Your sentiment isn't wrong, but...

577
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,780
I've been beat, haven't I?

578
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,130
I certainly can't tease Ebata anymore.

579
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:19,740
Today was full of surprises.

580
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,760
Or rather, the unexpected?

581
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:27,390
Either way, Sakai-san dressing as a woman was quite...

582
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,810
He's impressive, isn't he?

583
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,570
He was certainly more skilled with makeup than I was.

584
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,180
What?

585
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,530
You didn't notice?

586
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,290
I was wearing a bit of makeup today myself.

587
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:48,680
I see. No wonder I felt like something was different.

588
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,840
I didn't want to be rude so I said nothing.

589
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,200
Ikuko-san taught me.

590
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,350
It was one of those "challenges" I wrote about before.

591
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,690
Is that so?

592
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,280
Then that drawing you included...

593
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,390
What exactly is this a drawing of?

594
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,080
You cannot tell?

595
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:06,190
- A raccoon?
- What?

596
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,930
- A pig!
- It is a cat.

597
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,740
A cat?

598
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,390
I seriously don't see it.

599
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:24,250
These are the ears. And this is the tail.

600
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,560
I... see.

601
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:33,730
I wanted you to see it as well, Takimasa-sama.

602
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,150
There was a cute stray at the nearby shrine.

603
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,580
Yes.

604
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:54,770
Takimasa-sama. May I ask you for a favor?

605
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,540
Go ahead. What is it?

606
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,510
Your...

607
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,660
Your...

608
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,110
"Yes."

609
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,000
Please do not use it on any other woman.

610
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,780
Okay?

611
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,230
Yes.

612
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,070
Thank you so much.

613
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,860
She's so cu...

614
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,330
No, I mean.

615
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:40,560
What does she mean, not say "yes" to other women?

616
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,860
What sort of affirmation is she referring to?

617
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,060
Natsumi-san,

618
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,140
I do not speak with women aside from you in the first place.
