1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,560
The year is 1937.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,230
Natsumi is wed to the navy sub-lieutenant, Takimasa Ebata.

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,490
After overcoming her sister's childbirth,
the two speak openly to each other of their future.

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:20,180
With their bonds solidified,
Natsumi and Takimasa set out to view the fireflies.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,340
However...
[Katsudo-Benshi]

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,900
We've been deployed.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,380
I will be there shortly.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,250
As for Takimasa and Fukami...

9
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,620
Fukami!

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:45,060
- Takimasa and Fukami are...
- A Navy ship has been caught in a storm off the South Pacific.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,480
The area has been affected by violent winds,
cutting off communications from the deployed ship.

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,990
[Finale]

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,720
Good morning.

14
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,010
Good morning, ma'am.

15
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,870
Another early day?

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,170
I found myself awake before I knew it.

17
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,880
Would you like to have breakfast together?

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,760
I would love to.

19
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,840
Does everything taste alright?

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,390
Yes, this is all so delicious.

21
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,160
I'm glad to hear that.

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,420
Breaking news. Breaking news.

23
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:03,640
We've received word from the naval vessel
caught out in the South Pacific.

24
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,300
Communication systems have been repaired, and are functional.

25
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,160
Several sailors have been injured,

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,900
- Injured?
- and medical treatment for them is underway.

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,700
I repeat...

28
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,130
The maroon-colored building?
That would be Yokosuka's naval base.

29
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,400
Though a part of it collapsed due to the Great Kanto earthquake,

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,120
they rebuilt and reinforced its architecture in merely three years.

31
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,050
Naval command in this area is centralized at that base.

32
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,730
Maybe I could learn more from the Yokosuka base.

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,440
- Mrs. Natsumi?
- Ms. Fumiko...

34
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,060
Were you headed out?

35
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,490
I see. You hoped to visit the Yokosuka base.

36
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,360
But I reckon you would learn nothing new, even if you are family.

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,540
I figured as much.

38
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,370
I am in a similar situation myself, Mrs. Natsumi.

39
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:18,080
In fact, I came today to ask Mrs. Ikuko about the future.

40
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:28,990
Do you mean your wedding, and what is to become of it?

41
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:32,750
That, too. But the last time I spoke to him...

42
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,940
If I were to die, what would you do?

43
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,200
I would simply consider a different path in life for myself.

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,980
I parted ways with an unnecessarily cold remark.

45
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:50,900
My aunt had cautioned me to spend our time without regret,
like every moment would be our last.

46
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,450
Yet I suppose it's easier said than done.

47
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,250
Right. I'm not the only one who's worried, am I?

48
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,470
Feel free to talk to me, Mrs. Natsumi.

49
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:09,420
I will be here to listen anytime.

50
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,760
I keep having nightmares.

51
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,770
And they scare me awake.

52
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,120
I understand all too well.

53
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,820
Reading the newspaper terrifies me.

54
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,230
I pray to our home shrine constantly.

55
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,380
Every day, without fail.

56
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,830
My worries only grow with each passing day.

57
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,150
The anxiety feels suffocating.

58
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:23,420
But I do not wish for anyone to see how weak I've become.

59
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:30,400
Because Mr. Takimasa is going through far worse.

60
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,690
I am Mr. Takimasa's wife.

61
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,420
And as his wife...

62
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,400
I want to stay smiling, without fail.

63
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,360
Mrs. Natsumi...

64
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,640
My goodness, you two.

65
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,430
Mrs. Ikuko?

66
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,400
I had a feeling something was bothering you at breakfast today.

67
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:43,400
We navy wives fight alongside our husbands.

68
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,240
If you are shedding tears of misery for being left behind,
dry those shameful tears immediately.

69
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,680
If you are shedding tears from needlessly negative thoughts,

70
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,650
dry them, for you are being disrespectful
to those fighting for our country.

71
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,010
However...

72
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,520
If you are shedding tears because your heart is tired,
cry all you wish.

73
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,100
Mrs. Ikuko...

74
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,700
And remember, dear, you always have friends to confide in.

75
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,650
You are never alone.

76
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,530
Taki will be alright. As my husband once said...

77
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,760
That Taki's a sturdy lad.

78
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,420
It'd take more than an enemy cannon to snuff his breath out.

79
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,230
He really said that?

80
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,330
He made a comment about Fukami as well.

81
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:51,170
With that charisma, I reckon he'd talk his way right out of hell.

82
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,540
Oh, Commander Shibahara...

83
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,440
He understands his men well.

84
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,960
Then as their superior, Commander Shibahara would...

85
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,340
Pardon?

86
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,600
He would...

87
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:17,520
I know! He would be able to deflect anything!

88
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,930
I'm sorry, was that odd?

89
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,040
If only I could be more eloquent...

90
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,640
No, no. I'm sorry for laughing, dear.

91
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,000
Goodness... I love you, Natsumi.

92
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,640
And of course, you too, Fumiko.

93
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,240
I was given some delicious daifuku.
[T/N: Mochi with sweet filling]

94
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,630
Would you girls like some?

95
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,600
- Yes, I'd love to try!
- As would I.

96
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,140
This is delicious!

97
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,230
It is.

98
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,780
You have powder on your face.

99
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,390
On your hands as well.

100
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,770
Thank you. Do I still have some?

101
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,890
Mrs. Natsumi!

102
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,850
Welcome home...

103
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,310
I have returned.

104
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:44,010
Mr. Takimasa is here. Right before my eyes.

105
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,800
He's returned home, safe and sound.

106
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,790
Good morning.

107
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,180
If I had it my way, I'd prefer potatoes in my curry.

108
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,460
As if injuring myself due to the violent storm wasn't bad enough,

109
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,850
our electrical systems exploded soon after.

110
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,210
I was prepared to die then and there.

111
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,120
Even Ebata was caught up in the blast.

112
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,040
What?

113
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,010
He came out with minor scrapes. Not to worry.

114
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,250
Still...

115
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,690
We were the lucky ones.

116
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,020
- Mr. Fukami.
- Yes?

117
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:58,570
I'm terribly sorry for my remark the other day.

118
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,940
If I were to die, what would you do?

119
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,670
I would simply consider a different path in life for myself.

120
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,250
I had a feeling you would worry about that.

121
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,540
What?

122
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,090
The moment I had readied myself for death's embrace...

123
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,000
I realized I wanted to see you one last time.

124
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,660
I'm thankful I got to see you again.

125
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,890
Still, I never expected a reaction like that from you, Ms. Fumiko.

126
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,050
You had caught me off guard, is all.

127
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,440
Were you so worried for my well-being, to the point of tears?

128
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,360
Ow, ouch.

129
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,210
Don't let it get to your head.

130
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,520
Merciless even towards the injured, I see.

131
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,460
Your injury is no excuse for your attitude.

132
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:05,050
I hope my arm heals before we exchange our engagement gifts.

133
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,070
It will.

134
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,400
I will make sure of it.

135
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,600
How heartening.

136
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,810
I expected nothing less from you, Ms. Fumiko.

137
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,900
Ow, ow...

138
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,010
All this, for us?

139
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,240
I included plenty of fresh, seasonal fish as well.

140
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,830
Thank you very much.

141
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,490
I'm terribly sorry my father asked for such a rushed order.

142
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,620
It's no worry. Anything for a regular of ours.

143
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,450
Maybe I shouldn't have mentioned that.

144
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:53,840
In any case, please place the sushi trays out front
once you are done with them.

145
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,800
- Of course.
- I'm glad you made it back safe and sound, Taki.

146
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,850
- Here, have some sushi.
- Thank you, sir.

147
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:02,210
"Taki"?

148
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,000
"Taki"?

149
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,970
When did you become so chummy with Natsumi's husband?

150
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,600
Well, the other day...

151
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,130
Now that you mention it,

152
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,300
wasn't my childbirth the first time you two met?

153
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,490
But there wasn't any time to get acquainted then.

154
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,190
Let's just forget about this, alright?

155
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,400
Sounds suspicious...

156
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,080
- Hey...
- Now, now. Everyone has a secret or two to keep.

157
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,500
I suppose.

158
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,490
Then let me ask a different question.

159
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,810
What now?

160
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:47,470
Why did you approve of the matchmaking
between Natsumi and her husband?

161
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,380
- "Why"?
- I would like to know as well.

162
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,740
So would I.

163
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,990
I assumed you wanted a hand in the navy for business purposes.

164
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,860
Of course not.

165
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,850
Then why?

166
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,240
He saved Natsumi when she was feeling ill.

167
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,960
I had a feeling he'd be a nice guy.

168
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,010
- That's it?
- What, got a problem?

169
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,000
Fate works in mysterious ways, right?

170
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,570
- In fact, your father and I met in quite a similar fashion.
- Hey now...

171
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,710
- Really?
- You did?

172
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:31,640
He came to help me when my sandal strap broke!

173
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,260
That's nothing special.

174
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,510
Never knew.

175
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,680
- Neither did I.
- Great story, Father.

176
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,630
Quit poking fun at your parents.

177
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,050
- Right?
- Indeed.

178
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,910
Fuyu.

179
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,630
Thank you.

180
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
Some tea?

181
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,110
Thank you, Natsumi. Here, I'll take the tray.

182
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,130
Thank you.

183
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,620
- For you, Mr. Takimasa.
- Thank you.

184
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,870
Ouch!

185
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,220
- How nice.
- Huh?

186
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,510
Watching you two makes me want to get married, too.

187
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,750
Oh? Is there someone you have a crush on, Fuyu?

188
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,390
A crush? I... I won't allow it!

189
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,800
I don't have a crush! Yet.

190
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,070
Y-Yet? Don't fall for anyone until I find the perfect man for you!

191
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,020
Dear, calm down!

192
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,290
You can't, you hear me?

193
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,630
- We spilled soy sauce!
- We spilled soy sauce!

194
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,800
- Oh my!
- Goodness...

195
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,980
- What are you two doing?
- Sorry...

196
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,330
- Here.
- Thank you.

197
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,410
I'll have to wash this.

198
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,920
- Geez...
- It's alright.

199
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,030
Sorry.

200
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,140
Fuyuko!

201
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,810
- Keep a careful eye on Ichiko and Rinko, please.
- Sure thing.

202
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,380
Raising children is truly an ordeal.

203
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,750
Every day is like a new trial to overcome.

204
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,290
A trial...

205
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,960
They spill their food, they doodle on the walls,

206
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,130
and they won't hesitate to run until I lose sight of them.

207
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,670
I see.

208
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:24,230
But they're just so adorable when they fall asleep.

209
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:28,240
Natsumi, will you be having...

210
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,730
Huh?

211
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,300
No, never mind.

212
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,970
So long as you and your husband are happy, all is well.

213
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,460
- Harue...
- Natsumi.

214
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,950
Make sure you treasure your beloved, okay?

215
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,380
Thank you all for coming today.

216
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,170
Thank you.

217
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,160
Mr. Takimasa.

218
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,210
Yes, ma'am?

219
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,360
Thank you for coming home to us, safe and sound.

220
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,480
- Natsumi.
- Yes?

221
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,440
Make sure you continue to support Mr. Takimasa, alright?

222
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,490
I will.

223
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:20,240
And never forget your smile.

224
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,050
I won't.

225
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,000
- Then shall we leave them be?
- Yes.

226
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,070
- Thank you again.
- Of course.

227
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,760
- See you soon.
- Take care, you two.

228
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,200
Terribly sorry for the ruckus on your precious day off.

229
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,770
It's no worry at all.

230
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,000
I was happy to see them.

231
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,390
It felt as though I was part of your family.

232
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,490
But of course.

233
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,180
You have been a part of the family
for a while now, Mr. Takimasa.

234
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,330
Anyone home?

235
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,850
Yes!

236
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,500
Taki, you're really back.

237
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,900
Oh, it's just Yoshiharu.

238
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,940
What's that supposed to mean?

239
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,130
Miss, I brought some more ohagi for you both.

240
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,220
To celebrate Taki's return, yeah?

241
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,770
Thank you.

242
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,150
Please, come on in.

243
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,390
I was pushed.

244
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,050
Right, almost forgot I've still got a shop to run!

245
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,350
- I see.
- We'll drop by another time.

246
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,990
Sure thing.

247
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,430
Shall we enjoy these ohagi while they're fresh?

248
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,820
I suppose, yes.

249
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,970
Still acting all formal with each other?

250
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,060
It's like I'm watching a pair of strangers!

251
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,180
Is that so?

252
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:23,340
Miss, lemme tell you.
Men like it when you get a little cheeky with them, got that?

253
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,840
They do?

254
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,420
- They do indeed!
- Drop it already.

255
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,720
Then I'll be seeing you two around.

256
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,360
Ohagi, hagi, hagi!

257
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,790
Terribly sorry for his behavior.

258
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,410
I don't mind. I find him quite enjoyable.

259
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,120
What would you like for dinner tonight?

260
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,430
- Allow me to guess.
- Go ahead.

261
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,210
Ready and...

262
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,000
- Flounder.
- Meat - Flounder!

263
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,030
- Yes.
- Yes?

264
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,090
Flounder it shall be.

265
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,550
- Right.
- Yes.

266
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,020
Do you require any help?

267
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,010
No. Please, have a seat.

268
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:38,470
Well, I am rather bored, so...

269
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,400
Shall I stoke the flames?

270
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,530
Thank you.

271
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,180
That looks wonderful.

272
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,320
We owe it to your assistance, Mr. Takimasa.

273
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,960
I only helped to adjust the heat, nothing more.

274
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,440
Thank you, for always cooking our meals.

275
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,680
I am only doing my duty as your wife.

276
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,630
And... well...

277
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,560
I'm glad you are the one
I get to spend my days with, Mrs. Natsumi.

278
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,370
Truly, I am.

279
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,620
I feel the same way, Mr. Takimasa.

280
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,630
- Let us dig in.
- Yes, let's.

281
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,200
How does that taste?

282
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,010
I see no issue with it.

283
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,020
- Yes?
- No, nothing.

284
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:57,200
I was simply marveling about how you truly are home.

285
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:06,410
During our ceremony, I never imagined
we would spend such harmonious days with each other.

286
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:09,750
I'm truly sorry I couldn't attend.

287
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,180
Please, now it is something to laugh about!

288
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,960
I even terrified you when we did meet each other...

289
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,790
I share the blame for being so nervous as well.

290
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,170
And from our time spent together...

291
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,090
I believe we must first get acquainted with each other.

292
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,720
I've come to see how truly kind you are, Mr. Takimasa.

293
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,020
I also quite enjoyed our honeymoon vacation to Tateyama.

294
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,020
It's so beautiful.

295
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,290
The seashell I brought home from the beach
reminds me of our time there.

296
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,580
I share both sentiments.

297
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,160
That was when we viewed the moon from our lodging, yes?

298
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,700
I was surprised when you passed out from oxygen deficiency.

299
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,690
W-What a surprise indeed.

300
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,980
And then you left early the next morning for duty, as I recall.

301
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,960
I apologize for leaving you.

302
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,410
Do not apologize. You were only fulfilling your duty.

303
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,730
You returned home around August, was it?

304
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:40,810
Yes. I took you around town.

305
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:43,220
You told me of the fireflies as well.

306
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,780
Your hideaway?

307
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,440
Fireflies gather there in troves.

308
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,470
They light up the entire field!

309
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,880
We can make it a household tradition of ours.

310
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,060
In that case, I must absolutely return home now, don't I?

311
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,020
I also had my suit made.

312
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,570
You just don't get it, Mr. Navy.

313
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,660
- S-So cute!
- Measurements have to be taken standing.

314
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,020
We had our portrait taken, too.

315
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,540
Please send them my way when you can.

316
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:18,690
I'm truly sorry for leaving you.

317
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,760
I had you retrieve our photographs alone.

318
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,600
Please, it's no worry at all.

319
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:31,260
It seems all I've done is apologize.

320
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,220
- I'm always causing you trouble...
- That is not true!

321
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:44,380
Mr. Takimasa. You have given me much courage.

322
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,350
I'm so lonely...

323
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,780
Whenever my father left for duty, he had my mother cut his hair.

324
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,030
It was his promise to return home.

325
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:00,410
You are the one who has given me courage.

326
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,060
Back then...

327
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,680
Please, let me shoulder this burden with you.

328
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,500
I ought to storm their place myself.

329
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:14,650
It's alleviating to have someone get mad for your sake.

330
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,260
I was truly happy to have your support.

331
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,650
And I was happy you shared with me your burdens.

332
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,320
We went to greet your family afterwards, yes?

333
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,950
We did indeed!

334
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:40,060
We also discovered you were my savior from long ago.

335
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,560
That discovery was certainly a surprise.

336
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,390
And later that night...

337
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:51,800
The only person I wish would touch me, will forever be you.

338
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,210
Mrs. Natsumi. You're beautiful.

339
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,300
It seems to be getting quite toasty.

340
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,130
Yes, I can practically feel the heat.

341
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:15,310
Then, the rings.

342
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:20,950
It's a ring... to commemorate our marriage.

343
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,490
May we come to retrieve our rings in June or July?

344
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,450
I promise the two of us will come to receive them, together.

345
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,990
Let us get our rings tomorrow.

346
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:41,600
You wouldn't mind?

347
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,400
Of course not.

348
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,980
We can head out to see the fireflies afterwards.

349
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,290
I'm glad I could return before June came to an end.

350
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,630
Yes, truly.

351
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,000
These pickled plums are quite sour...

352
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:24,650
Right! I made something nice
while you were out at sea, Mr. Takimasa.

353
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,800
L-Let us finish dinner first.

354
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,710
Yes.

355
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,810
Here.

356
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,280
I made rings with wire and scrap fabrics.

357
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,080
I see.

358
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,910
I was practicing our ring exchange.

359
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,190
"Ring exchange"?

360
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:12,680
We take each other's wedding rings,
and put them on our partner's left ring finger. Or so I hear.

361
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,480
Interesting.

362
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,710
This was what I used to practice putting the ring on your finger.

363
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:28,310
And this smaller one, I put on my right ring finger.

364
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:31,010
Why the right, and not the left?

365
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,050
I hoped to save the left hand...

366
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:43,540
for when you would put the ring on my finger.

367
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:55,840
T-This is quite the creative way to practice.

368
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:07,650
This ring is far larger than my finger.

369
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,990
I had assumed it was about this wide.

370
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,710
Mrs. Natsumi.

371
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,280
Yes?

372
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,650
Your hand.

373
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,000
W-What brings this about?

374
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,150
I asked you to remember, even when we were apart.

375
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,400
But it seems you've forgotten.

376
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,910
Even when we are apart?

377
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,920
Please make sure you won't forget me.

378
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,030
Even when we are apart.

379
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:14,810
I had assumed that was about your presence, Mr. Takimasa.

380
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,220
I had hoped you would remember my hands as well.

381
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,390
Let us try it on.

382
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,690
Mr. and Mrs. Ebata. I have been eagerly awaiting you two.
Right this way.

383
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,070
[Matsukaze Department Store]

384
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,930
Thank you for your patience with us.

385
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:15,330
Thank you, sir.

386
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:19,940
Of course. I am also elated to hand these rings to you both.

387
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,070
Please, have a seat.

388
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,640
I shall bring your rings right away.

389
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,520
Please make sure everything looks alright.

390
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,420
This one would be for the missus, and this one for you, sir.

391
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,710
I suggest you try them on as well.

392
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,580
Right.

393
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,360
S-Somehow, this is a little nerve-racking...

394
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,630
I shall bring some tea for us.

395
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,920
Shall we try them on?

396
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,010
If we may...

397
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,780
Does that hurt?

398
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,680
No, not at all.

399
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,890
It's a perfect fit.

400
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,210
Then I will put yours on as well.

401
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,750
Please do.

402
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,580
How is the size?

403
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,560
It's a perfect fit.

404
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:37,420
I suppose our practicing paid off.

405
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,120
It certainly has.

406
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,030
Although, you were a bit hesitant...

407
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,030
N-No, I was not!

408
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,260
We're almost there.

409
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,790
Alright.

410
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,750
It's absolutely beautiful.

411
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,290
Thank you for showing me.

412
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:55,030
No need to thank me.

413
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,500
This is our household's tradition, after all.

414
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:09,630
Even so, thank you.

415
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,060
Yeah.

416
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:38,090
I cannot believe it has already been a year
since you first told me of these fireflies.

417
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:42,050
It felt so long, and yet so short.

418
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,380
What an odd feeling that is.

419
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:50,700
We've only spent a total of a couple of months together, after all.

420
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,620
N-No, I didn't mean it like that.

421
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:58,620
How do I put it...

422
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,150
Now this is an amazing sight.

423
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:16,190
Orihime and Hikoboshi...
[T/N: Vega and Altair, respectively]

424
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,590
Huh?

425
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:25,630
They are only able to meet once a year, on July 7th.

426
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,070
That is why that day feels so special to them.

427
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,370
We are similar to them, in a way.

428
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,080
It is because our time together is limited

429
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,000
that every moment...

430
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,690
Every hour...

431
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,010
Every minute...

432
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,580
Every second...

433
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,330
Is special to us.

434
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,740
It is something we treasure.

435
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,940
That is why time feels short, and yet so long.

436
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:03,320
Let us come to see these fireflies every year.

437
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,580
Of course.

438
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:25,960
This was an era where folks found their moments of peace,
while war loomed on the horizon.

439
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,980
No, rather...

440
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:33,930
Perhaps they cherished small moments in their daily lives

441
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:40,620
because war haunted over them.

442
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:50,590
Folks, are you cherishing the small moments in your daily lives?

443
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,530
- Let us dig in.
- Yes, let's.

444
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,600
How does that taste?

445
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,430
I see no issue with it.

446
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,630
Is it tasty?

447
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,190
It is.

448
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:11,810
I'm so terribly sorry! This is too high a hurdle for me.

449
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,580
I would prefer we stay with formalities...

450
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:23,010
Let us eat.

451
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,660
Yes, let's.
