00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,040
Greetings, my dearest audience!

2
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,590
"Who am I?" you ask.

3
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,210
Well, I am the Katsudo-Benshi!

4
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,660
In the past, movies didn't have sound

5
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,800
so we "Benshi" would narrate these movies to our audience.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,360
By the way, do you know of the year 1936?

7
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,550
"Not really"? Then allow me.

8
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,130
In America, the Chaplin film, "Modern Times," was released.

9
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,070
And in Japan, the February 26 incident occurred.

10
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,250
But folks, our tale begins

11
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:08,040
on a particularly beautiful spring day.
[1936 (Showa 11) | Spring]

12
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,280
There once was a woman, named Sekiya Natsumi in a certain house.

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,410
She was the third daughter of the Sekiya family.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,980
An earnest woman, who always put her best foot forth.

15
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,740
- Oh?
- At times, she could be a bit clumsy.

16
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,740
In your modern tongue, she would be considered an "airhead."

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,340
So that's how it works!

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,250
Natsumi, remember to wash the collar with extra care.

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,300
Yes, Mother.

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,700
Natsumi.

21
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,160
- Father? You're home early...
- Natsumi.

22
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,460
Yes?

23
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,880
The family that you'll marry into is decided.

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,840
The ceremony is next week.

25
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,800
What?

26
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,200
At the time, arranged marriages of all sorts were the norm.

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Yet she was to marry a stranger in a week?

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,550
That is quite sudden indeed.

29
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,860
What will become of our dear Natsumi's fate?

30
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,320
Her husband-to-be is a sub-lieutenant of the Imperial Navy.

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,630
And what a shock indeed.

32
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,810
For he arrived at their ceremony...

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,390
as a mere photograph.

34
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,640
Oh, he's a photo.

35
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,580
I am terribly sorry. He was suddenly scheduled for a drill.

36
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,300
"A drill"?

37
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,250
Yes. Our apologies.

38
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,290
And what about our matchmaker, Shibahara-san?

39
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,050
As his superior, my husband had to join him.

40
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,920
This is why I don't trust military men.

41
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,730
I agree.

42
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,520
I can't believe he puts his own drill above the ceremony.

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,320
Enough. Your father fully accepted this marriage.

44
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,110
I feel sorry for Nacchan*.
(*Natsumi's nickname)

45
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,800
A photo.

46
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,790
I am truly sorry about this, Dear.

47
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:22,480
♫ Hey, the "sorry" that I was about to say yesterday ♫

48
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,070
♫ And my unreliable responses ♫

49
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,920
♫ I'm crying underneath. I love you ♫

50
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,850
♫ I managed to lie and say, "I'm not bothered" ♫

51
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,660
♫ But I want you to understand that I feel uneasy sometimes ♫

52
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,030
♫ My love for you grows stronger, and it's like a roller coaster ♫

53
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,270
♫ Will it reach you while spinning, shaking, and crashing? ♫

54
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,320
♫ Tonight's love story; shooting stars are shining brightly ♫

55
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,940
♫ I'll tell you the rest of what I was going to say ♫

56
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,570
♫ Hooked on you. I say, "I love you." Stay in my sight forever ♫

57
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:02,320
♫ In the next life or even past ones, I'll always want to see you ♫

58
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,020
♫ Hooked on you all the time. I'll tell you so just listen ♫

59
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,800
♫ I'll call your name many times or even tens of thousands of times ♫

[Two weeks later]
[Shibahara Kunimitsu]

64
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,950
My, you don't need to clean, Natsumi-chan!

65
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,330
I have been here since the ceremony, Ma'am.

66
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,270
Please allow me to help.

67
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,890
It's nothing you need to worry about, Natsumi-chan.

68
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:48,640
Blame the navy for stealing your husband away for two weeks.

69
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,650
But worry not. My husband will be back with yours tonight.

70
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,120
Hey, we've returned.

71
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,440
Goodness, they're already here!

72
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,910
I'll bring him to you, Natsumi-chan, so wait in the guest room.

73
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,050
Due to his circumstances, the ceremony was held at the house of Shibahara, the matchmakers.

74
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,320
After two weeks of freeloading at their abode,

75
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:18,250
she was finally about to meet her husband

76
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,660
for the very first time.

77
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,730
I wonder what he's like?

78
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,770
Calm down.

79
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,080
Calm down.

80
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,740
Okay.

81
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,160
Okay.

82
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,450
Okay.

83
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,320
Okay.

84
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,320
Sorry for the wait. Are you ready?

85
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,780
Yes, Ma'am.

86
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,030
Taki-kun. Right this way.

87
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,630
Yes, Ma'am.

88
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,610
My husband and I will be in the main room. Let us know if you need anything at all.

89
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes, Ma'am.

90
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:58,250
What should I say?

91
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,440
I've never really spoken with a man before...

92
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,650
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

93
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,080
My name is Ebata Takimasa.

94
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,970
Nice to meet you, too.

95
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,970
No, that's not it.

96
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,030
Inexperienced as I may be, I will be in your care.

97
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,460
Right.

98
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,590
I don't know the lifestyle of a navy man well.

99
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,120
Could you kindly tell me about it?

100
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,300
I am no expert on the workings at home.

101
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,710
Please ask Ikuko-san for things of that manner.

102
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,720
Y-Yes, Sir.

103
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,250
Then I shall.

104
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,050
Conversing with men is so difficult!

105
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,750
Then let us be off.

106
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,000
Off, to where?

107
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,210
I stubbed my pinkie toe!

108
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,910
He's gone...

109
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,760
What? When did he...

110
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,620
Is this... a detached house?
[Shibahara Kunimitsu]

111
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,800
Pardon me...

112
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,720
What is he looking at?

113
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,290
Would this be... the main room?

114
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,670
A kitchen.

115
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,030
This place has a bath.

116
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,810
I simply cannot understand what is on his mind.

117
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:28,080
No, I am to work for this man! I mustn't be rude!

118
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,210
This must be the final room.

119
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,460
There's a dresser.

120
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,750
- It's settled. Please gather your belongings.
- What?

121
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:01,910
It takes Natsumi a few long moments to finally realize.
[Katsudo Benshi]

122
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,500
"It's settled"?

123
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,200
Does he mean to suggest they will live here?

124
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,320
Where has he gone?

125
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,410
No, I must learn to call him my...

126
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,040
My husband.

127
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,540
We had no utensils or pots so I borrowed some from the main house.

128
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,020
All necessary items have been placed at the entryway.

129
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,090
Oh, my! I hadn't caught on at all!

130
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,280
When did he carry all this?

131
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,510
This is supposed to be my job.

132
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,220
I can't be acting nervous!

133
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,880
What are you doing?

134
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,900
You do not need to carry all this.

135
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,090
But it is my job to man the kitchen.

136
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,840
I mustn't trouble you with this.

137
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,240
In that case...

138
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,220
I am letting go.

139
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,700
I will carry these cups to the kitchen.

140
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,400
Please put those bowls away in a cabinet.

141
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,780
Did you have any other qualms?

142
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,600
- Well...
- N-No, Sir! Not at all! I will carry these!

143
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,500
Why did she react in such a manner?

144
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,640
Was she disheartened?

145
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,180
I'm only ever in the company of men so...

146
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,650
He's expressionless. I can't read him.

147
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:46,550
Will I truly manage to do well with this man?

148
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,740
This is no time for worrying.

149
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,710
I asked Ikuko-san for all his favorites.
[Husband's favorite foods: White Fish, Clams...]

150
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,960
What matters most is food, right?

[Shibahara Kunimitsu]
[Ebata Takimasa]

152
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,140
Please do not explode...

153
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,790
Dinner is served.

154
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:07,180
That took two hours, and I still burned and messed up some dishes.

155
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,910
- Thank you for the meal.
- Thank you for the meal.

156
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,080
If something does not suit your taste, please set it aside.

157
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,680
I see no issue with these dishes.

158
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,790
Then I shall partake.

159
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,260
Excuse me...

160
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,940
Yes?

161
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,810
What seems to be the...

162
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,610
Is he already done?

163
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,200
I will bring seconds right away!

164
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,410
Pardon me.

165
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,820
Thank goodness I made extra miso soup.

166
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:02,770
What else... Right, I have the pickled plums I got as a free gift while shopping!

167
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,520
Here you go.

168
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,250
I'll have to eat quick as well.

169
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,640
H-He's... staring at me.

170
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,820
Is he telling me to pick up the pace and eat faster?

171
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:05,190
I ate too fast... and now I feel ill.

172
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,370
Excuse me, when would you like to bathe?

173
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,240
I can get that readied right away, if you wish.

174
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,120
I will not be bathing tonight.

175
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,050
I took one before coming back home under Commander Shibahara's orders.

176
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,740
Oh, the matchmaker...

177
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,350
I understand.

Please do.

180
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
Yes, Sir.

181
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,780
Did I say something strange? We'll need our bedding to sleep...

182
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,990
It's the first night!

183
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,330

184

185

Not like that.

188
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,830

194
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,150
Do we simply sleep side by side?

196

I am so terribly sorry.

204
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,660
I should have noticed, seeing as we even had no utensils.

205
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,380
Though it is late, may I head to the main house to borrow our bedding for the night?

206

We cannot trouble Ikuko-san and the Commander any further.

207

208

Head to the main house and ask to stay there for the night.

209
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,730
But I cannot simply leave you here...

210
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,470
My profession has trained me to stay awake until morning.

211
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,050
Please, head to the main house.

212
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,930

217
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,250
Is this truly acceptable as our "first night"?

218
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,790

219
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,470
I suppose it does.

220
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,310
I will turn off the light to preserve electricity.

223
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,540

225
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,040
This is... an outer coat?

Is he suggesting I use it?

227
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,620
Sir, I cannot use your—

228
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,900

247
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,900
Thank goodness Ikuko-san was willing to share some bedding with us.

248
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,220
Tonight, we'll get proper sleep.

249
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,000

250
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,180
I'm terribly sorry for falling asleep!

251
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,980
Not to worry, I slept a bit as well.

252
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,560
I will wash your coat and return it for sure.

253
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:33,890
Right. Time to air out our bedding and head out for groceries.

Leaving the home without a word is, of course, a given.

So you wrote your maiden name, hesitated, and were told to claim you were my sister.

355
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:10,020
Yes. I chose to follow their advice.

356
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,590
Who the hell told her to do that?

357
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,690
I was about to send her home!

358
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,710
I know no woman of the sort! Send her away immediately!

359
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,830
- Yes, Sir.
- Say, what was her name?

360
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,900
Yes, Sir. Her name was Sekiya Natsumi-san.

361
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,300
What?

362
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,060
- What?
- I'll send her away.

363
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,200
W-Wait!

364
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,850
Let her through.

365
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,900
It was my mistake. I'm terribly sorry.

366
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,660
No, it is not your fault.

367
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:50,860
You are allowed to rewrite your name so next time please write that you are...

368
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,390
my wife.

369
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,240
Yes, Sir.

370
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,020
You are the only woman in my life who would come to visit.

371
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,180
Hearing of this unknown "sister" made me panic.

372
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,120
The only one?

373
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:19,070
Which means he has no geishas or mistresses,

374
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,010
right?

375
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:26,540
So then, why have you come to visit?

376
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:32,370
Right. I brought a change of clothes as you did not return home last night.

377
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:35,730
A change of clothes? Sorry to bother you, but thank you.

378
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,450
However, today is my day off,

379
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,090
and I had planned to head back rather soon.

380
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:46,410
In that case, shall we head home together?

381
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,200
Is something the matter?

382
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,600
No.

383
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,320
Let us be off.

384
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,500
- My wife.
- His ..."wife"...

385
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,000
- I didn't know!
- You may call me by name instead.

386
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,200
- Ta...
- Na...

387
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,900
- I am so, truly sorry!
- What are we supposed to do on a "first night"?

388
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,000
What?

389
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:35,460
I thought I'd never hear those words again, not after my parents passed.

390
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,430
Shall we head home together?

391
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,650
Oh?

392
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,840
Taki! Hey, long time no see!

393
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,800
- Taki!
- Let me down!

394
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,320
My husband...

395
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,710
Taki, how're you doing?

396
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,000
- He... He didn't notice.
- I hear you moved to Shibahara-san's detached house.

397
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,450
Yes, I did.

398
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,640
Taki.

399
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,050
Is that someone you know?

400
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,110
Finally hired a housemaid?

401
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:19,600
No. She is...

402
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,160
my wife.

403
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,860
It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir.

404
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:35,660
Your... w-w-wife?

405
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,790
- I didn't know!
- I just told you.

406
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:42,130
- Since when?
- We met the day before last. Our ceremony was two weeks ago.

407
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,350
What?

408
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,210
His... "wife"...

409
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,840
Oku-san*.
(*Term of respect for a someone else's wife)

410
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,250
"Oku-san"?

411
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,810
Please let me visit your abode.

412
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,340
- Here you go.
- Thank you. And here's a little something from me.

413
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:08,420
The name's Sakai. I run a sweets shop.

414
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,350
Our ohagi's* are top-notch .
(*Sweet rice balls, coated in red bean)

415
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,370
My name is Sekiya...

416
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,020
I'm Ebata Natsumi.

417
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:22,840
Taki, you really got married, didn't you?

418
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,750
Weren't these ohagi's to be delivered somewhere?

419
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,510
I already did the delivery. We accidentally made extra, and I was on my way to bring them back home.

420
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,840
- So they're leftovers.
- Is that a problem?

421
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,040
Thank you for the ohagi.

422
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,830
Of course, give them a try, Oku-san.

423
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:44,430
- Then I shall bring plates.
- Sounds good.

424
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,940
- This is delicious.
- Right?

425
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:05,090
Isn't this guy hard to handle with his stoic nature and all?

426
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:09,860
No, not at all. If I may ask, are you two old friends?

427
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,750
Indeed, we've been buds since we were... thirtheen? Fourteen?

428
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,310
- Fourteen years old.
- Right.

429
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:20,960
Since you started living with the Shibahara-san's because you had no relatives, right?

430
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,750
Yes. My father and the commander got along during his time in the Navy or so I've heard.

431
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,920
I was told both his parents had passed,

432
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,500
but, otherwise, I truly know nothing about him.

433
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,320
Oku-san.

434
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:41,200
- Yes, Sir?
- Could I use your restroom?

435
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,590
Of course. Follow this hall down, and it will be to the left of that door.

436
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:50,550
I'll find my way there! Just relax and eat.

437
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,610
- You said to the right... I mean, left?
- Yes, Sir, that left door.

438
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:03,620
I apologize for earlier.

439
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,980
I'm not used to being called "my husband" and failed to notice you calling.

440
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,550
Please, it is no concern.

441
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,340
As such...

442
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,420
you may call me by name instead.

443
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,340
By name?

444
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,800
[Wrong]

445
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,230
He means his first name...

446
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,400
[Wrong]

447
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,220
Right?

448
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,870
[Ebata Takimasa]

449
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:39,860
Wait, right scroll.
[Takimasa]

450
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,560
I have never called a man by his first name before!

451
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,430
I understand. Then I shall.

452
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,040
Ta...

453
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,030
Then please call me by name as well.

454
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,510
What?

455
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,730
T-That would be rather...

456
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,550
Na...

457
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:32,450
Naturally, I understand.

458
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,920
I thought he was going to say my name!

459
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,080
Say her first name? Impossible.

460
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,270
No, I must say his name first.

461
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:55,170
I made the request. I have to take initiative.

462
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,580
Sorry for the wait!

00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:02,890

00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,440
Are you leaving so soon?

467
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,670
Why not stay for dinner?

468
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:16,040
Thank you, but I still have a shop to run.

469
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,590
Drop by when you've got the chance, will you?

470
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:22,010
Of course. Thank you again for the ohagi.

471
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,500
- See you around, Taki.
- All right.

472
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,290
I apologize for the sudden guest.

473
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:40,250
It's no worries, I was glad to meet one of my husband's friends.

474
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,350
Is that so?

475
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,080
Why did he pause?

476
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,420
No, don't tell me.

477
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,320
Is he angry that I didn't call him by name?

478
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:01,090
"My husband"...

479
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:07,770
I'm so terribly sorry. I failed to call you by name.

480
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,770
I will do my best to amend my mistakes if you give me the time.

481
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,430
I do not mind, really.

482
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,190
Natsumi-san.

483
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:40,360
Damn, I hadn't thought of what to say after.

484
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,940
That is all.

485
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:51,200
Did he just... call me, "Natsumi-san"?

486
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:57,200
Please, wait!

487
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:09,290
Did you say something?

488
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,150
Takimasa-sama.

489
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:31,260
That is all.

490
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,440
Takimasa.

491
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,210
Takimasa!

492
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,620
I thought I would never hear someone call my name ever again.

493
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,050
It is the second night since our initial meeting.

494
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,780
I repeat, it is night.

495
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,580
Should we be further apart?

496
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,500
Perhaps we ought to be close?

497
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,680
Tonight is our actual first night.

498
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:49,240
You were quick. Were you able to relax in the bath?

499
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,980
Yes, thank you for allowing me to bathe first.

500
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,720
- Natsumi-san.
- Yes, Takimasa-sama?

501
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:09,370
I can't get used to the first names.

502
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:15,460
You ought to bathe before the water gets cold.

503
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:21,000
Yes, Sir. Thank you.

504
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,180
No, that would be too close.

505
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,470
What am I doing?

506
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,920
I shouldn't be overly conscious.

507
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,990
Bathroom.

508
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,220
Wait.

509
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,400
The toilet is next to the bath.

510
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,990
I am so, truly sorry!

511
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,630
That could very well happen.

512
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,920
Excuse me, Natsumi-san?

513
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,660
I am coming in.

514
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,070
Pardon me.

515
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,590
Thank goodness...

516
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,210
We ought to buy a partition.

517
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:17,350
So this is what it means to live with a woman.

518
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,810
It requires extra care...

519
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:29,830
T-This calls for...

520
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,460
Alcohol!

521
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,600
I forgot to ask her to buy sake.

522
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,240
Excuse me.

523
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,380
Did I not cook enough for dinner?

524
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:56,330
It's not pickled long enough yet. Shall I make something easy instead?

525
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,250
No need.

526
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,190
I was simply running an inspection.

527
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,090
An inspection.

528
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,490
And now, the moment had finally come!

529
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,240
What do I do?

530
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,020
Let us sleep.

531
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,390
Yes, Sir.

532
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,600
- Let us sleep.
- Yes, Sir.

533
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:51,890
And now what?

534
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:54,860
Excuse me.

535
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,810
Go ahead, Takimasa-sama.

536
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,050
Thank you for preparing our bedding.

537
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,890
I truly feel as though I'm back on land.

538
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:12,010
Back on land? You exaggerate.

539
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,650
On the boats, we sleep in hammocks, after all.

540
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,690
Ham... What?

541
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:25,340
A cloth hoisted from two points. We sleep within that contraption.

542
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:31,820
Think of it like a sideways bagworm.

543
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,090
[Hanging]

544
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,220
Natsumi. Not like that.

545
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,840
Are you able to rest in these "hammocks"?

546
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,850
They're surprisingly comfortable.

547
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,350
They take no space, and during battle...

548
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:52,340
That is all I had to say. Go ahead, Natsumi-san.

549
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:54,060
O-Oh...

550
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,140
What should I do?

551
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,690
What are we supposed to do on a "first night"?

552
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,500
- What?
- I know I should not ask.

553
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:16,370
But we were not able to fulfill the "first night" yesterday because I fell asleep.

554
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:21,030
In any case, I will leave it all to you, Takimasa-sama.

555
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,650
I've gone and said it.

556
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,980
What does a first night...

557
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:32,050
I cannot explain the doings of men and women verbally!

558
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:37,430
No. I must be a man and take responsibility.

559
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,200
Well...

560
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:46,570
The act of intercourse.

561
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,480
"Intercourse."

562
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,900
What did that mean again? I had a dictionary somewhere...

563
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,360
T-There is no need to know if you were unaware!

564
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:59,240
A first night...

565
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,230
Yes?

566
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,980
Would... begin with a kiss.

567
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,300
A kiss...

568
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:10,090
At least, that is how some go about it.

569
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,710
However, I believe we must first get acquainted with each other.

570
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,010
Your hands, please.

571
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:32,620
We're holding... What do I...

572
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:41,990
Takimasa-sama, your hands are large and warm.

573
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,100
Is that so?

574
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,890
Natsumi-san, your hands are...

575
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,080
- Well...
- You're freezing.

576
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,670
Did you warm yourself up in the bath?

577
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,960
My body runs cold. As such, my hands tend to be cool.

578
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:09,510
Thank you for your concern.

579
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,210
Please, get some rest.

580
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,260
Yes, Sir.

581
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:22,180
Is one blanket enough for people whose bodies run cold?

582
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,370
Yes, it is plenty for me.

583
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,980
My hands have gotten warmer as well.

584
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,070
Would you like to see for yourself?

585
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:36,010
I jest...

586
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,590
Your hands are still...

587
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:50,920
I ended up grabbing her hand to check,

588
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,730
but what now?

589
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:58,310
The conversation led to that I made the offer, but what now?

590
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,710
Now that I've taken the step...

591
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,370
I will leave the rest to Takimasa-sama!

592
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:12,820
- Good night.
- Yes, good night.

593
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:36,240
And so, these two held hands for the rest of the night.

594
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:43,030
Sleep came to neither, and they were left exhausted the following day.

595
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,250
♫ I managed to lie and say, "I'm not bothered" ♫

596
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,600
♫ But I want you to understand that I feel uneasy sometimes ♫

597
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,430
Thank you for breakfast.

598
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,680
♫ Will it reach you while spinning, shaking, and crashing? ♫

599
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:02,660
♫ Tonight's love story; shooting stars are shining brightly ♫

600
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:07,290
♫ I'll tell you the rest of what I was going to say ♫

601
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:12,890
♫ Hooked on you. I say, "I love you." Stay in my sight forever ♫

602
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:18,820
♫ In the next life or even past ones, I'll always want to see you ♫

603
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:24,380

Thank you.

607
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,790
♫ Will you stay with me forever?

608
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,890
♫ Will you stay with me forever?

609
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,530
Then I shall be off.

610
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:42,460
Please take care.

611
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,380
Though I cannot be specific, know I will be away for some time.

612
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:53,280
Pardon?

613
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,150
Please take care of yourself.

614
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,010
Two months flew by after his initial departure.

615
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:17,670
Our tale resumes with summer on the horizon.

616
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,790
You have a letter, Ma'am.

617
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,840
Thank you.

618
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,040
Long time no see, Natsumi-chan.
[Preview]

619
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,020
- Seta-kun.
- Seta-kun?

620
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,680
Being considerate is important, you know.

621
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:47,990
This will practically be your honeymoon!

622
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:53,120
I'm sure if I lived with her every day, I wouldn't worry about other men.

623
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,460
Natsumi-san.

624
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,780
Takimasa-sama.
