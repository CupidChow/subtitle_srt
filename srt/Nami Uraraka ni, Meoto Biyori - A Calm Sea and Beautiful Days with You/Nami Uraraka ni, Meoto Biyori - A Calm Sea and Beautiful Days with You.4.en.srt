[Katsudo-Benshi]

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,450
Natsumi has wed the navy sub-lieutenant, Ebata Takimasa.

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,350
Though these two began as an awkward couple, they're slowly bridging the gap between them.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:15,800
In that case, I must absolutely return home, right?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,790
However, Takimasa is burdened with a difficult past.

6
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:23,810
Have I forced you to recall a sad memory?

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,290
No.

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:32,900
Natsumi was then invited to the Floral Fleet Commune, a gathering for naval wives.

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,890
There, she met a woman named Yoshimori Fumiko.

10
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,610
Pardon me, Ma'am.

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,660
I am happy to see you all at our Floral Fleet today.

12
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,800
Ladies, our duty is to protect our homes, raise our children,

13
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,780
and support our husbands while they are away.

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:28,170
I'm sure you all are well aware of the immense responsibilities you shoulder.

15
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,050
So let us allow ourselves this day to relax, and unwind.

16
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,640
- Mitsuko-san, may I?
- What is it?

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,660
Natsumi-chan.

18
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,580
Ladies, this is Natsumi-chan. I mentioned her at a previous gathering, as you may recall.

19
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,790
I am Ebata's wife, Natsumi. It's an honor to meet you all.

20
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,830
- It's our pleasure.
- Pleased to meet you.

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,480
Has married life been faring well for you and your husband?

22
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,800
Yes, Ma'am.

23
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,780
My, a newlywed couple indeed.

24
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,520
I pray you grow accustomed to life as a naval wife, Dear.

25
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,970
Especially with the potential for "other women."

26
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,550
Takimasa-sama would never do something of that nature.

27
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,360
When greeting my aunt, beware to never interrupt her.

28
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,070
My, how absolutely adorable!

29
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,690
I'd expect nothing less from newlyweds.

30
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,780
We remember when all of us had times like this, don't we?

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,430
You must be cherished by your husband.

32
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,250
How unexpected of Ebata-kun!

33
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,750
And I must say, your tea was a delight as well.

34
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,790
It seems you are as thorough with your work...

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,220
as Fumiko-san claimed.

36
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,020
Thank you very much, Ma'am.

37
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,990
That was a job well done.

38
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,960
I owe it all to you, Fumiko-san.

39
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,070
If I may ask, is it quite common for naval folk

40
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,820
to frequent geishas and have mistresses?

41
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,210
I cannot help but be curious.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,620
I see.

43
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,390
I can only speak on what I know, but perhaps it may help.

44
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,410
One wife keeps her husband on a well-kept leash by being good friends with his geishas.

45
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,000
Another sent all her husband's children to university, legitimate or not.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,500
And another lives in harmony with her loyal husband, despite having no children of their own.

47
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,270
Each has her own style and none are similar to the other.

48
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,870
As such,

49
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,430
I believe you, too, shall simply build a relationship of your own, Natsumi-san.

50
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,010
Takimasa-sama.

51
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,320
Thank you;

52
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,410
your advice fills me with confidence.

53
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,430
You're quite welcome.

54
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,890
Now then, let us get to our main topic of the day.

55
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,380
November will bring an end to these latter drills,

56
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,110
leaving the younger officers with plenty of downtime.

57
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,170
As such,

58
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,490
let us choose which ladies to send as their potential marriage candidates.

59
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,230
Fumiko-san.

60
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,720
Why do you think I've invited you today? You are to join us.

61
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,780
You cannot remain a bachelorette forever.

62
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,600
How about this lieutenant commander?

63
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,950
- My, what a handsome man!
- He looks wonderful.

64
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,040
I suppose.

65
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,890
Say, what of the sub-lieutenant named Fukami?

66
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,080
I would consider him.

67
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,920
Sub-lieutenant Fukami? For you, he is a bit, well...

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,910
- Right, ladies?
- Yes, I wholeheartedly agree.

69
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,050
Though, perhaps he is well suited for my youngest daughter.

70
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,660
She is quite the beauty, and they would make a fair match.

71
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,460
Fumiko-san,

72
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,010
was that perhaps on purpose?

73
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,940
Is this "Fukami-san" an acquaintance of yours?

74
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,880
No, I only know his name.

75
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,890
But with his looks, personality, and well-off family,

76
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,550
he is an incredibly sought-after bachelor.

77
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,660
So raising his name will divert the conversation, won't it?

78
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,800
I see.

79
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,020
Caught a cold?

80
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,890
No. Someone must be gossiping about me.

81
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,970
You're quite the M, after all.

82
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,690
"M" means a popular man.

83
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,840
Oh, how I wish that were me.

84
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,850
How about you also start a family of your own?

85
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,910
Wow! Never thought I'd hear that sentiment from you, Ebata-kun.

86
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,790
Quit pulling my leg.

87
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,440
I'm sure plenty of ladies are dying to have your hand in marriage.

88
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,090
Isn't there anyone you...

89
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,160
- You loveー
- No way!

90
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,030
What now?

91
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,800
Love isn't necessary for marriage. If anything, it's a burden.

92
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,730
You married your wife without ever meeting her before, didn't you?

93
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,890
I suppose I did, yes.

94
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,010
I know I'll have to marry eventually.

95
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,640
But

96
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,160
I'm not expecting anything grand from marriage.

97
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,420
Marriage is done to propagate the family line, nothing more.

98
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm almost impressed with how rational you can be.

99
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:48,090
How can they be so jovial every time?

100
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,090
Meanwhile, I'm on pins and needles...

101
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,530
This individual is...

102
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,280
The wife of Lieutenant Akiyama, Junko-san.

103
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,820
Junko-san, is something bothering you?

104
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,670
Natsumi-san, I believe?

105
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:12,430
Yes.

106
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,590
We must strive to gather information on our own initiative.

107
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,110
It's not as if the navy will explain its every detail to us.

108
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,180
Our duty is staying informed via newspaper or radio

109
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,690
and building viable connections here.

110
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,250
Yes, I agree.

111
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,900
But what were you worried about?

112
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,430
Let's not talk about this. It's nothing a newlywed needs to be burdened with.

113
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:37,600
Oh...

114
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,670
More importantly, do you know your husband well?

115
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,180
Personality and preferences are one thing. But knowing his past is just as important.

116
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:53,400
Have I forced you to recall a sad memory?

117
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,990
No.

118
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,930

I apologize for stopping by without notice.

141
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,560
I realized I hadn't thanked you for your help the other day.

142
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,420
No, I should be thanking you.

143
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,320
If you happen to have time...

144
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,610
Would you like to cook curry and rice together?

145
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,250
Is this a waitress' apron?

146
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,380
Now I'm not interested in cafes that have changed anymore,

147
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,040
but I longed for the waitress outfit when I was younger.

148
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,020
So I figured dressing cute would lift the spirits a bit.

Yes, let's.

Will you be wearing a smock, Fumiko-san?

152
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,670
Frills are not my style.

153
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,860

I'm sure that will be fine.

However, I do not know if I am allowed to do so.

I appreciate you both for so generously sharing your lunch.

175
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,280
But what's the occasion?

176
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,750
Natsumi-san has something she really wants to ask you, Ikuko-san.

177
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,920
Do you really?

178
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,040
No, or rather...

179
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:54,180
I wish to know more about Takimasa-sama.

180
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,430
I see.

181
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:12,360
All I know of Taki-kun's past is that his parents passed when he was 14 years old.

182
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:17,750
He came to our home about six months later.

183
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,030
That is all.

184
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,350
I know very little about his life before he arrived here.

185
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,110
Is that so.

186
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,530
I'm terribly sorry I was no help, Dear.

187
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,440
No, thank you for sharing regardless.

188
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,920
Remember what I told you before, Dear.

189
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,180
Taki-kun will accept whatever you have to say.

190
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,200
I suppose so.

191
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:04,850
- Did she fall asleep?
- Yes.

192
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,900
It seems a full stomach lulled her to bed.

193
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,680
Or perhaps she had been so anxious about Taki-kun's past,

194
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,980
that she hadn't been eating well.

195
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,860
I've truly pushed her into an unfair predicament.

196
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,960
Ikuko-san...

197
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,950
Ideally, the two would have met before marriage.

198
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,300
I ought to have gotten her better acquainted with Taki-kun.

199
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,870
And yet, we had them rush the marriage

200
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,040
for our own selfish reasons.

201
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,810
Selfish reasons?

202
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,640
You see, Taki-kun tends to treat himself without care.

203
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,670
He lived a cycle of study, work, and drills.

204
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,280
The few breaks he was given, he would spend on the vessel,

205
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,980
without giving himself a moment of rest.

206
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:14,520
Eventually, he had even considered enlisting in the army in Shanghai.

207
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:24,560
We were afraid he would willingly dive headfirst into battle of his own will.

208
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,410
We wished to stop him.

209
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,830
And as a result, we used this poor girl.

210
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:41,200
We quite forcefully negotiated their marriage.

211
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,800
But what if she still had dreams she wished to accomplish?

212
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,550
What if there was someone else she loved?

213
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,650
I cannot help but worry.

214
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,020
The family that you'll marry into is decided.

215
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,000
The ceremony is next week.

216
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,090
I understand now why everything was so sudden.

217
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:21,060
What would have become of me, if I didn't marry Takimasa-sama?

218
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,230
Would I have gotten married to someone else?

219
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,600
Natsumi-chan.

220
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,450
Seta-kun?

221
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,060
Doing well?

222
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,890
Fuyu-chan!

223
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,860
We thought you'd be lonely so we decided to drop by, Nacchan.

224
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, Fuyu-chan!

225
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,170
Is this the main room?

226
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,050
- Where do you all sit?
- Takimasa-sama sits on this side.

227
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,220
Oh! And what's this room here?

228
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,550
That would be where we sleep.

229
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,690
- Do you place your bedding side by side here?
- Yes.

230
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,810
Oh, you lovebirds!

231
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,400
Gosh, don't say that, Fuyu-chan.

232
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,610
Here, let me serve you both some tea.

233
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,750
This is rough.

234
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,220
Seta-kun?

235
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,930
I'm stepping out to get some fresh air.

236
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,930
- But our dango* (Japanese sweet dumplings)...
- I'll have one later.

237
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,400
Damn, why did I...

238
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,240
- What?
- What?

239
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,130
Perhaps you shouldn't have gotten married to me at all.

240
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,660
I'm so pathetic...

241
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,560
I want to support this person.

242
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:46,430
I wish to know what happened when your parents passed.

243
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,410
Cute.

244
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,360
- What?
- What?

245
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,440
Natsumi-san, are you all right? A trespasser wasー

246
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,670
Who?

247
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,820
A-And you are...

248
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,770
Takimasa-sama?

249
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,200
Natsumi-san... Thank the gods...

250
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,730
I apologize for my behavior earlier.

251
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,140
No, we share the blame.

252
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,040
We apologize for visiting while you were away.

253
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,730
So this man is... I feel a little uneasy.

254
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,450
My wife has told me much about you, Seta-san.

255
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:54,430
And I hear your work keeps you quite busy.

256
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,260
Oh no, not at all.

257
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,360
Did you have some business with my wife today?

258
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:13,470
Yes, I've come at her parents' request. They've asked that I check up on her.

259
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:17,330
They worry because you two haven't come to visit yourselves.

260
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:21,390
My apologies. I had planned to visit before the new year.

261
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,840
You truly are a busy man.

262
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,870
You must worry, leaving her home alone for long periods of time.

263
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,860
Gosh, I wouldn't be able to handle it.

264
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,330
You make a point, yes.

265
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,870
But she understands my circumstances, and for that, I'm eternally grateful.

266
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:48,430
Nacchan, don't you think those two are getting along well?

267
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,910
- Maybe they're more like-minded than we thought.
- But I'm grateful to her

268
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:56,000
- You think so?
- for understanding my preferences so well.

269
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,270
It took me ages to get Takimasa-sama to open up

270
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,070
or even smile.

271
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,860
Seta-kun, you sly fox!

272
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,390
Your tea, Takimasa-sama.

273
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:14,420
Thank you.

274
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,370
Here's yours, Seta-kun.

275
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,830
I made sure to make it extra bitter, just as you like it.

276
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,970
Right, thanks.

277
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,080
As he likes it?

278
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,650
Thanks, Nacchan.

279
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,680
That's so bitter.

280
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,430
Sorry, was that too much for you?

281
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,540
I guess that was a bit childish of me.

282
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,780
No, this is just fine.

283
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,360
She knows this man's preferences?

284
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,740
I will entertain these two for a bit, Takimasa-sama. How about you go ahead and change?

285
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,950
Right.

286
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,840
No, I shall remain.

287
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,220
I have things I wish to discuss, after all.

288
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,140
If you insist.

289
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:12,570
That means... he wants to speak more with Seta-kun, right?

290
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,110
What?

291
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,780
I cannot have them reminisce about childhood memories!

292
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,450
Why were you able to break Takimasa-sama's shell so easily?

293
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,600
- What's with the face?
- No reason.

294
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,280
She's never shown that sort of expression to me before.

295
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,700
- Then quit it.
- Quit what?

296
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,000
- You know what.
- You two sure get along.

297
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,920
Seriously, stop it with the face.

298
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,930
- What?
- You know what.

299
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,210
Oh, erm, well...

300
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,590
Though it may not be much for a souvenir,

301
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,750
I have some leftovers, if you'd like.

302
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,160
Caramels? And they're only leftovers?

303
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,240
He has navy money, and he visits other port towns.

304
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,200
Couldn't he bring something more decent...

305
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,430
Thank you.

306
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,910
Oh, I want some, too.

307
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,740
I have no more.

308
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,360
Nacchan, give me one.

309
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,960
Oh, but... Well...

310
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,000
I see now.

311
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,940
No wonder you were making a face.

312
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,010
What are you talking about?

313
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,220
You were jealous your husband was opening up to me.

314
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,270
I was not.

315
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,340
This is just like the time that stray cat only warmed up to me.

316
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,640
Don't liken Takimasa-sama to a cat.

317
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,890
What? He's totally like a cat.

318
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,630
No, he's not!

319
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,440
I apologize for the ruckus on your precious day home.

320
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,000
It's all right.

321
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:13,900
Rather, I'd like to know what you two were talking about earlier.

322
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,040
Earlier?

323
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,960
After I handed you those caramels, you were whispering amongst yourselves.

324
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:30,600
That is of no concern to you, Takimasa-sama.

325
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,100
Is it something you cannot tell me?

326
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,560
T-Takimasa-sama?

327
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,270
Tell me.

328
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,800
Seta-kun had told me

329
00:25:53,910 --> 00:26:00,700
that I was jealous of him because you two were getting along. And that was spot on...

330
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,030
- What?
- I'm sorry.

331
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,720
Takimasa-sama?

332
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,080
I'm so pathetic...

333
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,130
I must apologize.

334
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,130
I had gotten unreasonably anxious.

335
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,660
Anxious?

336
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,200
Don't get so close to other men.

337
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,760
Okay.

338
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,960
Takimasa-sama, I've finished bathing...

339
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,830
He must have been tired.

340
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,820
You'll catch a cold if you don't properly tuck in.

341
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,940
Cute.

342
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,250
Takimasa-sama, um...

343
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,040
Softer than I anticipated.

344
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,260
Were you perhaps listening?

345
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,820
Yes.

346
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:53,630
So now I'll consider ourselves even.

347
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,740
I only poked once. You pinched about ten times.

348
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,230
Isn't that unfair?

349
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,940

I was fourteen.

396
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:18,410
My mother, who always had a weak constitution, took a turn for the worse after he passed.

397
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:20,670
She then followed him, two months later.

398
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:27,920
Afterward, I stayed with my father's relatives in Hakone, who ran a hot springs inn.

399

405

I went on a mad rampage.

406
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,740
I destroyed all the imported furniture and precious pots I could find and ran.

407
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:15,650
I ran until I found myself back here.
