1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,800
The year is 1936 (Showa11).

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,300
Natsumi has wed the navy sub-lieutenant, Ebata Takimasa.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,930
Over half a year has passed since their marriage,

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,580
when Natsumi and Takimasa go to greet the Sekiya's for the first time.

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,160
While visiting, they also happen to learn of Natsumi's savior and first crush.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,600
Yet as it turns out, that man was none other than Takimasa himself.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,800
Perhaps this is fate?

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,230
Finally, as the day came to a close...
[Katsudo Benshi]

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,390
You're beautiful.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What have I done? Last night, I...

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,680
I said something so... promiscuous.

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,100
Moreover, I touched Takimasa-sama so, so many times...

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,900
In addition, the things we did... The things I've done...

14
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,210
Takimasa-sama will surely come to despise me!

15
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,890
Ouch...

16
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,880
Are you all right? I shouldn't have stood behind you.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,020
Yes, my apologies.

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,970
I will serve breakfast right away. Just a moment.

19
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,480
Of course.

20
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,070
All right. Thanks to Natsumi-san's headbutt, I could calm down.

21
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,020
I was practically in a fluster until just now.

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,260
Here you go.

23
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,370
Thank you.

24
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,450
Now I must remain level-headed.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,500
Thank you for breakfast.

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,840
I will serve us some tea.

27
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:14,710
The only person I wish would embrace me will forever be you, Takimasa-sama.

28
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,570
Level. Headed!

29
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,700
So salty!

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,400
What the heck is this?

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I've made plenty more for second helpings.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,500
Right, thank you.

33
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:36,300
The rice... is undercooked.

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,500
And the fish... is raw in the middle.

35
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,140
Don't tell me...

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,060
Is she silently expressing her anger toward me?

37
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,300
I cannot believe you put me through such embarrassing ordeals.

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,140
I have simply had enough!

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,910
In which case... I ought to apologize.

40
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,370
Last night, within those very arms and chest, I was...

41
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,200
You're beautiful.

42
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,800
What am I thinking so bright and early in the morning?

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,810
Thank you for breakfast.

44
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,300
Salty!

45
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,690
Did I not taste this?

46
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,500
Or was I so lost in thought about last night, I failed to notice?

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,300
Oh gosh, should I cook a new batch of breakfast?

48
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,800
More importantly, why hasn't Takimasa-sama made note of this?

49
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,700
It seems these two are reminiscing about quite a bit.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,660
So salty!

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,970
[Episode 7]

67
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,900
The end of the year was fast approaching.

68
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,510
I'm terribly sorry to have you help me clean, Dear.

69
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,150
It's no trouble. Year-end cleaning must be an ordeal in this large main house.

70
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,700
It certainly is.

71
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,140
Kunimitsu-san would help if he weren't busy, but alas.

72
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,870
Your husband?

73
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,380
But of course.

74
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,670
You ought to ask for Taki-kun's assistance with your home as well.

75
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,400
Oh, I couldn't really...

76
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,600
Natsumi-chan, remember this well.

77
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,500
Although we navy wives are below third-class officers outside the home,

78
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,120
within the home, we are only below Her Majesty the Empress herself.

79
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,100
That being said...

80
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,840
Would he truly help?

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,390
I cannot ask Takimasa-sama to clean on his day off...

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,700
- Is everything all right?
- What? Oh...

83
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,480
I am getting around to our year-end cleaning.

84
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,340
Oh, is it that time of year already?

85
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,410
Yes. So if I may...

86
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,980
Well...

87
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,880
Could I ask you to wait out in the hall while I clean thoroughly?

88
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,350
Of course.

89
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,800
I'm sorry to bother...

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,810
No worries.

91
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,700
Cleaning is my job.

92
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,400
Yes. This is only right.

93
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,240
Natsumi-san, if there is any way I can...

94
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,820
Oh, no!

95
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,100
- Does this go up here?
- Yes.

96
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,190
I would lend a hand if you asked.

97
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,500
- My apologies.
- No, what I mean is...

98
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,100
I'd like you to rely on me.

99
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,900
We're a family now.

100
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,820
So that is to say...

101
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,070
Anyway, you are the commander when it comes to cleaning, Natsumi-san.

102
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,660
Give me the order, and I will do anything.

103
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,350
- Anything?
- Yes.

104
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,360
In that case...

105
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,600
Could I ask you to clean our shrine?

106
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,200
Understood. If you would give me the order.

107
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,700
- "Order"?
- And please make it both clear and concise.

108
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,900
For now, let us go with "take down the shrine."

109
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,300
I understand.

110
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,900
Take down the shrine... Please?

111
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,300
That's no good. Concise.

112
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,400
One more time. Take down the shrine!

113
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,960
First, cleanse your mouth and hands.

114
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,300
Then pray before the shrine.

115
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,690
And finally, take it down.

116
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,760
Natsumi-san, your checks, please.

117
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,380
Checks?

118
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,900
If you see no issue, you will say "Proceed to clean the shrine."

119
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,700
To clean, your order will be, "Begin cleaning shrine."

120
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,730
When I am finished, you will say, "Cease cleaning. Return shrine."

121
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,080
Understood?

122
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,800
Yes, Sir.

123
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,000
Then we shall begin.

124
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,180
It seems they've adopted naval commands into their cleaning regime.

125
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,000
Proceed to clean the shrine.

126
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,500
Begin cleaning shrine.

127
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,600
Natsumi-san? It is I, Fumiko.

128
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,500
Yes, come on in.

129
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,450
Thank you for coming to assist us today.

130
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,530
- Of course.
- I hear Fukami-san will be joining us later as well.

131
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,600
I had a feeling he might.

132
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,100
"Had a feeling"?

133
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,800
He had mentioned it in a letter.

134
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,780
A letter?

135
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,700
So they've kept in touch!

136
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,620
He'll be making mochi* with the Ebata's?
(*A Japanese rice cake)

137
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,900
Then, if I offer to help, I may have a chance to see Fukami-san.

138
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,400
There has been development between these two!

139
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,610
This is wonderful news!

140
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,820
Ready, and...

141
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,560
There.

142
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,870
There.

143
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,920
There.

144
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,490
And again.

145
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,700
There.

146
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,200
There.

147
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,730
There.

148
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,050
There.

149
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,520
- There.
- Excuse me.

150
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,350
That's enough, Dear.

151
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,300
- There.
- Oh, there you are.

152
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,900
There!

153
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,510
Why have I been sent with you?

154
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,360
I would have managed just fine alone.

155
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,610
Now, now, don't say that. You saw how Ebata's wife pleaded.

156
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:02,050
I'm terribly sorry, but it seems I've forgotten to get us some sake.

157
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,970
Fumiko-san, could I trouble you to go buy us a bottle or two?

158
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,930
Oh, Fukami-san! Please accompany her!

159
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,830
She's not the greatest liar, is she?

160
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,300
Either way, it seems she desperately wishes for us to get along.

161
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,710
Natsumi-san tends to deeply misunderstand at times.

162
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:26,070
Say, how was my letter?

163
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,300
It surprised me, in more ways than one.

164
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,600
To think you would pen the letter in a woman's name...

165
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,180
Fukami Ryuko-san.

166
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,970
I didn't wish to worry your family, is all.

167
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,800
My younger sister is thoroughly convinced you're a lady with excellent penmanship.

168
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
What a relief.

169
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,700
But I worry that you now think I'm a clever womanizer.

170
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,200
That is precisely what I think you are.

171
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,460
Then you misunderstand.

172
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,300
If you knew I could misunderstand, then the measures you took

173
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,100
were wholly unnecessary.

174
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,100
Hold it! You brat...
[Vegetables and Fruits]

175
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,200
Please wait, Sir.

176
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,330
- How much?
- What?

177
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,900
Will this suffice?

178
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,500
Yes, thank you.

179
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,000
Wait.

180
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,400
You're forgetting to say something to her.

181
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,510
He must have his circumstances.

182
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,860
Right?

183
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,400
Mom disappeared and Dad's sick.

184
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
My younger brother and sister are starving.

185
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,440
That's no reason to resort to theft.

186
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,520
What would you people know?

187
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,810
You wear nice clothes and nice shoes.

188
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,910
Of course, you'd say that.

189
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,500
I bet you feel great,

190
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,100
- offering charity to us poor rats.
- I'd suggest you stop there,

191
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,060
unless you wish to become a lowbrow.

192
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,450
- What?
- If you don't want pity, then at least act respectable.

193
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,100
Sorry. Forget what I just said.

194
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,100
I also have a younger brother.

195
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Just like you, I desperately try to be an older brother he can always rely on.

196
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:49,230
So even if it gets tough,

197
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,900
you have to stay an honorable man.

198
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,810
You want to remain a proud older brother, right?

199
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,910
- A gift?
- What?

200
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,450
You won't be getting one for yourself, Takimasa-sama?

201
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,980
- Could you repeat―
- No.

202
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,320
Say, how were things with you and Natsumi-san's friend?

203
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,770
I've decided to make this year end celebration a special one for Takimasa-sama.

204
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,530
- You're cu…
- Was he about to say I was "cute"?

205
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,730
I wonder if things are going well between Fumiko-san and Fukami-san.

206
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:39,500
- Right...
- I even lied to them about our stock of sake.

207
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,200
I feel a bit guilty for doing so...

208
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,500
Let's drink while we wait for their return.

209
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,900
Natsumi-san, can you handle alcohol?

210
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,200
I've given it a sip once, during our wedding.

211
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,090
It was far too bitter for me to stomach.

212
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,950
In that case, how about adding sugar?

213
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,600
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

214
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
I shall give it a try.

215
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,700
This, I can drink.

216
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,530
You're most definitely lying.

217
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,010
This is quite sweet.

218
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,000
Shall I add a bit more sugar to yours?

219
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,590
Yes, please.

220
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,800
What a sudden downpour.

221
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,170
I reckon it won't last long.

222
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,540
We can simply wait it out.

223
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,100
You can use this if you'd like.

224
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,840
I have my own, thank you.

225
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,400
Here.

226
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,900
- I'm fine.
- Take it, kid.

227
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,200
The navy has prepared me for any weather.

228
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,200
I'm fine without a coat.

229
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,800
I can introduce you to some work delivering the paper.

230
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,390
What?

231
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,540
- If you're up for it―
- I am.

232
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,540
Go to the newsagent on Shiokaze Street.

233
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,420
You can get a job if you say Fukami Ryunosuke sent you.

234
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,560
Thanks.

235
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,600
If you're going to thank anyone, thank Fumiko-san here.

236
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,960
Miss.

237
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,710
Thank you.

238
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,080
You're welcome.

239
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,940
I'm going to go now.

240
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,290
I want to feed these apples to my brother and sister as soon as possible.

241
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,320
Thanks for the coat.

242
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
- You won't need it?
- No.

243
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,990
If I join the navy,

244
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,550
can I be a reliable older brother like you?

245
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,000
That depends on you, kid.

246
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,800
See you, Mister.

247
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,030
Take care.

248
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,800
- How unexpected.
- What?

249
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,990
With children, you don't deceive them with your usual fake smile,

250
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,630
and you face them seriously, don't you?

251
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,600
Children are innocent, after all.

252
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,100
To that boy, my household name and appearance mean nothing.

253
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,360
Pardon?

254
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,150
Most who approach me are only interested in my legacy

255
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,300
or my face.

256
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,500
This is especially true with women.

257
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,240
But you are different.

258
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,970
Wasn't that line particularly suave?

259
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,860
I believe making light of your sincerity is a detriment to yourself.

260
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,750
Ever the harsh critic, I see.

261
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,160
I would have had a more favorable impression of you, if not for that last statement.

262
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,710
- What?
- Just kidding.

263
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,370
- Could you repeat—
- No.

264
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:55,040
You will catch a cold, you know.

265
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,040
You'll get sick.

266
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:13,030
Me, sick? Now that's strange...

267
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,460
Because you pushed yourself, saying, "The navy prepared me for any weather."

268
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,950
May I send you another letter?

269
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,940
Do as you wish.

270
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:57,990
- Thanks for having me today.
- Sure.

271
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,320
Say, how were things with you and Natsumi-san's friend?

272
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,880
What?

273
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,080
I know you're not actually interested.

274
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,690
Natsumi-san insisted I ask.

275
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,820
Just head back in, your wife's waiting.

276
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,540
If you insist.

277
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,890
I'll see you around.

278
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,390
- Ebata, before I leave, how did things go after that?
- What?

279
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,940
Were you able to please your wife somehow?

280
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,650
Oh, I see.

281
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,070
We visited her family together. She seemed to appreciate it.

282
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,940
Excuse me?

283
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,450
What?

284
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,650
Come on. Visiting family is a given.

285
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,280
I mean, yes. I understand. But...

286
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,040
Have you given her any gifts?

287
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,020
Gifts?

288
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,050
Quit making faces.

289
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:10,220
What sort of gift am I to give?

290
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,750
Figure that out yourself. Bye.

291
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,280
A gift?

292
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,750
This is bad; I can't think of a single thing.

293
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,310
Open wide.

294
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,050
How is that, Dear?

295
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,650
It tastes absolutely flavorful.

296
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:44,520
Goodness, I cannot remember the last time we celebrated the new year with Taki-kun.

297
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,040
Did he not celebrate with you all every year?

298
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,770
Since entering military school, he had only come to greet us

299
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,550
out of consideration for my husband and I.

300
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:59,950
It seems he spent many New Years on the boat or at a lodging.

301
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:07,350
Perhaps the year-end vacation was no different from an ordinary break for that boy.

302
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:22,420
Ikuko-san, I've decided to make this year-end celebration a special one for Takimasa-sama.

303
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,650
My, that sounds wonderful!

304
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,260
Or so I had planned, and yet...

305
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,800
Certainly, we ought to visit a shrine and ring in the new year there?

306
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,880
I'm satisfied enough with our new year soba* and a bath.
(*Japanese buckwheat noodles)

307
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,950
I wouldn't want to head out while we're warm, and catch a cold.

308
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,160
I suppose...

309
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,460
Besides...

310
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,050
I feel more at ease spending my time here with you, Natsumi-san.

311
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,670
May I stay awake until the new year?

312
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,990
- Can you?
- Yes.

313
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,820
My family always spent the new year awake until midnight.

314
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,800
I see.

315
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,200
I guess she's reached her limit.

316
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,930
Natsumi-san. Let us head to bed.

317
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,480
I'm awake!

318
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,370
- Still...
- I stayed up every year. I will be fine.

319
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,010
How did your family pass time until the new year?

320
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:51,990
We would chat or play games like karuta* (Japanese playing cards) or a sort board game.

321
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,490
Unfortunately, I haven't brought any games with me.

322
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,150
I don't own any either.

323
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
I will be fine as is.

324
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,510
After all, I have vowed to make this year end celebration special for you, Takimasa-sama.

325
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,200
In that case, let us play a board game.

326
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,750
But you said...

327
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,800
If we have none, we only need to make one ourselves.

328
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,530
I'll plot out several spaces for us to fill in.

329
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,700
What should our first space be?

330
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,190
[Start]

331
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,930
- How about a march...
- Perhaps a young lady...

332
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,140
A march it is.

333
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,100
No, we should find something we have in common and work from there.

334
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
Something we have in common.

335
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,420
Let's see...

336
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:00,110
How about we start with a marriage ceremony?

337
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,460
The next space can be a "first meeting" of some sort.

338
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,150
[Marriage Ceremony]

339
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,790
Then if a player rolls a one or two on this space,

340
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:18,120
let's say the groom-to-be is absent, and the player rests a turn.

341
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,610
How nostalgic.

342
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:23,240
What was your impression of me when we first met?

343
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:33,030
When we met? You were very... No, you were quite...

344
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:39,910
I mean, you were a bit scary.

345
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:42,480
You can say I was quite terrifying.

346
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,220
Back then, I wasn't certain how to interact with you, Natsumi-san.

347
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,120
My apologies for scaring you.

348
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,130
I see. I never knew.

349
00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:01,330
Yet now I know you are a strong woman. There is no one I can rely on more.

350
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,620
Don't call me "strong."

351
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:13,110
I'd appreciate a cuter compliment, mind you.

352
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,800
I-Is that so.

353
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,310
Do I call her "tough"?

354
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,400
No, that won't do.

355
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,580
Then how about "reassuring"?

356
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,400
No, that has a strong nuance as well.

357
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,970
Cuter...

358
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,400
All right, it's now or never.

359
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,200
You're cu...

360
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,540
"Cu"?

361
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,060

00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,920
No, I can't say it!

365
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,020
Was he about to say I was "cute"?

366
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,950
Let us fill in the rest of these spaces.

367
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,940
R-Right.

368
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,750
I suppose our next space ought to be "first-name basis."

369
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,590
- Natsumi-san
- Takimasa-sama.

371
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,280

373
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,600

374

I know no woman of that sort! Send her away immediately!

375
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,500
Yes, I remember.
[Visiting]

376
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,950
Including our vacation to Tateyama is also an absolute must.

377
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,110
I will add it in.

378
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:51,620
The sea is so beautiful, Takimasa-sama!

379
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,950
[Trip to Tateyama]

380
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,440
Afterward, we spent time gazing at the moon...

381
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,510
I fell asleep before I knew it, right?

382
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,810
Due to oxygen deficiency, I believe.

383
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,290
Y-You had, indeed.

384
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:21,160
- Then you told me when you would return.
- Shhh.

385
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,490
That, we cannot include.

386
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,510
Yes, right.

387
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,670
What else... Oh, you took me around town!

388
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:36,090
Then I had my suit made, and we watched a meteor shower.

389
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,880
- Please include the day I cut your hair definitely. 
- Of course.

391
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,480
Afterward, Fuyu-chan and Seta-kun came to visit.

392
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,990
That isn't a necessary event to include, is it?

393
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:07,110
In that case, how about we include us tailing Fumiko-san and Fukami-san in disguise?

394
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,570
Good idea.

395
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,580
I'll have to include visiting your family, of course.

396
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,600
Then we did our year end cleaning, and made mochi.

397
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,680
Drat, I drew the spaces too small. Now we have extra spots.

398
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,970
That's no problem.

399
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,940
We have plenty of years ahead of us.

400
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,190
Filling spaces will be no ordeal.

401
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,380
I... suppose not.

402
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,680

I swear it upon these muscles...

406
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,580
Oh?

407
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,080
It seems my muscles are not feeling so well today.

408
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,890

Let us add "showing off our muscles" to our board.

413
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:44,110
You'll include something like this?

For everyday wear, this semi-cylindrical ring is a popular choice.

492
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,930

496
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,050
Excuse me, is this also a ring?

497
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:28,670
There are two bands.

498
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,350
Yes, Sir. That is known as a gimmel ring.

499
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:36,690
It consists of two linked rings,

500
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,220
which fit together to become one.

501
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,880

504
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:59,010
Matching rings are something many women dream of, aren't they?

505
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:04,370
I didn't know about a gimmel ring before. It was beautiful.

00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:05,210
Of course. But more importantly, how does it fit?

530
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,260
It's a bit large.

531
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,840
Thank you.

532
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:28,060
Just to confirm, are you purchasing a ring solely for Oku-sama today?

533
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,030
Yes, thank you.

534
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,870
You won't be getting one for yourself, Takimasa-sama?

535
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,690
I don't tend to wear accessories.

536
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,810
I see.

537
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:49,920
As I have served many customers in the span of my career,

538
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,260
I understand how you feel, Oku-sama.

539
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,520
Matching rings are something many women dream of, aren't they?

540
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,130
Yes, embarrassing as it is to admit.

541
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,440
They are?

542
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,810
But with my profession...

543
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:10,370
If you cannot wear a ring, how about carrying it in a pouch?

544
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,440
But a man with a ring?

545
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,210
That is...

546
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,800
We shall get a ring for myself and my wife.

547
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,720
Thank you very much.

548
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,860
Wonderful.

549
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,540
If these rings are to be a pair,

550
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,120
might I inform you of our engraving service?

551
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:54,030
We could include your initials, or the date of your wedding within the band, for example.

552
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,280
Then we shall both get engravings as well.

553
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,360
Excellent choice.

554
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,770
For the engraving, should it be the date of our ceremony?

555
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,250
That may be nice...

556
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:15,060
Although, you weren't there, Takimasa-sama.

557
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,100
How about the day we first met instead?

558
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,970
That day wasn't a particularly auspicious day, as I recall.

559
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:27,020
We ought to pick a date with better fortune.

560
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,900
In that case, the day we visited the theatre?

561
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,690
Do you recall when exactly that was?

562
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,120
No.

563
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,030
We would like our rings to say "1936, Spring."

564
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,200
And could we include our initials as well?

565
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,090
Of course.

566
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:02,760
Your rings will be ready in a month.

567
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,230
- What?
- What?

568
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:11,190
By then, Takimasa-sama will surely be back aboard the ship.

569
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,180
I cannot wait for our rings.

570
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,440
Takimasa-sama...

571
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:30,370
I wish to ask about earlier.

572
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,160
- In that case, I shall—
- Sir.

573
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:40,380
May we come to retrieve our rings in June or July, which is six months from now?

574
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,380
I promise the two of us will come to receive them, together.

575
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,850
Why in half a year?

576
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:56,160
I left you for our photographs, so I wanted to retrieve our rings together.

577
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:01,840
- Although, I will keep you waiting for a while...
- It's alright.

578
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,040
I will wait, however long I must.

579
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:16,420
I didn't know about a gimmel ring before. It was beautiful.

580
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:20,710
I was enticed by two rings becoming one.

581
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,770
They're together,

582
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,460
even when they may be apart.

583
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,180
Indeed.

584
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,540
She's a bit close, is she not?
[Preview]

585
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,190
Is he lying to me?

586
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,490
- He was definitely with a woman.
- Good luck,

587
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,520
Ebata-san.

588
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,730
Now I can visit you whenever I wish, Fumiko-san.

589
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,770
I feel flustered as well, ma'am!

590
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:54,370
Is this... a raccoon?
[This drama is fiction.]

591
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,780
What?

592
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:05,000
♫ I'll call your name many times or even tens of thousands of times ♫
