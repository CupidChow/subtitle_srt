00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,680
A true gentleman does not seek indulgence.

377
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,110
Guo Kui, even if you're a dog,

378
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,760
there are rules to follow.

379
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,280
To be a gentleman is to not be

380
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,280
overly driven by desire for indulgence.

381
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,830
I'll beat you up if you're being picky! Eat!

382
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,350
Yingying, why are you in such a bad mood?

383
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,880
Who did you argue with?

384
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,310
No one.

385
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,640
I was just in a fight.

386
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,110
With whom?

387
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,950
I don't know.

388
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,160
They dress in fine clothes,

389
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,760
but they have no idea who I am.

390
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,070
Yaoting, we've talked about it before. Stick to the old rule.

391
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,640
If no one comes looking for us, act like nothing happened.

392
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,470
If someone does, take Mother for a walk.

393
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,830
Mr. Ji,

394
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,590
Ms. Ji,

395
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,680
Mrs. Hua is here.

396
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,190
Yaoting, don't worry. I'll see her.

397
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll hold her off.

398
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:09,950
Give me.

399
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,350
Mrs. Hua,

400
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,920
[Hesheng Rice Store]
the silk you ordered are all here.

401
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,880
Kindly check the numbers.

402
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,110
[Huarong, the owner of Hua's Dyehouse]

403
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,680
The color is dull, lacking vibrancy,

404
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,830
and it doesn't have the luster it should.

405
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,920
It doesn't feel smooth either.

406
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,470
Mrs. Hua, take a closer look.

407
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
This is the finest mulberry silk of Jiannandao,

408
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,710
with a consistent texture

409
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,710
and a soft luster.

410
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
The color is far more vibrant than anything else on the market.

411
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Mr. Ji,

412
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,880
I'll be honest with you.

413
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,230
Business has been tough lately.

414
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,190
A few of the major brocade merchants in Yizhou

415
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,560
have been undercutting prices.

416
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,880
If this continues,

417
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,760
I won't be able to afford your silk anymore.

418
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,470
Trust is the foundation of everything.

419
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,920
Since we've made an agreement,

420
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,310
we should honor it.

421
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,070
That may be your business practice,

422
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,640
but my practice

423
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,800
is to buy it

424
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,880
at five-tenths.

425
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,680
If you don't want to sell, that's your choice.

426
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I'll pay you at the original price for this order,

427
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,470
but don't expect

428
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,520
any more orders

429
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,680
from me after this.

430
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,880
Mrs. Hua, you're aware of my family's situation.

431
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,430
We have to pay you annual interest,

432
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,640
and on top of that, my mother is ill.

433
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,880
Her medicine requires a lot of money.

434
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,470
What about this?

435
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,470
If you're truly in need of money,

436
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,640
I can lend you 20 guan.

437
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,430
We already owe you money.

438
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,590
If we borrow more...

439
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,230
How...

440
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,430
How could we ever manage to pay off what we owe?

441
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,280
Yaoting,

442
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,430
Mrs. Hua is joking.

443
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,230
She won't lend us money anymore.

444
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,880
Mrs. Hua.

445
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,710
Why wouldn't she?

446
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,110
Yaoting, think about it.

447
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,470
We already owe her 50 guan.

448
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,760
If we borrow another 20 guan,

449
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
the three percent interest

450
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,160
alone exceeds

451
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,070
our family's annual profit.

452
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,560
If we can't pay her,

453
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,230
our family

454
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,710
will end up as servants to the Hua family.

455
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,710
But Mrs. Hua

456
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,310
is generous,

457
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,310
beautiful, and kind.

458
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,110
She wouldn't force us to sell ourselves,

459
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,920
so of course she wouldn't lend us money,

460
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
right, Mrs. Hua?

461
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,680
Alright then.

462
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,160
Since your family doesn't need the money,

463
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,680
I'll adjust this order

464
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,470
to four-tenths of the price.

465
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,280
Mrs. Hua.

466
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,070
Alright.

467
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,110
We'll adjust the order as requested, Mrs. Hua.

468
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,680
This way, please.

469
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,880

Our dog

476
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,950
can't tolerate shouting.

477
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,880
The louder you get,

478
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
the faster it will sink its teeth into you.

479
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,520
I'm warning you.

480
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,430
If you deliberately hurt me,

481
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,560
you'll find yourself behind bars!

482
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,310
I'm warning you.

483
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,520
If you deliberately hurt her,

484
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,310
you'll find yourself behind bars!

485
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,430
It said the food in prison is better than at home.

486
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,520
Oh dear!

487
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,230
It's actually willing to go to jail.

488
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,830
What do you want from me

489
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,230
for you send the dog away?

490
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,230
You know it.

491
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,920
Five-tenths.

492
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,430

493
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,760
not to yield to a simple five-tenths discount.

494
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,190
That's five packets of rice!

495
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,560
Did you even know that?

496
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,950
Six-tenths. Only six-tenths at most!

497
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,000
It said six-tenths isn't even enough to buy its meat.

498
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,230
It still wants to go to jail.

499
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,590
Seven-tenths! Seven-tenths at most!

500
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,110

I know Mrs. Hua is doing this

507

to force us

A three-tenths discount

514
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,760
won't hurt her.

515
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,560
She can be angry,

516
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,830

She's not mute.

541
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,590
You don't need to defend her.

542

and aggressively

549
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,950

I'm hungry. My stomach is growling.

556
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,800
I'm so hungry.

557
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,430
I know I've made a mistake.

558
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,000
Please forgive me.

00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,190
I've been thinking

563
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,400
about how Mrs. Hua has been collecting

564
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,310
our debts for the past eight years.

565
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,640
She's still our only creditor

566
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,590
to this day.

567
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,040
I think she has

568
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,000
other motives.

569
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,000
Have you had enough yet?

570
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,430
Let your brother worry about this.

571
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,590
You're all grown up.

572
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,160
You can't keep acting like you did before.

573
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,310
You also have

574
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,760
an engagement with Mr. Zhao.

575
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,000
Mr. Zhao has been generous to our family over the years.

576
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,590
Don't put him in a difficult position.

577
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,800
Yaoting isn't married yet. I'm not in a hurry.

578
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,680
You cannot refuse what is offered by elders.

579
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,310
Ting.

580
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,280
I will not marry

581
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,950
until I have cleared our debts

582
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,160
and restored our family's honor.

583
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
How resolute!

584
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,680
I'm younger, so don't refuse it.

585
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,830
When Heaven bestows great responsibility upon someone,

586
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,230
it first tempers their mind and body

587
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,190
through hardships

588
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,470
to fortify

589
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,310
their character.

590
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,640
Enough...

591
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,950
Ji Yingying, tell me.

592
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,920
Who did you fight with today?

593
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,880
Mother, I didn't fight with anyone today.

594
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,350
Actually, it's because of Huanhua Dyehouse,

595
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,040
Yingxia Dyehouse

596
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,280
and several other dyehouses.

597
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
There are just

598
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:51,920
some...

599
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,950
I'm not entirely sure either.

600
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,680
Guo Kui hasn't eaten yet.

601
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,350
I have to make its dinner.

602
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:57,950
Ji Yingying!

603
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,560
Guo Kui!

604
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,110
You...!

605
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,760
Time to eat, Guo Kui!

606
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,680
This child.

607
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,230
Ting,

608
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,310
do you know who she fought with today?

609
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,880
I do not.

610
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,920
Find out about it tomorrow,

611
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,640
and make sure to apologize to them properly.

612
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:13,880
Mother,

613
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,680
Yingying isn't the quiet or gentle type,

614
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,350
but she wouldn't cause trouble without reason.

615
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,950
This matter feels...

616
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,400
Does it even matter who's right or wrong?

617
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,760
Do you not understand too?

618
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,830
I do...

619
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,560
I no longer desire

620
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,680
luxurious things.

621
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,000
All I wish for is for both of you

622
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,520
to live in peace.

623
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,280
Yes, Mother.

624
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,680
Please don't be upset.

625
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,520
Eat your food.

626
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,000
I'll go tomorrow.

627
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,640
Mr. Yang,

628
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,680
I know

629
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,640
I've failed you.

630
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,280
You trusted me

631
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,310
with looking after your mentor,

632
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,430
but he's gone now.

633
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Three brocade officers

634
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,350
have died

635
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,040
in Yizhou alone.

636
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,800
He could have chosen any path.

637
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,040
Why choose to be a brocade officer?

638
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,000
I don't...

639
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,040
What was it that he wanted you to pass on to me?

640
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,920
He told me

641
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,000
to pass this on to you

642
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,560
when I saw you again.

643
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,310
This is your best friend in Yizhou.

644
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,590
What is so good about him?

645
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,110
He trusts me.

646
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,590
[Zhu Gehong]

647
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,430
What message did Mr. Shen

648
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,350
leave for you then?

649
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,920
Do I have to report to you?

650
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,560
I forgot my place.

651
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,560
What are your plans for tomorrow?

652
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,040
Are you going home or...?

653
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:54,590
I am meeting a friend.

654
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,760
You have friends in Yizhou?

655
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,110
The messenger only mentioned that

656
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,470
soldiers surrounded your house.

657
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,070
Perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

658
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,160
You again?

659
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,040
It's you!

660
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:22,000
Something urgent came up at home!

661
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,950
Please give me a lift.

662
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,950
If my family makes it through this crisis,

663
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,680
I'll be your friend.

664
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,520
A future friend!

[Huanhua Dyehouse]
Tell Ji Yingying to come out!

666
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,070
Ji Yingying, show yourself!

667
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,560
Ms. Ji!

668
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,430
Ji Yingying, I know you're in there!

669
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,880
Ms. Ji,

670
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,040
what should we do now?

671
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:11,470
Open up!

672
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,350
Now I see why

673
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,160
Mrs. Ji asked me who you were fighting with.

674
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,430
No one knows.

675
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,040
It turns out he wasn't from Sandaoyan.

676
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,400
He's Mr. Sang from Yizhou!

677
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,760
What should we do?

678
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,830
Mrs. Ji and Mr. Ji aren't home right now!

679
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,950
They are out restocking!

680
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:24,920
Don't worry, Gui.

681
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,920
I'm here!

682
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,040
Wait... Ms. Ji, what are you looking for?

683
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,950
I'm looking for a useful tool.

684
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,950
Open up!

00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,350

What's with all the commotion early in the morning?

687
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,070
So it turns out Mr. Sang has honored us with a visit!

688
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,430
Are you scared now?

689
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,520
Listen here!

690
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,560
Get on your knees and apologize to me!

691
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,280
I'll spare you this once,

Thank you for your generosity.

694
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,470
You're truly kind.

From head to toe, or left to right,

I don't see any wounds on you?

Look at my leg! My head!

This arm! Here! They're all broken!

Does it hurt?

I value my appearance too much to harm myself.

Why would I ruin myself?

718
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,070
Enough with the accusations!

Yes! We all saw it!

check your wounds, then?

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,190
you've been instructed to find the Shu Red Silk.

751
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,830
This is the taste I've been after!

752
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,520
I tried making it myself,

753
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,350
but I couldn't get it right. Have a try.

754
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:18,360
I have made a chance for you.

755
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,710
Mr. Yang?

756
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,560
You've arrived at the perfect moment! Please come.

757
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,120
Be our judge!

758
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,430
Wasn't it her who purposely hit her head just now?

759
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,760
I witnessed everything

760
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,360
that happened just now.

761
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,600
I think...

762
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,000
Chief Sang will be back in two days.

763
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,800
I wouldn't cause a scene

764
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,040
if I were you.

765
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,840
You'd get a beating.

766
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,360
Why would I get a beating?

767
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,520
Look here. Between you two,

768
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,360
who would your father believe?

769
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,950
But I'm wrapped up like this...

770
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,560
You can trick everyone else,

771
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,430
but you can't fool your father or me.

772
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,840
Fine! Just you wait!

773
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,190
This is not over!

774
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,120
Let's go!

775
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Take care, Mr. Sang!

776
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,630
Everyone...

777
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,560
They have already left.

778
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,800
Haven't you seen enough?

779
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,280
Should I have Mr. Sang

780
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,080
go to your home and create trouble?

781
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:25,560
Come on. Let's go home,

782
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,150
Gui!

783
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,600
Sir!

784
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,430
Sir,

785
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,630
I accidentally broke a bowl earlier

786
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,040
and don't have enough money with me.

787
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,230
Could I trouble you to pay for it on my behalf?

788
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,950
If it's inconvenient for you,

789
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,430
I'll have to ask Mr. Sang

790
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,190
to come back and pay it for me.

791
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,670
Thank you.

792
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,840
Ms. Ji,

793
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,430
every action has its cause.

794
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,000
If Mr. Hua hadn't mentioned the beauty of the view

795
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,560
at Huanhua Creek,

796
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,910
Shisi wouldn't have insisted to welcome me there,

797
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,630
and none of this misunderstanding would have occurred.

798
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,760
The Hua family?

799
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,190
No surprise there.

800
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,120
In that case,

801
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,280
I'll have to trouble you

802
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,710
to speak with Mr. Sang

803
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,760
so he doesn't hold anything against us folks from Sandaoyan.

804
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,910
What do I get out of it?

805
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,710
Good things

806
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,760
come to those who do good!

807
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,190
The speed that it dries...

808
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,230
This color...

809
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,670
Is that dye

810
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,230
on your forehead?

811
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,950
You've got guts

812
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,630
tricking Mr. Sang like that.

813
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,360
What do you want?

814
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,760
I lent you a hand.

815
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,360
The least you can do is invite me for a drink.

816
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,630
Deal. Please, step inside.

817
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,040
Hold on!

818
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,840
Sir, here's your water.

819
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
You want me to drink here?

820
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
It's my family's rules.

821
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,950
It's custom to have a drink once you're inside.

822
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,190
Okay.

823
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,950
Alright.

824
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,520
We're square. Please leave.

825
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,760
I haven't got in.

826
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:28,520
You wanted to come in.

827
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,560
I let you.

828
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,390
You wanted a drink.

829
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,600
I poured you one.

830
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,150
Thanks for your assistance.

831
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,000
Pardon me for not seeing you out.

832
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,120
Wait! I helped you!

833
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,950
Thank you.

834
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,360
Thank you for your help.

00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,950
Ms. Ji?

Ms. Ji!

837
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,670
Hey!

838
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,670
You left me outside!

839
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,560
Ms. Ji!

840
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,190
Slow down, Mother.

841
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,320
Stand right there!

842
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,910
Mother!

843
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,320
I didn't get into a fight. I really didn't!

844
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:12,670
- You... - Yingying,

845
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,120
you're injured!

846
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,280
Oh, no. No!

847
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,470
It's fake!

848
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,120
I'm not hurt at all.

849
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:21,840
It's fake?

850
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,910
See?

851
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,840
So?

852
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,760
I can't scold you because it's fake?

853
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,800
But that's the only way I could fool them.

854
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,630
They all believe this is real.

855
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,910
Mother,

856
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,190
Sang Shisi came here

857
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,560
because Mrs. Hua provoked him.

858
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,950
Even if Sang Shisi is willing to let it go,

859
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,320
Mrs. Hua won't let this slide.

860
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,120
Yaoting,

861
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,520
we must come up with a plan to deal with her.

862
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,190
Ji Yingying!

863
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,280
Can't you just let this be?

864
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,120
Must you always fight everything

865
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,280
because of your nature?

866
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:56,670
Mrs. Hua

867
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,600
dominates the market with no shame,

868
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,360
yet she targets us specifically.

869
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,230
Why?

870
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,470
You think I'm the cause of all this?

871
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,430
Because I wouldn't submit,

872
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,120
that's why they are out to get us?

873
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,390
You think that I'm wrong?

874
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,040
How many times have I told you?

875
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,950
I only want our family

876
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,840
to have a peaceful and stable life.

877
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,390
Even if we face bullying and losses,

878
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,390
as long as there's no further trouble, it's already a blessing enough.

879
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,520
Am I wrong to wish for this?

everyone knows

890
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,040
that only the Shu brocade washed in this creek

891
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,560
achieves its vibrant color.

892
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,630
