into whatever you need.

195
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,520
But before we team up,

196
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,320
I need to know

197
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,150
if your benefactor can protect the Ji family.

198
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,320
How did you know I have a benefactor?

199
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,710
Could I not have done it by myself?

200
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,400
How could you have become a brocade officer on your own?

201
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,590
I will use

After my father's death,

I cannot stand the sight of blood.

That is the reason

211
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,920
why I’ve never succeeded in dyeing Shu Red Silk.

But to be safe,

562
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:20,840
Zhuge,

563
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,000
please find one more person for me.

564
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:23,760
Come closer.

565
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,560
We have finally found their hideout.

566
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,040
The Yang family is indeed impressive.

567
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,120
The peonies look real.

568
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,670
The brocade from the Zou family is impressive too.

569
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,360
The peacock looks just as lifelike.

570
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,670
It looks like it will fly out of the fabric soon.

571
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,710
The brocade contest is about craftsmanship,

572
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:28,670
not about who can make it look the most lifelike.

573
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,150
I think the Yu family's piece is quite good.

574
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,120
It has a certain elegance to it.

575
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,080
The brocade from the Yu family feels a bit outdated.

576
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,520
[From To Li Yong by Li Bai]
"Like the great roc soaring with the wind,

577
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,670
ascending to the heavens!"

578
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,390
Please, everyone, feast your eyes on our brocade!

579
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,360
The brocade is rather pretty.

580
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,150
How boring.

581
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,430
It is indeed a good one.

582
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,910
It looks normal.

583
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,800
Mr. Yang,

584
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,950
the Yang family's "Heavenly Beauty" displays

585
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,470
remarkable technique

586
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,190
and elegance,

587
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,600
while the Zhao family's concept is exceptional,

588
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,320
with a color palette that's truly masterful.

589
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,950
We cannot decide just yet.

590
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,670
What is your opinion…?

591
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:58,910
You're right!

592
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,190
Both families' brocades

593
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,910
have their own unique qualities.

594
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:04,120
In my opinion,

595
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,910
since it is still early

596
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,950
and we are finding it difficult to choose,

597
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,470
perhaps…

598
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,000
we should take more time to observe,

599
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,190
think it over,

600
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,120
and reconsider.

601
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,800
Who are you waiting for, Mr. Yang?

602
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,080
Since the outcome has been decided,

603
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,190
could you please announce the results?

604
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,320
Do we have the outcome?

605
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,150
Yes, yes, we do.

606
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,120
This time,

607
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,600
the winner of the Brocade Weaving Competition

608
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,630
is…

609
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,560
the Zhao family...

610
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,390
Everyone, look!

611
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,670
There is a kite!

612
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,630
Yingying!

613
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,600
It is Yingying!

614
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,390
She is here! Ji Yingying! Ji Yingying!

615
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:13,470
Ji Yingying! Ji Yingying! Ji Yingying!

616
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,430
Mother, look at the color of the kite.

617
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,190
Could it be…?

618
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,190
Shu Red Silk?

619
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,470
Yes, it is!

620
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,000
This is the real Shu Red Silk!

621
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,560
Didn't they say the Ji family

622
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,080
could no longer make Shu Red Silk?

623
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,630
Ji Yingying,

624
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,230
where did you

625
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,280
get the Shu Red Silk kite?

626
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,080
We might have lost the ability to make it before,

627
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,800
but that does not mean we cannot do it now.

628
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,280
Besides, just because others cannot recreate it

629
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,430
does not mean I cannot either!

630
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,950
I, Ji Yingying, representing the Ji family,

631
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,150
present our brocade,

632
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,230
