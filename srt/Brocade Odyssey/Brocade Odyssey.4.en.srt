00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 4]

3
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,000
[Yuebuhuan]

4
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,120
A single tree cannot make a forest.

5
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,830
Today, our ability to resume silk washing

6
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,630
is due to the efforts of everyone here.

7
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,480
I toast to all of you. Cheers!

8
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,080
But this is only the first step.

9
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,910
While we now have a place to wash silk,

10
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,830
we have undoubtedly lost

11
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,080
Mrs. Hua's order.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,270
And with her influence,

13
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,830
the other dyehouses will likely avoid

14
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,440
giving us any business.

15
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,550
In this situation,

16
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,630
we have no choice but to save ourselves.

17
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,510
Thus, I propose that we,

18
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,120
as Silk Society,

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,040
participate in Splendor Showcase.

20
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,110
If we can make a name for ourselves in the competition,

21
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,470
we will be able to trade directly with the brocade merchants.

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,160
Orders will no longer be a concern.

23
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,470
What do all of you think?

24
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,880
Truthfully, this collaboration

25
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,080
has benefited us greatly.

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,470
However, we have also come dangerously close to ruin.

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,550
I fear our family can no longer endure.

28
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,880
Moreover,

29
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Mrs. Hua

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,080
has promised us.

31
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,240
If we withdraw from Silk Society,

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,270
she promises to let bygones be bygones.

33
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
I apologize.

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,880
We are left with no choice.

35
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,830
We cannot afford to risk it,

36
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,470
nor do we dare to.

37
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,320
Have you forgotten

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,110
how they bullied us in the past?

39
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,470
Now that we have a chance,

40
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,880
you want to turn back?

41
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,670
Indeed, we face a precarious situation.

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,550
Everyone,

43
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,750
we have our own path to follow.

44
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,910
I will not force anyone.

45
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,670
However, if someday, you change your minds

46
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,880
and wish to return,

47
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,080
know that I, Ji Yingying, will welcome you with open arms.

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,880
I apologize.

49
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,910
My mother says this matter is indeed dangerous.

50
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,720
However, without trust, one has no foundation.

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,080
I may not be eloquent

52
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,240
or clever,

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,830
but I do pride myself on my loyalty.

54
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,270
Since I gave you my word,

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,550
I will not go back on it.

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,550
I have poor health,

57
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,080
so I will toast with tea instead of wine.

58
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,910
Here's to you.

59
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,670
That is the first time I have heard you speak with such conviction.

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,880
Ji Yingying, I have placed my faith in you.

61
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,030
I believe

62
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,750
you can lead us to something great.

63
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,670
Something truly great.

64
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,080
Here's to you!

65
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,670
Yingying,

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,880
I cannot make decisions for my family,

67
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,080
but can I join you

68
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
in my own name?

69
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,270
Even if I am not much help,

70
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,600
I will do my best

71
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,760
whenever I am needed!

72
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,440
Good! Then, let's earn money together

73
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,510
and weather this storm as one.

74
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,920
Agreed!

75
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,350
Drink up!

76
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,160
Cheers!

77
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,670
A toast to everyone here!

78
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,070
Drink up!

79
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,510
- Cheers! - Cheers!

80
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,350
I have perused

81
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,880
all the information the guards have recorded.

82
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,950
It seems Mr. Shen

83
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,670
has a peculiar interest in Mount Qingcheng.

84
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:47,270
He usually frequents the mountain alone.

85
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,760
Mount Qingcheng?

86
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,040
Have the shadow guards been stationed there yet?

87
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,320
Yes, they have.

88
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,270
Each one is a top-tier martial arts expert.

89
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,230
Send them

90
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,950
to scout the mountain thoroughly.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,920
If they detect anything unusual, they are to report back to me immediately.

92
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,390
Yes.

93
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,070
Mr. Yang,

94
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,480
a messenger from the Yang residence came with word for you.

95
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,550
They said that when you are not occupied in the next few days,

96
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,670
you should return home for a visit.

97
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,350
Who brought the message?

98
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,270
Was it Yang Jingshan or Yang Jinglin?

99
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Judging by their attire,

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,640
it seemed to be a servant.

101
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,160
A servant?

102
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,950
Yes, sir.

103
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,670
Lei Zu Festival will be held in a few days.

104
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,440
Brocade Master and the brocade officer must offer prayers together.

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,880
You will not be able to avoid it.

106
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
If you ask me,

107
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,440
you might as well return now and smooth things over.

108
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,830
By the way, Yingying,

109
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,760
you mentioned participating in Splendor Showcase.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But to do so,

111
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,830
we will need a recommendation from a top figure in the trade.

112
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,830
Moreover, there is a hefty entry fee.

113
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,480
We cannot manage to have

114
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,110
either of these.

115
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,230
I will figure out

116
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,040
the money.

117
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:20,880
Yaoting...

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,230
Did we not agree?

119
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,000
You will handle the living matters,

120
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,830
and I will handle the dead.

121
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,510
This money issue surely does not count as living, does it?

122
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,640
All right.

123
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,390
Then, I will find someone to advocate for us.

124
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,440
What should we do in the meantime?

125
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,640
I will need all of you

126
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,480
to dye the best silk you can produce.

127
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,830
That will be our confidence to compete in Splendor Showcase.

128
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,790
All right! Not a problem!

129
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,550
Not a problem!

130
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,070
Today,

131
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,160
we will not stop until we are drunk!

132
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,000
Agreed! Let's keep drinking!

133
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Master,

134
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,230
the silk is fully prepared.

135
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,920
I have personally handpicked

136
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,640
the men chosen to deliver it.

137
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,670
Now, we are only waiting for Lei Zu Festival to begin.

138
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,720
I guarantee nothing will go wrong.

139
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,480
But...

140
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,270
But what?

141
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,390
But

142
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,830
recently,

143
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,640
that young lady from the Ji family has become particularly arrogant.

144
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,880
Not only has she sought the support of Mr. Sang,

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,440
but she is also close to the newly appointed brocade officer.

146
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,270
Before she had all these connections,

147
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,720
did you manage to control her?

148
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,880
I do not need excuses.

149
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,040
What I want is

150
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,200
Shu Red Silk.

151
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,230
But Ji Yingying is cunning

152
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,070
and unpredictable.

153
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,110
She is difficult to pin down.

154
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,390
What if

155
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,270
she truly manages to pay off all her debts

156
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,950
within the month?

157
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,390
It will become much harder

158
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,670
to find a leverage

159
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,640
against her.

160
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,600
Thus, I humbly ask for your guidance, master.

161
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,480
Unpredictable as she may be,

162
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
there is always something constant around her.

163
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,670
Counter her ever-changing moves with steadfastness.

164
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,550
Constant?

165
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,600
I understand now.

166
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,440
I appreciate your help, master.

167
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,950
You have two hands.

168
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Keep one on Shu Red Silk

169
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,040
and the other on Lei Zu Festival.

170
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,880
Fail at either,

171
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,000
and I will chop off that particular hand.

172
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,440
I understand.

173
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,520
Mr. Ji,

174
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,670
your willingness to weave brocade in our humble workshop

175
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,200
is truly an honor for us.

176
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,840
You flatter me, sir.

177
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
I should be thanking you for your generosity.

178
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,230
The son of Brocade Master

179
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,760
is certainly worth the price.

180
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,440
Here's your loom.

181
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,440
I will not disturb you further.

182
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,760
I will await your masterpiece.

183
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,640
I will do my utmost.

184
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,960
Hasn't Mr. Ji

185
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,550
always dismissed our little workshop as producing

186
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,760
rough and inferior brocade?

187
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,200
Why did he lower himself to work here now?

188
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,760
It is because his sister offended someone.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Their silk dyeing business has collapsed,

376
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:00,280
Ms. Ji, since you seek a recommendation for the competition,

377
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,070
I am willing to give you a chance as well.

378
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,310
What should I do?

379
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,190
The Zhao family has a stockpile of aged silk.

380
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,880
The quality is decent,

381
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,640
but the colors are outdated.

382
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,070
If you can manage to sell this silk

383
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,040
within half a month, Ms. Ji,

384
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,470
I will grant your request

385
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,280
and recommend you to the brocade guild.

386
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
Mr. Zhao Senior, rest assured.

387
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,680
I will see to it.

388
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,470
You have stepped into the spotlight now.

389
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,710
You will have no chance to hide your talent anymore.

390
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,040
You once said that the more Mr. Zhao Senior values someone,

391
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,160
the less freedom they have.

392
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,520
Everything must follow the Zhao family's rules.

393
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,160
But giving in once

394
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,160
leads to endless yielding.

395
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,710
Instead of being compliant,

396
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,350
it is better to seize control.

397
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,710
Isn't that what Sang Shisi said?

398
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,160
Xiuyuan,

399
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
I will take my leave.

400
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,760
All right.

401
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,070
Stay safe.

402
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,520
[Yuebuhuan]

403
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,110
I do not believe

404
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,800
that Mr. Zhao Senior genuinely wants to help you.

405
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,470
He is simply using you

406
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,710
to lure his beloved grandson back

407
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,310
into weaving brocade.

408
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,760
Selling silk?

409
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,310
He is clearly making things difficult on purpose.

410
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,680
If you fail to sell it, he will blame your incompetence.

411
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,470
He will not be responsible.

412
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,110
Of course, he has his own motives.

413
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,000
But he has given his word.

414
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,310
If I succeed,

415
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,800
he will not be able to go back on it.

416
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,560
Now, what I need is a good business idea.

417
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,640
Yang Jinglan?

418
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,110
Today

419
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,110
is the 19th.

420
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,070
It is his mother's death anniversary.

421
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,280
A death anniversary?

422
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,760
And he dresses so flamboyantly?

423
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,520
[Yuebuhuan]

424
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,560
That is just who he is.

425
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,310
The more sorrowful he feels,

426
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,230
the more outrageous his behavior becomes.

427
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,230
How do you know that?

428
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:17,640
That's right.

429
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,830
You used to be his sister-in-law.

430
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,950
What trouble have you gotten into this time?

431
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,310
A fight.

432
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,590
Who won?

433
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,830
Do I ever lose?

434
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,760
Why are you here?

435
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,760
I argued with the elders.

436
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,800
Who won?

437
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,950
What do you think?

438
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,070
What are you doing?

439
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,070
These are offerings.

440
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,710
Who cares?

441
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,680
What is the point of offerings to the dead?

442
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,680
Besides, my mother is not enshrined here.

443
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,950
I am just like him.

444
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,880
We hate the Yang family's rules,

445
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,280
and we tarnish their reputation.

446
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,520
Juxian.

447
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,440
Greetings, Juxian, my sister-in-law.

448
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,620
[Yang Juxian, Yang Jinglan's father, and the Yang family's matriarch]

[Yang Jinglin, the second son of the Yang family; Yang Jingshan]

450
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,880
[the eldest son of the Yang family]
All of you suddenly gathered here.

451
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
What is the occasion?

452
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,680
Had we not been summoned here?

453
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,950
Who called you?

454
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,230
No one?

455
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,950
Perhaps there has been a misunderstanding.

456
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,230
This troublemaker!

457
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,160
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

458
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,680
I have brought a gift to Mr. Yang Juxian.

459
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,310
I ask everyone here to bear witness.

460
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,500
[A kind father, and a filial son]

461
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,920
If Mr. Yang Juxian wishes to reprimand me again,

462
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,950
let him first reflect

463
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
on these words.

464
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,680
Do you want to hit me?

465
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,310
We are no longer in the past.

466
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,280
If you dare strike me now,

467
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,280
it will be counted as an assault on an imperial officer.

468
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,230
Jinglan!

469
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,230
Today, you have blatantly disregarded proper decorum,

470
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,310
mocked your elders,

471
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,350
and ridiculed your father!

472
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,350
Do you have no sense of duty as a son or nephew?

473
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,280
Uncle, you are the one who knows the rules best.

474
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,110
Thus, tell us.

475
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,950
What is greater, public duty

476
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,710
or private matters?

477
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,640
Which holds more weight, the emperor's mandate or the family rules?

478
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,070
Naturally, the emperor's mandate is greater.

479
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,350
Then, the Yang family's rule...?

480
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,350
Greetings, Mr. Yang.

481
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,520
Why does he resent the Yang family so much?

482
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,880
Do you want to know?

483
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,800
Since I'll inevitably cross paths with him,

484
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,310
I ought to have a good understanding of him.

485
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,190
Tell me.

486
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,520
Why don't you first tell me

487
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,110
about your opinion of my new wine?

488
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,590
I drank it all too quickly,

489
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,110
so I did not get to savor it properly.

490
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,710
Let me taste it again.

491
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,280
It is fragrant!

His mother

493
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,470
was his father's greatest love.

494
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,520
However, she came from humble origins.

495
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,350
Back then, the Yang family business was struggling,

496
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,920
and the elders forced his father

497
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,070
to marry a woman from a wealthy family

498
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,950
as his wife.

499
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,710
[The memorial tablet of Mrs. Yang]
His mother waited five long years

500
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,830
before she was finally married into the Yang family,

501
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,000
but only as a concubine.

502
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:43,880
Go away!

Rushed back overnight?

508
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,310
You received word of her critical state ten days ago,

509
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,920
yet you only arrived now.

510
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,950
It's because you were occupied with business

511
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,000
and obsessed with negotiating!

512
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,160
My mother's life

513
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,710
never mattered to you.

514
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,590
How dare you!

515
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,110
The Yang family business is of utmost importance.

516
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,000
It naturally outweighs personal matters.

517
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,830
As a member of the Yang family,

518
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,520
you ought to understand this.

519
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,710
The interests of our kin matters,

520
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,070
but what about my mom's life?

521
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,760

523
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,920

then let's talk about the present.

550
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,520
Being a brocade officer is no ordinary position.

551
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,070
You must...

00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,070
Rest assured.

553
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,760
I will not drag the Yang family into anything,

and I hope

555

the family will not drag me down, either.

556

Is this

557

the real reason for your dramatic return?

558
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,710

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,310
However,

562
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,880
I just do not want to have anything more to do with you.

563
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,110
Ah, so that is why!

564
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,920
No wonder he loathes negotiating with me.

565
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,560
It is not you he dislikes.

566
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,160
It is the Yang family he despises.

567
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,760
But who does not?

568
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,110
Why should I abide by the Yang family's rules?

569
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,520
Is weaving brocade that impressive?

570
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,350
I can even brew wine!

571
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,710
People may live without wearing brocade,

572
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,880
but no one can live without wine.

573
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,040
You asked me to taste the wine, but you ended up getting drunk.

574
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,190
I should not have talked to you about the Yang family.

575
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,560
Where are you going? Do not leave!

576
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,160
I am going to make you some hangover remedy.

577
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,400
I do not need it...!

578
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,760
I am fine!

579
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,800
Wait...

580
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,310
Slow down...

581
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,070
I am fine!

582
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:16,470
Slow down!

583
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,310
You need to stop drinking.

584
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,160
Yingying!

585
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,950
Yaoting!

586
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,430
Mr. Ji, you are here.

587
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,160
Ms. Yu.

588
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,520
Yaoting, why are you here?

589
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,760
I have come to take you home.

590
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,000
Perfect timing!

591
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,190
Come. Let us sit and have a drink.

592
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,110
Yaoting,

593
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,470
go and make a hangover remedy for Yu.

594
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,710
I need to coax her to sleep before I can leave.

595
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,310
All right.

596
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,950
Yingying,

597
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:40,000
what do you think I should call my new wine?

598
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,680
What about

599
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,950
Amber Glow?

600
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,590
How about it?

601
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,800
The World's Best Wine!

602
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,710
The World's Best Wine?

603
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
I would not dare boast that much.

604
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:55,880
Mr. Yang,

605
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,190
the tavern is close.

606
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,920
Come back another day.

607
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,070
The door is open,

608
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,280
and there are people here.

609
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,160
What is this?

610
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,000
You are allowed to drink here,

611
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,470
but I am not?

612
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,070
We are taking care of someone who has had too much.

613
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,800
Who is drunk?

614
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,310
I am not drunk!

615
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,430
Not at all!

616
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,040
Sit...

617
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,880
Everyone, sit.

618
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,640
I will get more wine for us.

619
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,430
Ms. Yu?

620
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,520
Ms. Yu!

621
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,160
Mr. Ji,

622
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,070
you have had too much.

623
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,590
I...

624
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,110
Your brother is drunk without a sip of wine.

625
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,000
Wait for me.

626
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,830
I will fetch the wine. Wait for me!

627
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,710
I am

628
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,880
in a foul mood tonight.

629
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,310
Let us do this.

630
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,880
Pretend we do not know each other,

631
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
forget the past,

632
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,760
and treat this as a chance meeting.

633
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,760
Will you sit and share a drink with me?

634
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,430
Very well.

635
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,110
Mr. Yang,

636
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,040
my sister was impulsive.

637
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,590
How could we dare drink alongside you?

638
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,000
We kindly ask for your forgiveness.

639
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,400
I apologize.

640
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,520
I spent too much time outside,

641
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,710
so I am unaccustomed to the city's rules.

642
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,590
Let us do this.

643
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,310
I will take some wine and leave.

644
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,280
Leave?

645
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,350
Where do you think you are going?

646
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,280
She is an unmarried young lady,

647
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,470
so it is improper for her to share a drink with you at this hour.

648
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,680
But I can do it.

649
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,190
Who is not a wanderer at heart?

650
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,350
Will you drink?

651
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,310
Have a seat!

652
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,310
We'll drink the wanderer's brew!

653
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,190
Cheers!

654
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,190
Do you remember

655
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,920
the time we were punished and made to kneel in the ancestral hall?

656
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,760
I would rather not.

657
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,110
It is best to forget.

658
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,560
Not even good wine can keep your mouth shut.

659
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,880
Yaoting,

660
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,070
I envy them.

661
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,110
Yingying...

662
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,070
I know I am a woman.

663
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
Living in Yizhou means

664
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,760
I must follow reason

665
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,710
and obey the rules.

666
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,000
It is not about what I want to do.

667
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:57,470
Slow down.

668
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,150
But drinking like this will not solve anything, either.

669
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,230
Can you still drink or not?

670
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,800
I am so happy.

671
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,870
Here!

672
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,560
Two pots of wine and two pots of soup.

673
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,000
You may not sniff them, nor touch them.

674
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,150
Pick one at random.

675
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,190
It is all up to luck.

676
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,190
Do you dare to...

677
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:25,230
wager?

678
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,000
Too much ginger.

679
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,150
Not enough salt.

680
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,280
I will fix it next time.

681
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,870
What are you doing?

682
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,520
Who said we would stop at just one pot?

683
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,040
The greed of man knows no bound.

684
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,000
Why is this still the same hangover remedy?

685
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,120
The wisdom of the tavern owner knows no bounds.

686
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,150
How else could we ensure

687
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,520
you drink the remedy?

688
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,600
Receptive.

689
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,000
And crafty.

690
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,360
A sly merchant, indeed!

691
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,080
Crafty and re...?

692
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,320
Receptive.

693
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,280
Yaoting,

694
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,710
I have thought of a way to sell the surplus silk!

695
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,390
I cannot do this anymore.

696
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,320
The Zhao family's silk

697
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,320
is beyond useless!

698
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,800
And there is so much of it!

699
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,560
Look at me.

700
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,430
Are my eyelids glued shut?

701
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,230
Take a look.

702
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,800
All right.

703
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,800
Snap out of it, will you?

704
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,320
There was not much to begin with.

705
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,280
Once we finish this, there will be...!

706
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,000
There will only be a little left!

707
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,430
I do not need you to fan me.

708
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,390
Stop blocking the light, will you?

709
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,630
All right. I will move to the side.

710
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,190
Sang Shisi!

711
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,630
Do not touch my silk!

712
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,080
Stay away from her!

713
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,150
I...

714
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,800
I will pick it up!

715
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,230
Yingying, I finished the embroidery.

716
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,670
As expected of you, Pin.

717
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,000
You're quick and flawless.

718
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,600
As expected, Mr. Ji,

719
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,840
your weaving is perfectly balanced,

720
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,040
smooth, and refined.

721
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,710
What a fine brocade!

722
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,390
This month, I will add ten qian to your pay.

723
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,870
I appreciate it, Mr. Wang.

724
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,470
Hold on.

725
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:38,120
What is this?

726
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,230
How am I supposed to sell this?

727
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,870
You are sitting near Mr. Ji,

728
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,040
and yet you cannot seem to learn anything from him!

729
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,390
Mr. Wang,

730
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:46,230
I...

731
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,870
Listen carefully,

732
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,040
all of you.

733
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,600
The previous order was delayed.

734
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,870
Thus, each of you will have two qian docked from your pay this month.

735
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,840
In this workshop, rewards and penalties are clear.

736
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,040
The skilled earn more.

737
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,190
If you improve

738
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,910
your weaving,

739
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:02,150
you will earn what you deserve.

740
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,430
Mr. Ji, you indeed weave beautifully.

741
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,710
We should learn from him.

742
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,190
Indeed.

743
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
Once I finish my batch, I will teach you.

744
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,000
Showing off, are you?

745
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,710
Before you came,

746
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,840
Mr. Wang never complained about our work.

747
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,800
You just have to stand out,

748
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,430
don't you?

749
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,320
Father,

750
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,120
do I lack talent for weaving brocade?

751
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,000
Talent?

752
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,230
I do not have much of that, either.

753
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,630
But what I rely on are these simple words.

754
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,040
Diligence makes up for lack of talent.

755
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,670
As long as you put your heart into something you love,

756
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,040
you will not only succeed,

757
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,230
but you will also excel.

758
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,950
[Ji]

759
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,670
Seven times pulling, eight times tugging.

760
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,470
What is this?

761
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,910
What are you doing?

762
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,710
If you are here to stir up trouble again,

763
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
do not bother coming to work at the Wang family's shop!

764
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:32,630
Go!

765
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,630
Get back to work now!

766
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,390
You are unbelievable!

767
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,190
Mr. Ji, come here.

768
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:43,870
Mr. Ji,

769
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,190
are you all right?

770
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,080
I am all right.

771
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,870
Mr. Wang,

772
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,520
may I purchase this loom?

773
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,040
It is the one my father used many years ago,

774
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,190
and I would like to have it as a keepsake.

775
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,910
This loom may be broken,

776
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,870
but it is not cheap.

777
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,430
I will gather the money.

778
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,560
Please, grant me this request, Mr. Wang.

779
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,280
Lei Zu Festival,

780
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:21,600
don floral garments, cross the long embankment,

781
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,910
and bow deeply.

782
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,950
- Slow down! Watch your step! - Seek excellence.

783
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,520
Where is Mr. Yang?

784
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,710
The appointed hour is almost upon us.

785
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,230
Missing the appointed time is a grave offense.

786
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,430
If he is late, it is either deliberate

787
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,040
or he has prepared an excuse.

788
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,000
You seem to know him well.

789
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,670
Know your enemy,

790
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,800
and you will never lose a battle.

791
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,950
Where is Mr. Sang?

792
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,800
I sent him to hire porters for the ceremony work.

793
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,040
Everyone has their role,

794
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,280
and he needs to do something.

795
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,670
Mr. Zhao is here!

796
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,080
He is looking at you.

797
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,520
Mrs. Yang, what a blessing you have.

798
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,800
Your eldest son remains Brocade Master,

799
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,840
and your third son has become the brocade officer.

800
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,320
To have a pair of outstanding talents in one family

801
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,670
is truly an object of envy.

802
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,230
The two sons of the Zhao family

803
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,080
are equally remarkable.

804
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,430
Mr. Zhao Senior, you must feel blessed as well.

805
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,080
We, the ordinary folk, cannot compare.

806
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,840
Your eldest son will compete in the Brocade Weaving Competition,

807
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,230
while your third son will judge.

808
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,910
The Yang family stands unrivaled

809
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:05,190
in Yizhou's brocade industry.

810
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,630
My eldest son's Brocade Master title

811
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,230
comes from the recognition of Shu's artisans.

812
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:14,120
My third son's appointment as brocade officer

813
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,150
is an honor from the imperial court.

814
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,040
The Yang family owes its success today

815
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,040
to your support and the fairness of the court.

816
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,230
Therefore,

817
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,230
be it my eldest or my third,

818
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,320
they will always win hearts with reason

819
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,190
and act with fairness and integrity.

820
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,230
What do you think?

821
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,280
Naturally, the matter of right and wrong

822
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,630
is plain for all to see.

823
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,000
If you two

824
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,280
have the time to argue,

825
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,470
perhaps you should send someone to look for him.

826
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,230
The appointed hour is approaching quickly.

827
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,040
If we anger Lei Zu,

828
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:52,390
no one will beget good fortune.

829
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,520
The brocade officer has arrived!

830
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,670
The first incense offering is an important occasion.

831
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,670
Why are you late?

832
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,840
Missing the appointed hour

833
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,230
is a grave disrespect to Lei Zu!

834
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,430
Is this how

835
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,430
the Yang family addresses an officer of my stature?

836
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,320
Is it me who disrespects Lei Zu,

837
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,280
or is it you who disrespects me?

838
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,080
The auspicious hour has arrived!

839
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,000
All must remain solemn and reverent.

840
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
People,

841
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,630
bring the basin and cloth.

842
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,040
Brocade officer, Brocade Master, wash your hands and calm your mind.

843
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,630
This one!

844
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,870
Miss, someone asked me to deliver this to you.

845
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,120
Thank you.

846
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,000
If you do not want your brother jailed,

847
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,520
return home immediately.
