[Episode 20]

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,400
So, what do you want?

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,800
This time,

5
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,720
I have proven

6
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,590
my loyalty and competence to you, General.

7
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,870
I have no other requests.

8
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,680
I only wish to continue serving you,

9
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,870
protecting both of our families

10
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,870
and fulfilling my duties as a husband and son-in-law.

11
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,800
So, are you asking to take her place and manage the family?

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,120
I hope you can allow it.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,520
You did all this for Ms. Ji, did you not?

14
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,110
Do you not know the enmity between her and me?

15
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,750
I can ensure she is confined to one place

16
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,240
and never opposes you again, General.

17
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,720
A weapon with leverage

18
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,000
is far easier for you to wield.

19
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,110
In truth, I care little about your motives.

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,600
As long as your loyalty to me is unwavering,

21
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,360
I will grant you whatever you ask.

22
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,670
Thank you for your generosity, General.

23
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,960
You may leave.

24
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,630
Yes, sir.

25
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,360
My dear,

26
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,160
we should go home now.

27
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,910
Father,

28
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,320
I admit my wrongs!

29
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,720
Please forgive me!

30
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,320
Father,

31
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,720
I admit my wrongs!

32
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,630
I beg to see you!

My dear husband,

52
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,720
the stain of false accusations on your name

53

for so many years

has finally

been wiped clean.

56
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,760
Father,

57
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,640
Yingying has restored your honor before all the world.

58
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,790
Your name is vindicated.

59
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,510
You can rest in peace now.

[Beloved Husband, Ji Guinan's Memorial Tablet]

Meanwhile, our new brocade will be finished soon.

65

66
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
not to investigate,

67
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,160
but she defied me.

68
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,510
She has endured so much

69
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,350
for your case.

70
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,510
It was fine.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,790
Well,

72
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,510
it is all behind us now.

Yingying,

74
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,200
I hope you will agree on something.

75
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,320
No more running around

76
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,110
and no more putting yourself in danger.

77
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,110
All right?

78
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,920
Very well. I promise, Mother. No more running around.

79
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,480
I will always stay by your side and Yaoting's.

80
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,480
I mean no more putting yourself in danger

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,510
and no more troublemaking.

82
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,670
Okay!

83
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,510
Come on, get up.

84
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
From this day onward,

85
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,320
we will live peacefully as a family.

86
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,110
I believe your father is watching over us

87
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,920
and will protect us.

88
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,510
All right.

89
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,350

How happy you are!

93
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,480
Mother, Yaoting,

94
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,510
can you two go outside first?

95
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,550
I would like to speak to Father for a moment.

96
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,600
Are you writing more letters to Father?

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,110
You are not tattling on me again, are you?

98
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,110
Last time, you even told him

99
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,160
about the last piece of meat I gave to Guo Kui!

100
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,320
Are you not worried he would laugh at you?

101
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,480
You are a grown-up now,

102
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,350
but you're still behaving like a child.

103
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,920
I will always be Father's little girl.

104
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,160
All right...

105
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,920
Let's not disturb your sister.

106
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,110
We should go out.

107
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,230
Ting,

108
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,830
I just remembered a few more things

109
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,110
I need to tell Yingying.

110
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,000
Take the dishes out to the table, will you?

111
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,230
Okay.

112
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,550
Father,

113
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,600
I know

114
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,510
this is not the whole truth.

115
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,640
I also know

116
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,350
the path ahead

117
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,000
is fraught with danger.

118
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,200
But I have already achieved much.

119
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,480
I founded Bloom Society

120
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,390
and I have a group of friends from the dyehouses

121
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,510
who trust me and support me.

122
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,390
Besides, Mr. Yu

123
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,320
has agreed to weave brocade with me.

124
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,480
Also,

125
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,510
I have an ally in investigating the case.

126
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,510
His name is Yang Jinglan.

127
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,070
He may seem like a frivolous man,

128
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,350
but in truth,

129
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,110
he is sharp but kindhearted.

130
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
He is clever and resourceful.

131
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,910
He also has taken care of me

132
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,670
and our family.

133
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,110
Together,

134
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,150
he and I will continue to uncover the truth

135
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,550
and restore peace to the brocade industry.

[Huanhua Dyehouse]

My late husband's name has been cleared

138
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,880
thanks entirely to your tireless efforts, Mr. Yang.

139
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,960
My gratitude is beyond words.

140
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,550
Mrs. Ji, there is no need for this.

141
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,880
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

142
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,440
Apprehending the culprit behind the forgery of the tribute brocade

143
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,960
is merely my duty as the brocade officer.

144
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,110
Besides, this was not my doing alone.

145
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,320
Ms. Ji played no small role.

146
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,000
Mr. Yang, you take such good care of Yingying.

147
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,910
This is truly an honor for our family.

148
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,670
Ms. Ji is a leading figure in Yizhou's brocade industry.

149
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,590
She is also my friend.

150
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,910
I am naturally obliged to lend a hand,

151
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,110
both publicly and privately.

152
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,790
Mr. Yang,

153
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,200
since you are Yingying's friend,

154
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,200
I would like to ask

155
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,710
for a small favor.

156
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
There is no need to hesitate.

157
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,080
I shall do anything within my power.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,670
Please forgive my candor, Mr. Yang.

159
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,320
You see,

160
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,150
children in other families, at Yingying's age,

161
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,550
have already settled down and started families of their own.

162
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,910
But as her mother, I have been negligent.

163
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,550
Both of my children have been delayed.

164
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,110
Ting is a man, so it is less pressing for him.

165
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,710
But Yingying...

166
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,910
She really cannot be delayed any longer.

167
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,080
So today,

168
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,320
I wish to rely on your keen insight

169
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,470
to take a look at these portraits.

170
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,960
Tell me, which one among them is the most suitable match for my daughter?

171
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,550
Does Ms. Ji

172
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,670
know about this matter?

173
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,880
Marriage has always been

174
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,760
decided by parents

175
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,880
and the matchmakers.

176
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,520
Indeed.

177
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,910
Yes, indeed.

178
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,320
Mrs. Ji,

179
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,790
I do have someone in mind for Yingying.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,110
This man is neither wealthy nor powerful,

181
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,110
but he has modest means.

182
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,470
He is not bound by convention,

183
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,670
but he is a man of his word.

184
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,880
I believe this man

185
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,200
would cherish Ms. Ji and protect her for a lifetime.

186
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,200
But can this man

187
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,550
take Yingying away from all this chaos

188
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
and give her a peaceful and stable life?

189
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,760
Although my husband's name has been cleared,

190
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,910
I heard from Yingying

191
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,880
that this case runs deep.

192
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,350
There is still a hidden culprit behind it all.

193
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,520
If Yingying stays in Yizhou,

194
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,110
she will constantly face the danger of revenge.

195
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,470
That is why the suitors I have chosen

196
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,320
are all from distant counties.

197
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,840
As a mother,

198
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,960
I do not wish for my children to achieve wealth or power.

199
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,960
I only hope they can live far from trouble,

200
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,470
leading peaceful and stable lives.

201
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,520
May I ask when you plan for her

202
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,880
to live far from trouble?

203
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,670
Now.

204
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,470
If the person you recommend

205
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,110
can take Yingying away today,

206
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,960
and if they are willing to leave together,

207
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,200
I will grant them my blessing immediately.

208
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,670
To them,

209
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,230
there are things

210
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,080
more important than life and death now.

211
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,200
But for me,

212
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,200
only my daughter's life and death matter.

213
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,520
Mr. Yang,

214
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,030
please do not think I am ungrateful.

215
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,520
No matter how excellent

216
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,320
this man may be,

217
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,030
if he cannot take Yingying far away from danger,

218
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,640
I, as her mother,

219
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,110
cannot agree.

220
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,230
She is my only daughter,

221
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,710
and I hope

222
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,710
you can understand my fears and concerns.

223
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,840
Mrs. Ji,

224
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,280
I understand your concerns now.

225
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,230
From now on,

226
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,470
I will bear all the troubles to come.

227
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,670
I will ensure Yingying is not involved in them.

228
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,710
As for the man

229
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,520
I recommend,

230
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,440
I will bring him to meet you

231
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,030
when the day comes that he can guarantee her safety

232
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,790
and promise her a life of peace.

233
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,670
Well,

234
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,790
I will take my leave.

235
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,230
Take care, Mr. Yang.

236
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,710
It is finished...!

237
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,840
Rippling Grain Brocade is finished!

238
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,230
Here...!

239
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,280
Fresh oranges have arrived!

240
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:18,840
Here come the oranges!

241
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,230
We have brocade and oranges.

242
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,080
Brocade and oranges...

243
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,440
We have a bright future ahead of us!

244
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,320
That is right!

245
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,320
Here!

246
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,520
Let's dance!

247
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,710
Good!

248
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,280
Mr. Bai,

249
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,280
my mission is accomplished.

250
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,400
I witnessed it all, from nothing to everything.

251
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,230
My dream has been fulfilled. This journey was not in vain.

252
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,320
Are you not going inside?

253
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,640
She deserves her own bright future.

254
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,230
Right now,

255
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I have no right to disturb it.

256
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:26,760
Are you giving up?

257
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,590
Let's go.

only the weak make wishes and pray to the gods.

280
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,280
The strong rely solely on themselves.

281
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,040
Sheng,

282
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,880
have you forgotten why we came to Yizhou?

283
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,070
Are you truly giving up because of Ji Yingying?

284
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,640
Are you

285
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,430
questioning me?

286
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,280
I am just worried.

287
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:26,560
Sheng, you think you are the bait,

288
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,280
but in the end,

289
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,470
you might be the one that is hooked

290
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,310
and struggling in the sea of love.

291
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,760
How insolent!

292
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,800
Do you remember what you said

293
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,640
before joining the Bai family?

294
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,680
Tell me.

295
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,470
Once I joined the Bai household,

296
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,920
I would leave my past behind,

297
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,470
become nothing more than a subordinate,

298
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,350
and follow your orders without question.

299
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
You must set out in three days.

300
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,230
Take everything we have procured and go back.

301
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,160
Prepare the grounds as instructed.

302
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,470
Do not come back without my command.

303
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,950
As for

304
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,680
the tribute brocade case,

305
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,590
Yang Jinglan will not stop

306
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,880
after he has uncovered the logistics officer.

307
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,950
The family must remain vigilant.

308
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,640
Do you understand,

309
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,040
Ms. Ning?

310
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,470
Yes,

311
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,470
I understand.

312
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,470
Is everything prepared?

313
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,920
Are you truly going to Nanzhao?

314
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,880
Though the past few years have been peaceful,

315
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,110
there is no telling

316
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:49,110
when conflict might break out again.

317
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:50,920
Moreover,

318
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,400
if they really are colluding

319
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,430
with Niu Jin,

320
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,680
it is a place too far from our reach.

321
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,760
You are walking straight into a trap.

322
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,520
I think

323
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,520
this might just be a coincidence.

324
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,800
Should we further...

325
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,880
Since when did you become so talkative?

326
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,110
What are you looking for?

327
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,560
Found it.

328
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,640
Here, take this.

329
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,880
What is it?

330
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,470
My senior once told me that

331
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,830
you are someone

332
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,350
who loves reading more than anything.

333
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,710
Your lifelong ambition is to become the top scholar.

334
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,680
But since you came with me to Yizhou,

335
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,350
I have not seen you touch a single book.

336
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,070
That will not do.

337
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,950
You had better read more.

338
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,880
If I do not make it back

339
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,430
from this trip,

340
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,110
you will head straight back to Chang'an

341
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,310
and take the imperial exams!

342
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I am not studying

343
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,070
because I promised Master I would stay here

344
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,110
to help you with the case.

345
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,350
If it is not solved,

346
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,070
I will not study.

347
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,070
Besides, I am an idiot.

348
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,230
I am not good at multitasking.

349
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,560
So you had better make sure

350
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,160
you come back safe and sound.

351
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,470
Let me ask you this one last time.

352
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,800
Must you go?

353
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,430
Where are you going?

354
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,520
Ms. Ji.

355
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,640
A place.

356
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,560
Why are you here?

357
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,880
Our new brocade is finished.

358
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,950
I am here to share the good fortune,

359
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,760
After all the twists and turns,

360
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,470
things finally turned out as hoped.

361
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Thank you, Ms. Ji.

362
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,590
I have something I must attend to.

363
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,190
Please excuse me.

364
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,560
My father's exoneration is all thanks to you.

365
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,680
My mother asked me to bring this gift.

366
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,070
No need for such formalities.

367
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,280
The items in that box were prepared by my mother and Yaoting.

368
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,590
This sword tassel

369
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,230
is a gift from me.

370
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,280
I asked for blessings at the temple.

371
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,760
I prayed for your safety and success.

372
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,470
This is made from Ripple Brocade, is it not?

373
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,640
You recognized it.

374
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,070
Such a precious item.

375
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,470
Is this not considered bribery?

376
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,710
I am not sure I dare accept.

377
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,680
Then give me money and consider it bought.

378
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,070
This kind of thing is priceless.

379
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,430
No matter what I offer,

380
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,430
it would not be enough.

381
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,470
Then think of it as a down payment

382
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,590
for securing my safety.

383
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,430
But can this man

384
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,710
take Yingying away from all this chaos

385
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
and give her a peaceful and stable life?

386
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Ms. Ji, you and I are allies.

387
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,070
It is our mutual responsibility to benefit each other.

388
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,280
But you gave me such a valuable gift.

389
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,680
I truly do not know how I can repay this favor.

390
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Repay the favor?

391
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,070
Am I just an ally

392
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,160
to you?

393
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,070
For now, that is all we can be.

394
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,520
What happened?

395
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,560
Nothing happened.

396
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,470
I have just realized

397
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,470
I have acted recklessly in the past.

398
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,070
I might have inadvertently offended you, Ms. Ji.

399
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,680
Wait!

400
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,190
I will be busy for a while.

401
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,280
Take care of yourself.

402
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,430
If anything happens,

403
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,470
send word to Brocade Bureau.

404
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,350
Do not try to handle it all on your own.

405
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,830
One more thing.

406
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
Although Niu Jin has used the excuse of assisting in the war

407
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,710
to leave Yizhou temporarily,

408
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,430
he has surely left plenty of his men

409
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,920
behind in the city.

410
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,280
It is easier to dodge a visible bow

411
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,310
than to guard against a hidden strike.

412
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,520
Be cautious.

413
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,880
Do not take unnecessary risks in the future.

414
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,400
Never ever bet everything on a single move again.

415
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,710
Yang Jinglan,

416
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,560
are you out of your mind?

417
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,470
If we are mere allies,

418
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,040
why bother crossing the line?

419
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,470
Do you want to ask me the reason

420
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,560
why I still act like I do not like her

421
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,070
when I do?

422
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,230
I know you are going to say

423
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,160
there are

424
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,280
more important things in this world than love.

425
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,430
For example, peace and safety.

426
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,920
Your path is fraught with peril.

427
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,470
You have no right to make promises to her.

428
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,760
Then why did you promise

429
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,280
to protect her?

430
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,310
The promises you make to an ally

431
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,470
are not the same as the promises you make

432
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,070
to the one you love.

433
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,280
What is the difference?

434
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,920
If she is an ally,

435
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,520
I will fight to the death to protect her.

436
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,880
But if she is the one I love,

437
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,760
I must live well.

438
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,280
I must live and stay by her side

439
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,160
and share this mundane, imperfect world

440
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,520
with her.

441
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,470
Have you made preparations for me to leave?

442
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,950
The matter of the logistics officer

443
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,800
is serious.

444
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,280
It makes sense for a brocade officer to report back to Chang'an.

445
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
I will impersonate you and head to Chang'an.

446
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,470
Just focus on heading to Nanzhao.

447
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
I have prepared

448
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,560
the maps and rations.

449
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,470
When do you want to leave?

450
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,310
Ally?

451
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,830
What a fool you are!

452
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,470
You like him.

453
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,430
Who likes him?

454
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,230
Then why are you running away from home?

455
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,470
I do not want to go on blind dates!

456
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:42,350
It is because of him.

457
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,040
Whether you two end up together is not just up to him.

458
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:45,920
It is up to you.

459
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,950
If you like him, stay close to him.

460
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,710
If you do not like him, just walk away.

461
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,160
What he thinks does not matter.

462
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,230
I gave him a sword tassel.

463
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,310
Was that not obvious enough?

464
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,760
If he does not like me,

465
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,310
why should I cling to him?

466
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,560
Yingying?

467
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,680
Yingying!

468
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,280
First, I am not going home.

469
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,470
Second, I am not going on blind dates.

470
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:05,800
I...

471
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:08,760
Well, I...

472
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,350
I am here not because...

473
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,560
Wait a second.

474
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
You drove her away.

475
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,350
You had better finish the work she left behind.

476
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,520
All right.

477
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,470
What are the things

478
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,310
in that bundle?

479
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,520
Yingying is determined

480
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,470
to stand her ground against our mother.

481
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:32,950
I figured

482
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,640
she would be staying with you for a while,

483
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,160
so I packed her some clothes and necessities.

484
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,040
I did not expect you to be so thoughtful.

485
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,310
So you are not here

486
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,560
to drag her back for the blind dates?

487
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,950
She has a mind of her own.

488
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,040
If it is not someone she truly admires,

489
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,640
she would rather never marry.

490
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,400
As her brother,

491
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,680
I only want her to be happy.

492
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,470
How can I force her into something she does not want?

493
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,160
You understand her so well.

494
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,880
But why does your mother keep pushing her?

495
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,110
But

496
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,920
not every woman

497
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,830
truly knows what she likes

498
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,760
or what she wants.

499
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,950
Well...

500
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,470
For instance,

501
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,190
do you know

502
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,070
what kind of man you like, Yuniang?

503
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,830
I thought we were talking about Yingying.

504
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,470
How did this conversation suddenly turn to me?

505
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,680
I was just... casually asking.

506
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,350
I like all kinds of men!

507
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,070
I like those with handsome looks

508
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,640
and strong build.

509
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,640
I also like those who are rich and witty.

510
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,470
It is best to have wealth and power,

511
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,110
and no parents to interfere!

512
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,000
But

513
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,920
no one could possibly have

514
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,710
all those traits at once.

515
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,350
Could it be...?

516
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,950
That is why I do not plan to remarry.

517
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,920
As long as I stay single,

518
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,350
I can admire

519
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,760
any fine young man,

520
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,560
appreciate him,

521
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,560
and even tease him.

522
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,230
You really do not plan to marry again?

523
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,000
No.

524
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,430
Being a bride once was enough. It is boring.

525
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,640
Yuniang, please take care of Yingying.

526
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,190
I have got some matters to attend to at home.

527
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:21,710
I will leave first.

528
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,880
Do you really not like Yaoting?

529
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,710
He is just fine.

530
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,350
What is that supposed to mean?

531
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,070
I enjoy his company.

532
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,160
But he is not someone I cannot live without.

533
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,880
There are things more important than love,

534
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,280
such as freedom

535
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,680
and joy.

536
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,160
That is not what you were saying to me earlier!

537
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,880
People can justify anything with words,

538
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,470
and every path in life can eventually reach its end.

539
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,310
So, Yingying,

540
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,830
stop listening to what others say.

541
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,470
You should ask yourself more often.

542
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,920
It is the second watch of the Hai hour.

543
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,310
Lock your doors, close your windows,

544
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,830
and guard against thieves!

545
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,920
I will rely on myself

546
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,760
to protect you through storms and blades, Ms. Ji.

547
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,470
From this day forward,

548
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,680
you will no longer bear the name of a disgraced family.

549
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,950
Your father

550
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,560
remains the noble and righteous Brocade Master.

551
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,800
Our life is intertwined.

552
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:20,000
Our trust is exchanged for loyalty.

553
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,950
What ally could ever offer such devotion?

554
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,230
But he is not one to play games or deceive.

555
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,950
No,

556
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,070
I must know the truth!

557
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,640
It is already late.

558
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,760
Ji Yingying,

559
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,310
if you wake up tomorrow feeling the same,

560
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,280
go ask him about it directly.

561
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,310
No more tormenting yourself with doubt.

562
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,230

00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,190
Yes, sir.

605
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,910
As for Zhao Xiuyuan,

606
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,630
if he seeks me out,

607
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:30,190
bring him directly to me.

608
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,840
Zhao Xiuyuan?

609
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,800
Master, do you wish to collaborate with him?

Leveraging the Yu family

611
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,190
and pitting the Zhao family against the Yang family

612
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,080
is an excellent strategy.

613
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,280
Besides,

614
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,120
Zhao Xiuyuan and I share one thing in common.

615
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,190
We will not let go of Ji Yingying.

616
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:46,710
So why not work together?

00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,710

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,910
Zhao Xiuyuan has you confined here.

621
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,600
You have suffered enough.

622
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,630
There are guards watching at all hours.

623
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,470
The place is fortified.

624
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,840
How did you get inside?

625
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,910
I found a way.

626
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,230
As long as I can see you,

627
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,630
I will be at ease.

628
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,630
You foolish girl.

629
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,390
You have endured so much.

630
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,320
Come here.

631
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,520
What should we do next, Ms. Niu?

632
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,390
How can I get you out of here?

633
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,040
What is happening outside?

634
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,120
The general has requested to lead troops to the southwest front.

635
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,470
Half of the forces in the city have been handed to Zhao Xiuyuan.

636
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,710
The other half remains in the Niu residence

637
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,280
under the butler's command.

638
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:52,390
My dear father is always quick to dodge responsibility.

639
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,670
How about Ji Yingying and Yang Jinglan?

640
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,670
Bloom Society has completed its Ripple Brocade.

641
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,870
They are now

642
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,950
publicly selling it across the city

643
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,630
with great fanfare.

644
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,670
Yang Jinglan

645
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,120
has returned to Chang'an

646
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,840
to report on the matter of the logistics officer.

647
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,520
How about Zhao Xiuyuan?

648
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,600
What is he doing?

649
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,150
Nothing.

650
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,040
Has he made any move against Ji Yingying?

651
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,230
No, he has not.

652
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,390
For the past few days, Mr. Zhao stayed in the house

653
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,840
and handled family matters.

654
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,320
He did not even attend

655
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,520
the event where Ji Yingying unveiled her new brocade.

656
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,230
Miss,

657
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,120
has he truly given up on Ji Yingying?

658
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,840
In the past, he had nothing,

659
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,870
yet he still refused to let go.

660
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,800
Now, he has power in his hands,

661
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,390
so there is no way he will give up so easily.

662
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,800
Right now,

663
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,390
we need someone to give him a push

664
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,630
and pierce through his final layer of hypocrisy.

665
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,910
What do you need me to do?

666
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,390
Find a way

667
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,630
to bring Mrs. Zhao to see me.

668
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,800
If you must drink,

669
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,230
go do it at a business discussion.

670
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,230
What is the point of sulking here?

671
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,040
Mother,

672
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,870
all business matters have been delegated.

673
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,910
Everything is under control.

674
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,520
A little drink will not cause harm.

675
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,230
Will it not cause harm?

676
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,080
You cannot even hold this wine jug steadily.

677
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,280
How will you draw patterns

678
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,470
or throw the shuttle to weave brocade?

679
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,470
I used to weave brocade for one person alone,

680
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,870
but now that they are gone,

681
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,470
what meaning is there in weaving anymore?

682
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,190
You are still pining for Ji Yingying, right?

683
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,430
Then, marry her!

684
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,840
With Bloom Society's recent success,

685
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,630
she is more than worthy of becoming part of our family now.

686
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,430
But

687
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,910
she no longer wants to marry me.

688
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:21,040
I used to claim everything I did

689
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,840
was for her.

690
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,120
But in the end,

691
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,320
I was the one who hurt her the most.

692
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,840
Mother,

693
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,840
I do not deserve her.

694
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,040
Marriage

695
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,280
is decided by parents

696
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,390
and matchmakers.

697
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,120
Once she becomes your wife,

698
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,000
she will come to terms with it sooner or later.

699
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:53,600
Why bring this up now, Mother?

700
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,230
Now,

701
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,840
Ms. Ji has joined forces with the Yu family

702
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,630
to create the new brocade.

703
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,910
They are stealing the spotlight.

704
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,430
Yet, my husband sits idly by,

705
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,840
allowing the Zhao family to be overshadowed.

706
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,080
He is indulging in these trivial feelings.

707
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:10,120
How can he achieve greatness?

708
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,320
How can he secure his position as the patriarch of the family

709
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,120
and gain my father's trust?

710
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,320
So, I am willing to let him take another bride

711
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,870
to settle this lingering matter in his heart.

712
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,280
But Xiuyuan is simply too stubborn.

713
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,870
If he is unwilling,

714
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,430
I am afraid

715
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,710
even I will not be able to persuade him.

716
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,600
My husband's heart is as hard as stone.

717
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,600
Ordinary words will not sway him,

718
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,280
but I do have something in mind

719
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,470
that you can say to him.

720
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,040
I cannot bear to see you so defeated.

721
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,710
Lost business

722
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,910
can be won back.

723
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,840
And so can love.

724
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,000
If a man truly desires a woman,

725
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,390
all it takes is the resolve to act.

726
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,870
It will not be that difficult.

727
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,230
If you truly care for her,

728
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,040
can you not muster even a shred of courage?

729
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,630
How long has she known Yang Jinglan

730
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,840
compared to the time she has spent with you?

731
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,670
Are you really willing

732
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,430
to let someone else take the flower you have nurtured

733
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,870
with your own hands?

734
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:26,120
I cannot accept it!

735
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,230
Mother, you do not understand.

736
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,840
That boy is unreliable.

737
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,320
I worry every day

738
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,120
that Yingying will suffer under his care!

739
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,630
Then take her back!

740
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,190
