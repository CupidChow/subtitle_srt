[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,800
Ritual of offering begins!

4
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,830
Ascend the Mountain

5
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,190
and honor Leizu!

6
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,590
In gratitude to Leizu,

7
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,870
Xuanyuan's consort,

8
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,270
the first silkworm mother

9
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,480
who taught us to raise silkworms

10
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,550
and make clothing.

11
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,040
Her grace reaches all, and her name immortalized.

12
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,830
The Brocade Officer and Master present silk and offer wine.

13
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,080
As the year draws to a close,

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,270
in gratitude to Leizu,

15
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,440
I lead the esteemed householders

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,190
to perform the purification ceremony,

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,190
solemnly completing the ritual at the altar,

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,030
offering fragrant incense,

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,720
praying for shared blessings,

20
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,600
humbly inviting the deity to partake!

21
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,320
The Brocade Officer and Master bow again!

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,520
Everyone kneels in unison!

23
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:47,320
Reverently honoring Leizu, praying for shared blessings!

24
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,190
Pay your respects!

25
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,000
Mr. Yang,

26
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,910
where are you going?

27
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,190
Why should I report my whereabouts

28
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
to you?

29
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,000
Once everyone finishes offering incense,

30
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,360
we still need

31
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,160
to escort the deity back

32
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,520
and pay respects to Leizu.

33
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,190
To avoid further delays on your part,

34
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,080
please wait here with me.

35
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,670
After all these years,

36
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,550
why are you still so tiresome?

37
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,110
By the time they finish offering incense,

38
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,110
it'll be almost nightfall.

39
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,600
I'm tired

40
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,520
and just want to rest a bit. What's wrong with that?

41
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,320
What,

42
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,520
did Leizu herself tell you

43
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,000
that I must stand and wait?

44
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,080
You...

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,600
Gentleman,

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,910
why not come and take a look over here?

47
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,600
Try your luck for just 20 wen.

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,360
These are blessed by Leizu herself!

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,800
Come and check out our fortune boxes!

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,110
You might get something amazing.

51
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,910
Want to give it a try?

52
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,440
These people attend the Leizu Festival

53
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,800
just to pay their respects.

54
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,600
Who'd want to buy this junky silk?

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,160
And these boxes are downright ugly.

56
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,000
We're offering a silk draw game here.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Just 20 wen per draw.

58
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,390
They're blessed by Leizu herself!

59
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,190
What's the matter?

60
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,670
Where's the hype man we hired?

61
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,390
He went to the restroom.

62
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,030
He'll be back in a bit.

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,950
How much did you agree to pay him?

64
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,350
A whole string of coins.

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,230
Did you already pay him?

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,950
Yeah.

67
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,320
Paid in full?

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,920
Shouldn't we pay him in full?

69
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,230
Why would he bother working now?

70
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,880
He's clearly not coming back.

71
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,920
I was fooled again, eh?

72
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,390
I'll just hire another one.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,270
You...

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,110
Miss, may I ask,

75
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,230
what do you mean by "Leizu's blessing" here?

76
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,880
And is it appropriate to sell silk

77
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,760
at the Leizu Festival?

78
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,880
Sir, you misunderstand.

79
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,830
Leizu taught our ancestors

80
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,230
to raise silkworms and weave silk.

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,480
Her contributions are immense.

82
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,320
The fact that I can sell silk today

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,440
is all thanks to her blessing,

84
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,270
and there is no disrespect intended.

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,200
What we call "Leizu's blessing"

86
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,480
is fortune hidden within these boxes.

87
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,480
Inside, you'll find silk of varying quality.

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,640
Each box is priced at 20 wen.

89
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,070
Feel free to choose one.

90
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,230
Its quality depends entirely on your luck today.

91
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,110
I see now.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,320
Well, I'll...

93
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,480
give it a try now.

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,110
Sure.

95
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,200
Here.

96
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,440
Which one would you like, sir?

97
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,320
That one.

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,920
This one?

99
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,480
All right.

100
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,670
Sir, your fortune is truly abundant today!

101
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,320
This is our lucky bonus,

102
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,640
a blessing pouch for double the good fortune!

103
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,320
This pouch is exquisitely crafted.

104
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,230
Even for 30 or 40 wen,

105
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,510
you wouldn't buy it elsewhere.

106
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,440
Is everything inside good?

107
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,200
It can't be. It's only 20 wen each.

108
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,880
They'd lose a fortune.

109
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Let me try another one.

110
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,760
Sure thing.

111
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,390
This one?

112
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,000
All right.

113
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,640
See? I knew it!

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,950
It's a loss!

115
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:07,640
This is old silk, isn't it?

116
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,230
It's not worth 20 wen.

117
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,270
It's not worth it at all.

118
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,790
This isn't worth it!

119
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,440
True, this one isn't worth 20 wen.

120
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,830
But that pouch alone is worth more than 20 wen.

121
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,390
Together, you're still coming out ahead.

122
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,760
That's true.

123
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
That makes sense.

124
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,200
Exactly.

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,640
If you put it that way, I have to try another!

126
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
Of course, go ahead.

127
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,790
That one.

128
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,230
All right, that one.

129
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,390
This one?

130
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,110
Yeah.

131
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
What's this?

132
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,320
Midnight Purple Silk!

133
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,920
Who knew these boxes held such fine silk?

134
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,640
These fortune boxes are all about luck.

135
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,320
There's gain and there's loss.

136
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,720
Exactly.

137
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,040
As long as you buy enough,

138
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,790
the differences will even out eventually.

139
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,000
Plus, even this old silk isn't useless.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you sell it to someone else,

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,480
you wouldn't lose much.

142
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,000
If you win, you're happy.

143
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,790
If you lose, think of it as spending a few coins

144
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,830
for some fun!

145
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,480
Miss, you have a point!

146
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,040
Here, I'll try one too!

147
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,880
Sure.

148
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,110
I'll try one too!

149
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,270
Step right up!

150
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,110
Don't push!

151
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,200
Please don't push!

152
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,640
- Line up for the mystery boxes! - There's plenty for everyone!

153
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,760
Line up!

154
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,920
Don't push!

155
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,270
Over here!

156
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,070
I'll try one too.

157
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,230
I'll take this one.

158
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,320
I'll try one as well.

159
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,600
Yingying!

160
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,920
There's enough for everyone!

161
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,550
Yingying!

162
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,510
Hurry, restock!

163
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,320
Coming!

164
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,480
This one.

165
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,720
Miss, someone asked me to send this to you.

166
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,950
Thank you.

167
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,160
Miss Ji,

168
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,760
rushing over won't help your brother.

169
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,830
Save your energy.

170
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,200
You were the one who sent me the message?

171
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,200
I took you in out of kindness, gave you work at our house.

172
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,270
Instead of gratitude,

173
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,550
you stole our loom.

174
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,000
Now you've been caught red-handed.

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,880
What else do you have to say for yourself?

176
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,760
There must be misunderstanding here!

177
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,440
Mr. Wang,

178
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,070
didn't you agree

179
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,480
to sell me this loom?

180
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,000
When did I ever agree to sell it to you?

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,160
How could you even afford it?

182
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,830
This loom was clearly stolen from my house!

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,390
So many witnesses saw it happen.

184
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,830
That's right!

185
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,790
Are you still trying to deny it?

186
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,600
It was you!

187
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,000
What did you do to my brother?

188
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,600
Your brother depends on others for scraps,

189
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,670
enduring humiliation to work.

190
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,070
I bet you don't know about any of this.

191
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,230
My brother working for you was all part of your plan?

192
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,030
Just a little icing on the cake.

193
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
A gentleman doesn't steal.

194
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
A virtuous man doesn't rob.

195
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,960
I, Ji Yaoting,

196
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,590
have never resorted to petty theft!

197
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,230
Where's the contract?

198
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,440
Yes, the contract.

199
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
Everyone here witnessed it that day.

200
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,640
We signed a contract!

201
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,440
What contract?

202
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,200
Did anyone see it?

203
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,000
- Did you see it? - No, I didn't.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,590
All we saw was Ji Yaoting stealing the loom

205
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,640
and getting caught red-handed.

206
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,400
- That's right. - You...

207
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,440
The contract is with you, isn't it?

208
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,760
Without that contract,

209
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,470
your brother will be taken to the bureau,

210
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,590
have his hands and feet broken,

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,280
and never weave brocade again.

212
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,670
You're forcing my brother into a dead end today.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,790
Aren't you afraid that one day,

214
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,230
I'll repay you in kind?

215
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,080
A powerless criminal's daughter,

216
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,400
and you dare challenge me?

217
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,550
You're overestimating yourself.

218
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,840
Fine, Mrs. Hua, just you wait.

219
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,080
Let's see if I can do.

220
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,880
So, do you still want this contract?

221
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,110
Move the loom out!

222
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,670
Don't move it!

223
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,230
Move it!

224
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,840
Don't move it!

225
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,230
Move it!

226
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,320
You agreed to sell it to me!

227
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,150
It's my loom!

228
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,520
Move it!

229
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,150
Don't move it!

230
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,080
You stole it from me!

231
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,670
Don't move it!

232
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,590
This isn't your loom!

233
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,840
Don't move it!

234
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:37,960
Say it then.

235
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,790
What do you want me to do?

236
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,760
Let go...

237
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,440
Why are you here?

238
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,110
I came to find you.

239
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,350
If you don't go back soon,

240
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,640
the situation above will be exposed.

241
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,960
It's just a closing ceremony.

242
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,880
Must I really be there?

243
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,280
What's your mouth for?

244
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,670
Can't you just make up an excuse for me?

245
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,150
Excuses are easy to find,

246
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,590
but traces are hard to hide.

247
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,400
If you miss the ceremony above

248
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,840
and happen to stir up trouble

249
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,080
here in the mountains...

250
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,230
This Brocade Officer position of yours

251
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,150
is already under close watch.

252
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,910
It's too easy to arouse suspicion.

253
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,960
Where do all these coincidences come from?

254
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,840
Caution and preparation

255
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,110
prevent accidents.

256
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,470
Bookworm!

257
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
Brute!

258
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,350
Come!

259
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,400
Hand the money over to me!

260
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,200
Let me weigh how much it is.

261
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,320
I knew Yingying's idea would work!

262
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,760
Nice!

263
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,640
My hand is the scale!

264
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,280
Why don't you count it when you get back?

265
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,150
Can you ever finish counting money?

266
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,350
Yingying, you're back!

267
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:55,910
Yingying!

268
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,150
How about that?

269
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,670
Are all the boxes sold out?

270
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,150
Of course!

271
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,590
With your brains and our hands,

272
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,230
what can't we accomplish?

273
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,350
My eyes were strained nearly to blindness.

274
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,440
Finally, we can join the Splendor Showcase.

275
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,960
Mr. Zhao Senior is here.

276
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,760
Hurry, go greet him.

277
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,400
Look!

278
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:15,880
Go!

279
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,400
How about this?

280
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,350
I'd like

281
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,470
to introduce someone to all of you,

282
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:22,960
a rising star in business.

283
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,640
Please, everyone, stay a moment.

284
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,790
This is Miss Ji of the Huanhua Dyehouse

285
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,550
from Sandaoyan.

286
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,350
She's young,

287
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,880
but she's got plenty of ideas.

288
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,000
If you ever get the chance,

289
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,550
please support her endeavors.

290
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,790
If you personally speak for her,

291
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,790
she must be an extraordinary talent.

292
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,840
Rest assured!

293
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,550
Since you've asked,

294
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,280
we'll certainly help her out!

295
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,550
Thank you.

296
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,280
Sir, the old silk is sold out.

297
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,200
I'd like to remind you of your promise

298
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,790
to grant me one request.

299
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,760
Speak freely, Miss Ji.

300
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,350
Pay attention!

301
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,030
Stop stalling!

302
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,760
Just say it already!

303
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,230
Yingying!

304
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
- Yingying! - Say it!

305
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,150
Go ahead.

306
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,960
Please, sir,

307
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,550
allow me to marry Zhao Xiuyuan soon.

308
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,080
What?

309
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,590
What?

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,320
Is this what we agreed on?

311
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,670
Did I misremember?

312
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,880
Ji Yingying,

313
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,470
what's wrong with you?

314
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,590
The betrothal between Zhao Xiuyuan and me

315
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,910
was set when we were young.

316
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,000
I know the Zhao family needs a capable wife.

317
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,760
Previously,

318
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,670
I caused Sang Shisi to stir up trouble at Huanhua Creek,

319
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,400
forcing the Brocade Officer to change the creekside rules.

320
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,590
Now, relying on my own abilities,

321
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,440
I stand before you discussing business.

322
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,640
Surely, this proves my worth.

323
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Please grant your approval, sir.

324
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,840
So, I've been played, have I?

325
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,200
You little lady...

326
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,280
You're quite the little lady indeed.

327
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,710
Mr. Zhao Senior gave you

328
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,280
the right to discuss business,

329
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,640
and you're wasting it

330
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,840
with nonsense!

331
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,080
Grandpa,

332
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,000
this matter

333
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,400
is my idea.

334
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,350
I've always admired Miss Ji,

335
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,760
and I wanted to take this opportunity

336
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,670
to ask for her hand in marriage.

337
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,030
I hope you'll approve.

338
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,840
Fool.

339
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,760
This Zhao Xiuyuan is as clueless as they come,

340
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,640
discussing personal matters in public.

341
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,590
Sir,

342
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,760
since this is your family's private affair,

343
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,000
we'll excuse ourselves now.

344
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,760
I must apologize for the embarrassment

345
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,470
we've caused you all.

346
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,670
Not at all. We'll take our leave first.

347
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,670
Miss Ji, as for what you mentioned,

348
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,840
when the time is right,

349
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,670
everything will naturally fall into place.

350
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,320
Let's go!

351
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,910
Ji Yingying, stop right there!

352
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,910
What do you take us for?

353
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,880
Tools for your personal gain?

354
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,670
Stepping stones for your high-society marriage?

355
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,470
Do you really intend to run a business with us?

356
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,230
Ji Yingying,

357
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,760
were you lying to me from the start?

358
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,280
You're just like them.

359
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,000
You never saw me as a friend, did you?

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,550
Could there

361
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,550
be more to this story?

362
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,840
Yeah, let's calm down

363
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,760
and hear Yingying's explanation.

364
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,110
What's there left to explain?

365
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,960
Our hearts are divided.

366
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,470
And our trust is long gone.

367
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,280
We might as well call it quits.

368
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,230
It's my fault. I've let you all down.

369
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,880
Fine.

370
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,910
Ji Yingying,

371
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,320
I must have been blind to trust you.

372
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,110
"Honorary President"? I quit!

373
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,150
What are you standing here for? Let's go!

374
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,590
Since I chose to support you,

375
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,000
that won't change.

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,880
I believe

377
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,280
you can accomplish something with us.

378
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,160
As long as everyone needs me,

379
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,470
I'll give it my all!

380
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,230
You tell me drinking is harmful,

381
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,350
but look how much you've had yourself!

382
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,070
I'm fine. Give me that.

383
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,280
I can handle my liquor...

384
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,350
Yingying,

385
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,160
I've heard a bit about what happened today.

386
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,070
You're not someone who goes back on her word.

387
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,470
What's really going on?

388
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,710
I heard

389
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,040
you set up a stall to sell silk

390
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,230
at the Lei Zu Festival today

391
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,470
to ask a favor of Mr. Zhao Senior.

392
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,470
Did you hope to gain his approval

393
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,280
for your marriage to Zhao Xiuyuan?

394
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,110
Are you asking me to reveal this publicly?

395
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,950
If you're offering yourself,

396
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,920
at least show some real capability.

397
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,280
Oh, by the way,

398
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,310
the new rules at Huanhua Creek

399
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,760
was your idea, wasn't it?

400
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,830
Miss Ji, you could tell Mr. Zhao Senior

401
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,350
about this accomplishment.

402
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,470
Take the initiative and confess my schemes,

403
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,920
then I'll face rejection from both the Zhao family

404
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,680
and the other dyehouse owners.

405
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,760
One contract,

406
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,830
two demands,

407
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,070
your business practices

408
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,680
are truly unfair, aren't they?

409
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,760
It all depends

410
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,160
on how much you care about your brother.

411
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,950
Mrs. Hua

412
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,710
made you say those things,

413
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,830
ruining your reputation as a woman

414
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,350
while shifting the blame for Huanhua Creek's

415
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,470
new rules onto you.

416
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,710
Turning the dyehouse owners against you.

417
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,070
That's truly malicious.

418
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,640
Yu, I feel awful.

419
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,040
Can't we just tell them the truth?

420
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,470
My brother endured so much humiliation

421
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,880
behind the scenes while working,

422
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,310
yet he acted as if nothing happened.

423
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,710
If not for helping me,

424
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,040
he wouldn't have been set up by Mrs. Hua.

425
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,430
If he knew I did all this for him,

426
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,160
who knows how guilty he'd feel?

427
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,070
With his attitude,

428
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,400
he might even

429
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,310
give up weaving brocade entirely.

430
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,920
He's your elder brother.

431
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,430
It's not your place to shield him.

432
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,070
Failure is a lesson learned.

433
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,880
In the end, Mrs. Hua's target is me,

434
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,070
and he was dragged into this.

435
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,230
It's my fault I let down everyone.

436
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,880
That contract...

437
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,230
do you think Mrs. Hua will give it to you?

438
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,430
Just wait and see!

439
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,950
Once I get past this hurdle,

440
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,430
I'll make sure to get that contract back.

441
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,880
You really don't give up, do you?

442
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,280
Give up?

443
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,070
Why should I give up?

444
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,920
Those dyehouse tycoons can act as they please

445
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,710
and we deserve to be bullied?

446
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,710
So what if they have power and influence?

447
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,680
Does that give them the right to harm others?

448
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,280
We work ourselves to the bone to make a living!

449
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,280
Do we deserve to be wronged?

450
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,680
This is the Ji Yingying I know!

451
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,070
Yu, let me tell you...

452
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,000
Shh.

453
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,760
I will soon create a new dye color.

454
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,560
When the time comes...

455
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,040
When the time comes, I'll...

456
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,230
Let's talk about it then.

457
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll go make you some hangover soup.

458
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,830
I...

459
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,520
When the time comes, I'll show them...

460
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
How much did she drink?

461
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,830
You're here.

462
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,760
Are you looking for her? Or for me?

463
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,280
Yu, I saw a wild horse!

464
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,280
A wild horse... quick, give me a hand!

465
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I came to find some wine,

466
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,190
and also to find her.

467
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,830
But seeing her like this, completely drunk,

468
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,640
she probably doesn't even recognize anything now.

469
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,190
Do you recognize this silk?

470
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,350
In all of Shu, when it comes to silk,

471
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,880
if I claim second place...

472
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,190
How modest of you.

473
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,040
No one dares claim first place!

474
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,400
I may have spoken too soon.

475
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,640
If you claim first place,

476
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,950
then take a good look.

477
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,800
What is this?

478
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,590
Do you recognize it?

479
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,470
I do.

480
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,160
It's your hand!

481
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,800
Idiot.

482
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,470
In my opinion,

483
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,760
your skill in identifying silk is far from refined.

484
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,230
But your ability to boast

485
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,430
is top-notch.

486
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,680
You just don't recognize it, do you?

487
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,590
Nonsense!

488
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,520
In all of Shu, when it comes to silk,

489
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,070
if I...

490
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,880
claim...

491
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,760
Take care.

492
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,400
Is this all because the Zhao family hasn't replied?

493
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,680
Are you so desperate to marry Zhao Xiuyuan?

494
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,280
What do you know?

495
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,470
You're the Brocade Officer...

496
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
No matter what title I hold,

497
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,830
I would never marry her.

498
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,400
What I mean is,

499
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,800
you could help by recommending her for the Splendor Showcase.

500
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,760
She wants to marry into a powerful family

501
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,430
and succeed in business at the same time.

502
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,760
She surely knows how to enjoy life.

503
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,000
But those who have passed on...

504
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,160
does she not care about them at all?

505
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:45,590
Help if you can.

506
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,430
If you can't, then leave.

507
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,520
Boiled bean sprouts in broth

508
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,880
can help with a hangover.

509
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,680
It's gentler than most remedies.

510
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,950
This restaurant is mine.

511
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:56,830
I don't need your advice!

512
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,950
I'll take this wine!

513
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,280
You're back.

514
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,070
Mr. Yang, if you have any grievances against me,

515
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,590
can you just say them directly?

516
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,350
That day, I came to Yizhou with my people

517
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,400
and enjoyed various entertainments

518
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,760
in the courtyard.

519
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,430
Everyone came to join me,

520
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,590
Except you, who stayed in your room.

521
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,880
Why was that?

522
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,400
I don't enjoy banquets,

523
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,830
nor am I good at pleasing people.

524
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,880
That's it.

525
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,640
I'm here to get things done,

526
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,680
not to fool around.

527
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't need someone who shares my ambition

528
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,350
or tries to win my favor.

529
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:10,680
What I need

530
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,950
is a pair of eyes different from mine

531
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,560
to see Yizhou City.

532
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,350
That's

533
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,680
why I chose you.

534
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,710
Fine.

535
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,190
Then

536
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,800
I'll speak bluntly.

537
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,880
Go ahead.

538
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,800
I understand that you've recently been feuding with the Yang family on purpose

539
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,760
to make others think you're isolated and unsupported,

540
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,070
making you appear approachable for bribes and alliances.

541
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,470
It's a clever way to bait them.

542
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,000
But the Yang family, as the Brocade Master,

543
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,350
have been operating in Yizhou for decades.

544
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,590
If you could cooperate with them,

545
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,000
it would be greatly beneficial.

546
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,400
Despite clashing during the day,

547
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,230
with your extraordinary martial skills,

548
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,400
why not meet them secretly at night?

549
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,680
I do need someone who speaks plainly,

550
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,560
but I never said

551
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,590
I wouldn't hit

552
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,350
the one who does.

553
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,920
So, did you discover anything

554
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,230
in the mountains today?

555
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,190
The road ahead is blocked.

556
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,830
We might need to take another way.

557
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,760
What happened?

558
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,680
A few large stones are blocking the path.

559
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,190
They must have rolled down from the mountain

560
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,560
after the recent rain.

561
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,800
You all,

562
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,230
follow me to find another route.

563
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,040
You,

564
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,160
stay here and keep watch.

565
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:33,640
Let's go.

566
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,470
What's this?

567
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,190
Someone took advantage of the crowd at the Lei Zu Festival

568
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,350
to bypass inspections

569
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,880
and transport silk into the mountain's interior,

570
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,470
two whole chests of it.

571
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,000
Transporting silk to the mountains?

572
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,190
Could it be...

573
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,070
There must

574
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,590
be a hidden brocade workshop

575
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,160
somewhere up there we don't know about.

576
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,590
Weaving brocade in the mountains...

577
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,950
This batch of brocade must be hiding an even bigger secret.

578
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,400
With such a large operation,

579
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,590
could it be connected to the military commissioner?

580
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,310
Mu Hui?

581
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,040
He's the highest-ranking official here.

582
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,190
All of Shu is his personal treasure chest,

583
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,000
and the governor is just his lackey for collecting money.

584
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,950
These brocade merchants pay tributes annually.

585
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,230
He can exploit them however he pleases.

586
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,350
Why go to such lengths?

587
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,400
True.

588
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,430
Only those who can't embezzle openly

589
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,800
would resort to such elaborate schemes,

590
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,350
acting so secretively in the mountains.

591
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,560
In that case,

592
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,040
should we inform

593
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,000
the military commissioner in the future?

594
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,760
Much appreciated.

595
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,040
Please inspect the silk.

596
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,800
Miss,

597
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,000
it's getting late.

598
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,920
It's cold in the mountains. Let's head back early.

599
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,590
Have you gathered any information?

600
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,310
The letter says

601
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,760
that Yang Jinglan has been at odds with the Yang family since childhood.

602
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,040
He later ran away from home

603
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,160
and became a wandering swordsman,

604
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,920
traveling from place to place.

605
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,160
A year ago, he went to the capital

606
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,760
and purchased an official title.

607
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Bought his position?

608
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,190
The Brocade Officers of Yizhou kept dying mysteriously,

609
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,230
and no one dared take the post.

610
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,830
Since he's a Yizhou native

611
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,640
and wanted this position

612
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,160
to spite the Yang family,

613
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,190
he paid someone to secure the role.

614
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:23,350
Sounds like he's a complete playboy.

615
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,800
Yet at Huanhua Creek,

616
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,160
he was the only one bold enough to post a notice

617
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,710
banning territorial disputes.

618
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,310
A playboy who wants to do a good job?

619
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,760
Rumor has it Ji Yingying is behind it.

620
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,560
Since we can't confirm his intentions,

621
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,430
let's see

622
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,350
what he's capable of.

623
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,560
Go ask Mrs. Hua to do something.

624
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
I'll use the Splendor Showcase

625
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,230
to test the waters.

626
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,640
Yes, ma'am.

627
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,190
She's asleep?

628
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,400
How about

629
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,190
letting her rest here tonight?

630
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That won't do.

631
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,800
If Mother finds out, she'll be angry.

632
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,400
Yingying gained Mr. Zhao Senior's approval

633
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,880
and sold silk at the Lei Zu Festival today.

634
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,000
But from her sorrowful expression,

635
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
it doesn't look like she drank out of joy.

636
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,000
Did something happen?

637
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,070
Even if you knew,

638
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,640
what could you do?

639
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:42,800
Right.

640
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,590
I can't even handle my own problems.

641
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,640
I couldn't even protect Father's loom,

642
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,590
let alone help her.

643
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,070
Our family's had nothing but misfortune lately.

644
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,430
She must be overwhelmed with grief

645
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,590
and so was drinking herself into this state.

646
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,190
It's my fault.

647
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,800
I couldn't protect her.

648
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,830
Stop crying.

649
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,230
Yingying is much stronger than you think.

650
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,950
What happened exactly?

651
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,950
Please, Yuniang, tell me.

652
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,640
You're a gentleman,

653
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,160
a good person,

654
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,160
But kindness without a sharp edge

655
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
can't fend off the sharp swords aimed at you.

656
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,430
She didn't tell you

657
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,160
because she wanted to protect you.

658
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,830
But the longer she shields you,

659
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,800
the more guilt you'll feel when you finally learn the truth.

660
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,680
Hand it over.

661
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,470
The contract Mr. Wang tricked me into signing.

662
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,040
Yingying has done her part.

663
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,070
It's your turn to give up the contract.

664
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,160
You think I'll just hand it over

665
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,040
because you asked?

666
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,040
Unless...

667
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,400
Mr. Ji,

668
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,230
you kneel and kowtow to me three times,

669
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,230
or pay 300 guan to redeem it.

670
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,640
You're all liars!

671
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,640
This is just who I am!

672
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,800
I'm not one of those bookish gentlemen.

673
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
If it weren't for your scheming,

674
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,800
Yingying wouldn't have had

675
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,160
to ruin her reputation to save me!

676
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,280
Did I ruin Ji Yingying's reputation?

677
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,880
She's always hanging

678
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,280
around those men.

679
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:58,110
Everyone in Sandaoyan knows it.

680
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,590
Does she even have a reputation?

681
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,070
How dare you hit me!

682
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,640
Ji Yaoting, I'll kill you!

683
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,560
I'll kill you!

684
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,190
If you bully Yingying again,

685
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,400
I'll beat you every time I see you!

686
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,160
You're a scholar. How can you strike so hard...

687
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,160
I read books

688
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,400
simply because I love reading.

689
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,400
I'm no gentleman!

690
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,070
I'm the eldest son of the Ji family,

691
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,400
Yingying's elder brother!

692
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,830
Are you giving it up or not?

693
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,400
I'll give it...

694
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,160
Here...

695
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,590
Hua Xiangrong, let me tell you...

696
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,350
Scholars

697
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,590
get more tricks up our sleeves.

698
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,430
Forgive me...

699
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,430
I acted impulsively

700
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,040
and caused you trouble.

701
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,800
I'll compensate for any damages

702
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,230
to the items here later.

703
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,800
I'll take my leave now.

704
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:08,920
You...

705
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,280
This bookworm...

706
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,400
he dares to fight!

707
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,280
Compensation!

708
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:50,940
[Contract]

709
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,290
[The content of the contract]

710
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,000
Yaoting, I'm hungry.

711
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,470
I saved you some porridge.

712
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,000
I'll get it for you.

713
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,320
Young Master.

714
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,560
Miss.

715
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,390
The madam has returned.

716
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,230
She was invited back by the second wife of the Zhao family.

717
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:08,560
Let's go.

718
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,800
This is this year's new tea.

719
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,630
Though it's not expensive,

720
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,080
It's fresh and flavorful.

721
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,360
Please have a taste, Madam.

722
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,600
Let's get straight to the point.

723
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,230
I invited you back

724
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,360
to discuss the marriage between Xiuyuan and Miss Ji.

725
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,560
Madam,

726
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,120
it seems we're on the same page.

727
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,470
Shh.

728
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,560
The marriage between them

729
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,800
was arranged while Yingying's father was still alive.

730
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,080
At that time,

731
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,000
he had a particular fondness for Xiuyuan.

732
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,080
This marriage...

733
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,950
This marriage,

734
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,430
let's call it off.

735
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,000
Call it off?

736
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,760
How can it be canceled so lightly?

737
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,390
Nothing in this world is unchanging.

738
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,600
Take Brocade Master Ji for example.

739
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,600
He was once so prominent,

740
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,630
but later, his household fell into ruin,

741
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,560
and your entire family was dragged down with him.

742
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,800
Xiuyuan is the legitimate son of the Zhao family's second branch.

743
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,600
Even if he doesn't become the family head in the future,

744
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,950
he will inherit a considerable fortune.

745
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,000
With his brilliance and talent,

746
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,390
He is more than suited to marry into a family of senior officials.

747
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,800
I understand.

748
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:27,390
Please see yourself out, Madam.

749
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,950
Actually, Miss Ji does have some admirable qualities.

750
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,040
She's capable and competent.

751
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,230
Why not find her

752
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,390
a steady and obedient husband?

753
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,150
Let Miss Ji make waves outside,

754
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,710
while her husband stays home to care for you.

755
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,800
Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds?

756
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,080
I happen to have a few suitable matches in mind.

757
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,390
If Yingying marries first,

758
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,630
it would be the Ji family breaking off the marriage,

759
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:57,390
leaving the Zhao family free

760
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,670
of any accusations.

761
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,670
All these years, your family has been delaying the marriage

762
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,040
for this reason.

763
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,230
What's this? Has the esteemed Zhao family

764
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,280
stopped caring about their reputation?

765
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,430
Speaking of reputation,

766
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
you might want to worry about your own.

767
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,190
How impressive Miss Ji is,

768
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,390
offending every major dyehouse in Sandaoyan.

769
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,600
Even dye suppliers refuse to sell to her now.

770
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,190
The girls

771
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,670
are not like the boys.

772
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,430
When discipline is required, it must be enforced.

773
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,800
Otherwise, those who know the situation might say they're disobedient,

774
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,000
and those who don't

775
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,430
might think their mother, coming from a lowly family,

776
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,470
doesn't know how to raise them properly.

777
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,630
It's true my mother wasn't born into a noble family,

778
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,630
but no matter how unrefined her ways,

779
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,870
she knows to be kind to others

780
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,320
and would never cause scenes in others' homes.

781
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,190
How dare you!

782
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,230
Greetings, Aunt.

783
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,080
Aunt, are you here today

784
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,040
on Mr. Zhao Senior's orders

785
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,040
to cancel the engagement?

786
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,950
If that's the case,

787
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,280
Mother, tomorrow you should tell Matchmaker Wang

788
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,150
that Mr. Zhao Senior looks down on our Ji family

789
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,040
and wishes to call off the engagement.

790
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,040
Ask her to find me another match.

791
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,600
Watch your tongue!

792
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,800
Mr. Zhao Senior has never said such a thing.

793
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,560
Then it must be you acting on your own.

794
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,710
Congratulations, Aunt, for reaching such heights.

795
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,670
You can now make decisions on Mr. Zhao Senior's behalf.

796
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:25,710
Ji Yingying,

797
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,190
stop using Mr. Zhao Senior as leverage against me.

798
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,390
Since I brought up the engagement

799
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,760
in front of everyone,

800
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,520
the Zhao family

801
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,910
must respond appropriately.

802
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,230
"Go see her.

803
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,080
Find out what exactly she wants

804
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,600
and what she's capable of."

805
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,560
That's most likely what Mr. Zhao Senior intended, right?

806
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,430
Wrong guess?

807
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,630
Speculating about my elders

808
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,080
is my fault.

809
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,430
How about I return with you

810
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,150
to apologize to Mr. Zhao Senior?

811
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,360
After that disgraceful display at the Lei Zu Festival,

812
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,280
do you think Mr. Zhao Senior will tolerate you?

813
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,670
Ji Yingying,

814
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,950
regardless of Mr. Zhao Senior's opinion,

815
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,560
you'll never marry into the Zhao family.

816
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,840
I've already lost face.

817
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,000
But if you continue to disrespect my mother at our home,

818
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,040
I won't mind dragging you down with me.

819
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,360
Our Ji family is small and insignificant,

820
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,670
losing face means nothing to us.

821
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,190
But as for the Zhao family,

822
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,630
if you lose face,

823
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,190
Mr. Zhao Senior might expel you.

824
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,600
How dare you!

825
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,230
Madam, you know

826
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,390
my abilities are limited,

827
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,080
but I always keep my word.

828
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,630
Over here!

829
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,390
Guo Kui, see the guest out!

830
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,670
Mother...

831
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,280
Mother, I'm sorry...

832
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,950
Mother, Yingying didn't mean to...

833
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,840
All right, enough.

834
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,000
Get up.

835
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,630
What,

836
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,600
do you both think I'm that unreasonable?

837
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,280
The Zhao family has gone too far.

838
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,280
A bit of a scolding won't hurt.

839
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:18,630
But as for this marriage...

840
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,430
She has no say in the matter.

841
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,470
As long as I'm useful,

842
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,190
Mr. Zhao Senior will eventually agree.

843
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,840
Zhao Xiuyuan truly is a good match,

844
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,000
but with a family like the Zhaos, all about profit,

845
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,800
even if you marry into their family...

846
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,190
Zhao Xiuyuan is different

847
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,760
from the others in the Zhao family.

848
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,190
I'm marrying Zhao Xiuyuan,

849
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,150
not the Zhao family.

850
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,670
Oh, why do you think so simply?

851
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,870
But it's true!

852
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,390
Don't be upset.

853
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,450
[Zhao Residence]

854
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,870
Zhao Ping.

855
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,560
Sir, any orders?

856
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,000
Deliver this letter

857
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,870
to the Ji family.

858
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,360
The Master has decreed

859
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,560
anyone who dares to sneak you out

860
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,430
or send a message to the Ji family on your behalf

861
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,630
will have their legs broken

862
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,430
and be expelled.

863
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,470
Sir,

864
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,190
please don't make things difficult for me.

865
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,910
Then pass on a message to my grandfather.

866
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,600
My brocade

867
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,320
is ready for embroidery.

868
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,150
Have someone send the materials over.

869
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:43,560
I don't want to delay this year's Brocade Weaving Competition.

870
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,150
Understood. I'll go right away.

871
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,960
Whose son are you?

872
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,910
It's so lively up front.

873
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,560
Why are you sitting here alone?

874
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,670
My name is Ji Yingying.

875
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,630
I'm the daughter of Ji Guinan,

876
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:10,630
I'm here with my father to celebrate Mr. Zhao Senior's birthday.

877
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,280
Whether it's lively at home

878
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,760
has nothing to do with me.

879
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,280
They don't care if I'm happy either.

880
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,670
Being happy is simple enough.

881
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,230
Come, I'll take you somewhere.

882
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,670
You have a nice smile.

883
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,430
You should smile more often.

884
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,080
Everyone sees the world differently.

885
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,320
My father sees it through the dyehouse,

886
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,230
in all its vibrant colors.

887
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,280
My brother sees it through books,

888
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,080
in the span of history and eternity.

889
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,470
You can see it through a kite.

890
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,910
However far you want to see,

891
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,360
