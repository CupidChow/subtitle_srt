[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 31]

3
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,400
Alright.

4
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,720
Sheng Dalang is gone.

5
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,960
He's gone.

6
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,520
I knew this journey wouldn't be smooth.

7
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,280
I thought someone might get sick,

8
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,440
and someone might get hurt.

9
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,440
I believed that as long as we were careful enough

10
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
and well-prepared,

11
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,520
we could protect them.

12
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
But,

13
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,400
I never expected

14
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,880
to lose him so suddenly.

15
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
Not even a trace remains.

16
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,880
That was Sheng Dalang!

17
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,920
Alright.

18
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,120
Yang Jinglan,

19
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm scared.

20
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Should we turn back?

21
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,120
I don't want to see anyone else

22
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,240
get hurt.

23
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,040
Yingying,

24
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,920
everyone made their own choice

25
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,280
to come this far.

26
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,000
No one knows the ending at the beginning

27
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,640
of the story.

28
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
We are the leaders.

29
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,240
We've brought everyone this far.

30
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,840
If we

31
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,640
back down now,

32
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,600
how can we expect anyone to trust us

33
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,120
to lead them

34
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,800
through this trade route?

35
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Alright.

36
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,320
Can we do it?

37
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,440
We definitely can.

38
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,480
My brother and Yu...

39
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,280
Alright.

40
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,680
I know. I know everything.

41
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,520
Don't worry.

42
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,560
I promise I will bring them back

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,840
safe and sound.

44
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840
Okay?

45
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,720
Big brother.

46
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,120
It's her!

47
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,320
That woman

48
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,120
killed our third brother!

49
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,120
Today, I must cut her down!

50
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,040
Second brother, wait!

51
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,280
Who's that man?

52
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,080
He doesn't know martial arts.

53
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,800
He just followed us

54
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,520
when we caught the woman.

55
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,830
I also feel sad

56
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,430
about third brother's death.

57
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,030
But don't forget

58
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,110
what our purpose of this trip is.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,790
To make money!

60
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,600
How about this:

61
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,790
kill the woman

62
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,030
to avenge our brother.

63
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,680
Keep the man as a hostage.

64
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,640
If you kill her, you won't get a penny!

65
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,520
Why not?

66
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
Is she valuable?

67
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,030
Have you heard of the Yang Brocade from Yizhou?

68
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,630
This shipment belongs to the Yang family.

69
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,630
Big brother,

70
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,190
at the foot of the mountain,

71
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:37,990
we saw the carriage

72
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,270
indeed carried the Yang family flag.

73
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,590
The carriage is loaded with brocade.

74
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,630
Cut off one of his fingers,

75
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,230
take it down the mountain to exchange for the goods.

76
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,520
Then we'll see if it's real.

77
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,630
If you must cut, then cut my finger.

78
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,440
He's a brocade weaver.

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,230
If you cut his finger,

80
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,190
you might as well take his life!

81
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,230
No, cut mine!

82
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,630
They only recognize my hand.

83
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,190
Cut mine!

84
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,120
Report!

85
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,080
Boss, second boss,

86
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,440
a group is chasing us up the mountain.

87
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,440
They must be here to rescue these two.

88
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,830
How many?

89
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,720
Seven or eight.

90
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,390
The leader is the one with the highest martial skills.

91
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,030
The others are protecting the convoy.

92
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,470
It looks like they plan to camp in the valley.

93
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,470
Since they've come up the mountain,

94
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,390
we'll change our tactics.

95
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,200
Second brother,

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,640
take these two deep into the mountains.

97
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,080
Leave marks along the way.

98
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,670
Once they're far enough,

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,360
I'll take the guys

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,030
and surround the goods at the foot of the mountain.

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,040
Go!

102
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,000
Go.

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,840
Go!

104
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,080
These marks are too obvious.

105
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
They left them on purpose.

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,600
But why would the bandits do that?

107
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,640
General Niu.

108
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,240
Greetings, Your Excellency.

109
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,920
Your Excellency, you're so busy,

110
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,800
yet you still made time to meet with me.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,520
I am deeply grateful.

112
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,120
Enough.

113
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,840
I've planned a family dinner for today.

114
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,240
Let's skip the formalities.

115
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,080
Come,

116
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,680
Thank you.

117
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,080
Take a seat.

118
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
Start with the food.

119
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,040
Your Excellency, a few days ago in Yizhou...

120
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,880
I remember back when you were with me,

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,280
you loved this steamed shad dish.

122
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
It's hard to find in Yizhou.

123
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,640
I had it specially brought

124
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,400
from Qiantang.

125
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,880
Give it a try and see how it tastes.

126
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,880
Exquisite.

127
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
Your Excellency, you remembered me so well,

128
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
but I...

129
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,240
If you find it exquisite,

130
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,640
have more while it's still warm.

131
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,000
Once it cools,

132
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,280
it will become fishy.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Thank you, Your Excellency.

134
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Shad is delicious,

135
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,240
but it has many bones.

136
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,600
If you're too greedy

137
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,200
and swallow it whole,

138
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,320
you might choke on a bone.

139
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,640
When eating shad,

140
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,080
you must chew it slowly and carefully.

141
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,720
Some fish,

142
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,440
if left untouched,

143
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
won't cause you any trouble.

144
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,840
But

145
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,040
if you're too eager,

146
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,840
you may end up hurting yourself.

147
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,680
Don't you agree?

148
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,040
Your Excellency's advice

149
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
is something I will never forget.

150
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,880
Good.

151
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,720
Now, stand up.

152
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
Thank you.

153
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,800
Try this one too.

154
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,680
Come on.

155
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,560
Eat.

156
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,640
How does it taste?

157
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,240
Delicious.

158
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,080
General Niu, farewell.

159
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,720
General,

160
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,920
what do you think the Military Commissioner meant?

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,520
Inviting me to eat the fish I loved in my youth,

162
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
then warning me

163
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,400
not to choke on bones,

164
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,680
what do you think he meant?

165
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,040
Out of respect for old ties,

166
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,000
he's letting it go this time.

167
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,080
But if it happens again,

168
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,080
there will be no mercy.

169
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,240
So the Military Commissioner is still on your side.

170
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,240
That's because he doesn't yet know

171
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,440
that I'm dealing with the Prince Bai of Nanzhao.

172
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,200
Yang Jinglan will never let it slide.

173
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,400
If he uncovers anything,

174
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,320
the court will press charges.

175
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Mu Hui will be the first

176
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,640
to throw me under the bus.

177
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
When that happens,

178
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,600
we'll be at their mercy.

179
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,920
So what should we do?

180
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,840
To be honest, everything I have today is thanks

181
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,120
to Military Commissioner Mu.

182
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,400
But if that day does come...

183
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,240
This needs to be even sharper.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,520
I see our Imperial Uncle here

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,200
has been working all day long.

186
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,680
Sure enough, he's much steadier now.

187
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,200
So,

188
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,240
Only by facing life and death head-on

189
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,280
and taking life and death lightly

190
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,240
can one go far.

191
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,040
Are you trying to comfort me?

192
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,000
Ms. Ji, you're a talent worth cultivating.

193
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,480
I simply don't want to see your ambitions

194
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,080
wither along the way.

195
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,800
Ms. Ji,

196
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,240
this trap is so simple.

197
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,920
With so many bandits, will it work?

198
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Did you really only bring Chi Hu?

199
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,200
What do you mean by that?

200
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,080
Some of our people followed my husband up the mountain.

201
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,160
The ones left now

202
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,720
are not enough to deal with the bandits.

203
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,240
And you brought only one person.

204
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
So,

205
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,640
I have traps elsewhere.

206
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,240
As expected, you have a backup plan.

207
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,000
What use are those traps?

208
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,640
You will see in time.

209
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,480
May all things have spirits

210
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,960
and take my lifespan

211
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,960
to ensure Yingying's safety.

212
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,120
Second boss,

213
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,920
they've been sitting there the whole time.

214
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,120
We tried to startle them,

215
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,560
but they didn't move.

216
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,150
Brothers, grip your knives tightly.

217
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,120
If they charge at us,

218
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,910
take one down first

219
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,830
to set an example!

220
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,320
Kill him!

221
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,670
Yang Jinglan!

222
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,270
Yu!

223
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:20,840
Yaoting!

224
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,120
Let's go!

225
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,520
Go!

226
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,560
Where are they?

227
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,960
Boss, over there.

228
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,270
They've hidden in a cave.

229
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,680
They're hiding in the cave

230
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,150
and left the carriage here.

231
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,270
Is this an offer to trade the goods for their lives?

232
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,200
Then let's hurry and take the goods.

233
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,240
Wait.

234
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,480
Send two people down first to check.

235
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,480
You two, go scout it out.

236
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,120
Look.

237
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,630
Shh.

238
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,310
Gou!

239
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,150
Mao!

240
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:51,960
There really is an ambush.

241
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,750
What now?

242
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,870
Climb down the cliffside using ropes.

243
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,470
Yes, sir.

244
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,870
Go!

245
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,190
Yes!

246
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,590
Shisi,

247
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,870
I'll need your help later.

248
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:25,750
Tell me.

249
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,270
Get ready.

250
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,190
Drop the ropes!

251
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,120
Ms. Ji!

252
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,800
Boss!

253
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,590
They're coming out!

254
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,680
They found a trap near the carriage

255
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,190
and will think there are traps all around it.

256
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,560
Even though the goods are on the carriage,

257
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,120
they'll believe they've fallen into a trick.

258
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,750
Using the fake to defend the real.

259
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,080
A brilliant plan.

260
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,360
But you saw it too.

261
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,150
You planned to scare them with shadows,

262
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,870
and they didn't fall for it.

263
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,920
So what will you do next?

264
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,150
Fire the arrows!

265
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,510
Master!

266
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,800
Keep firing!

267
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,920
Fire the arrows!

268
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,310
My arm...

269
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,070
I thought

270
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,360
your chain traps

271
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,070
were meant for the bandits.

272
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,120
I didn't expect

273
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,800
they were prepared for me instead.

274
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,600
Since you're not being honest,

275
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,680
I have no choice but to take a gamble.

276
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,430
Yingying,

277
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,280
you guessed it right.

278
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,630
Chi Hu led a group

279
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:01,680
and killed all the bandits!

280
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,160
We are safe now.

281
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,830
Thank you, Mr. Bai, for your rescue.

282
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,160
You're welcome.

283
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,390
With this liquor,

284
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,720
we honor our fallen companions.

285
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,360
May they rest in peace

286
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,120
and watch over us.

287
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,430
Thank you all for believing in me and Jinglan,

288
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,190
drawing your swords to help us,

289
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,680
and fighting with all your might.

290
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,190
When we reach Tubo

291
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,040
and sell this brocade,

292
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,990
I'll treat everyone to drinks!

293
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,120
Thank you, Mr. Yang and Ms. Ji!

294
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,190
Everyone, rest well tonight.

295
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,360
Tomorrow,

296
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,240
let's move forward!

297
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,430
Understood!

298
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,400
Let me handle it.

299
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,960
These days,

300
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,360
you've worked so hard.

301
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
You should take a good rest too.

302
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,120
Easy, be very gentle.

303
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,760
Don't worry.

304
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,200
This medicine specializes in treating bumps and strains.

305
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,480
You'll be fine in a couple of days.

306
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,360
I've been thinking,

307
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,280
is it really useful for us to be here?

308
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,520
It's not that I can't endure hardship,

309
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,880
but look at my build, my frame,

310
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,000
and my timid nature,

311
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,280
can I really be of any help?

312
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,160
In this caravan,

313
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,520
everyone has different roles

314
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,600
to play.

315
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,920
The guards' skill

316
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,080
is to protect the goods.

317
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,480
We are merchants.

318
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,680
Our skill is to do good business

319
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,520
when we reach Tubo

320
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,680
and sell the goods.

321
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,520
So, it's not that we are incapable.

322
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,920
It's just that our moment hasn't come yet.

323
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,760
Impressive, Sheng Dalang.

324
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,040
Since when did you learn to talk like this?

325
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,920
What was that saying again?

326
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,160
"Part for three days..."

327
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,000
Something like that.

328
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,720
"Part for three days,

329
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,760
and you'll see them in a new light."

330
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,920
Yes!

331
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,880
"Part for three days,

332
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,560
and you'll see them in a new light!"

333
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,560
Easy.

334
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,840
Honestly, I have to thank you for this.

335
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,600
If it weren't for you,

336
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,520
I wouldn't have come this far,

337
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,160
seen all these things,

338
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,520
or said these words.

339
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,400
Why thank me?

340
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,520
I didn't do much.

341
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,480
Don't you remember? You taught me

342
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,800
to be brave and raise my hand,

343
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
to be brave and step forward.

344
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,520
So this time, I came out.

345
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,320
Exactly, be brave and raise your hand,

346
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,400
be brave and step forward.

347
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,440
Don't worry.

348
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,720
I'll take good care of everyone.

349
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,000
You definitely can.

350
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,720
Are you planning to keep carrying it?

351
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,280
Sheng Dalang died for me.

352
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,560
Yang Jinglan,

353
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,520
I'm just a worthless person.

354
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,560
I even promised Sheng Dalang to take care of everyone.

355
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,920
But now, not only did I fail to take care of everyone,

356
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,800
I also caused his death.

357
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,520
I shouldn't have come.

358
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,000
Joining this caravan

359
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,320
was your own choice.

360
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,360
If you want to leave now,

361
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,480
no one can stop you.

362
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,600
So,

363
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,320
you think I'm worthless too, don't you?

364
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,920
Sang Shisi,

365
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,280
the path we're on now

366
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,480
is one no one has walked before.

367
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,880
We must face all the hardships and dangers

368
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
along the way.

369
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,080
Whether good or bad,

370
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,920
we must fully accept them.

371
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,640
Besides,

372
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,360
you are the honorary president of Bloom Society.

373
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,720
Don't you think this caravan need you?

374
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,200
So, what should we do now?

375
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,520
By choosing this path,

376
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,360
you've already proven you're brave.

377
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,400
As for the road ahead,

378
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,960
only you can decide.

379
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,120
If you ever treat me badly,

380
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,720
I'll kill you.

381
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,680
I...

382
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,120
I'll definitely treat you well!

383
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll only treat you well!

384
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,520
I'll just treat you well.

385
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,320
I've faced death,

386
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,120
why should I fear loving again?

387
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,720
Master,

388
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,760
something's happened in Yizhou.

389
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,440
Should we

390
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,760
return earlier than planned?

391
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,480
By the time we return to Yizhou,

392
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,000
the craftsmen there will likely turn against us.

393
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,760
Chi Hu.

394
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,640
Here.

395
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,760
Prepare

396
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,360
a gift for me.

397
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,520
Understood.

398
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,560
Mr. Bai, you're not resting yet?

399
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,440
What a lovely night it is.

400
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,920
Oh,

401
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,920
Ms. Ji,

402
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,560
would you like to hear a story?

403
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,400
Once there was a child.

404
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,640
His mother

405
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,400
was taken by his father to be his wife.

406
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,920
She was always unhappy,

407
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,400
never smiling.

408
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
But

409
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,000
whenever she wore

410
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,480
the brocade garment

411
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,040
she brought from her hometown,

412
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,040
she would

413
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,600
light up with joy.

414
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,720
The child

415
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,760
wished for his mother to be happy every day.

416
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,920
So he begged his master

417
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,720
to bring more brocade garments

418
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,720
from her hometown.

419
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,720
He hoped that his own hometown

420
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,160
could be as full of brocade

421
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,040
as hers.

422
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,560
Only then

423
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,880
did he believe

424
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,200
she wouldn't miss her hometown

425
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,800
and would consider this place

426
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,560
her home.

427
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,760
I can understand that child.

428
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,760
But if that determination could be channeled for a good cause,

429
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,360
it wouldn't be a bad thing.

430
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,160
Alright,

431
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,360
no more stories.

432
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,080
Ms. Ji,

433
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,320
here

434
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,360
is a gift for you.

435
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,240
May you

436
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,560
find great success in your business.

437
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,640
Look...

438
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,920
These fireworks are different

439
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,360
from any I've seen before.

440
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,160
Yes,

441
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,200
I've never seen

442
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,320
fireworks like these either.

443
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,080
I was wondering where Mr. Bai had gone.

444
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,320
Turns out he was here

445
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,000
trying to charm my wife.

446
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,400
Every burst of fireworks says

447
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,880
I wishes to maintain

448
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,400
a lasting friendship with Ms. Ji.

449
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,560
If you could be sincere,

450
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,320
I, too, hope

451
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,040
you and my wife can maintain a lasting friendship.

452
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,240
Every word I say is from the heart,

453
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
honest and open.

454
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,560
There was a time I wanted to be friends with you.

455
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,040
But you refused me yourself.

456
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,560
Have you forgotten?

457
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,840
No matter when you're in trouble,

458
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,280
as long as it doesn't violate morality

459
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,400
or break the law,

460
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,960
I'm willing to help you through it.

461
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,200
That's my promise to a friend.

462
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,690
[Unyielding Resolve]

463
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,360
Alright. It's late.

464
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,560
I should head back.

465
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,440
Farewell.

466
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,400
I won't see you off.

467
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,360
Dear,

468
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,080
what do you think

469
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,600
those fireworks meant?

470
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,960
Whatever the intention,

471
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,080
if he dares to draw his dagger at the end,

472
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,640
we'll take decisive action.

473
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,640
General,

474
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,670
there's news from Yizhou City.

475
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,350
Yang Jinglan's men went to the Prince Bai's residence to arrest someone.

476
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,790
Afterward, they also detained a foreign merchant caravan.

477
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,360
Yang Jinglan's men?

478
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:30,080
Does his little Brocade Bureau have that many people?

479
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,150
And they dare to arrest foreign merchants?

480
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,950
It seems this is an order from Chang'an.

481
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,560
Does this mean...

482
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,400
Chang'an is really going to investigate thoroughly?

483
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,790
What was Governor Zhang's response

484
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,230
after Yang Jinglan made the arrests?

485
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,680
He shut his doors

486
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,600
and acted as if he knew nothing.

487
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,720
If Governor Zhang doesn't act,

488
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,470
it means the Military Commissioner doesn't want to intervene.

489
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,430
But if something happens,

490
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,640
would the Military Commissioner truly abandon us?

491
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,230
Good morning, Mr. Bai.

492
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,400
Why are you so proactive today?

493
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,470
This trip to Yizhou,

494
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,270
the greatest gain

495
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,710
for me has been

496
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,520
meeting you, Ms. Ji and Mr. Yang.

497
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,990
It's because of you two

498
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,710
that I have seen

499
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,830
the extraordinary people and beauty of Shu.

500
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
But all good things

501
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,270
must come to an end.

502
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,240
I must take my leave.

503
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,630
We're so close to Tubo now.

504
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,440
Wouldn't leaving at this moment

505
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,630
be a pity?

506
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,830
From here on,

507
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,600
you must continue the journey alone.

508
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,320
This place is close to my hometown.

509
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,070
I miss home

510
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,270
and want to go back for a visit.

511
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,630
Ms. Ji, once you return from Tubo,

512
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,630
I'll host a celebration for you here.

513
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,400
Mr. Bai, I'm afraid you won't be able to return home.

514
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,600
A letter arrived from Yizhou yesterday,

515
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,440
claiming that a foreign merchant dared to collude

516
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,320
with Yizhou officials to smuggle tribute brocade for years.

517
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,440
This year, it escalated.

518
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,230
They even dared to steal confidential pattern designs from various families

519
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,230
and smuggle them to Nanzhao.

520
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,160
It was said

521
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,600
that all of this was planned by you.

522
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,350
Mr. Bai,

523
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:32,190
I have no choice but to detain you temporarily.

524
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,760
Let's not discuss

525
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,070
whether there's a misunderstanding.

526
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,070
You're an official of Yizhou.

527
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,040
You have no authority over the people of Nanzhao.

528
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,070
Anyone doing business in Tang

529
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,600
must follow Tang laws.

530
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,190
Guards!

531
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,440
Detain Mr. Bai temporarily.

532
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,040
Yang Jinglan,

533
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,120
stop being rude!

534
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,720
We warmly welcome Prince Bai back to Nanzhao!

535
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,190
Prince?

536
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,560
Do you need me

537
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,000
to show you my credentials and token?

538
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,190
No need.

539
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,230
I never intended to hide my identity.

540
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,120
It's just that this identity

541
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,630
makes it inconvenient to act in Yizhou.

542
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,600
Ms. Ji,

543
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,280
shall we reintroduce ourselves?

544
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,910
I am Sheng Fengze, the Prince Bai of Nanzhao.

545
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,840
Since you're the Prince Bai of Nanzhao,

546
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,040
then this is all the more convenient.

547
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,040
Along with yesterday's letter from Yizhou,

548
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,840
there was also an edict from Chang'an.

549
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,440
We respectfully invite Prince Bai to meet the Emperor in Chang'an.

550
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,440
What if I don't want to go?

551
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,000
I believe the Emperor of Tang

552
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,510
wouldn't force you to compel me.

553
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,230
Not going is fine.

554
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,720
But those foreign merchants' testimonies

555
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,320
will all be handed over to the King of Nanzhao.

556
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:27,920
I'm confident the King of Nanzhao

557
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,120
will provide Tang with a reasonable explanation.

558
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,710
The people of Nanzhao all know

559
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,030
that I am unwell,

560
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,190
resting in my residence,

561
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,630
yet you claim to have seen me in Yizhou.

562
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,480
Tell me,

563
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,830
could someone be impersonating me?

564
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,880
All the more reason to go to Chang'an

565
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,630
and verify your identity.

566
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,640
Instead,

567
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,320
Mr. Bai,

568
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,840
no,

569
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,400
Prince Bai,

570
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,120
why not make a deal with us?

571
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,720
Dear,

572
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,480
you're trying to get blood from a stone.

573
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,840
Fine.

574
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,640
I was thinking the same thing.

575
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,000
I do enjoy doing business with you, Ms. Ji.

576
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,000
Mr. Bai, may I have a word with you?

577
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,640
Now that you refuse to go to Chang'an

578
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,560
and my husband refuses to let you return to Nanzhao,

579
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,800
rather than this stalemate,

580
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,840
which could lead to fight

581
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:41,760
and mutual destruction,

582
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,920
why not take a step back?

583
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,240
Yingying!

584
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,400
Yang Jinglan,

585
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,960
I don't want to see

586
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,600
anyone else get hurt.

587
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,640
By holding this stalemate,

588
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,200
you're just waiting for the people from Chang'an

589
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,160
to join you

590
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,920
in a life-or-death fight against them.

591
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,960
But have you thought about the caravan members?

592
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,160
What about them?

593
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,920
With Prince Bai's indifference,

594
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,360
how could he care about their lives?

595
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,960
It seems Ms. Ji truly understands me.

596
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,160
But Prince Bai,

597
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,560
you also understand my husband well.

598
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,200
When he charged back into Yizhou alone, cutting down foes,

599
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,360
it was ruthless.

600
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,840
If you push him too hard,

601
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,400
no matter how many people you have,

602
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,960
he could justify killing you

603
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,720
as an accident during duty.

604
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,400
Ms. Ji,

605
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,680
you have laid it all out plainly.

606
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,000
If I'm not mistaken,

607
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,360
the next topic should be

608
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,120
about mutually beneficial cooperation.

609
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,160
We crossed paths with you

610
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,400
because we were investigating Niu Jin.

611
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,680
I believe your collaboration with Niu Jin

612
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,000
is purely for profit,

613
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,040
not out of genuine friendship.

614
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,720
You suddenly bring up

615
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,120
General Niu,

616
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,160
but there is no bond

617
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,760
between me and General Niu.

618
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,360
If I offer you greater benefits,

619
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,560
would you be willing to make some sacrifices?

620
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,240
I'd like to hear

621
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,560
what these benefits are.

622
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,640
Ji Yingying,

623
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,840
do you intend to let him go

624
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,520
and only capture Niu Jin?

625
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,760
We both know

626
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,120
what kind of person he is.

627
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:42,880
Today,

628
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,320
if we collude with him,

629
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,760
we'll be stained forever!

630
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,200
But what good does capturing him do?

631
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,040
Would the Tang authority

632
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,760
punish a Nanzhao prince

633
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,400
over a trivial tribute brocade smuggling case?

634
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,960
Unafraid of power,

635
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,000
determined to uncover the truth,

636
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,600
and never compromising.

637
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,240
Have you forgotten all of this?

638
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,360
I haven't forgotten!

639
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,960
I'm just scared.

640
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm afraid of more people getting hurt,

641
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
more incidents happening.

642
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,800
I can't wait any longer.

643
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
For revenge,

644
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,560
I endured for nine years.

645
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,040
A whole nine years.

646
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,760
But now Niu Jin is watching us,

647
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,400
ready to strike at any moment.

648
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,600
I can't endure it any longer.

649
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,760
This is the best choice after weighing all the pros and cons.

650
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,640
Yang Jinglan,

651
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,640
this time, listen to me, alright?

652
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,960
Yang Jinglan!

653
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,880
Please, I beg you.

654
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,440
Sheng Fengze,

655
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,480
if you admit

656
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,200
that Niu Jin smuggled tribute brocade to Nanzhao,

657
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,960
I can tell the court

658
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,960
that you were deceived by Niu Jin.

659
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,320
As for the testimonies from those merchants,

660
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,840
I'll leave it to you to handle.

661
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,400
Mr. Yang,

662
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,960
I know you're resourceful.

663
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,840
If you go back on your word,

664
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,040
where could I possibly seek justice?

665
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,040
We Tang people keep our word.

666
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:23,840
Alright.

667
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,160
Since this is a deal,

668
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,160
there should be some guarantee, right?

669
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,040
What do you want?

670
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,760
Mr. Yang goes to Chang'an to negotiate,

671
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,720
and I accompany Ji Yingying to Tubo.

672
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,560
Then I'll bring Ji Yingying

673
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,800
to visit Nanzhao as a guest.

674
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,200
You're dreaming.

675
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,440
You can come for her

676
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,240
after you've killed Niu Jin and fulfill your vengeance!

677
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,480
I know

678
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,040
you're highly skilled in martial arts.

679
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,000
Mr. Yang, tell me,

680
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,720
can the caravan members

681
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,560
avoid those crossbows?

682
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Ms. Ji said something

683
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,840
I liked very much.

684
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,160
She said that in business,

685
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,560
we must learn to trust each other

686
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,360
and make mutual concessions.

687
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,920
What do you think?

688
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,720
Alright.

689
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,320
Mutual concessions.

690
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
If you admit it,

691
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,240
then I agree to your terms.

692
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,320
I never thought

693
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,440
you could be so straightforward.

694
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,600
Fine.

695
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,000
Then today,

696
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,200
I will also be straightforward.

697
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,800
I admit to smuggling

698
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,920
tribute brocade with Niu Jin.

699
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:00,760
Alright.

700
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,320
Since we've all heard it,

701
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,880
come out now!

702
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,480
Yang Jinglan,

703
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,920
I've brought the people you wanted.

704
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,120
When we get to Chang'an, I'll buy you a drink!

705
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,600
Come on,

706
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,760
show Prince Bai your identities!

707
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,440
Ministry of Personnel Guard, Zhang Tingyan.

708
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,520
Ministry of War Guard, Zhao Xun.

709
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,520
Ministry of Justice Guard, He Dapeng.

710
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,680
Ministry of Revenue Guard, Wang Zhaofang.

711
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,400
Ministry of Works Guard, Wu Xinfei.

712
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,640
Imperial Qianniu Guard, Zhao Meng.

713
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,560
We respectfully invite Prince Bai to Chang'an!

714
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,840
Too bad they came at a bad time.

715
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,120
Everything you just said

716
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,600
was heard by they all.

717
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,000
That means the court of Tang

718
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,280
is now fully aware.

719
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,280
Sheng Fengze,

720
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,600
not all evidence

721
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,640
needs to be written down.

722
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,480
Prince Bai,

723
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,840
please.

724
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,880
We respectfully invite Prince Bai to Chang'an!

725
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,360
It seems

726
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,120
I'll have to make the trip to Chang'an after all.

727
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,160
