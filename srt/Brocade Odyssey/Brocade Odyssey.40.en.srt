206
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,880
we, the insignificant, will unite

207
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,960
and take on enemies much larger than us.

208

Your mistake started

209
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,560
when you decided to trample on the brocade industry.

210

Today,

211
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,600
I will use the Shu brocade

212
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,440

230
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,440
and plotted against the three brocade officers of Yizhou

231
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,400
and the military commissioner, Mu Hui.

232
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,680
You also massacred the people of Yizhou!

233
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
According to the law,

234
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,920
you should be executed!

235
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,360
I am the military commissioner of Yizhou.

236
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,920
Even if I am guilty,

237
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
the Emperor should be the one to pass judgment,

238
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,160
not someone

239
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,360

You are all my men.

Xue Yu might let others off,

247
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,880
but he will never have mercy on any of you.

248
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,080
Since there is no escaping death,

249
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,680
why not drag someone else along?

250

It is better to rely on yourself rather than others.

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,320
Cherish her.

384
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,360
You see,

385
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,760
giving up your position as the brocade officer

386
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,600
so suddenly was a bold choice.

387
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Your brothers

388
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,040
and I have discussed it.

389
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,320
They are willing

390
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
to give you a share of their shops.

391
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,320
And I

392
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,760
will teach you how to run the business myself.

393
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,880
Are you going to teach him?

394
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,720
Why? Do you think I cannot do it?

395
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,040
I have accomplished a lot in my day!

396
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Father,

397
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,840
it is not that.

398
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,520
But if you are the one teaching me business,

399
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,080
I might as well not do it at all.

400
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,240
What kind of talk is that?

401
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,600
If you do not work, how will you support yourself?

402
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,160
My wife is one of the most renowned figures

403
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,920
in Yizhou's business world.

404
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,520
All I need to do is be the perfect husband to support her.

405
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,560
Did you hear that?

406
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,440
He could even say that!

407
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,400
This...!

408
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,120
You are young but idle

409
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,240
and want to live off Yingying's success!

410
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,240
Father,

411
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,440
like father, like son!

412
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,320
Besides,

413
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,280
has Mother not taken care of you

414
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,800
so well all these years?

415
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,160
You are something!

416
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,320
You...!

417
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,920
You ungrateful son!

418
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:20,760
Stop!

419
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,560
You did not notice me working,

420
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,800
but you are quick to catch me enjoying life.

421
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,480
Father, just wait until after his wedding.

422
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,000
Mother,

423
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,760
tell us who is right here.

424
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,440
You are still too green

425
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,240
to compare yourself to me!

426
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,880
That is enough. Stop bickering.

427
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,080
You are both grown men.

428
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,000
Do not ruin Jinglan's wedding robes!

429
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,200
Once the wedding is over,

430
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,440
I will teach you a lesson!

431
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,640
Yes, do it!

432
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,440
Pin,

433
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,200
can we deliver the Pearl and Peony Brocade

434
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,160
and the Round Flower and Bird Brocade for the Zhang family

435
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,040
by the end of the month?

436
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,400
Yes. I have got it.

437
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,360
The Zhao family needs to settle their balance by the end of the month.

438
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,990
Do not worry. I will handle it.

439
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:09,560
One more thing.

440
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,400
The shipment of brocade for Tubo

441
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,400
and the Rippling Grain Brocade for Nanzhao

442
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,360
due on the 15th day

443
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,800
are important orders.

444
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,080
There cannot be any mistakes.

445
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,470
All right.

446
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,200
Just think about trying on your wedding robes today.

447
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,950
Are you worried

448
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,990
to leave the business to us?

449
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,840
I am not.

450
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,600
Ms. Ji.

451
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:30,880
Gui.

452
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,800
You have been so occupied that you have hardly eaten.

453
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,760
That is not good for you.

454
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,600
Look at what I brought.

455
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Glutinous rice cakes!

456
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,160
Thank you, Gui.

457
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,160
Have a little, at least.

458
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,950
All right.

459
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,470
How did you know I was hungry?

460
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,600
Where is my mother?

461
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Mrs. Ji is busy preparing your wedding trousseau at home.

462
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:52,760
You look nice.

463
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,600
Have some, Pin.

464
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,000
You must be starving.

465
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,960
It is delicious.

466
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,400
Very delicious.

467
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,640
Yingying!

468
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,760
Yaoting?

469
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,840
Look at this.

470
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,240
Do you like it?

471
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,440
This is something

472
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,280
Yuniang prepared for you a while ago.

473
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,680
She said you like lively things,

474
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,320
something that makes you happy just by looking at it.

475
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
I love it.

476
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,560
What are you doing?

477
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,720
Are they not beautiful?

478
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,280
I am letting them enjoy some sunshine.

479
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,520
They are not flowers or plants.

480
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,760
Why would they need sunshine?

481
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,120
They will be damaged.

482
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,600
No.

483
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,720
They told me they are happy.

484
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,680
But they told me they are upset.

485
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,440
They want to go back to lying in their box.

486
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Can you say something nice?

487
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,680
Otherwise, keep your mouth shut!

488
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,600
It is unbearable hearing him

489
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,840
say those lines.

490
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,240
I know. It is so strange.

491
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,800
I feel the same way.

492
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,840
The two definitely have something going on.

493
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,040
How can you tell?

494
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,880
How could I not?

495
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,160
I am only a month away

496
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,480
from becoming an old man myself.

497
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,280
Back in the day, my wife and I were just like them...

498
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,480
Why am I telling you this?

499
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,440
Hurry up!

500
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,960
Off to lessons!

501
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,000
Go to your lessons! Hurry!

502
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,840
Go! Off to lessons with you!

503
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,360
Go!

504
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,520
Honestly,

505
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,360
you are following him around all day.

506
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,560
He has been such a bad influence on you!

507
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,840
Wait a moment!

508
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,200
What does this have to do with me?

509
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,840
Pin, he is blaming me again!

510
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,520
Are you not going to deal with him?

511
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,400
Pin might control you,

512
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,320
but not me!

513
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:03,880
I...!

514
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,280
What does becoming an old man mean?

515
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,760
It means becoming a father.

516
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,320
Are you going to be a father?

517
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,080
What is he doing here?

518
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,200
Why is he already in his wedding robes?

519
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,000
Did they change the date?

520
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,480
Let us go see!

521
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,320
He...!

522
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:17,840
Yingying!

523
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,320
Why is he...

524
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,320
Why are you here?

525
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
You are not supposed to see each other before the wedding!

526
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,480
This is not your first time.

527
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,440
Why are you in a rush?

528
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,400
I know, Yaoting.

529
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,240
Something major is happening.

530
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,520
My senior is here.

531
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,520
The crown prince?

532
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,200
Isn't your senior the crown prince?

533
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,680
Is the crown prince here?

534
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,840
Greetings, Your Highness!

535
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,080
Please rise. Spare the formalities.

536
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

537
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,080
But this requires kneeling.

538
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,320
Hereby decreed,

539
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,880
Ji Yingying of Sandaoyan,

540
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,880
for her contribution to the brocade industry,

541
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,440
[Imperial Decree]
which has educated and united foreign lands,

542
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,720
and for opening trade routes

543
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,960
that foster peace and goodwill among neighboring regions,

544
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,600
is to be honored with the title of Lady of Silk.

545
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,640
You are to oversee Yizhou's brocade industry with the brocade officer

546
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,480
and open all the trade routes.

547
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,240
You are to depart tomorrow for the capital to meet the Emperor.

548
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
The decree ends.

549
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,160
I accept the decree.

550
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,960
Thank you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Your Highness.

551
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,040
Tomorrow?

552
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,120
But their wedding is tomorrow!

553
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,560
That is right!

554
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,840
Let us pick another day.

555
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,360
A lifetime together as husband and wife

556
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,720
is such a blessing.

557
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,440
I wish to help you soar.

558
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,720
I wish to help you achieve all you desire.

559
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,440
You do not need to wait.

560
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,360
Jinglan, since I am here today,

561
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,120
let us have

562
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,720
the wedding now.

563
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,440
I will serve as your witness.

564
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,000
Today?

565
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,920
But Mother is unaware!

566
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
And nothing is prepared!

567
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,560
I will go and set up the venue!

568
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,560
I will invite the guests!

569
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,080
The guests!

570
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,520
