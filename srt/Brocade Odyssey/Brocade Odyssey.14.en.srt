[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,360
This is called not learning your lesson until it is too late.

4
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,080
General, do not forget.

5
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,270
The military commissioner just issued an order.

6
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,590
Ms. Ji must dye Shu Red Silk and weave tribute brocade.

7
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,190
To possess such a skill is to invite misfortune.

8
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,510
Ms. Ji's impressive talent

9
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,000
will attract envy.

10
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,590
Her family could be wiped out.

11
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,720
As much as I pity that,

12
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,880
there is nothing

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,470
I can do to help.

14
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:13,960
Mr. Yang?

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,750
Mr. Yang,

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,720
I have no interest in listening to nonsense.

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,110
So

18
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,550
think carefully

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,320
before answering me.

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,320
I came to Yizhou

21
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,830
not to target you, General,

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,470
but to restore order in the brocade industry.

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,830
I will investigate

24
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,670
whoever that stands in my way.

25
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,080
Behind me stands

26
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,670
all the imperial officers who still have a shred of conscience.

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:08,830
Yingying?

28
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,000
Yingying!

29
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Yaoting?

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,520
Yaoting!

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,160
General!

32
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,550
You scoundrel!

33
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,320
Who gave the order to use force?

34
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,720
Are you trying to draw even more attention from the military commissioner?

35
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
He is not one of us.

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,240
What?

37
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,470
It is me.

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,520
Master Gao?

39
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,030
I came on Mr. Yang's orders.

40
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,390
Please cooperate with me, Ms. Ji.

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,470
Just act your part.

42
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,470
I will follow your lead.

43
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,160
Chief Sang's men have arrived!

44
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,110
I must leave now.

45
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,000
Wait!

46
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,750
Ms. Ji,

47
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,240
you!

48
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
Since this is all an act,

49
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,750
let's make it convincing.

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
Do not even think about hurting my sister!

51
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Yaoting!

52
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,600
To those inside, listen!

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,190
Chief Sang is here!

54
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,510
Yingying?

55
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,320
Yingying!

56
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:18,230
Yingying?

57
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,790
Yaoting.

58
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,950
What happened?

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,350
How did you get hurt?

60
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,480
Ms. Ji, this...

61
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,070
Gui, quickly fetch a doctor!

62
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,070
- Hurry up! - No need.

63
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,550
No need!

64
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,670
Gui, Mother,

65
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,640
I am fine.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,200
But you are bleeding!

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,350
How can you say you are fine?

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,230
You...

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,480
It is just a small cut.

70
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,160
Find a reliable physician

71
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,600
but tell them to make it sound worse than it is.

72
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,350
Open the door immediately!

73
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,790
Chief Sang.

74
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,880
Where is the assassin?

75
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,950
He is gone.

76
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,830
Search the area!

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,950
Yes, sir!

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,950
Report!

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,040
Chief Sang, we found this token.

80
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,790
[Niu]

81
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,670
You punk!

82
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,790
Do not harm me!

83
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,720
I would not dream of it.

84
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,160
This could be a great merit.

85
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,320
This...

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,790
General Niu, Governor Zhang,

87
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,390
it is my fault

88
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,230
for troubling both of you.

89
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,950
You are here as well, Mr. Yang. What a coincidence.

90
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
Not quite.

91
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,160
But the Ji family is no ordinary household.

92
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,510
Ms. Ji

93
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,160
shoulders the irreplaceable task of weaving the tribute brocade.

94
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,510
As the brocade officer,

95
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,790
it is my duty to give them more attention.

96
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,110
It is just an ordinary silk merchant

97
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,390
attacked by robbers.

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,790
Surely that does not warrant troubling Governor Zhang.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,760
Normally, no.

100
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,550
And certainly not enough to disturb you, General.

101
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,830
But during Chief Sang's search,

102
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,950
the thief left behind something curious.

103
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,760
Perhaps,

104
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,550
you would like to take a look, General?

105
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,770
[Niu]

106
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,350
My token?

107
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,200
This thief is truly despicable

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,160
to dare steal my token!

109
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,760
Very well.

110
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,350
So, Chief Sang,

111
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,480
are you implying

112
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,790
that I intended to kill Ms. Ji?

113
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
I would not dare.

114
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,510
But the token...

115
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,760
The token was clearly planted by someone seeking to frame you, General Niu.

116
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,640
General Niu and I were in the tavern the entire time,

117
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,480
I can vouch

118
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,640
it is certainly not the work of General Niu.

119
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,510
Moreover,

120
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,790
if he truly intended harm,

121
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,830
he would not risk exposure,

122
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,320
nor would he carry anything

123
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,320
that could reveal his identity.

124
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:40,920
Therefore,

125
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,350
I believe

126
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,510
that this must be a deliberate attempt to slander the general.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,110
In that case,

128
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,760
why trouble the general with this matter, Mr. Yang?

129
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,110
May I say something, Governor Zhang?

130
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,110
Mr. Yang's intentions are only to protect the general's reputation.

131
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,110
Surely, you know

132
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,350
that the general's beloved daughter

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,510
is marrying my former betrothed.

134
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,790
Additionally, I have successfully dyed Shu Red Silk.

135
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,760
It is a feat

136
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,200
that has forced the general's son-in-law

137
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,040
to show Zhao Red Silk.

138
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,160
To the public,

139
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
it would seem perfectly reasonable

140
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,320
for you to harbor a grudge against me

141
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,350
and wish me harm, general.

142
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,510
This situation has provided the perfect opportunity

143
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,550
for someone to exploit it and stir trouble.

144
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,950
If we ignore this now

145
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,350
and take no action,

146
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,920
I fear

147
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,440
it may escalate,

148
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,910
and bring harm to the general rather than benefits.

149
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,880
Ms. Ji, your reasoning is sound.

150
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,400
But

151
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,350
my conduct is upright and beyond reproach.

152
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,590
I am not afraid of rumors.

153
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,840
If she were an ordinary woman, it would not matter.

154
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,350
But now the tribute brocade depends on her.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,350
If something were to happen to her,

156
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,550
the tribute brocade would not be completed.

157
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,350
It might implicate a general as well.

158
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,710
The imperial court

159
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,230
would send investigators.

160
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,150
General, your conduct is indeed upright and beyond reproach.

161
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,440
But how many others in Yizhou

162
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,320
can withstand such scrutiny?

163
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,440
What is your brilliant solution to this, Mr. Yang?

164
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,550
Governor Zhang,

165
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:29,840
since someone dared to impersonate General Niu

166
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,400
to assassinate Ms. Ji,

167
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:34,150
why not turn the tables?

168
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,550
Let General Niu personally protect Ms. Ji.

169
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,590
First, the general's wisdom and valor are unmatched,

170
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,960
ensuring her safety.

171
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,000
Second, as long as Ms. Ji remains unharmed,

172
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,640
the rumors

173
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,590
will naturally fade away on their own.

174
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,520
What does Ms. Ji's safety

175
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,910
have to do with me?

176
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,790
Besides,

177
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,350
the city's defense

178
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,440
fall under Governor Zhang's jurisdiction.

179
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,760
That is true.

180
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,760
In that case, Ms. Ji,

181
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,640
I will need you to follow me to the military camp.

182
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,760
We will present

183
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,400
this wound and token

184
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,520
to the military commissioner

185
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,790
and have him properly investigate the matter,

186
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,590
clearing your name.

187
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,520
Very well.

188
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,910
If I have the opportunity to meet the military commissioner,

189
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,710
I will gladly tell him

190
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,840
everything I know.

191
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,350
Why are we dragging the military commissioner into this?

192
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,840
How tiresome.

193
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,150
Fine.

194
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,200
Mr. Yang, Ms. Ji, you can trust me.

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,550
Though my duty is to guard the frontier,

196
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,710
I may not be able to deploy troops to protect you.

197
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,440
But I will not allow Ms. Ji

198
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,230
to fall victim to these vile schemes.

199
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:45,030
How about that?

200
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,960
Hurry up and thank General Niu.

201
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,440
Thank you, General Niu!

202
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,150
No need. It is a minor matter.

203
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,960
Thank you.

204
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,470
Ms. Niu,

205
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,400
are you all right?

206
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,200
It is nothing.

207
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,910
After so many years, I have grown used to it.

208
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,320
If I had not been held captive in the mountains,

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,520
you would not have gone there either.

210
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,470
The matters of the brocade workshop could not be hidden forever.

211
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,710
Even without you,

212
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,710
Yang Jinglan would have found another way

213
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,710
to lure me to the mountains.

214
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,400
You should not blame yourself.

215
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,110
But Ms. Niu,

216
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,350
you have suffered so much

217
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,320
and endured so much hardships.

218
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,670
It was so difficult to get to where you are today.

219
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,080
How could I not blame myself?

220
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,110
But if it were not for you,

221
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,150
who would have supported me

222
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,710
to this day?

223
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,590
I made a promise

224
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,910
on the day you saved me.

225
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,710
I am not a maid of the Niu household,

226
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,280
but I am

227
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,910
your maid, Ms. Niu.

228
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,960
I do not believe in fate.

229
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,910
I refuse to be a man's accessory.

230
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,520
I will live my own life.

231
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,760
Ms. Niu,

232
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,200
I will stand by your side.

233
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,200
Why are you here?

234
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,590
You promised me.

235
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,550
As long as I stayed away from her,

236
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,760
you would keep her safe.

237
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,030
But today, she almost died in the mountains!

238
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
Did she die?

239
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,440
Not only is she alive,

240
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,150
but she has also received support

241
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,400
from the military commissioner.

242
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,200
Now,

243
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,350
the two of you will work together to weave the tribute brocade.

244
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:30,790
Looking at it this way,

245
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,880
should you not be thanking me?

246
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,400
Going back on your word

247
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,150
and twisting facts.

248
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,080
Conducting business this way will get you nowhere.

249
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,790
My dear, have you forgotten?

250
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,200
The decisions on

251
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,080
whether this deal is made,

252
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,910
and how this deal is made

253
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,590
have always been mine to take.

254
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,080
You have been crying.

255
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,200
The wind in the mountains is harsh.

256
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,960
Dust in my eyes, that is all.

257
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,790
Is it dust in your eyes

258
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,200
or the sting of complete defeat?

259
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,670
My dear,

260
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,840
if I lose,

261
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,590
I can simply start over.

262
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,670
But you?

263
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,670
You hold no pieces.

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,760
You cannot even make it to the chessboard.

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,280
In the end,

266
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,030
I will always be the one moving the pieces.

267
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,350
Is that not right?

268
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,760
Mr. Yang, you found an excuse to keep my brother and mother away.

269
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,790
Is there something you want to tell me?

270
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,230
Did I guess wrong?

271
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
You had Gao Fang impersonate an assassin from the Niu family.

272
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,200
Isn't that to strike first

273
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
and make Niu Jin hesitate to harm me again?

274
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
You guessed it right.

275
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,640
But in my plan,

276
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,350
there was no part where you risked your life

277
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,960
and got yourself stabbed, Ms. Ji.

278
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,760
I was just worried they would turn the tables,

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,400
and accuse us of being the ones crying thief.

280
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,150
I wanted to make the act more convincing.

281
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,030
The physician did say I am fine.

282
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,840
I told you I would protect you.

283
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,790
You promised to trust me.

284
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,760
I did trust you.

285
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
That is why I played along.

286
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,280
Guo Kui, go back!

287
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,760
Why do you come out again?

288
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,960
Next time, I will be more careful.

289
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,230
Besides,

290
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,150
I have you to back me up.

291
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,110
Niu Jin

292
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,760
would not dare harm you directly for now.

293
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
I fear

294
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,150
the day the tribute brocade is completed

295
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,080
might be the day danger resurfaces.

296
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,470
I am not afraid. You will protect me, Mr. Yang.

297
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,080
Bold words.

298
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,760
Even Guo Kui cannot just wander in wherever he likes.

299
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,400
Niu Jin's hesitation today was purely circumstantial.

300
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,200
So, the more valuable the stakes, the less likely he is to act rashly?

301
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,000
What are you planning now?

302
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,000
I only know business.

303
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,590
If I can dye Shu Red Silk

304
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,280
and weave the most unique brocade in the world,

305
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,840
I can become Brocade Master,

306
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,790
a royal merchant,

307
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
be the golden goose that no one would dare to touch.

308
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,280
If Niu Jin ever plans to harm me again,

309
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,640
he will have to think twice.

310
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,080
Wait a moment.

311
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,070
These are the records of everyone in my family

312
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,880
who could enter the brocade workshop and dyehouse back then,

313
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,190
as well as the workers involved in transporting the tribute brocade

314
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,470
and liaising with Brocade Bureau.

315
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,040
I also have

316
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,800
the names of the former brocade officer, Liu Chongshan,

317
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,430
and his guards.

318
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,680
But I do not know

319
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,560
the names of the logistics officer who killed my father

320
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,430
and the soldiers involved in the handovers.

321
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,920
If your master

322
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,640
truly investigated my father's case,

323
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,680
perhaps these could help you find the clues

324
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,830
you are looking for.

325
00:17:59,070 --> 00:17:59,880
Yang Jinglan,

326
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,230
I am entrusting my father's case

327
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,190
to you.

328
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,640
After all these years,

329
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,520
you still remember

330
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,950
all these names?

331
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,280
Some things...

332
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,710
Ji Guinan,

333
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,350
passing off inferior goods as tribute,

334
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,310
deceiving the emperor,

335
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,880
and resisting arrest...

336
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
It cannot be forgotten, no matter how long it has been.

337
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,310
He will be executed immediately.

338
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,590
Confiscate all the assets

339
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,070
of the Ji family.

340
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,110
Search the premises!

341
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,190
Yes, sir!

342
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:48,590
Mrs. Ji,

343
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,830
Zhao Xiuyuan is waiting at the entrance.

344
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,470
He says he wishes to discuss the weaving of the tribute brocade with Ms. Ji.

345
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,310
Go back!

346
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,040
Sit down.

347
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,880
Though we have past grievances,

348
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,160
this is official business

349
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,070
and cannot be delayed.

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
Mr. Yang, my daughter is gravely injured.

351
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,470
Is it truly necessary to rush the tribute brocade in these two days?

352
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:24,070
No, it is not urgent.

353
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Not only is there no rush,

354
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,470
there is also no need for Ms. Ji to be involved in this matter at all.

355
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,110
For the weaving of tribute brocade,

356
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,160
Ms. Ji only needs to dye Shu Red Silk

357
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,590
according to the quantities

358
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,470
provided by Master Zhao.

359
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,830
Once completed, the silk will be delivered to Brocade Bureau

360
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,950
for verification, and then handed over to Master Zhao.

361
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,280
Ms. Ji, you are to stay here and recover.

362
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,350
You cannot go anywhere.

363
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,880
I will go explain it to him myself.

364
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,880
Mr. Yang,

365
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,880
do not forget what I entrusted you with.

366
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,310
Do not worry.

367
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,070
Mother,

368
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,920
I...

369
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,800
Focus on getting better.

370
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,590
The rest can wait for another day.

371
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,470
I will inform Bloom Society

372
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,830
that you have caught a cold

373
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,760
and are resting at home.

374
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,280
They can focus on dyeing silk

375
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,160
without worrying.

376
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,640
Come now, rest.

377
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,950
Get some rest.

378
