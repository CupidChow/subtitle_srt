00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,000
It is only right to apologize

4
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,360
when you are at fault.

5
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,400
You don't have to dwell on it, Mr. Yang.

6
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,280
I lived in Yizhou for over ten years.

7
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,760
I am used to it.

8
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,200
Mr. Yang, if you truly regret your actions,

9
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,000
you should treat the Ji family

10
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,960
more favorably moving forward.

11
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,560
I'd better hurry back to dye the silk.

12
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,400
Wait a minute.

13
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,600
Since I'm here to apologize,

14
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,240
I must show some sincerity.

15
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,560
What is this?

16
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,160
There is nothing on it.

17
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,920
What is this?

18
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,320
A gift from you?

19
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,120
What kind of dye did you use?

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,520
How could you tell I used dye?

21
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,960
Well, I wouldn't be bothered

22
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,120
if you showed me something else.

23
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,760
So, do you want a favor,

24
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,480
or do you want this instead?

25
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
Why are you

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,560
so insincere?

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,520
If you're going to apologize, then do it properly!

28
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,560
Why are you making her choose?

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,600
You're right, Linglong.

30
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
Let's hurry.

31
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,800
Yingying said this is the first order for Bloom Society.

32
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
We need to make sure it gets delivered on time!

33
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,840
Mr. Jiang,

34
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,520
your wife

35
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,280
just called you home for dinner.

36
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,680
Alas, don't rush me!

37
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,240
Good work takes time!

38
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
It's time for some flower cookies.

39
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,640
Ms. Ji,

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
my madam requested to meet you.

41
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,440
Your madam is...?

42
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,840
The daughter of General Niu,

43
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,960
Ms. Niu.

44
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,960
I've never had any dealings with your madam.

45
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,160
Why would she want to meet me?

46
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,200
My madam saw the velvet flowers

47
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,360
you presented at the Splendor Showcase,

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,320
and she adored them.

49
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
She is asking

50
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,440
if you could replicate them

51
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
using the flowers she grows.

52
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
Can you... accept the order?

53
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,360
Well...

54
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll have to take a look at the flowers first.

55
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,320
After them!

56
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,160
Yes, sir!

57
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:37,920
What happened?

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
As per your orders,

59
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,960
we had been scouting the cave for days.

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,400
Nothing happened at all.

61
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,000
But a group of people suddenly showed up

62
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,960
today and ambushed us.

63
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,960
[The Niu Residence]

64
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Ms. Niu,

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
Ms. Ji has arrived.

66
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
Greetings, Ms. Niu.

67
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,160
Ms. Ji,

68
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,800
it's good to see you again.

69
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,320
Please, sit.

70
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,880
I've actually

71
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,160
wanted to meet you for a long time.

72
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm merely a commoner

73
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,520
who happened to cross paths with you once.

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,720
How did you come to know of me?

75
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,200
Falling flowers filled the sky during the Splendor Showcase,

76
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,920
and Flushed Rose stunned the whole crowd.

77
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,240
Who in Yizhou

78
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
hasn't heard of you?

79
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,520
Actually, Ms. Ji, I admire you greatly.

80
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,920
You admire me?

81
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Ms. Niu, you come from a distinguished background.

82
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,160
What's there to envy about me?

83
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,960
Ms. Ji, I want to be like you.

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,960
I want to build a career as a woman

85
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,600
and prove to my father that

86
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,720
a woman's future

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,640
is not only limited

88
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,000
to marriage.

89
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Ms. Niu, you certainly are ambitious.

90
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,160
I'm sure you will achieve whatever you set your heart on.

91
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
What a fine tea.

92
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Ms. Ji,

93
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,200
would you be interested in joining me

94
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,800
to oversee the brocade business in Yizhou?

95
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,520
I know that

96
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,400
you and Mr. Zhao are in love,

97
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,760
but the Zhao family opposes it.

98
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,640
I can help you

99
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,960
secure your marriage with him...

100
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,760
And restore the Ji family's prestige

101
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,760
from your father's era.

102
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ms. Niu,

103
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,160
with all your wealth

104
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,400
and influence,

105
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,560
why would you lower yourself

106
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,120
to pursue a career?

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,760
Merchants are considered the lowest of society.

108
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,960
Ms. Niu,

109
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,520
I truly find it hard to believe your words.

110
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,760
Ms. Ji, you're a very cautious person.

111
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,520
Very well.

112
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,240
Let me show you

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
why I want this.

114
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,080
This is...?

115
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,480
My mother.

116
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,680
My mother was only 16 when she married into this family

117
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,320
and bore five children for my father.

118
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,360
However, my father only desired a son

119
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,600
who could fight alongside him.

120
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,200
Sadly,

121
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,720
after five attempts,

122
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,160
all he had were daughters.

123
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
When I was born, my mother's health deteriorated,

124
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,840
and she could no longer bear children.

125
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,200
She never left the house ever since.

126
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,840
General,

127
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,440
when will you return?

128
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,120
Mrs. Niu...

129
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,080
She doesn't recognize me either.

130
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,320
General...

131
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,440
Now, she has become a woman

132
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,480
who only spends her days waiting for her husband's return.

133
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,240
My father

134
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
married off all four of my sisters

135
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,880
to men who could help him gain more power.

136
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,240
I, too, have been married twice,

137
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,680
but I won't accept my fate.

138
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,280
Since women can't be officials,

139
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,800
I'll venture into business.

140
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,360
I'll show my father that

141
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,280
I'm better than

142
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,840
any man he chooses for me.

143
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,400
Ms. Niu, you sure are ambitious.

144
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,520
I truly admire you.

145
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,680
Bloom Society

146
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,880
and Flushed Rose

147
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,200
have proved your worth.

148
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,120
Join me,

149
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,720
and you can reach even greater heights.

150
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,800
Together, we can take full control

151
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,480
of Yizhou's brocade business.

152
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,760
Ms. Niu, you drive a tempting offer,

153
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,440
and I appreciate your honesty.

154
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,720
However, I believe that

155
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,040
personal feelings should never be mixed with business.

156
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,960
My feelings for Mr. Zhao

157
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,800
cannot be used as a bargaining chip.

158
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,200
Besides, I founded Bloom Society

159
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,320
to give people like Ms. Zhu and myself,

160
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,760
who have no status or power,

161
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,040
a way forward.

162
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,960
If I were to join forces with you,

163
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,640
I would be no different

164
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,800
from Mrs. Hua.

165
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,200
For that reason,

166
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,160
I must decline your offer.

167
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,920
As I have said,

168
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,280
Ms. Ji,

169
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,040
you still don't grasp

170
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
what it is like to hold true power.

171
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,440
True power

172
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,560
is the ability to prevent you from succeeding in anything

173
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,840
that goes against my will.

174
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,050
[Flushed Rose]

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,060
[Ji Yingying from Yizhou's Sandaoyan dyehouse created a new color, Flushed Rose]

177
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,560
Isn't this registration document

178
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,240
should be on its way to Chang'an?

179
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,960
No wonder

180
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,520
Mrs. Hua insisted

181
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,360
I take on the Flushed Rose orders that day.

182
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,440
Turns out there was more to it than I thought.

183
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,600
Ms. Niu,

184
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,560
you must be the rumored benefactor behind the Hua family.

185
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,000
That doesn’t matter.

186
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
The real question is,

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,400
will you

188
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,520
reconsider your decision?

189
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
I have made up my mind.

190
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,160
Thank you for your kindness, Ms. Niu.

191
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,360
It’s getting late. I'll take my leave now.

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,920
Ms. Ji, please wait.

193
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
What are you doing? Let go!

194
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Let go of me!

195
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Ms. Ji,

196
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,160
I gave you a chance.

197
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,160
Ms. Niu, your actions right now

198
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,000
only prove that I was right to reject your offer.

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
If you refuse to work with me,

200
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,160
then you'll serve me instead.

201
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,360
Ms. Ji, you can only leave this place

202
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,560
once you've dyed the Shu Red Silk.

203
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,200
Hold on.

204
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,200
It's too late

205
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,760
for regrets.

206
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Ms. Niu,

207
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,160
can I send a letter to my family to let them know I'm safe?

208
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,200
I don't want to worry them.

209
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
Besides, I'm sure you don't want this to escalate either.

210
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,160
I may come from a humble background,

211
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,800
but Mr. Sang

212
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,520
is part of our Bloom Society.

213
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,960
Get her a pen and a paper.

214
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,360
Yes, madam.

215
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
Ms. Niu,

216
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,760
she is done.

217
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,520
Yaoting, Mother,

218
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,640
I have learned that

219
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,360
a landslide has happened 300 li outside Yizhou

220
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,600
and delayed the delivery of the registration document.

221
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
I have rented a carriage

222
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
to retrieve the document.

223
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
Time is tight.

224
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,960
I can't explain in detail.

225
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,960
Please forgive me.

226
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,600
Yaoting, Mother,

227
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,640
remember to buy more ingredients for the flower cookies and the rest.

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,520
We need a lot to produce Flushed Red.

229
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,240
I didn't have enough money

230
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,760
when I bought the dye last time.

231
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,800
Thankfully, Ms. Yu lent me two guan.

232
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,560
Please repay her for me.

233
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,040
Yaoting, Mother,

234
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,440
don't worry about me.

235
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,520
Deliver this to the Ji residence later.

236
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,520
Yes.

237
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,760
Keep an eye on her.

238
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,040
If she escapes, you'll pay for it with your life.

239
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,240
Understood.

240
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,800
These are all materials for dyeing Shu Red Silk.

241
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,120
Why are they all here?

242
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,280
Why aren't you working?

243
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,240
Stop dawdling!

244
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,440
I'm watching you.

245
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,720
These ordinary ingredients won't do

246
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
if you want to dye

247
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,440
Shu Red Silk.

248
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,200
Then what else do you need?

249
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,200
I need eight liang of ashes burned from redwoods,

250
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,160
one jin of madder from the rocks,

251
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,360
and three and a half jin of safflowers filled with morning dew.

252
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,200
That should be all.

253
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,800
Don't think of playing tricks.

254
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,320
Hurry and get them prepared.

255
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,560
Can you shoulder the blame

256
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
if there's a delay in the dyeing process?

257
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,360
You!

258
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,240
Wait here.

259
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,040
Ms. Niu,

260
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,320
can Ji Yingying really dye Shu Red Silk?

261
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,000
If she can dye it, we'll use hers.

262
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,280
If not, we'll use our own.

263
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,640
Mrs. Hua is already ruined,

264
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,960
and Ji Yingying refuses to comply.

265
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,840
Plus, the mountains are unsafe lately.

266
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,320
Even if it's not Yang Jinglan,

267
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,240
someone else

268
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,320
is surely targeting us.

269
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,400
The best way

270
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,680
to hide a drop of water

271
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,160
is to place it in the sea.

272
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,360
A loom doesn't belong in the mountains,

273
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,400
but if it's placed in a brocade workshop,

274
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,720
no one will suspect a thing.

275
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,160
Ms. Niu,

276
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,360
there is a letter from the General.

277
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,200
You may leave.

278
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,360
Yes, Ms. Niu.

279
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,040
Ms. Niu.

280
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
Read it.

281
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,200
Summarize the important parts for me.

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,800
Okay.

283
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,160
[The sixth day of You month is his birthday.

Niu Jin]

285
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,000
The General is attempting to marry you off again.

286
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,920
It's a distant relative of the Right Military Commissioner.

287
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
He wishes to take you as his concubine.

288
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,760
General...

289
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,600
You're his daughter,

290
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,800
not a gift to be given away!

291
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
Quiet down.

292
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,360
This is the Niu residence,

293
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,320
not my home.

294
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,960
I just feel sorry for you, Ms. Niu.

295
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,760
The gentleman Ji Yingying fancies is from the Zhao family,

296
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,040
the renowned brocade merchants in Yizhou.

297
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,680
The name is

298
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,200
Zhao Xiuyuan, I believe?

299
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
I think so.

300
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,640
The Zhao family

301
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,800
is the perfect sea to hide the drop of water.

[San Hua Pavilion]

303
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,320
This might be a mistake.

304
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,320
Please pardon me.

305
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,560
You are at the right place.

306
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,880
I was the one who invited you, Mr. Zhao.

307
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
And you are?

308
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,640
My father is Niu Jin, Vice Governor of Yizhou.

309
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,200
I am the fifth daughter in my family.

310
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,240
Surely you've heard of me.

311
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,960
Ms. Niu,

312
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,040
why did you invite me here?

313
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,680
Do you intend to keep standing there

314
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,400
to speak with me?

315
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,000
We're strangers.

316
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,240
For the sake of your honor,

317
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,440
it's best that I remain standing here.

318
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,440
Surely you know about my reputation.

319
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,000
Staying there

320
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,440
isn't good for yours.

321
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,520
If there's nothing else,

322
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,440
I'll take my leave.

323
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,240
I'm a friend of Ms. Ji.

326
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,080
Yes.

327
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,040
Mr. Zhao, please wait a moment.

328
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,800
Ms. Niu,

329
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,680
what business do you have with me?

330
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
When people

331
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,000
see my face

332
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,840
and learn about my status,

333
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,280
they either fear me,

334
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,720
avoid me, or fawn over me.

335
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,840
But you're

336
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,600
the only one

337
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,800
who remains unmoved.

338
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,080
Are you

339
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
not afraid of me?

340
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,240
I don't judge people by their appearances,

341
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,720
only by their hearts.

342
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,440
Excuse me.

343
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,720
Don't you want to hear

344

the message Ms. Ji left for you?

345
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,280
No.

346
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,960
Yingying would never entrust someone like you

347
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,040
to deliver a message to me.

348
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,560

351
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,480
and unpredictable.

352
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,160
Alright.

353
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,520
Let me

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,840
bare my heart to you today.

355
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,000
I fell in love with you

356
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,480
at first sight.

357
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,760
I wish for you to accept me.

358
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,440
Careful with what you say.

359
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,440
I am already engaged.

360
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm afraid I cannot reciprocate your affections.

361
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,280
Is it Ms. Ji from Huanhua Dyehouse?

362
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,000
Please don't come any closer.

363
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,360
But I have heard that

364
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,120
the Zhao family has already annulled the engagement.

365
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,080
Even so, I only wish to marry Yingying in this life.

366
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,320
Please don't make it difficult for me.

367
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,840
Mr. Zhao,

368
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,440
do you realize the weight of my words?

369
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,080
I am the daughter of Niu Jin.

370
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,440
There is nothing

371
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,520

372
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,440
Everyone knows the power of General Niu.

373
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,680
But I truly seek nothing.

374
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,240
If there's nothing else today,

375
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,000
then

376
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,520
thank you for the hospitality.

377
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
I'll take my leave.

378
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,040
Ms. Niu, Mr. Zhao Sr. will soon hear about you

379
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,640
reserving the entire San Hua Pavilion

380
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,240
just to meet Mr. Zhao.

381
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,000
But will the Zhao family

382
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,840
really take action?

383
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,080
Mr. Zhao Sr. is a wise man.

384
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
He will understand.

385
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
But Ms. Niu,

386
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,880
is Mr. Zhao really the one you want to choose?

387
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,680
You think he is unsuitable?

388
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,480
He remained unfazed even after

389
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,520
learning about my identity.

390
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,680
He showed neither shock nor disdain

391
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,720
upon seeing my face.

392
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,440
Just for that alone,

393
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,680
he stands above the rest.

394
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,760
But his heart already belongs to Ji Yingying.

395
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,880
He will never truly love you.

396
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,880
Love?

397
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,760
Do you think I need something like that?

398
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,800
Rather than letting my father marry me off

399
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,360
to some random household,

400
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,720
I'd rather act first.

401
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,800
The Zhao family is one I can control,

402
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,560
and one I urgently need to control.

403
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,520
The Zhao family

404
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,920
is the perfect place to hide that drop of water.

405
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,240
With the Zhao family's brocade workshop,

406
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,480
I won't need to exhaust myself weaving brocade in the mountains.

407
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Ji Yingying,

408
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,040
since you won't submit to me,

409
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,640
I will just take what you hold dear.

410
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,960
I wonder if Yaoting has received my letter.

411
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,680
I asked Ms. Yu about it.

412
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,760
She said dyeing Shu Red Silk

413
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,680
doesn't require the things you mentioned.

414
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,040
Are you playing me as a fool?

415
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,080
I'm the one dyeing the silk.

416
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,120
What would she know?

417
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,200
How dare you talk back?

418
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,800
I'm going to teach you a lesson!

419
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,160
Let me teach you a lesson!

420
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:51,640
You!

421
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,520
Still running?

422
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,480
How dare you talk back?

423
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,960
Let's see where you can run.

424
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,520
You!

425
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,320
Why aren't you running?

426
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm telling you.

427
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,880
This is just a warning.

428
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,000
If you dare mess with me again,

429
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,680
you won't live to regret it.

430
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,800
Keep an eye on her.

431
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,920
[The Zhao Residence]

432
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,720
Grandfather.

433
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,640
I heard

434
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,120
Ms. Niu has taken a liking to you.

435
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,560
Grandfather, you must be mistaken.

436
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,720
I only met her briefly

437
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,560
by chance.

438
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,320
How could there be any interest?

439
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,280
Is it her disinterest

440
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,440
or yours?

441
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,120
You slighted Ms. Niu today.

442
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,400
Did you consider

443
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,920
if she bears a grudge,

444
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,720
Zhao Brocade won't stand a chance

445
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,040
against the Brocade Master?

446
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,920
Grandfather,

447
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,760
Yingying and I are in love.

448
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,760
I cannot accept

449
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,160
Ms. Niu's favor.

450
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,040
Foolish boy!

451
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,000
I approved your marriage with Ji Yingying

452
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,560
because of Bloom Society

453
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,840
and Flushed Rose.

454
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Your union with her will help our family greatly.

455
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,520
Xiuyuan,

456
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,200
but if you marry Ms. Niu…

457
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,320
I won't.

458
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,680
How dare you!

459
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,520
A messenger has been sent to the Niu residence to propose marriage.

460
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,800
Ridiculous!

461
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,200
Grandfather,

462
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,720
she wouldn't want to marry a cripple.

463
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,360
My heart

464
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,440
will not change.

465
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,840
Then you'll kneel here

466
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,840
until you have thought it through.

467
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,800
I will kneel.

468
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,760
I...

469
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,600
Mr. Zhao Senior!

470
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,360
Here's a message from the Niu residence.

471
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,520
They are inviting Mr. Zhao to visit.

472
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,880
Tell Ms. Niu that

473
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,520
Mr. Zhao will be there.

474
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,080
Yes, sir.

[The Niu Residence]

476
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,400
You look rather worn, Mr. Zhao.

477
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
All thanks to you, Ms. Niu.

478
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,920
I have done nothing at all.

479
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,680
It was the Zhao family who came to my family seeking a marriage proposal.

480
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,920
The Niu family wields tremendous power.

481
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,040
We met at San Hua Pavilion yesterday.

482
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,920
Did you

483
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,840
plan all of this in advance?

484
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,360
Please.

485
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,880
Even if you dislike the idea,

486
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,440
you do not show it.

487
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,440
Your composure is admirable, Mr. Zhao.

488
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,160
Earlier,

489
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,760
you asked me if this was intentional.

490
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,200
I pity my sincerity.

491
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,520
You speak of it so disdainfully.

492
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,640
Let's be candid.

493
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,440
You are willing to lower yourself

494
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,800
to marry me, the son of a merchant.

495
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,920
What is your true intention?

496
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,680
Once we are married,

497
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
there are certain things

498
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,040
I will share with you.

499
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,680
Who would have thought

500
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,280
you are so desperate

501
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,040
to marry yourself off, Ms. Niu?

502
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,080
How dare you!

503
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,120
Do you know

504
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,440
how I got this scar on my face?

505
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,550
Everyone says I am cursed,

506
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
a bringer of bad luck to my husbands.

507
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,400
But in truth,

508
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,240
I wanted them dead.

509
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,520
And so, they died.

510
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,240
This scar was my father's lesson to me.

511
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,240
He was furious at the time,

512
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,200
and his hand slipped.

513
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,120
But I am grateful for this scar.

514
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,040
It earned me the opportunity

to hold power and make decisions.

516

Power once forced its will upon you.

517

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,680
But Yingying only left a letter and disappeared.

565
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,840
I am worried about her.

566
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,240
Maybe

567
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,880
I should hire a carriage and go find her.

568
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,720
I will go find her.

569
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,640
You stay home and wait.

570
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,640
No, I will go.

571
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,600
Go home and wait! Trust me.

572
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,320
I invited you here today

573
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,920
to enjoy a play

574
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,280
with me.

575
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,520
Perhaps after watching,

576
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,040
you will reconsider your decisions.

577
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,000
Ms. Niu said

578
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,200
to give you half an hour to escape.

579
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,080
What kind of new torment is this?

580
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,080
It is a chance to live.

581
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,040
It all depends on whether you want it or not.

582
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,360
Yingying!

583
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,800
What are you trying to do?

584
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,680
Just inviting you to watch a play.

585
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,200
Best stay away from the windows, Mr. Zhao.

586
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,240
These archers cannot hear sudden noises.

587
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,120
Otherwise, they might shoot at Ms. Ji.

588
00:34:59,240 --> 00:34:59,720
Ms. Niu!

589
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,200
Do not move!

590
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,600
Do you believe I will kill you?

591
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,440
A cornered beast fights hardest.

592
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,840
Do you not find it entertaining?

593
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:15,960
Ms. Ji,

594
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,520
your time is running out.

595
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,640
Will you continue?

596
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,320
I really will kill you!

597
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,120
Can you face the consequences

598
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,920
after killing me?

599
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,760
Can the Ji and Zhao families

600
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,840
bear the consequences?

601
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,280
I am sorry.

602
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,040
I will release you

603
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,840
once I am outside.

604
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,480
Let me go...!

605
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,720
Do you hear that?

606
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,880
Release her!

607
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,600
What a match made in heaven.

608
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,840
Even your escape plans

609
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,640
are identical.

610
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,440
Let me go!

611
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,280
Are you insane?

612
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,080
Mr. Zhao, you clearly have never killled anyone.

613
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,040
Do you want to kill me?

614
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Should I have them

615
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,280
kill a few more

616
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,840
to teach you how it is done?

617
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,440
What exactly are you trying to do?

618
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
I have already told you.

619
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,840
From the moment I saw you,

620
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,040
I was captivated.

621
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,040
I wish for us to get married.

622
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
I hope you will grant my wish.

623
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,370
[Marriage Agreement]

624
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,200
Will you release Yingying

625
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,240
if I agree to this?

626
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,400
That depends on

627
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,080
whether you are willing

628
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,800
to treat me sincerely in the future, Mr. Zhao.

629
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,760
How insolent!

630
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,000
You dare cause trouble at the Niu residence!

631
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,840
Hand Yingying over immediately!

632
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,040
Ms. Niu,

633
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,320
there is an urgent decree from the palace.

634
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,760
They want Shu Red Silk.

635
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,120
I have already reported to the governor.

636
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,680
I must take Ji Yingying, the daughter of the Red Silk Brocade Master,

637
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,240
to assist with the investigation.

638
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,400
Ms. Niu,

639
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,400
surrender her at once.

640
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,040
Mr. Yang, you are quite the strategist.

641
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,640
You are not to be underestimated.

642
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,960
But I think you misunderstand, Mr. Yang.

643
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,520
Ms. Ji did visit my residence,

644
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,320
but she has since departed.

645
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,800
Whether she is here or not,

646
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,000
I will know after I search.

647
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,560
The General's residence

648
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,320
is not a place you can search at will.

649
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
The emperor's order cannot be defied.

650
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Ms. Niu,

651
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,840
do you intend to resist an imperial decree?

652
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,960
If you fail to find her,

653
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,040
the crime of forcibly entering this residence

654
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,360
will not be easily excused.

655
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,560
Fine.

656
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,160
Forgive the intrusion.

657
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,440
Search everywhere!

658
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:12,960
Yes, sir!

659
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,080
Mr. Yang, no sign of her on the eastern side.

660
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:01,840
Mr. Yang,

661
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
she is not in the backyard either.

662
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,960
Keep searching!

663
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:06,960
Yes, sir.

664
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,800
How dare you act on your own?

665
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
Did I not instruct you

666
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,160
to escort Ms. Ji safely back to her house?

667
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,360
How could you do something so foolish?

668
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,200
Please forgive me, miss.

669
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,520
I saw Ms. Ji behaving arrogantly and rudely,

670
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,160
and I felt indignant.

671
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,280
That is why, in a moment of folly, I made such a grave mistake.

672
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,920
Please spare me, miss.

673
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,720
Do you realize

674
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,360
if today's event were to spread,

675
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,600
and Ms. Ji's reputation were ruined,

676
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,760
even death would not atone for your actions?

677
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Enough, Ms. Niu.

678
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,920
This act of pity has gone far enough.

679
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,800
I will not

680
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,960
speak of today's event.

681
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,080
Our paths

682
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,800
