[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,550
Whether it's day or night,

4
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,310
this troublemaker,

5
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,760
is forbidden

6
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,190
from washing silk in Huanhua Creek!

7
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,400
Mr. Hua,

8
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,630
everyone knows

9
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,830
that only the Shu brocade washed in this creek

10
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,360
can achieve its vibrant color.

11
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,440
That's the only way to create true Shu brocade.

12
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,440
Huanhua Creek is the backbone of every dyehouse!

13
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,680
I don't know how I offended you

14
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,550
and why you ruin my business like this.

15
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,440
You didn't offend me.

16
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,230
You offended Mr. Sang!

17
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,630
If you're allowed to wash silk here again,

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,440
Mr. Sang will think that we're allies.

19
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,160
Who's to say he won't come and pick a fight with us one day?

20
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:12,830
I'd like to ask

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,960
who will dare stand against Mr. Sang's wrath.

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,800
Huanhua Creek has been open to all

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
for centuries.

24
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,630
It bears no claim to your family's name!

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,160
I never claim it is.

26
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,600
I'm simply looking out for everyone's interests.

27
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,000
If it means we must play the villain, so be it!

28
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,830
Mr. Chen, what are you doing?

29
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,750
I've purchased her silk by now.

30
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,160
Have you the authority to stop me

31
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,360
from washing my own silk?

32
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,390
I'll buy some too.

33
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,720
Give me the rest.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,750
Stop! Stop here!

35
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,600
Do you take me for a fool?

36
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,190
I've told you

37
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,800
the Ji family is forbidden from washing silk here!

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,440
They are not permitted!

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,800
And if any of you dare to aid her,

40
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,830
you can all leave now!

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,750
I kick you!

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,440
Enough...

43
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,670
This must be Hua Xiangrong's scheme

44
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,440
to keep you from washing silk.

45
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,240
If Mrs. Hua knows about it,

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,240
she won't stop you.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,960
I'm the one she seeks to isolate.

48
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,000
Stupid fool!

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,910
They're all scheming, every one of them!

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,750
That woman is not a good person too!

51
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,440
She's trying to use this

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,520
to drive our prices down!

53
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,720
Mark my words, if she doesn't,

54
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll write my name backward!

55
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,750
Mr. Chen,

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,110
this will help settle your nerves.

57
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,800
Would you like some?

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,910
I don't want it!

59
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,190
Mr. Sheng,

60
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,440
is your box filled with medicine?

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,160
Yes.

62
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,190
I may appear quite strong...

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,110
I mean,

64
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,110
I've always been somewhat frail since I was a child.

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,240
My mother insists

66
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,910
that I have enough medicine on hand

67
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,270
in case I need it.

68
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,670
This is good for the heart.

69
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,880
This one strengthens the liver and stomach.

70
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,830
And this one helps with sleep and prenatal nourishment.

71
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,830
Prenatal nourishment?

72
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,520
Your mother certainly has very high expectations of you!

73
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,110
Medicine is for all, regardless of gender!

74
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,390
It's all useful.

75
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,670
You should take some.

76
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,110
Why do I need prenatal nourishment?

77
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,550
Have some, Mr. Chen.

78
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,520
I don't need that!

79
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,160
I want to eat his brain!

80
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,670
I want to chew him up,

81
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,000
lick his bones clean,

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,110
and fry him to eat!

83
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,200
This event happened because of me.

84
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,790
I've dragged you into this mess alongside me.

85
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,670
What are you talking about?

86
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,830
You've always helped us delay Hua Xiangrong.

87
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,920
We're not heartless!

88
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,320
Even if this were to happen again,

89
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,110
we could never stand by and watch you being bullied.

90
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,880
- Yes! - That's right!

91
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,480
You're all so spirited.

92
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,350
Do you care to make a wager with me?

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,880
W-What kind of wager?

94
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,600
Do you know

95
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,510
why the Hua family dares to treat us this way?

96
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,320
Because we're just small dyehouses,

97
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,600
with little power to speak of.

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,550
The Hua family is the largest dyehouse in the city.

99
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,920
They get the whole cake, while we're left to scramble for the crumbs.

100
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,550
We have no choice but to rely on the little scraps

101
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,230
they toss our way to survive!

102
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,510
Then why would they bother splitting their orders

103
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,550
with us?

104
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,510
Because our prices are low!

105
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,200
It's far more profitable for them than hiring more workers

106
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,390
at their own dyehouse.

107
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,320
Besides, they've long been accustomed to driving our prices down.

108
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,760
Not just that!

109
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,040
Think about it.

110
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,510
Their indigo silk

111
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,230
is mainly dyed by Ms. Zhu.

112
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,670
They tend to order

113
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,320
green and blue silk from me.

114
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,040
Their orders from your family

115
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,790
are mostly for Shiyang brocade and midnight purple.

116
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,350
Yours is scarlet.

117
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,920
Yours is olive and blue.

118
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,390
Our dyehouses may be small,

119
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,720
but we have our own specialties!

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,480
A lot of our colors are actually done better than the Hua's Dyehouse!

121
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,200
But...

122
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,760
Our silk are all sold through the Hua family.

123
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,790
People only know Hua's Dyehouse.

124
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,640
They don't know about us smaller dyehouses.

125
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,390
So?

126
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,790
So, if we all join forces,

127
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,830
we'll become one large dyehouse

128
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,720
with the resources to handle

129
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,000
bigger orders.

130
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,550
Once we've built our reputation,

131
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
we won't have to fear a lack of business.

132
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,390
We'll have the leverage to secure better orders,

133
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,320
and then, we won't have to worry

134
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,390
about being unable to wash our silk!

135
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,790
Hold on. You make it sound so easy.

136
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,830
It's not easy

137
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,510
to build up a reputation.

138
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,270
I agree.

139
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,720
All the larger dyehouses have powerful individuals backing them.

140
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,510
That's right!

141
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,640
Just tell me. Since we have no power or status,

142
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,230
how can we fight against them?

143
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,270
Yeah.

144
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,640
Even if we compete against them,

145
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,880
they'd defeat us!

146
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,270
That's right!

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When there's a will, there's a way.

148
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,040
How could you know if you don't even try?

149
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,550
I...

150
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,440
A kite!

151
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,070
Which fool has the mind to fly a kite at a time like this?

152
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,920
Everyone, take some time to think it over.

153
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,720
We'll discuss it again once you've made up your minds.

154
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,670
Mr. Chen,

155
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,270
please keep an eye on my silk for me.

156
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,000
I...

157
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,270
I'm going to see what fool is out there flying a kite.

158
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,200
What's so interesting about a fool?

159
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,110
Why does she enjoy surrounding herself with such idiots?

160
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,110
That's right.

161
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,350
You're the idiot!

162
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,230
[Zhao Xiuyuan]

163
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,230
Xiuyuan!

164
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,720
Why are you free to be out today?

165
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,920
How is your brocade coming along?

166
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,350
Don't think you can change the subject

167
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,480
just because you've given me some sweets.

168
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,160
I heard about your incident with Sang Shisi.

169
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,160
I brought some medicine for you.

170
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,720
But as I'm looking at you, you don't seem hurt at all.

171
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,160
I knew it!

172
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,110
Whenever you get into a scuffle,

173
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,920
it's always the other party that ends up injured.

174
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,440
I never said I'm not hurt.

175
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,600
I'm injured right inside!

176
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,160
You'll need to get closer to see it.

177
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,950
Where?

178
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,950
I knew you were lying!

179
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,350
I can smell the dye on you.

180
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,720
Aren't you afraid of red?

181
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,320
Why would you put it on your face?

182
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,160
I'm only afraid of red when it's flowing...

183
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,350
when it runs like blood.

184
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,110
Not all reds scare me.

185
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,320
Alright,

186
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,350
let's get back to business.

187
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,040
I've looked

188
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,070
into Sang Shisi.

189
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,790
His sister is one of the emperor's concubines.

190
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,280
His father is a brocade officer.

191
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,440
The other children all have accomplished careers.

192
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,550
He's the only one

193
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,520
who's done nothing but fool around.

194
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,910
What are his hobbies?

195
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,110
He is good at nothing,

196
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,230
but he excels at one thing.

197
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,550
What?

198
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,110
Madiao.

199
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,590
Madiao?

200
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,480
[Yuebuhuan]

201
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,960
How dare you serve me raw food?

202
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,760
Innkeeper!

203
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,790
If you still don't show yourself now,

204
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,230
I'm going to...!

205
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,110
Going to what?

206
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,670
You're the innkeeper?

207
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,470
[Ms. Yu, Yuebuhuan Inn]

208
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,320
Yu Linglong!

209
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
What are you doing?

210
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,230
I'm getting you a properly cooked dish.

211
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
You must give me a satisfactory answer today.

212
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,910
At the very least,

213
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,230
you should compensate me.

214
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:37,760
Well...

215
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:39,000
It's fine

216
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,110
if you refuse,

217
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,080
but you should

218
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,910
at least

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,640
have a drink with me, shouldn't you?

220
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,880
Sure.

221
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,960
Do you know why my inn

222
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,150
is called Yuebuhuan?

223
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,400
How could I know?

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,150
We offer fine wine here.

225
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,760
Guests who stay the night

226
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,400
won't be allowed credit.

227
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,000
If it's not paid within the month, they won't be allowed to go home.

228
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,470
Eat if you like it.

229
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,520
If not, just leave!

230
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,790
You run a shady establishment!

231
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,790
You serve us moldy food!

232
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,440
Don't you realize that could kill us?

233
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,350
I'm going to report you!

234
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,640
When Mr. Wang was still Xichuan's military commissioner,

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,520
he once dined here

236
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,590
and praised the fish.

237
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,960
He said it was like shimmering gold among falling petals,

238
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,030
a taste so exquisite it surpassed even the beauty of Jiangnan's landscapes.

239
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,150
Mr. Wang gave such high praises,

240
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,000
yet you dismiss it,

241
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,840
calling it unfit for human consumption.

242
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,640
You've insulted Mr. Wang terribly.

243
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,550
I wonder who will be held accountable

244
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,280
when this reaches the court.

245
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,150
Why should I listen to you?

246
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,230
If I were you,

247
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,080
I'd settle the bill quickly,

248
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,590
then hurry home and hide.

249
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,400
I'll only mention this once everyone has forgotten about it.

250
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,790
I'll never come here again!

251
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,910
Never again!

252
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,230
Apologies for the interruption.

253
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,030
I'll offer a discount

254
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,590
on all alcoholic beverages today!

255
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,880
Thank you, Ms. Yu!

256
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,550
Waiter!

257
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,080
Come here please!

258
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,350
Get us another bottle!

259
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,520
I'm coming!

260
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,760
When did Mr. Wang

261
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,880
ever praise my fish here?

262
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,590
I made it up.

263
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,670
They won't be meeting Mr. Wang anyway.

264
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
And even if they do,

265
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,230
all they will talk about is work.

266
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,000
Who would bother with something so trivial?

267
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,470
What brings you here?

268
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,590
Have you heard about my incident with Sang Shisi?

269
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,790
Your name has traveled far.

270
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,550
Ms. Ji would not bow to power

271
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,470
and bravely stood up against Mr. Sang!

272
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,350
Do you want to make a name for yourself too?

273
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,760
Borrow me your place for two days,

274
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,350
and then borrow me some money.

275
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,590
Lend you some money?

276
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,910
Look how empty this place is!

277
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,550
It just has several customers for a whole day.

278
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,150
I have no money to lend you.

279
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,760
Just lend me the money.

280
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,590
I guarantee your inn will be filled with customers,

281
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,960
and you'll be making a fortune every day.

282
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,840
Do you have a plan to deal with the Hua family?

283
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,710
Or is this all for Sang Shisi?

284
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,080
Everyone knows that the way to fight power is with power.

285
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Good!

286
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,640
Well done!

287
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,080
Thank you for letting me win.

288
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,400
The Queen of Gambling is highly skilled.

289
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
You make us feel inadequate.

290
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,440
You're far too kind.

291
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,030
Anyone else wants to play?

292
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,550
It's you?

293
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,840
You're the Queen of Gambling?

294
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,640
Come on, play a round with me.

295
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,790
I'm talking to you!

296
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,670
Didn't you hear me?

297
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you know why I am gambling with money?

298
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,520
Why?

299
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,080
Because I offended Mr. Sang at Huanhua Creek.

300
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,590
The Hua family fears I'll bring trouble to them,

301
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,150
so they won't let me work at the creek.

302
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,520
My dyehouse is on the brink of closing down!

303
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,320
I have no choice but to rely on this to support my family.

304
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,110
How could I know such matters?

305
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,880
Never mind.

306
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,520
Once I have spoken my mind, I move on.

307
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,910
I never imagined the Hua family

308
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,350
would ensnare you using my name.

309
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,080
We shall discuss this later.

310
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,710
But now, let us make a wager!

311
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,590
No.

312
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,200
You...!

313
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,350
Very well. I shall accept your wager.

314
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,280
Regardless of the outcome,

315
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,760
I will see to it that the Hua family

316
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,910
leaves you in peace!

317
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,520
Really?

318
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,790
I stand by word.

319
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,200
Come on!

320
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,960
Place your wager on big or small.

321
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,760
Twenty wen each round

322
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,320
until you have claimed all of your opponent's money.

323
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,350
Anything you like.

324
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,960
70,000 guan.

325
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,320
80,000 guan.

326
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,710
Impressive!

327
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,480
[70,000 guan, 7 suozi, 80,000 guan, 8 suozi]

328
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,780
[50,000 guan, 60,000 guan.]

329
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,710
Ms. Ji's skills are truly remarkable.

330
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,590
She won eight times out of ten.

331
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,960
She is indeed impressive.

332
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,550
She wins when she wants.

333
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,910
She loses when she wants.

334
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,320
What does that mean?

335
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
What do I mean?

336
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,400
You should eat something before drinking,

337
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,880
or you'll harm your health.

338
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,280
You fare well

339
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,590
even without the aid of your family.

340
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,280
I never expected

341
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,520
that you would be the first to recognize me

342
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,880
with me not returning all these years.

343
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:23,400
Three meals a day,

344
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,000
and the journey stretches before me.

345
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
With a carefree heart,

346
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,710
the days pass in ease.

347
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:30,670
Come on,

348
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,030
my sister.

349
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,960
Thank you for thinking about me.

350
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,910
Your wine is

351
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,590
as exquisite as ever.

352
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
You're making me sound old by calling me sister.

353
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,150
Alright.

354
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,840
What rotten luck.

355
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,200
Let's take a break.

356
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,520
Mr. Sang, I have already conceded.

357
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,150
Please, allow me to return home.

358
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,080
No yet!

359
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,150
I am far from finished!

360
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,470
Come on, let us play 300 more rounds!

361
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,640
Little rascal!

362
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,320
You little rascal!

363
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,520
I just came...!

364
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,910
I just came back,

365
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,640
and you're already causing me trouble!

366
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
You...!

367
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,910
You are...

368
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,790
still running!

369
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,320
You even forced a poor girl to gamble with you.

370
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,030
Stand right there!

371
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,670
Stop hitting him...!

372
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,710
Get down here!

373
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,670
No! You'll hit me if I do!

374
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,110
Stand there!

375
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,640
Chief Sang, you've misunderstood.

376
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,770
[Chief Sang]
Chief Sang, you've misunderstood.

377
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,520
Mr. Sang and I are not here

378
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,840
to gamble.

379
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,080
We were attracting a crowd

380
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,910
for business.

381
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,110
Yes...

382
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,080
What business?

383
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,670
What business?

384
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,440
Tell my father

385
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,150
about it now.

386
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,190
I had no intention

387
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,400
of revealing it.

388
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,350
But since you have asked,

389
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,400
I will show you.

390
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,230
Mr. Jiang, take it out.

391
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,590
Here.

392
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,350
This is a Madiao pouch crafted by the Silk Society.

393
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,400
A Madiao pouch?

394
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,800
I have never heard of such a thing.

395
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,880
These were blessed by Leizu herself.

396
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,160
Each carries its own meaning.

397
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,230
Look.

398
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,470
Wanguan.

399
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,800
It symbolizes families and merchants

400
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,190
prospering with each passing day.

401
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
This is suozi.

402
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,760
[Suozi]
It carries

403
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,000
a blessing for scholars to succeed in their exams.

404
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,830
[Wenqian]
And this is wenqian.

405
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,680
It symbolizes the flow of thoughts

406
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,310
and a bright future to come.

407
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,680
That's good.

408
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,430
Oh, this is a great one.

409
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,350
Shiwan.

410
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,280
This is a gift that Mr. Sang

411
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,190
specially wished to present to you.

412
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,880
For me?

413
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,190
Yes, Father.

414
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,640
Father, this is for you.

415
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,830
I will help you put it on.

416
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,950
This is a blessing, wishing you

417
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,590
a life free of mistakes,

418
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
with good health

419
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,000
and longevity.

420
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,000
It is Mr. Sang's affection for you.

421
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,950
This little thing is quite intriguing.

422
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,560
Miss,

423
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,040
when do you plan to begin selling it?

424
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,800
If everyone likes them,

425
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,920
the Silk Society

426
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,430
shall do our utmost to produce them, okay?

427
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,710
Mr. Chen?

428
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,560
Mr. Jiang?

429
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,710
Mr. Sheng?

430
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes...

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,800
Exactly...

432
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,430
Silk Society?

433
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,400
During your absence,

434
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,000
Mr. Sang took pity on our hardships

435
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,880
and thus established the Silk Society on our behalf.

436
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,040
The Madiao pouch

437
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,560
marks our first venture.

438
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,190
Yes...

439
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,040
Mr. Sang serves as our honorary president.

440
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,830
We are not truly

441
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,470
gambling here.

442
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,680
We merely sought to spread word of our endeavor.

443
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,800
Are you truly doing a business?

444
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,590
Yes, Father.

445
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,680
You have misunderstood me.

446
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,040
Chief Sang,

447
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,000
you have misunderstood our president.

448
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,830
He has worked tirelessly

449
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,110
for us.

450
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,680
Interesting.

451
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,470
Don't bully others.

452
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,000
Okay.

453
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,280
And don't get bullied too.

454
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,710
- Goodbye, Father. - Take care, Chief Sang.

455
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,800
Esteemed guests,

456
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,350
if you fancy the Madiao pouch

457
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,070
crafted by the Silk Society,

458
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,830
we invite you to place your orders now.

459
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,230
The first 50 orders will receive a special half-price offer.

460
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,590
The design that Chief Sang possesses is particularly intricate.

461
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,350
We don't have that many of it.

462
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,470
Only 30 can be reserved.

463
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,640
They shall be sold on a first-come, first-served basis.

464
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,280
I want it...!

465
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,950
Listen here.

466
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,830
If you wish to have one,

467
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,680
place your orders with me.

468
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,000
Are you using me?

469
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,280
Yes.

470
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,160
Yes?

471
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,800
We were only here to sell the pouches.

472
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Who knew you would come?

473
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,590
And I certainly did not expect your father's arrival.

474
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,000
In a few days, you may inform your father

475
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,760
that you no longer wish to serve as the honorary president.

476
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,190
Then, there will be nothing binding you to us.

477
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,470
No way!

478
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,800
It is already official now.

479
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,830
I cannot simply walk away from it.

480
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,280
But being our honorary president means

481
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,590
you must lend a hand in our efforts.

482
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,880
Do you think I am incapable of helping?

483
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,400
Alright, you can try.

484
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,920
As the honorary president,

485
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,800
will there be any benefits afforded to me?

486
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,800
Oh, Mr. Yang.

487
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,950
Of course there is. I'll get it for you.

488
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,800
Come.

489
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,880
How annoying.

490
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,000
I wish to gamble with Ms. Ji.

491
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,560
The loser shall be bound to honor a deal

492
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,800
with the winner.

493
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,560
No.

494
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,400
Sure!

495
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,280
Shisi,

496
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,000
what kind of president are you?

497
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,110
Honorary president.

498
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,950
No wonder no one heeds your words.

499
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,520
It is a title

500
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:01,950
without power.

501
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,280
Could she have been deceiving you from the beginning?

502
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,830
Think about it.

503
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,160
Was it mere coincidence that your father arrived?

504
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,400
Was it a coincidence

505
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,680
they had to...?

506
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,470
Come!

507
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,680
I'll gamble with you.

508
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,040
Ms. Ji,

509
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,070
why don't we play it differently?

510
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,000
Let us each play with three cards.

511
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,800
It will be quicker.

512
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:26,640
Sure.

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,430
please.

519
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,560
That's huge.

520
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,880
He is losing for sure.

521
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,640
Mr. Yang's cards

522
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,560
fall short beside hers.

523
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,830

524
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,710

[90,000 guan. 9 suozi]

526
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
He's so good!

[90,000 guan. 9 suozi. 900,000 guan]

528
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,280
Impressive!

529
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,400
Ms. Ji,

530
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,110
is there something amiss

531
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,880
with my cards?

532
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,590
Mr. Yang, your prowess is unmatched.

533
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,160
I admit defeat.

534
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,880
Please, make your request.

535
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,640
I wish to pay a visit to your home.

536
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Why is it that you always wish to visit my home?

537
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,070
It is thanks to all of you that this has gone

538
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,710
so smoothly.

539
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,710
Us?

540
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,680
Us...?

541
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,110
Did you hear?

542
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:00,760
No.

543
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,160
There's a new gambling champion in Yizhou.

544
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,110
She has never lost.

545
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,070
She has defeated everyone in Yizhou.

546
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,350
Anyone who gambles with her

547
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,040
will only bring shame upon themselves.

548
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,280
Of course.

549
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,350
Take me to her at once!

550
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,950
Chief Sang,

551
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,680
Mr. Sang is forcing others to gamble with him.

552
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,430
None are permitted to leave until he is pleased.

553
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,110
You must uphold justice.

554
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,880
I will go take a look!

555
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,400
We made the Madiao pouches.

556
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,470
Wan Wan, a few others, and I

557
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,280
worked tireless for days to make them.

558
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,400
We tricked Sang Shisi into gambling with you

559
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,760
using his beloved

560
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,560
Madiao card game.

561
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,830
We then drew in his father

562
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,680
to teach him a lesson,

563
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,160
and now he is bound by us,

564
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
made to take on the position of president.

565
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,520
It's all connected.

566
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,160
Impressive.

567
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,280
Brilliant.

568
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,350
I have a question.

569
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,070
Are you really the god of gambling?

570
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,950
8 suozi.

571
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,350
50,000 guan.

572
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,520
7 wen.

573
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,280
All of these cards

574
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,070
show slight differences in color

575
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,680
after being worn by sweat, alcohol, and tea stains.

576
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,640
I remember them by their hues.

577
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,160
Alright.

578
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,880
What do we do next?

579
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,560
We'll take revenge of course.

580
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,000
The expense of lamp oil alone is far too high this month.

581
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,470
This is bad.

582
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,110
We should save more.

583
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,190
Pay it sooner.

584
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,310
Yingying won't have to

585
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,470
work so much then.

586
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,000
Yaoting,

587
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,230
you scared me.

588
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,760
Sneaking out again?

589
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,310
You're really forming this chamber?

590
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,470
Yaoting,

591
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,680
I have waited years for this moment.

592
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,350
I started this trouble with Sang Shisi,

593
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,040
but every crisis presents an opportunity.

594
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,520
How could I not be aware

595
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,950
that I've offended Mrs. Hua

596
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,520
and that she will seek revenge?

597
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,680
Does that mean that she won't scheme

598
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,070
against us if we don't provoke her?

599
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,520
The Hua family has powerful backing.

600
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,280
I don't know who is backing them.

601
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,070
I don't know about their schemes too.

602
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,560
But doing business is much like gambling with Madiao cards.

603
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,110
If you cannot read your opponent's hand,

604
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,430
the only choice is to make yours the strongest.

605
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,280
So,

606
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,350
Yaoting,

607
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,950
I'm begging you.

608
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,280
Thanks, Yaoting.

609
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:23,350
Stock up on more dye and silk thread in the coming days.

610
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,110
Take on orders beyond those of the Hua family.

611
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,880
Accept the orders even if

612
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,880
they are less profitable.

613
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,590
What are you up to now?

614
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,310
Just a precaution.

615
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,590
I've already told Mr. Chen and the others,

616
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,680
but Pin's family does not wish for me

617
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,760
to have contact with her at this time.

618
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,070
I beg you to take care of this errand for me.

619
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,430
Stocking up on dye is a good idea,

620
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,470
but with Mrs. Hua holding control over Huanhua Creek,

621
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,640
we have no place to wash the silk.

622
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,560
Yaoting, trust me.

623
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,560
We will soon have a place to wash our silk.

624
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,310
Ji Yingying.

625
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,520
Mother!

626
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,070
That's outrageous!

627
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,310
How dare they seize territory

628
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,070
and not let us wash our silks?

629
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,680
That was before.

630
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,880
But now that you are here,

631
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,040
let's see who dares to stand in our way.

632
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,640
Don't worry.

633
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,350
As long as I'm here, I will protect you.

634
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,000
Let's see if they have the courage to act.

635
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,230
Of course...

636
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,190
They are here...

637
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,280
They are here.

638
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,190
Go.

639
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,310
Go.

640
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,350
Starting today,

641
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,230
we will wash our silk here,

642
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,350
be it day or night.

643
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,590
Useless son,

644
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,950
living off others!

645
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,830
Go home and tend to your mother's feet!

646
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,190
Go!

647
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,760
You scoundrels!

648
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,880
I'll fight you.

649
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,950
My father always says

650
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,560
we should think more and act less.

651
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,760
Always persuade others with reason.

652
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,830
Today's goal is to reason

653
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,110
in a harmonious manner.

654
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,160
Why are you just standing there?

655
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:56,950
Get them!

656
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,950
Wait...!

657
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,560
Listen here.

658
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:05,520
We are now under the protection of Mr. Sang.

659
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,160
Try us.

660
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,040
Listen!

661
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,830
At the creek, I am supreme!

662
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,640
Mr. Sang means nothing here!

663
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,070
Who is Mr. Sang?

664
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,950
Get them!

665
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,310
How dare you insult Mr. Sang!

666
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,880
I just did! What will you do now?

667
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,560
Mr. Sang,

668
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:20,400
are we still going to reason in a harmonious manner?

669
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,310
How dare you!

670
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,920
Go!

671
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,190
Hurry...! Follow him.

672
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,520
Get in here!

673
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,560
Go away!

674
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,760
Mr. Sang...

675
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,230
I didn't know it was you, Mr. Sang.

676
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,560
Hit him!

677
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,190
Hit him...!

678
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,680
Hit him...!

679
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,110
Hit him!

680
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,920
Hit him...!

681
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,190
Are you acknowledging defeat?

682
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,590
Hua Xiangrong, you deserve it!

683
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,590
It's them! They are fighting at the creek!

684
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,430
Stop now!

685
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,150
[Brocade Bureau]

686
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,160
Help me see if it's broken!

687
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,640
It's bleeding...

688
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,760
It's bleeding?

689
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,230
It's bleeding!

690
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,950
Hua Xiangrong,

691
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,160
how dare you!

692
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,350
You have struck me until I am wounded!

693
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,110
How dare you!

694
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,710
Mr. Sang, I didn't know it was you!

695
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,040
If I had known,

696
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:38,950
I wouldn't have dared!

697
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:39,760
Not only did he strike you,

698
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,430
but he also insulted you!

699
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,560
He insulted you!

700
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,190
Shut up!

701
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,640
He insulted you.

702
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,520
You shut up!

703
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,560
I remember it now.

704
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,640
You said I mean nothing.

705
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,190
I'm telling you...

706
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,400
He even went as far as to call you a heap of dung!

707
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,400
Did you call me that?

708
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,920
Do you have a death wish?

709
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,880
Shut up!

710
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,310
Father?

711
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,400
Shut up!

712
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,760
I've been injured!

713
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,230
Kneel!

714
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,560
I told you to kneel!

715
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,590
Do you wish to humiliate me further?

716
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,880
You,

717
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,110
come with me.

718
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,680
Yes, sir.

719
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,760
You know as well as I do.

720
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,950
Only silk washed in the waters of Huanhua Creek

721
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,160
can be woven into Shu brocade

722
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,560
with vibrant,

723
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,640
long-lasting colors.

724
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,310
That is what makes it true Shu brocade.

725
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,760
For years,

726
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
dyehouses have seized land along the creek.

727
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,000
These people suffer in silence, while the officers turn a blind eye.

728
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:47,950
Now that Mr. Sang has caused a scene

729
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,710
at the creek,

730
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,640
I fear those with ulterior motives will take advantage of this.

731
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,800
Her Highness is highly favored in the palace.

732
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,110
If those who envy her

733
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:01,190
cannot act within the palace,

734
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,640
they will surely strike from without.

735
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,920
If His Majesty hears that

736
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,040
her family has become haughty, oppressive, and unruly

737
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,160
due to

738
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,230
her position,

739
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:10,760
what do you suppose he will think of her?

740
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,590
Those with ulterior motives?

741
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
Isn't she standing before me now?

742
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,560
It's true I have my own motives,

743
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,520
but

744
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,800
they are honorable ones.

745
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,590
Do you know

746
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,160
who lured Mr. Sang to the creek?

747
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,760
So, you already know.

748
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,920
What makes you any different?

749
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,400
I can guide your son

750
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,830
to abandon his reckless ways

751
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,160
and become a man of honor and integrity.

752
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,640
You?

753
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,190
How exactly would you manage that?

754
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,430
I trust you have inquired into

755
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,800
the present state of the Ji family

756
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,040
and taken measure of the kind of person I am,

757
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,920
following our last meeting.

758
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,760
The notorious Ms. Spitfire of Huanhua Creek.

759
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,760
I'll admit, you do possess a certain boldness.

760
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,830
Speak.

761
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,640
What do you want?

762
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:10,760
This incident

763
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,280
arose from disputes over territory at Huanhua Creek.

764
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:15,710
It's particularly sensitive as it involves Shu brocade.

765
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,070
But if the creek belongs to everyone

766
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,350
and private claims are forbidden,

767
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,560
then your son was simply playing by the creek

768
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,950
and got into a fight.

769
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,760
You are saying...

770
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,950
I ask that you establish a new rule

771
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,190
clearly stating that Huanhua Creek is to be shared by all,

772
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,760
and that no individual shall have exclusive rights to wash silk there.

773
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,160
Do you believe they will heed the rule merely because I issue it?

774
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,800
Which of the major dyehouses claiming land along the creek

775
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,350
does not have powerful support behind it?

776
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,640
Your rule would reflect your position.

777
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,950
Should they defy it, it would plainly reveal their contempt for the law.

778
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,160
If I establish this rule, it would imply that you too have powerful backing.

779
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,350
At the very least,

780
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,800
they wouldn't dare to drive you away again. Am I correct?

781
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,310
I believe that,

782
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,830
if given the opportunity,

783
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,430
you have the ability to restore the Ji family

784
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,230
to its former glory.

785
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,350
This is something I have embroidered myself.

786
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,100
[Wealth]
I am giving it to you.

787
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,920
What is the matter? Don't you want it?

788
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,280
Do you think it's ugly?

789
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,680
Did I make it that obvious?

790
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Zhao Xiuyuan!

791
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,920
Give it to me.

792
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,430
No!

793
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,680
I just meant

794
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,070
I'm afraid I won't be able to become a wealthy person.

795
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,920
Do you know why I'm giving this to you?

796
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,640
It's because you don't lack wisdom.

797
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,230
You are already brimming with creative ideas

798
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,230
and destined for greatness.

799
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:00,830
You lack neither resources

800
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,760
nor short of financial stability.

801
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,350
It is because you have always sought both high and low,

802
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,430
leaving no room for oversight.

803
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Since I am without means,

804
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
allow me to offer you a painting instead.

805
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,230
[A great roc rises with the wind, soaring to the heavens]
Though there's no roc in the painting,

806
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,670
the rolling clouds capture its majestic ascent.

807
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,560
A lone woman stands at the bow of a ship,

808
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,040
radiating grace with effortless charm.

809
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Who says women cannot sail against the tide?

810
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,560
Who says they cannot shine with ambition?

811
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,760
But why does this woman's silhouette

812
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,280
seem so familiar?

813
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,150
Soaring to the heavens.

814
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,000
Is that not

815
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,470
how I perceive you?

816
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,560
So even you know

817
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,390
how to flatter people.

818
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,520
Let's turn this painting into brocade.

819
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,630
The clouds, water, the ship,

820
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,560
and even the woman.

821
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
If done properly,

822
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,950
it should not be too difficult to weave.

823
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,600
Yet,

824
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,470
capturing the vast essence of the painting

825
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,150
is no easy task.

826
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,430
Perhaps we could use a five-layer shuttle?

827
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,760
With more blended colors,

828
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,910
we could adjust the number of black and white threads

829
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,520
to create varying shades of gray.

830
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,120
This could work for capturing the shadows in the clouds and the waves.

831
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,080
Shadows are indeed a good idea,

832
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,470
but if limited to black and white,

833
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,670
the entire piece may seem lifeless.

834
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:45,560
We could alternate plain and twill weaves

835
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,230
to mimic

836
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,150
the flow of nature.

837
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,430
By adjusting the dominant colors,

838
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,320
we can create transitions and a sense of movement.

839
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,560
Use both plain and twill weaves

840
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,950
for texture,

841
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,560
and different colors to emphasize light and shadow.

842
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,470
If we do it like this,

843
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,710
we might truly capture

844
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,560
the vast essence of the painting.

845
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,670
Alright. I'll pick the threads and colors right away.

846
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,120
I'll embroider a sample.

847
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,870
Don't you still have something important to do?

848
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,280
The only thing I need to do now is wait.

849
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,470
Besides, this is important too.

850
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,560
I'll leave first.

851
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,360
[Wealth]

852
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:36,870
I know I was in the wrong, my dear.

853
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,470
I brought shame upon the Hua family.

854
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,710
I wanted to use that punk

855
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,000
to teach the Ji family a lesson.

856
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,560
Who would've thought Ji Yingying would be the one to benefit instead?

857
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,190
Come here.

858
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,760
Sit down.

859
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,360
I admit I was careless this time, my dear.

860
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,600
That is why I lost.

861
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,150
But next time, I'll make sure to teach them a real lesson.

862
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,600
How many times have I told you?

863
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,150
Don't get involved personally.

864
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,560
Given your stature,

865
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,000
fight only if victory is certain,

866
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,870
if not then, flee!

867
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,230
Gently, my dear.

868
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,080
My dear,

869
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,360
please don't be upset.

870
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,600
I promise I'll listen to you.

871
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,390
Later,

872
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,430
prepare the carriage for me.

873
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,470
I'm going out.

874
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,950
Are you going to see the master?

875
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,390
There is no need for him

876
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,600
to act right now.

877
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,430
Simply cause enough trouble

878
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,080
to compel Chief Sang to settle down.

879
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,630
Judging by your expression, Ms. Ji,

880
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,430
you don't seem pleased to see me here.

881
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,950
But alas,

882
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,870
a wager is a wager.

883
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,390
Surely, you won't go back on your word, will you?

884
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,080
Of course I won't.

885
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,220
Mr. Yang, this way.

886
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:36,190
[Hesheng Rice Store]

887
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,950
Excuse me!

888
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,280
Where are you running off to?

889
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,800
Even with my limited knowledge,

890
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,840
I know that shortcuts will not lead us there.

891
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,760
You wouldn't understand.

892
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,190
In my family,

893
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,950
the more distinguished the guest,

894
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,800
the more secluded the reception.

895
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,800
Guo Kui, you can't bite him!

896
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,870
Be careful! He is venomous!

897
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Are you Guo Kui?

898
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,470
Well,

899
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,390
it seems even dogs fear villains.

900
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,230
Yingying?

901
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,840
Yaoting!

902
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,120
Who is this?

903
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,870
My name is Yang.

904
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,800
An honored guest of Ms. Ji.

905
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,390
He is a mere acquaintance.

906
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
Is Mother home, Yaoting?

907
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,760
I've been weaving brocade in my room,

908
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,950
so I haven't been to the front yard.

909
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,760
But based on her routine,

910
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,950
Mother is likely out procuring supplies.

911
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,000
That's great!

912
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,630
Yaoting, please fetch some water for Mr. Yang.

913
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,190
He seems to have a fondness for the water from our household.

914
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,760
Okay.

915
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,560
No rush.

916
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,280
I did not come here

917
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,600
merely to ask for water.

918
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,870
Rather, I came to visit an old acquaintance.

919
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,280
An old acquaintance? Who might that be?

920
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,520
I recall that your father, Mr. Ji Guinan,

921
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,600
won the weaving competition years ago.

922
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,040
His red Shu brocade earned resounding applause.

923
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,560
I was captivated by its brilliance.

924
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,230
Even after

925
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,190
all these years,

926
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,800
I still cannot forget it.

927
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,600
Yet, who could have imagined that

928
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,040
everything would change, and nothing remains as it once was?

929
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,800
Are you here just to reminisce, Mr. Yang?

930
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,230
You have spent so many years

931
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,190
with your father, Mr. Ji.

932
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,840
Surely, you must have inherited some of his skills.

933
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,840
I fear I may disappoint you, Mr. Yang.

934
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,600
When it comes to dyeing silk,

935
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,600
I am rather average

936
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,390
compared to Yingying.

937
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,360
Most of the silk in our home is dyed by her.

938
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,600
Is the dyed silk hanging here to dry?

939
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,390
Some is in the front yard.

940
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,600
Yaoting, why don't you fetch the water?

941
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,360
Okay.

942
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,800
No need to hurry.

943
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:18,230
This is my first time visiting a brocade family such as yours.

944
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,190
Ms. Ji,

945
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,800
why don't you show me around?

946
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,280
I would love to have a closer look.

947
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,800
Our home is modest.

948
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,150
There's not much of interest to see.

949
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,600
A simple home

950
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,280
can possess its own unique charm.

951
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,320
Get some water?

952
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:50,580
[Mrs. Zhao, Zhao Xiuyuan's mother]

953
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:53,040
It is an honor to have you

954
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,190
visit our home, Mrs. Zhao.

955
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,390
My daughter and Mr. Zhao have known each other since childhood.

956
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,840
Have we not already discussed this matter?

957
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,000
It is just that the Zhao family

958
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,390
is particularly strict with the sons.

959
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,950
We do not allow him to marry

960
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,230
unless he has accomplished something.

961
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,470
As a mother, how could I not be anxious about my son's future?

962
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:17,470
Yet, I cannot make such decisions in the family.

963
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,630
I see...

964
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,390
I understand your position, Mrs. Zhao.

965
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:26,150
I only hope you will speak kindly of us

966
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,390
to your husband.

967
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,950
To be honest,

968
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,520
one can marry

969
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,760
before achieving success.

970
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,630
Do you think I have not tried?

971
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,950
But my husband merely picked up his cup and said to me

972
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,600
the tea costs but three coins a liang,

973
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,950
yet it is served in a cup worth ten liang of silver.

974
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,870
Do you think they are a good match?
