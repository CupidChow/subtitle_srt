00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,890
[Nanzhao]

4
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,560
It's not that I didn't want to tell you,

5
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,720
but right now,

6
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,560
we are already thousands of miles away from Yizhou.

7
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
Even if I told you,

8
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,360
it would be beyond your reach.

9
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,520
So,

10
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,480
why invite unnecessary trouble?

11
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,520
Where are Pin and the others?

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,200
They traveled faster

13
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,520
and should already be there.

14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Perhaps they've even settled in.

15
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,920
Rest assured,

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,680
I will arrange for you to meet them.

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
Do you know

18
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,160
why I've had this carriage

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
move so slowly?

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,600
Because

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,520
I wanted you to see the scenery of Nanzhao.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,720
After seeing so much of Yizhou's landscape,

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,320
it's hard to hold anything else in my heart.

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,320
Have you heard of "Wang Zhaojun Departs for the Frontier"?

25
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,600
She married into a land thousands of miles away.

26
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
From that point on,

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,240
the Xiongnu and Han

28
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,520
became one family.

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,360
Have you heard of Su Wu herding sheep?

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,080
Imprisoned for 19 years,

31
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,480
yet his loyalty never changed.

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,920
I never believed

33
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
there's a business deal that can't be made.

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,960
It all depends

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
on the price.

36
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,480
Why are you walking so fast?

37
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,200
[Inn]
Do you know which room to go to?

38
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,520
Go attend to her.

39
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,320
Are the clothes ready?

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,120
Yes, they're at the inn.

41
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,120
Have someone deliver them.

42
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,960
Let her change into them.

43
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,880
Your Highness, those clothes are...

44
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,360
If she refuses,

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,120
tell her

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
that harming the people she cares about

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,240
is something

48
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,040
I wouldn't hesitate.

49
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,960
Understood.

50
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Goddess Leizu,

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,360
you always protect silkworms.

52
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,400
You will also bless the brocade makers, right?

53
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,040
Please watch over my family in Yizhou,

54
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,480
keeping them safe.

55
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,840
Help the kidnapped craftsmen return home soon.

56
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,400
And bless me...

57
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,520
Am I asking for too much?

58
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,120
Then, please prioritize protecting them.

59
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
I can protect myself.

60
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
In this desolate wilderness,

61
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,840
there's nothing much to eat.

62
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,240
So,

63
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,240
just make do and eat this with me.

64
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,000
When we enter the city tomorrow,

65
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,920
I will throw you

66
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,240
a banquet to welcome you.

67
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,960
Come, have a seat.

68
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,640
Beautiful.

69
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,720
There was a beauty in the Central Plains

70
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,000
who loved the sound of silk tearing.

71
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
To make her smile,

72
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,680
her king

73
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,080
gathered brocade from all over the land

74
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,080
and let her tear it at will.

75
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,800
From then on,

76
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,600
they were inseparable.

77
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,120
For the outfit you're wearing,

78
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,440
I had three of them made.

79
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,280
If you really like using it as a hand towel,

80
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,240
I can have more

81
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,640
made for you.

82
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,790
Even if you have ambitions for the throne,

83
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,840
I have no aspirations of becoming your beauty.

84
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,920
And,

85
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,320
you didn't hear the whole story.

86
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,160
That king...

87
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,160
eventually lost his kingdom.

88
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,560
I'm full. Excuse me.

89
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,960
Did you add something to the food?

90
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,640
You...

91
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,640
No need to worry.

92
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,200
What are you trying to do?

93
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,440
I only hope

94
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,840
you can sleep more comfortably.

95
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,160
What are you afraid of?

96
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,000
If I want someone,

97
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,200
I'll make it perfectly clear.

98
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Welcome back, Your Highness!

99
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,280
Your Highness.

100
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,920
Shh.

101
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
Don't disturb the princess consort.

102
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,440
Could she be the rumored divine maiden?

103
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,560
How could she be a divine maiden?

104
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,720
She's just Prince Bai's consort.

105
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
How dare you gossip about His Highness?

106
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,400
Do you have a death wish?

107
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,560
This servant deserves to die!

108
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,760
She's wearing the princess consort's clothes.

109
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,600
That's proof of His Highness's determination.

110
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Does His Highness think

111
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,000
that declaring her as the Prince Bai's consort first

112
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
will stop the king from taking her as his wife?

113
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,960
Throughout history,

114
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,560
if an emperor truly desires a woman,

115
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,960
even if she takes holy orders,

116
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,280
marriage and childbirth won't stop him.

117
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,640
His Highness surely has already considered

118
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,240
what we can think of.

119
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,960
Look,

120
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,440
these flowers and plants

121
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,600
are brought here

122
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,760
all the way from Yizhou just for you.

123
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,520
Seeing these

124
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,600
plants and flowers,

125
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,560
don't you

126
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,040
feel closer

127
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,600
to home?

128
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,360
Plants have spirits.

129
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,400
They will wither away

130
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,160
far from their native soil.

131
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,760
But I believe,

132
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,120
as long as I care for them attentively,

133
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,600
they will

134
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,320
adapt and take root.

135
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,480
Don't you think?

136
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,920
Let me tell you this:

137
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,120
if you intend to bite your tongue and end your life,

138
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,120
after you die,

139
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,680
I will make those craftsmen

140
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,080
join you in the grave.

141
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,360
Do you understand?

142
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,840
You won't.

143
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,720
You've risked everything

144
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,960
to rescue those craftsmen.

145
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,840
You won't give up for anyone.

146
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,760
Nor am I trying to end my life.

147
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,960
I only want to tell you,

148
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,960
the people I care about are in your hands now.

149
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,920
I can give in,

150
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,960
I can compromise,

151
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,560
but I have my limits.

152
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,320
Please don't test me any further.

153
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,720
Don't come any closer.

154
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,280
Ms. Ji, you're so clever,

155
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,480
you must be aware of my feelings for you.

156
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,520
You like me

157
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,480
the way one admires a fine porcelain vase.

158
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,560
He wants to possess it,

159
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
to toy with it,

160
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,160
but he doesn't care what it feels.

161
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
He doesn't care what it wants to do,

162
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,160
or where it wants to go.

163
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,720
This isn't affection,

164
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
nor is it love.

165
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,680
It's selfishness,

166
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,720
possessiveness,

167
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,760
plunder.

168
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,880
Plunder?

169
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,880
Shu brocade has hundreds of patterns,

170
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,800
and love has thousands of forms.

171
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,920
Ms. Ji,

172
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,200
you'll get used to it.

173
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,560
I heard

174
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,280
you were ambushed in Yizhou.

175
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,200
[Sheng Fengyou, King of Nanzhao]

176
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Were you seriously hurt?

177
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
Replying to Your Majesty,

178
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
I'm much better now.

179
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,160
[Du Yan]

180
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,520
Thank you for your concern.

181
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
You're my brother, after all.

182
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,880
As your elder brother,

183
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,480
I have to look out for you.

184
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,880
Your Majesty,

185
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,520
I am guilty.

186
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,120
I've been pretending to be ill at home,

187
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,200
but in truth,

188
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,120
I secretly traveled to Yizhou

189
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,880
to capture craftsmen.

190
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,880
However, I didn't expect

191
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,480
to be outplayed by Niu Jin,

192
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,480
almost losing my life in Yizhou.

193
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,760
Acting on my own initiative,

194
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
I am undoubtedly guilty beyond pardon.

195
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,760
But, Your Majesty,

196
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,480
those craftsmen are priceless.

197
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
They can make our Nanzhao brocade industry

198
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,840
renowned for generations.

199
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Please take a look, Your Majesty.

200
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,760
Bring it here.

201
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,760
Every craftsman listed in this book

202
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,040
is the finest in Yizhou.

203
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,960
With them here,

204
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,240
Nanzhao will never again

205
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,000
need to purchase brocade from Yizhou.

206
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,480
Your Majesty,

207
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,200
this year alone, we've purchased

208
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,600
at least fifty bolts of brocade monthly from Tang.

209
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,400
If it's truly as Prince Bai claims

210
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,560
and this endeavor is priceless,

211
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,480
then, in the future, our monthly brocade production

212
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,080
should not fall below fifty bolts.

213
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Fifty bolts?

214
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,760
Can you accomplish that, Prince?

215
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,760
Replying to Your Majesty,

216
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,640
those Yizhou craftsmen are not yet accustomed to the environment.

217
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,200
I suggest

218
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,000
giving them a month to recover.

219
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,800
Starting next month, we can make fifty bolts a month.

220
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,320
But I've heard

221
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,360
the chaos

222
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,360
and uproar caused

223
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,880
were all because Prince Bai

224
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,240
couldn't let go of a woman.

225
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,760
Rumor has it

226
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,400
she is a divine maiden capable of blessing emperors.

227
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,480
I initially thought

228
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Prince Bai had gone to such great lengths,

229
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,440
even tarnishing our Nanzhao's reputation

230
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,950
to bring back this divine maiden

231
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,470
to offer her to Your Majesty

232
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,400
for the prosperity of Nanzhao.

233
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,440
But unexpectedly,

234
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,310
the common folk now say this divine maiden

235
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,720
is actually Prince Bai's consort.

236
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,510
Prince, tell us,

237
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,230
is this woman a divine maiden

238
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,440
or your consort?

239
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,000
Your Majesty,

240
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,590
I've never heard of any divine maiden.

241
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,550
Ning,

242
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,110
you tell us,

243
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,040
does Prince have a particular fondness for this woman?

244
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,390
Replying to Your Majesty,

245
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,230
I wouldn't know.

246
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,670
All I know

247
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,590
is that this woman is from Yizhou.

248
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,480
Even if she were a divine maiden,

249
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,640
her blessings would only bring peace to Tang.

250
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,670
If she stays in our Nanzhao,

251
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,230
I'm afraid it would have the opposite effect.

252
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,670
Prince Bai brought her back

253
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,000
only because

254
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,440
she is exceptionally talented.

255
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,310
She alone equals hundreds of craftsmen.

256
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,230
One woman can rival hundreds of craftsmen?

257
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,790
Then

258
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,790
I must meet her myself.

259
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
Ji Yingying greets Your Majesty.

260
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,480
What kind of bow is that?

261
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,630
It is a Tang-style bow.

262
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,800
Why perform a Tang bow

263
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,630
here in Nanzhao?

264
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,720
Only two types of people

265
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,030
bow to a foreign king in the style of their own nation:

266
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,190
traitors and captives.

267
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,440
I don't think, for Nanzhao's honor,

268
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,440
anyone would

269
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,910
refer to our Yizhou craftsmen in such terms.

270
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,960
Yingying,

271
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,870
don't be rude

272
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,910
in front of His Majesty.

273
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,590
Prince Bai says

274
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,440
he wants to take you as his consort,

275
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,520
but others say you are a divine maiden destined to match emperors.

276
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,240
Then tell me,

277
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,800
what kind of person you want to be.

278
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,400
Rumors are spreading throughout Nanzhao

279
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:50,030
that I brought back a divine maiden destined for emperors.

280
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,910
But they don't realize the palace will truly imprison you.

281
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,630
If you don't want to go,

282
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,630
you

283
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,840
should know what you need to do.

284
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Replying to Your Majesty,

285
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,840
I don't want either option.

286
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,030
I want to make a deal with Your Majesty.

287
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,400
A deal?

288
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,440
Interesting.

289
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,440
What kind of deal do you want to make with me?

290
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,840
Without brocade,

291
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,470
even the King of Nanzhao

292
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,240
can only use plain brocade to embroider the sacred golden bird.

293
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,120
But plain brocade

294
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,470
is merely an inner garment for our Tang concubines.

295
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,870
How dare you!

296
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,150
Such insolence, insulting His Majesty!

297
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,280
Guards!

298
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,240
Let her speak.

299
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,840
Your Majesty, please look at this first.

300
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,520
What is this?

301
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,190
This is Shu Red Brocade from Yizhou,

302
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,830
woven by my father,

303
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,830
Ji Guinan, the Brocade Master of Yizhou.

304
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:15,920
Prince Bai

305
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,800
brought countless craftsmen and patterns from Yizhou.

306
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,120
He merely seeks to replicate Shu brocade patterns.

307
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,440
But even if Shu brocade is dyed and woven in Nanzhao,

308
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,440
it will still be Shu brocade.

309
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,120
Doesn't Your Majesty

310
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,440
wish for Nanzhao to have its own brocade?

311
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,040
A brocade named after Your Majesty's kingdom,

312
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,920
renowned for generations as the Nanzhao Brocade.

313
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,480
Nanzhao Brocade?

314
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Are you capable?

315
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,800
Yes, I am.

316
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,240
I recreated my father's Shu Red Silk.

317
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,390
I dyed a new shade, Flushed Rose.

318
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,680
I worked with brocade households to create a new pattern,

319
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,240
Rippling Grain Brocade.

320
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,680
I revolutionized brocade regulations,

321
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,070
making Yizhou's brocade industry thrive anew.

322
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,120
My value as an artisan

323
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,830
far surpasses my value as a woman.

324
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,870
With my skills, I can create Nanzhao Brocade,

325
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,680
ensuring Your Majesty's everlasting legacy.

326
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:22,240
Everlasting legacy...

327
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,480
That's a tempting business proposition.

328
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,680
It is,

329
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,480
because I have a significant request

330
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,040
for Your Majesty.

331
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
When Nanzhao Brocade is completed,

332
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,120
I hope Your Majesty will allow the craftsmen of Yizhou to return home.

333
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
But...

334
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,270
It was Prince Bai who invited you

335
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,710
here as guests.

336
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,270
How could I send you away

337
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,190
so lightly?

338
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,270
In our Tang,

339
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,920
the emperor is the Son of Heaven.

340
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,310
His word is law,

341
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,830
and no one dares defy him.

342
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,240
Is it the same in Nanzhao?

343
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,440
In Nanzhao,

344
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,870
is that how it is?

345
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,440
In our Nanzhao,

346
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,390
naturally, the king's word is law.

347
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,190
However,

348
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,830
I've heard that developing a new brocade

349
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,480
takes a long time.

350
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,310
If it takes ten years or more,

351
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,830
wouldn't all of Prince Bai's efforts be wasted?

352
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,830
Ten years or more?

353
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,680
Didn't you say

354
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,600
you alone could rival hundreds of craftsmen?

355
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,270
Then I'll give you one year

356
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,830
to create Nanzhao Brocade.

357
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,120
Your Majesty,

358
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,520
a year is too short...

359
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
I'm not negotiating with you.

360
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,200
Fine.

361
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,080
One year it is.

362
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,120
I will create a sample of Nanzhao Brocade.

363
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,840
We will toil day and night

364
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,480
to meet Your Majesty's expectations.

365
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,000
Please put it in writing, Your Majesty.

366
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,240
Ji Yingying,

367
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,440
don't push your luck.

368
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,400
You

369
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,800
don't trust me?

370
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,800
It's not that I don't trust Your Majesty.

371
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,080
To make a deal with Your Majesty is an honor.

372
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,720
But in the future,

373
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,120
if there's no proof,

374
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,480
others might think I'm making things up.

375
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,840
Since Your Majesty's word is law,

376
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,440
what harm is there in putting it in writing?

377
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,480
Please grant us your word, Your Majesty.

378
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,680
Bring me a pen.

379
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,000
[Nanzhao Brocade Complete, Craftsmen Return]

380
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

381
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,680
These Yizhou craftsmen are numerous and diverse.

382
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,280
You, Qingping Officer, cannot simply stand by.

383
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Assign some people to assist Prince Bai,

384
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,960
lest my younger brother

385
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,080
acts impulsively again.

386
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,400
Understood.

387
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,840
I will fully support Prince Bai.

388
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,400
A year from now,

389
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,520
if you complete Nanzhao Brocade,

390
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,440
I will send people to escort you back.

391
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,400
If you fail,

392
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,320
for every day past the deadline,

393
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,840
ten craftsmen will be lost.

394
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,040
And if not a single one remains,

395
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,440
then regarding the current situation in Yizhou,

396
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,520
I will have Prince Bai explain it personally to Tang.

397
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,800
I will inform the Emperor of Tang

398
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,320
that as long as peace prevails between our two nations,

399
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,040
the lives of envoys are of no concern.

400
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,600
Eager to return,

401
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,240
are you?

402
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,000
Yes, I admit,

403
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,440
you are a remarkably intelligent woman.

404
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,440
But you don't understand Nanzhao,

405
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
nor do you understand His Majesty.

406
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,760
And you understand even less

407
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,840
the fierce struggles in the court.

408
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,720
So what?

409
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,640
I may understand nothing,

410
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,440
but I know that doing this might get us home.

411
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,240
Even if there's only a sliver of hope,

412
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
I have to try.

413
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,320
Even if it costs your life?

414
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,840
Even if His Majesty keeps his word,

415
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,440
what can you accomplish

416
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
in a year?

417
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,680
So, did you intend

418
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,440
to let us return after a year?

419
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,040
If by then you refuse to enter Tang alone,

420
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,520
please arrange for me to meet with the craftsmen soon

421
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,000
to start developing the new brocade.

422
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,240
Very well.

423
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,800
Since

424
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,880
you're so eager to visit the weaving camp,

425
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,320
I'll grant your wish.

426
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,720
I'll take you there to see for yourself.

427
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,120
I've heard that Prince Bai worked tirelessly

428
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,480
and spent a fortune to bring you from Yizhou.

429
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,600
But Prince Bai

430
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,600
acted in haste.

431
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,040
Some unqualified people have inevitably mixed in.

432
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,560
So, I'll inspect you on Prince Bai's behalf

433
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,680
to see if you're worth the cost.

434
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
Starting from the first row,

435
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,280
show us your skills, one by one.

436
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,240
We are brocade weavers,

437
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,720
not performers.

438
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,240
What's there to show?

439
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,040
That's right. We won't weave.

440
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,320
We refuse!

441
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,330
Fine.

442
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,600
Since the two of you refuse to weave,

443
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,640
step forward first.

444
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,160
Now then,

445
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,080
anyone else unwilling to weave?

446
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,040
This is the result of your stubbornness,

447
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,480
refusing to become my consort

448
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,240
and insisting on making deals with my elder brother.

449
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,880
You are under my protection.

450
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,040
Do you think

451
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,920
Du Yan will let you succeed

452
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,840
in this deal?

453
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,240
Just to undermine me,

454
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,440
he'll do everything he can to target you and them.

455
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,440
You knew he would come,

456
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,240
and you could have saved them!

457
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,240
I could have saved them,

458
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
but I chose not to.

459
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,040
Because

460
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,640
you've wasted my goodwill.

461
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,800
Don't you enjoy doing business?

462
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:00,720
Fine.

463
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,320
I'll grant your wish

464
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,680
and discuss business with you.

465
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
The key to doing business

466
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,000
is making both parties happy.

467
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,760
However,

468
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,840
I'm not happy right now.

469
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,480
Sheng Fengze, I need the brocade completed,

470
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,720
and so do you!

471
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,800
We both want the craftsmen to stay alive,

472
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,600
don't we?

473
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
I need craftsmen,

474
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
but I don't need all of them!

475
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,120
I only need those who are obedient and useful.

476
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,080
But you,

477
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,440
you want them to be safe.

478
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,640
That's the biggest difference between us.

479
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,440
So what do you want to do now?

480
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,800
Ms. Ji, I think

481
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,280
you should recognize your place.

482
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,840
Here's a piece of advice:

483
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,120
Your bottom line

484
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,920
could perhaps be lowered a bit more.

485
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,240
Let me ask again.

486
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,120
Who else doesn't want to weave?

487
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,360
I'm willing.

488
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,920
Sir,

489
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,400
it's not that they don't want to show their skills,

490
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
but their expertise

491
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,240
requires prior steps

492
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,320
to be effective.

493
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,040
Please don't be angry.

494
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,120
I am here under royal orders

495
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,720
to assist the Prince Bai with brocade weaving.

496
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,320
If you perform well,

497
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,440
His Majesty will reward you generously.

498
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,880
But if not,

499
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,200
Nanzhao does not feed idlers.

500
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,640
So he's the only one willing to weave?

501
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
We are dyers.

502
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,360
We dye silk and match colors.

503
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,120
Dyers, you say?

504
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,800
Come on,

505
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,240
all dyers, come forward.

506
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,520
Move.

507
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,960
Move.

508
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Listen up.

509
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,440
In Nanzhao, we don't have silkworms

510
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,040
that can produce silk suitable for Shu brocade.

511
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,040
What use are you dyers to us?

512
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,000
See,

513
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,240
the Prince Bai indeed brought back some useless people!

514
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,080
Cut them down.

515
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,160
Yes, sir.

516
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,440
No,

517
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,400
I...

518
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,240
Wait!

519
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,710
The royal decree was just issued,

520
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,320
and yet you, Qingping Officer, have already barged in.

521
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,440
You're certainly diligent.

522
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,190
Prince Bai, you're over-thinking.

523
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,880
I feared you might fail to produce brocade

524
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,190
and face His Majesty's punishment,

525
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,190
so I hurried over

526
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,880
to help you deal with these useless people.

527
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:50,670
These people

528
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,440
were brought here by me.

529
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,880
Whether they're useful or not

530
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,840
should be up to me.

531
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,880
My princess consort,

532
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,640
what do you think?

533
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,240
Are they useful?

534
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,920
They are skilled craftsmen from Yizhou.

535
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,440
If we want to weave brocade,

536
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,840
not a single one of them can be spared.

537
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,920
I ask Prince Bai

538
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:19,920
to show them kindness.

539
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,680
Princess Consort?

540
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,440
Didn't you just say

541
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,240
that your value as an artisan

542
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,040
far outweighs your value as a woman?

543
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
How quickly you're changed.

544
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,120
I think so too.

545
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,040
But for people,

546
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,320
true realization

547
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,440
always comes in an instant.

548
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,240
Tell them,

549
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,000
whose person

550
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,320
are you?

551
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,920
I belong to Prince Bai.

552
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Prince Bai's person?

553
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,840
All of my subordinates belong to me.

554
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,040
You must clearly tell the Qingping Officer

555
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,440
that you are to become my consort.

556
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,800
I am to become Prince Bai's consort.

557
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,200
If the princess consort believes they're all useful,

558
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,240
then I believe her.

559
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,400
Qingping Officer,

560
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,680
what do you think?

561
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,720
I believe,

562
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,600
Prince Bai, your lifelong reputation

563
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,040
has been clouded by fleeting desires.

564
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,720
That is unwise.

565
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,440
If I recall correctly,

566
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,480
His Majesty's decree was for you to assist me,

567
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,040
not to command me.

568
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,040
If you've forgotten,

569
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,000
we can go ask His Majesty together for clarification.

570
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,640
There's no need.

571
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,240
I remember them very clearly

572
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,520
fifty bolts of brocade per month and the one-year agreement.

573
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,440
Prince Bai, you carry a heavy burden.

574
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,800
I won't disturb you further.

575
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,240
These subordinates are left to assist you in weaving brocade.

576
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,080
Prince Bai, please look after us...

577
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,800
If you wish to stay in my domain,

578
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,640
you must abide by my rules.

579
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,200
The first rule is:

580
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,080
If I don't call for you,

581
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,240
don't speak out of turn!

582
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,640
Understood.

583
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,200
Now leave!

584
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,800
Chi Hu.

585
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,480
At your service.

586
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,640
I leave this to you.

587
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,640
I promised the princess consort

588
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,240
that not a single one of these people would be harmed.

589
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,400
Understood.

590
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,720
Thank you, Prince Bai.

591
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Listen up, all of you!

592
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,360
Starting next month,

593
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,440
produce fifty bolts of brocade per month.

594
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,440
This is my promise to His Majesty.

595
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,240
If it's not achieved,

596
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,960
my blade

597
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,160
is no slower than the Qingping Officer's.

598
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,280
The King of Nanzhao has agreed:

599
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
if we create brocade unique to Nanzhao,

600
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,440
he will let us return to Yizhou.

601
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,560
It's getting late.

602
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,880
Dear, let's head home.

603
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,760
Could you leave Yingying here?

604
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,040
Creating new brocade

605
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,480
requires collective effort.

606
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,160
Instead of her working alone,

607
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,920
it would be better to leave her here.

608
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,840
Everyone working together will yield results faster.

609
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,040
Yes,

610
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,800
with Yingying working alongside us,

611
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,160
the new brocade can be achieved sooner.

612
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:18,960
That's right.

613
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,800
With Yingying here,

614
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,080
there's hope for reaching the quota.

615
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,480
Chi Hu will oversee

616
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
things here.

617
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,080
Let's go.

618
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,840
Live well.

619
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,920
Developing new brocade

620
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,520
requires teamwork and collaboration.

621
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,960
I can't do it alone.

622
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,960
When you truly need them,

623
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,920
I will

624
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,440
let you see them.

625
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,240
I'm not Zhao Xiuyuan.

626
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,560
Even if I were to cage you like a songbird,

627
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,960
I'd provide you

628
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,520
with a gilded cage big enough.

629
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,840
You could do whatever you like,

630
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,640
except

631
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,080
leave me.

632
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,080
But if the brocade isn't completed,

633
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,280
we'll both die.

634
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,280
So,

635
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,440
my life

636
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,440
is in your hands, Ms. Ji.

637
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,600
You can take

638
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,080
this dagger.

639
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,240
If you want to kill me,

640
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,680
you can use this dagger.

641
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,480
It's sharper.

642
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,760
It'll make my death swift,

643
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,160
leaving no time for sorrow.

644
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,880
Do you truly want someone

645
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,040
who might kill you every day?

646
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,960
I bet

647
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,360
she won't.

648
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,920
If you push her further,

649
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,040
she might lose her mind

650
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,240
and take you down with her.

651
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,280
I still bet she won't.

652
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,280
Because she knows clearly

653
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,080
that in Nanzhao,

654
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,360
I'm the only one who believes

655
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,520
they're valuable.

656
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,880
Ji Yingying,

657
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,720
my life to come

658
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,320
will be left in your hands.
