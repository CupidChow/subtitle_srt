[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,600
The three of us share a bond forged through life and death,

4
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,920
so I will be frank.

5
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,200
If the day ever comes

6
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,440
when I am left with no choice

7
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,240
but to betray the Commissioner,

8
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,590
would you two stand by me?

9
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,160
May I ask what could possibly drive you

10
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,720
to such an extreme, General Niu?

11
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,240
I am sure you have heard the rumors.

12
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,110
Chang'an is investigating me.

13
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,840
It is all thanks to Yang Jinglan

14
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,790
who is causing chaos in Yizhou

15
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,590
and fabricating charges against me.

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,200
I am already walking a tightrope over the edge.

17
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,670
If these charges are false,

18
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,030
surely the Commissioner, given his trust in you,

19
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,270
will uncover the truth

20
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,630
and do everything he can to protect you.

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,390
Does truth ever exist in this world?

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,670
What if the Commissioner decides to throw me to the wolves to save himself?

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,030
What am I supposed to do, then?

24
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,880
The Commissioner has his own considerations when making decisions.

25
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,070
No matter what,

26
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,350
you must remain loyal to him.

27
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,240
What a truly loyal and honorable man.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
Chen,

29
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,560
I am glad

30
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,270
you did not disappoint me in this test.

31
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,920
It is rare to have a friend like you

32
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,150
in life.

33
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,760
Here!

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,070
Come on.

35
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,920
Chen, here is a toast to you.

36
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,680
Yes. All right.

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,120
Cheers!

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,320
Niu Jin!

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,070
Why…? Why did you do that?

40
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,560
It is a shame to lose such a loyal and honorable man.

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,680
I cannot believe he chose duty

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
over reality.

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,040
Li, you are a man who values friendship deeply.

44
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,320
You would not make the same choice,

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,040
would you?

46
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,840
If I become Commissioner one day,

47
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,990
I will hand over

48
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,760
the position of Deputy General to you.

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,070
I will listen to your command, Commissioner.

50
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,350
Li, you are being too hasty.

51
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,160
If Commissioner Mu values our past relationship

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,550
and supports me,

53
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,040
we will still be like brothers.

54
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,670
But if things take a turn,

55
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,670
then the position of Deputy General will fall to you, Li.

56
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,070
I am willing to serve you, Commissioner!

57
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,510
Great!

58
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,550
Here is a toast to you, Deputy General Li.

59
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,230
Cheers, Commissioner Niu!

60
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,760
Yingying!

61
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,440
Tubo.

62
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,880
We are finally here.

63
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,160
We have finally navigated

64
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,680
through this trade route.

65
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,760
Sheng Dalang,

66
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,520
look!

67
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,720
We are finally here.

68
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,880
But without trust, there is no foundation.

69
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,160
I am not quick-witted,

70
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,320
and I can be a bit awkward with words.

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,960
But I am loyal.

72
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
Once I give my word to you,

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,680
I stick to it.

74
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
You can count on me.

75
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,280
I will keep

76
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,040
my promises.

77
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,040
Yang Jinglan,

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,000
we did it.

79
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,080
I hope everything goes well for you, too.

80
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,280
After enduring countless challenges, Ji Yingying and her team

81
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,160
finally reached Tubo.

82
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,640
The merchants in the Tubo market were thrilled

83
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,280
to see the brocades,

84
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,000
and the brocades quickly became highly sought-after items.

85
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,160
This is bad!

86
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,360
They have escaped!

87
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,720
Hold your position!

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,600
We will chase after them!

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:37,880
Yes!

90
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,320
Understood!

91
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
It is dark and cold now.

92
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
You have just drunk, Your Highness.

93
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,080
You should be careful not to catch a cold.

94
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,640
Please return with me

95
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,240
so that others will not worry about you.

96
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,360
You are really smart.

97
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,160
What if I refuse to return with you?

98
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,960
I will be in serious trouble

99
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,280
if anything happens to you, Your Highness.

100
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,280
How about this?

101
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,560
Let's make a deal.

102
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,400
Niu Jin and my master have been very cautious.

103
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,400
There is no concrete proof

104
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,440
of past transactions between them for years.

105
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,320
However, I have a token here

106
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,280
that Niu Jin gave to my master

107
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,200
as a gesture of sincerity

108
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,120
and to help with the transportation of goods.

109
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,630
[Niu]

110
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,520
Niu Jin has been cautious

111
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,880
about making a move

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,240
against me due to the Commissioner

113
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,680
and the crown prince.

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,080
Yet, now you give me this damning evidence against him.

115
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,840
You are planning to use Niu Jin to take me out, aren't you?

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,800
You and I can work together to take him out.

117
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,160
Well, it is indeed

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,760
a good deal.

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,840
But you forgot something.

120
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,720
I am not a merchant of the Tang Empire.

121
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,360
Instead, I am a government official.

122
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,640
Officials can endure humiliation

123
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,360
and face death without fear.

124
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,880
But they cannot lose sight of right and wrong

125
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,680
or work hand in glove with others.

126
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,150
Oh, yes.

127
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,080
You are right.

128
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,280
Do you know

129
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,720
why I waited

130
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,030
until today to escape?

131
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,280
It is because my plan needed the right timing.

132
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,920
By escaping today,

133
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,200
I can catch up with Ji Yingying

134
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,560
when she returns from Tubo.

135
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,400
I can bring her with me to Nanzhao

136
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,120
and visit the place.

137
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,080
Before that,

138
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,920
please come with me.

139
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,800
How bold you are, Yang Jinglan!

140
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
How dare you hurt Prince Bai?

141
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,600
Yang Jinglan,

142
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,000
I am Prince Bai of Nanzhao,

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,760
a guest invited by your empire.

144
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
How dare you try to kill me?

145
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Get a physician here now!

146
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,400
That is not needed.

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,600
I do not trust anyone

148
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,560
from the Tang Empire.

149
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,200
Your Highness,

150
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,040
what…? What is going on exactly?

151
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,000
Are you blind?

152
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,200
We have the evidence and witnesses of the crime!

153
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,840
Arrest the man who tried to assassinate His Highness now!

154
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,080
If I wanted him dead,

155
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,760
do you think he would still be alive?

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,680
Yang Jinglan,

157
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
are you saying the blood on your sword

158
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,040
does not belong to me?

159
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,480
There is no need

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,960
to go to Chang'an now.

161
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,240
That is a bad idea!

162
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,200
If you leave now, Your Highness,

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,640
we will not be able to complete our task.

164
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,880
Your task?

165
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,200
If you hand me over like this,

166
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,000
every one of you

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,560
will be labeled as failing to carry out your duty.

168
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,680
Think about it.

169
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,960
Do you want to send

170
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,800
a battered Prince Bai to Chang'an,

171
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,560
or do you

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,480
want to send

173
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,960
Yang Jinglan as the scapegoat to take the fall for you?

174
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,640
Think about what is at stake

175
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,360
for yourselves and your families.

176
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
I bet

177
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,200
you know what matters more.

178
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,480
Troop Six,

179
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,160
deliver a message to Chang'an for me.

180
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Tell them

181
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
that Nanzhao will

182
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,120
seek revenge for today's incident!

183
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,080
Yang Jinglan,

184
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,600
I have a message for you, too.

185
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,680
You cannot

186
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
protect everyone.

187
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,560
Mr. Yang, please forgive me.

188
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,240
I hope you can personally explain this to the emperor.

189
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,930
[Yizhou]

190
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:27,080
[Wanted]

191
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,320
[Wanted]

192
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,160
That old man, Niu Jin, is cunning.

193
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,680
Even before the court made a decision,

194
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,040
he pressured local officials

195
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,760
to plaster your wanted poster everywhere.

196
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,920
It is even more frustrating

197
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
that not a single person

198
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,960
from Troop Six stepped forward to vouch for you.

199
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,680
After all, Prince Bai of Nanzhao did get injured.

200
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
Someone has to take the fall.

201
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,080
You must head to Chang'an

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
and talk to the crown prince

203
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,520
to clear your name!

204
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,760
No.

205
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,560
He may try to aid me,

206
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
but I do not have any evidence

207
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,280
to prove my innocence.

208
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,400
The court certainly

209
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,080
will not risk offending Nanzhao's prince

210
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,920
for a brocade officer as insignificant as me.

211
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
What should we do, then?

212
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Should we grab Sheng Fengze for a confrontation?

213
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,120
But this guy seems to have completely vanished.

214
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,280
We cannot find him anywhere.

215
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
Do you think

216
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,880
he might have gone back to Nanzhao?

217
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,480
He went to such lengths to come to Yizhou.

218
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,880
I do not believe it is just for business.

219
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
He must have something else in mind.

220
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,280
That is why

221
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,640
I cannot leave now.

222
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,880
I need to act quickly and stop him.

223
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,880
If he is trying to use others as a weapon against me,

224
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,560
then I will turn

225
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,760
the tables on him.

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,320
However,

227
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,360
I still need another ally.

228
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,080
Who?

229
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,560
Mu Hui.

230
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,480
He might turn a blind eye to his subordinates' greed,

231
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,720
but he would never tolerate them

232
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,040
colluding with outsiders.

233
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,080
If there is solid evidence that Prince Bai is working with Niu Jin,

234
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,080
even if I indeed tried to assassinate him,

235
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,680
it would mean I uphold the law

236
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,320
and protect the safety of the Tang Empire.

237
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,720
Nanzhao would be in the wrong, and even if they decided to attack,

238
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,120
they would not have a legitimate excuse.

239
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,360
Would showing him only this token

240
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
be enough to convince him?

241
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,720
That's why I still need Zhuge's testimony about the foreign merchants.

242
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,960
All right. I will handle that.

243
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,760
Besides, I am not your subordinate.

244
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,880
So, they have no reason to arrest me.

245
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,880
Sneaking in should not be a problem.

246
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
The situation at the court is complicated.

247
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,480
Do you really think bringing him

248
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,320
to Chang'an will result in a clear resolution?

249
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,840
Do not worry.

250
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
I will do everything I can

251
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,680
to bring him to justice.

252
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,040
But no matter what,

253
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Niu Jin will not be able to escape.

254
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,680
As compared to getting revenge,

255
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,240
I am more concerned

256
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,360
about whether you will make it out unscathed.

257
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,840
You have not forgotten

258
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,320
that I still owe you a grand wedding, have you?

259
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,760
When I...

260
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,200
When we return to Yizhou,

261
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,080
we will host a grand celebration.

262
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,400
The entire city will talk about it.

263
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,360
All right.

264
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,520
Yingying, wait for me a moment.

265
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,760
Here.

266
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,080
Do I look good with it?

267
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,880
Of course.

268
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,880
I do not want you to leave.

269
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,080
I do not want us to part.

270
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,640
Then, I will not go.

271
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,680
Liar.

272
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,480
Yang Jinglan?

273
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,920
You must be safe.

274
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,440
Fang.

275
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,080
There is one more thing

276
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,640
I would like your help with.

277
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,520
Tell me.

278
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,040
Please deliver something to Yingying for me.

279
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,640
All right.

280
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,760
Consider it done.

281
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,200
Waiting for the unknown

282
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,920
or knowing the truth?

283
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,080
Which one

284
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,920
hurts you more?

285
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,200
What do you mean by that, my dear?

286
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,600
Yu Yuan was sold to a family in Lincheng as a maid.

287
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,440
But the matriarch of the household

288
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,920
feared she would attract her husband's attention,

289
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,200
so she found an excuse

290
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,110
and had Yu Yuan killed.

291
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,680
I will find her body

292
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,310
and give her a proper burial.

293
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,110
For this,

294
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,880
I owe you an apology.

295
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,560
Ms. Niu,

296
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,440
please get up. The ground is cold.

297
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,920
Yu Yuan?

298
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:39,880
Yu Yuan,

299
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
was I wrong?

300
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,840
I should have listened to my father

301
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,080
and become his pawn.

302
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,880
If I had, I would never have met Ji Yingying

303
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,280
or Yang Jinglan.

304
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,280
I would never have married Zhao Xiuyuan,

305
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,680
and you would never have left me.

306
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,600
If that were the case, you would not need me, either.

307
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,560
You just chose a path

308
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,200
that your mother and sisters

309
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,720
never dared to explore.

310
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,480
It is a road you have traveled alone for too long,

311
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,920
leaving you feeling isolated.

312
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,280
That is why you wanted someone to walk alongside you.

313
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,160
I am not your maid,

314
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,600
your friend,

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,160
or your family.

316
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,280
I am another version of you, instead.

317
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,720
The one who reassures you,

318
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,520
encourages you,

319
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,280
and tells you that you have not taken the wrong path.

320
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,520
Yu Yuan,

321
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,320
you are my Yu Yuan.

322
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,480
You are a part of me.

323
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,800
You are me.

324
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,040
Jingshan...!

325
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,320
Did I not warn you long ago?

326
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,960
The Yang family could face danger,

327
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,800
and we needed to prepare in advance.

328
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,400
But what did you do?

329
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,520
You always told us to wait for Yang Jinglan.

330
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,440
Well, he is now a wanted man.

331
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,040
What are you waiting for?

332
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,000
There must be something wrong.

333
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,240
Besides, words from the caravan said

334
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,560
Jinglan went to Chang'an,

335
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,040
while Yingying continued on

336
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,240
with the caravan to Tubo.

337
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,400
I believe that with her capabilities,

338
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,040
she will sell the brocade

339
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,120
and return safely.

340
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,440
She should have been back by now!

341
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,640
Why has she not shown up after all these days?

342
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,960
What could it mean?

343
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
Has she

344
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,760
abandoned her family,

345
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,320
run off with the money from selling Yang Brocade,

346
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,400
and now lived freely

347
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,760
elsewhere?

348
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,560
I did not come to the Yang residence

349
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,360
to listen to these matters, right?

350
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,800
Mr. Zhao is here to offer help in our time of need.

351
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,000
Help in time of need?

352
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,640
Why has the Yang family fallen into such straits?

353
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,200
Have all of you forgotten?

354
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,360
If we accept the Zhao family's order,

355
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,720
what dignity will the Yang family have left?

356
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,520
How will we hold our place in Yizhou?

357
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Mr. Yang, calm down.

358
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,680
At present,

359
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,200
the Yang family's weavers have all quit,

360
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,960
and no new orders are coming in.

361
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,960
In my view, your family is on the brink of collapse.

362
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,360
That is why I think,

363
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,040
compared to having dignity,

364
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,000
the survival of the Yang family

365
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,640
is what truly matters right now.

366
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,840
Well said!

367
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
You are absolutely right!

368
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,560
Jingshan,

369
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,760
you are still too young.

370
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,000
You have spent all your energy on brocade,

371
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,120
but you lack experience

372
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
in operating business.

373
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,120
But do not worry.

374
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,920
I will not stand idly by

375
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,360
and watch the Yang family crumble

376
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,120
because of your clash of egos.

377
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,720
Let me tell you

378
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,080
exactly where the Yang family stands right now.

379
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,520
We were already weakened previously,

380
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,120
and now, we are burdened with Yang Jinglan.

381
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,640
Who would dare do business with the Yang family from now on?

382
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,960
Mr. Zhao's order

383
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,920
is, quite frankly,

384
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,640
the only lifeline the Yang family has left.

385
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,240
Uncle Juli!

386
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:50,840
Enough!

387
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,440
If you cannot make the decision,

388
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,880
that is all right.

389
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,960
I will make it for you.

390
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,800
Everyone,

391
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,400
if you trust me,

392
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,040
then let us toast

393
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,160
to Mr. Zhao today.

394
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,280
Come on!

395
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,280
All right!

396
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,400
Mr. Yang Jingshan!

397
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,800
Sir!

398
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,120
Ms. Ji has returned!

399
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,080
Yingying,

400
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,520
are you all right?

401
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,920
Now that everyone is here,

402
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,400
let us open the chest.

403
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
Before I left,

404
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,920
all of you

405
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,040
sold your brocade to me.

406
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,120
Inside this chest is the remaining payment owed to you.

407
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,920
The Yang family has braved countless dangers this time

408
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,200
and finally opened a new route.

409
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,960
It is from Yizhou southward,

410
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,040
connecting Tubo and Nanzhao.

411
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,160
The brocade woven by the Yang family

412
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,760
was highly praised

413
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,360
among Tubo's nobles and wealthy merchants.

414
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,440
It was in such demand that we could not meet it.

415
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,920
No matter how others try to tarnish us,

416
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,120
gold will always be gold.

417
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,320
Yang Brocade remains worth its weight in gold.

418
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,360
In addition to selling off the brocade,

419
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,520
I also brought back new orders.

420
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,760
800 bolts of Shu Brocade.

421
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,760
Uncle Juli, please inspect and verify.

422
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,800
Well, not bad.

423
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,040
You have done all right.

424
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,640
I thank you on behalf of the Yang family.

425
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,920
But from now on, this matter

426
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
has nothing to do with you.

427
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,160
What do you mean by that?

428
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,240
What do I mean?

429
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,640
Officers,

430
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,800
come in!

431
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,920
Were you not looking for Yang Jinglan?

432
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,760
His wife is right here.

433
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,120
Take her away and interrogate her.

434
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,040
Use any methods you like. Torture her,

435
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:07,840
and you will get all the answers.

436
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,520
Uncle Juli!

437
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,360
Ms. Ji,

438
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
come with us.

439
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,360
Yang Jinglan has not even stood trial yet.

440
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,160
Even if his entire family were to be implicated,

441
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,760
it is far too soon to arrest me now.

442
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,560
Enough with that nonsense!

443
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Whoever Mr. Meng orders must come with us!

444
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,560
I cannot go.

445
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,680
This...!

446
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,960
[Letter of Separation]

447
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,240
The letter of separation is here.

448
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,440
Whether Yang Jinglan is innocent or guilty

449
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,960
no longer concerns me.

450
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,720
Rather than asking a stranger,

451
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,160
you would be better off asking Yang Jinglan's uncle.

452
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,440
You say it does not concern you, and suddenly, your word is law?

453
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,320
The letter of separation?

454
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,720
How did she get that?

455
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,720
She must have met Jinglan on the road.

456
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Am I right, officers?

457
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,160
Well, take this troublemaker away.

458
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,320
Torture her if you must,

459
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,000
and you will know everything soon enough.

460
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,440
This letter of separation

461
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,960
was written by Yang Jinglan

462
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,240
when we were exploring the trade route.

463
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,760
The mountain paths were perilous,

464
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,960
and bandits roamed freely.

465
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,240
He feared that if something were to befall him,

466
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,560
I would be left a widow,

467
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
tarnishing my reputation.

468
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,960
Officers,

469
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,600
I am no longer Yang Jinglan's wife.

470
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,360
I am Ji Yingying,

471
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,560
successor to Shu Red Silk

472
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,120
and the pioneer of the new trade route.

473
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,760
Chang'an knows my name,

474
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
and Tubo recognizes my work.

475
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,440
If Chang'an no longer values Shu Red Silk,

476
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,640
and Yizhou does not care about new trade routes,

477
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,040
then by all means, fabricate your charges

478
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,520
and take me in for questioning.

479
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,160
This...

480
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,560
We will report this to the magistrate

481
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,440
before making a decision.

482
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,440
Come on!

483
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,360
Officers!

484
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,200
Uncle Juli...

485
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,760
Or should I say,

486
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,240
Sir Yang.

487
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,640
May I have the order back now?

488
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,600
No, you may not.

489
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,520
You have separated from Yang Jinglan, have you not?

490
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,560
That means you are no longer part of the Yang family.

491
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,520
The Yang family's orders are none of your concern.

492
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,000
Perhaps you have forgotten, Sir Yang.

493
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,760
In the main hall, the matriarch agreed

494
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,960
that if I could sell Yang Brocade

495
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,960
and help the family through its crisis,

496
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,960
I would be allowed to manage the family affairs as well.

497
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,320
That day, the elders had no objections.

498
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,560
That is true.

499
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,200
Today, my place in the Yang family

500
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,600
is not

501
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,240
as Yang Jinglan's wife

502
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,960
but as its leader.

503
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,960
Absolutely not!

504
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,360
The matriarch is gravely ill,

505
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,760
and the Yang family is in turmoil.

506
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,520
We cannot let this troublemaker

507
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,960
step through our doors.

508
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,240
Perhaps you should take a closer look at the order in your hands, Sir Yang.

509
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,360
Whose name is signed on it?

510
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,480
[Signed by Ji Yingying]

511
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,040
Ji Yingying, how dare you!

512
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,040
You are lining your own pockets!

513
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,960
You have replaced us!

514
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,800
You have no shame!

515
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,440
Enough!

516
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,600
Show some respect.

517
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,160
Sir Yang, rebuke me all you like,

518
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,400
but it will not change the fact

519
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,160
that the name on these orders is mine.

520
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,640
If I am not allowed into the Yang family

521
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
and not permitted to make decisions,

522
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,840
then I can give these orders

523
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
to the Yu family,

524
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,760
the Ji family, the Zou family, or even the Wang family.

525
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,240
Even if my name were not on these papers,

526
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,360
do you know to whom

527
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,840
the brocade is for, Sir Yang?

528
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,320
Do you know where to get the remaining payment?

529
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,480
Do you know the appearance and whereabouts

530
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,320
of the shopkeeper

531
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,440
at Wangyue Pavilion?

532
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,640
Today, I ask all of you.

533
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,440
Am I allowed

534
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,040
to step

535
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,520
into the Yang residence?

536
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,560
You are allowed!

537
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,800
Of course, you are allowed!

538
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,920
Someone, come here.

539
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,840
Here!

540
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
Prepare a feast to welcome Ms. Ji.

541
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,080
Understood!

542
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,880
Jingshan!

543
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,360
What do we do now?

544
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,360
What should we do?

545
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,960
This is your family matter.

546
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,800
It is not something I can interfere with.

547
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,680
Madam?

548
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,920
Madam, I have returned.

549
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,960
After you left,

550
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,000
news came

551
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,320
that Mother had fallen seriously ill.

552
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,200
Father and Jinglin remained in Chang'an to continue negotiations,

553
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,720
but I rushed home immediately.

554
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,360
When I arrived,

555
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,400
I found Mother gravely ill.

556
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,760
What caused her illness?

557
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,800
At first, we thought it was exhaustion from overwork.

558
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,520
But despite treatment, she did not recover.

559
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,200
In the end, she fell into a deep sleep.

560
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,360
The physician said

561
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,760
it was possible Mother was poisoned.

562
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,200
This strange illness occurred

563
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,160

Yang Juxian would return for her funeral,

750
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,120
and I still would not get to be the patriarch of the Yang family.

751
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,480
So, I thought

752
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,320
I would use the antidote to force them into compliance.

753
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,680
But who could have guessed

754
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,080
that Ji Yingying went to Tubo

755
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,680
and acquired some supposed miraculous remedy?

756
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,520
Now, my antidote is useless.

757
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,120
If Bai Sheng

758
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,160
left you the poison,

759
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,600
how could they

760
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,640
have found an antidote so easily?

761
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,640
This is no place to linger.

762
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
No need to rush.

763
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,720
So, it is really you, Sir Yang.

764
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,560
Hand over the antidote.

765
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,080
Yang Juli,

766
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,840
it truly is you!

767
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,760
You vile, heartless man!

768
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,280
Hand it over now!

769
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,480
You came here with your men,

770
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,920
so I am sure you will leave safely.

771
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,760
But do not think for a moment

772
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,120
that I am alone or powerless.

773
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,760
The Yang family is dealing with its own traitor.

774
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,480
Mr. Zhao, you have no authority to intervene.

775
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,960
Not at all. Please, go ahead.

776
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,840
Mr. Zhao, you cannot burn bridges after crossing them!

777
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,680
Yang Juli conspired with outsiders,

778
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,760
betrayed his own family,

779
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,880
and poisoned the matriarch.

780
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,040
His crimes are unforgivable.

781
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,400
Someone, punish him accordingly!

782
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:31,880
Understood!

783
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,920
Punish him accordingly!

784
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,480
You...!

785
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,080
Ji Yingying,

786
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,000
I...!

787
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,760
I am...!

788
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,680
Give him 50 lashes!

789
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,360
Do not move!

790
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,880
I surrender!

791
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,480
Yingying!

792
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,520
Ms. Ji, I surrender!

793
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,160
I will confess everything!

794
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,520
I will tell you everything!

795
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,400
Do you want the antidote?

796
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:53,960
The antidote

797
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,200
is inside the three-colored porcelain vase in my study.

798
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,280
Yingying,

799
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,920
this entire scheme

800
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,440
was not my idea.

801
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,280
It was all Bai Sheng's!

802
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,440
I was nothing but a pawn.

803
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,880
The poison came from Bai Sheng, too.

804
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:11,920
He told me that

805
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,480
if I could obtain

806
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,520
the Yang family's list of merchants in Chang'an,

807
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,560
he would support me in becoming the patriarch.

808
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,240
He also said that

809
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,280
if anything went wrong,

810
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,880
I should seek out Zhao Xiuyuan for help!

811
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,960
Did you conspire with Bai Sheng?

812
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,520
He helped you a lot.

813
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,480
What does he want from the Yang family?

814
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,080
He said that once I became the patriarch of the Yang family,

815
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,080
he would take something from us.

816
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,640
But he never told me

817
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,880
what that thing was.

818
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,480
He demanded a pattern from the Zhao family.
