[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 6]

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,760
I'm coming!

4
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,870
[Color formula]

5
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,600
Yingying!

6
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,390
Yingying, what happened to you?

7
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,160
Are you not feeling well?

8
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,520
Have a seat.

9
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,910
Do you want me to help you inside to get some rest?

10
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,000
There's no need to rush for the work.

11
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,750
No need.

12
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,750
I finally figured out

13
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,110
the setting method for the new color.

14
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,910
I must get it done as soon as possible.

15
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,270
New color?

16
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,320
I thought you can't stand to look at red dye?

17
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,520
Why did you use red?

18
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,270
I can't avoid using red dye forever.

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm fine.

20
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,800
Stop pushing yourself, okay?

21
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,910
I might not know the reason,

22
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,320
but I believe you must have your reason

23
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,390
to do that.

24
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,750
Stop torturing yourself, okay?

25
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
I promised Mr. Chen and the others

26
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,600
that we'll participate in the Splendor Showcase.

27
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,920
We'll make a name for ourselves.

28
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,600
I also promised my brother

29
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,390
I'll pay off the Hua family's debts.

30
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,110
I won't let them win.

31
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,160
There's not enough time.

32
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,320
There's not enough time now!

33
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,550
How about this?

34
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,110
Tell me what to do.

35
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:47,950
I'll help you.

36
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,920
Don't worry.

37
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,350
Have a seat.

38
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,350
What should I add into it?

39
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,640
One liang of locust tree flowers.

40
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,040
Three liang of safflower.

41
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,920
Crush them together.

42
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,270
The Splendor Showcase is held once a year

43
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,320
to find the best of the best within the silk industry.

44
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,510
Other than regular purchases, all the brocade merchants

45
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,270
will also come here to select silk for the Brocade Weaving Competition.

46
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,270
It is a grand festival

47
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,600
that connects all businesses.

48
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,070
It has always been hosted

49
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,640
by the Brocade Bureau.

50
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,440
Before it begins, silk merchants have to pay a fee

51
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
to get the license to enter.

52
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,200
Those who are here as a silk merchant for the first time

53
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,110
will need to have a referee on top of that.

54
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,670
While a lottery system is used to assign their stall's location,

55
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,200
there are still some people

56
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,790
who would privately purchase and take over others' location.

57
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,640
To ensure the fairness of the system,

58
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,830
the Brocade Bureau has to check multiple times.

59
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,320
You don't have a care about your voice, do you?

60
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,040
It's cracking from all your talking.

61
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,200
To be precise, you're the one who doesn't care about me.

62
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,920
You don't want to listen to me talk.

63
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,070
What did we agree on before coming here?

64
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,000
Those who use their fists

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,640
are yours.

66
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,230
Those who use their pens

67
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,880
are mine.

68
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:20,950
It's good you remember that.

69
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,110
I think there's a lot of people in this venue.

70
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,830
If anything happens,

71
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,790
it could get out of hand.

72
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,830
We need to post a notice

73
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,640
to remind everyone to do business honestly,

74
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,830
treat others with kindness,

75
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,790
respect the venue,

76
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,110
and not cause problems.

77
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,760
No need to be too lengthy.

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,390
Five thousand to ten thousand words are enough.

79
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:35,760
Yes.

80
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,160
Peace at last. Brat...

81
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,040
Mr. Yang!

82
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,640
Mr. Yang's attentive preparation

83
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,040
is what allowed the Splendor Showcase to be so successful!

84
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,230
Thanks for your hard work.

85
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,640
Thank you!

86
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,110
You must be exhausted.

87
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,920
Can I treat you to a drink?

88
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,320
The first rule of the event!

89
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,070
Focus on your business,

90
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,790
and don't talk to me.

91
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,920
When was there ever such a rule?

92
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,040
We're writing it down! It'll be put up soon!

93
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,440
Jinglan has always been thoughtful and meticulous.

94
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,440
The second rule of the event!

95
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,440
Refer to me as Mr. Yang.

96
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,830
You're looking for me?

97
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,270
What's up?

98
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,320
What are you carrying?

99
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,480
It's the silk we prepared

100
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,230
for the Splendor Showcase previously.

101
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,880
There's no use for them anymore!

102
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,830
We can't even get in.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,790
Yingying said

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,040
even though we can't get into the Splendor Showcase's venue,

105
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,070
we can still set up a stall outside.

106
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,040
As long as people get to see it,

107
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,040
it's not a waste of our efforts.

108
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,270
Ji Yingying said that?

109
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,270
Hey!

110
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,270
Did you forget how she fooled us?

111
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,950
Why do you still trust her?

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,320
Do you know why I came to you?

113
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,950
It's because I think you are different from the others.

114
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,480
You might seem like a reckless scoundrel on the outside,

115
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,160
but you're a kind person on the inside.

116
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,640
You are honorable.

117
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,830
I guess I judged you wrongly.

118
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,000
Talk properly.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,510
Don't go.

120
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,950
It's just the Splendor Showcase!

121
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,880
I'll go!

122
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,920
But I don't want to set up a stall by the roadside.

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,600
If we're going, we'll go inside.

124
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,830
But we don't have a license.

125
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,950
My face

126
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,110
is all the license we need!

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,150
When it comes to silk within the whole of Shu,

128
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,670
if I say I'm the second best,

129
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,670
then nobody would dare call themself the best!

130
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,960
This number one booth

131
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,790
is the best spot

132
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,760
within the venue.

133
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,280
Anyone who comes to make purchases will pass through here.

134
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,590
The Liu family got the spot.

135
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,590
But there was news from the Liu family this morning

136
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,400
that they have fallen sick.

137
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,590
They can't leave their home.

138
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,030
The ones who got the best spot didn't come?

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Interesting.

140
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,440
You're done?

141
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,910
Yes.

142
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,590
I should have made you write 20,000 words!

143
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,880
You must be tired, Mr. Yang.

144
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,550
I prepared some snacks

145
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,640
for you to enjoy.

146
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,000
The Liu family's booth will be left empty anyway,

147
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,590
- Mr. Yang, - Mr. Yang!

148
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,000
Why not give it to me?

149
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,030
Mr. Yang,

150
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,640
I have a jade Kylin.

151
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,790
I just...

152
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,200
wonder if I can

153
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,520
appreciate it

154
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,550
with you privately?

155
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,280
You want the Liu family's booth?

156
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,960
You also want the Liu family's booth?

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,550
Yes, yes.

158
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,400
Zhuge,

159
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:58,960
take them to somewhere... quiet.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,790
Take a close look

161
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,230
and compare them carefully.

162
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,280
Okay.

163
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,030
Go on.

164
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,790
Go on.

165
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:08,910
My dear,

166
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,230
Do you think Master's method will work?

167
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,350
Can it really determine Yang Jinglan's true intentions?

168
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,280
If he accepts the gifts,

169
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,880
he'll just be

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,000
another greedy moron.

171
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,000
We don't have to fear him.

172
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,590
If he doesn't accept it,

173
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,080
that proves he's after something more important than wealth.

174
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,880
Then we must be even more careful of him.

175
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,200
You're right, my dear.

176
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,230
San Hua Pavilion's aged wine is just what I wanted!

177
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,230
He accepts bribes in public. Yang Jinglan must have lost his mind.

178
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,550
The greedier he is,

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,200
the better it is for us.

180
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,520
Not bad.

181
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,960
This is an exquisite jade peony!

182
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,110
It should be worth at least a fortune, right?

183
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,760
Mrs. Hua, you're too kind.

184
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm glad you like it.

185
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,590
Place this peony in my study.

186
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,520
Yes.

187
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,350
Mr. Yang,

188
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,840
you're going to place the peony in your study.

189
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,400
Then the empty...

190
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,320
Booth?

191
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,550
Zhuge, send some men to prepare light refreshments

192
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,320
and place some mats

193
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,350
for the people passing by to get some rest.

194
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:30,400
Mr. Yang!

195
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,840
You've accepted our gifts.

196
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Why aren't you keeping up your end?

197
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,150
Aren't these the gifts

198
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,670
you prepared for the winners

199
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,790
of the Splendor Showcase?

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,640
Gifts?

201
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,080
Why...

202
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,230
did you bring up the booth?

203
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,400
Are you

204
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,200
trying to bribe me in public?

205
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,150
Zhuge,

206
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,200
what's the punishment for bribery?

207
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,350
Light whipping if it's not serious.

208
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,320
The death penalty if it is.

209
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,670
Death penalty? Hmm?

210
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,280
My dear,

211
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,640
w-what should we do now?

212
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,230
He has

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,760
completely played us for fools.

214
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,200
Can that work?

215
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,470
Why don't we listen to Yingying

216
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,280
and sell outside?

217
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,400
Don't listen to her.

218
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,230
Listen to me.

219
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,030
I have the final say!

220
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,520
Sang Shisi.

221
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,910
Are you trying to pull a fast one on me?

222
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,520
What did I do?

223
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,790
Firstly, I did not take any of your booths.

224
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,440
Secondly,

225
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,840
I am not selling silk.

226
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,760
This is my outfit.

227
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,520
I want to wear this and take a spin around here.

228
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,440
Can't I?

229
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,320
Can't I?

230
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,790
Sure.

231
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,030
Here.

232
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,590
You like to spin?

233
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,030
You can spin inside this circle

234
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,400
until the event ends.

235
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,640
I'll send someone here

236
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,200
to bring you some food and drinks.

237
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,470
Don't say I'm not nice to you.

238
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,350
However,

239
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,910
if you dare take a step out of the circle...

240
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:13,960
Beat him!

241
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,880
Yes!

242
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,110
Mr. Yang, you...

243
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,440
A-Are you still my best friend?

244
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,790
Best friend?

245
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,230
I...

246
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,280
Mr. Yang, are you going to do this to me?

247
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,710
You really plan to lock them there until the event is over?

248
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,080
If I don't do that,

249
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,590
who knows what trouble they will attract?

250
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,110
Without their mastermind around,

251
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,470
they're setting themselves up to fail sooner or later.

252
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,470
Their mastermind hasn't showed up.

253
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,840
I heard she locked herself up at home.

254
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,000
Do you think Ji Yingying gave up?

255
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,880
She won't.

256
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,880
She won't? How do you know that?

257
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,400
She's not Ji Yingying

258
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,320
if she knows the meaning of giving up.

259
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,030
Look! What is that?

260
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,840
So pretty!

261
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,760
Look!

262
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,280
Flowers are falling from the sky,

263
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,470
yet the wind is coming from the southwest.

264
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,520
Yingying, I think someone is here.

265
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,880
I am indeed waiting for someone.

266
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,520
If not,

267
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,320
it would be a waste

268
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,520
of my silk's elegant appearance.

269
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,230
Catch!

270
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,150
So it was you, Ms. Ji.

271
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,030
Are you here to enjoy the view too, Mr. Yang?

272
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
Ji Yingying,

273
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,230
what are you doing?

274
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,640
Since I cannot participate in the Splendor Showcase,

275
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,320
there is no longer any use for this silk.

276
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,000
So, out of boredom, I turned it into pom-poms

277
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,280
and tossed them around for fun.

278
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,840
Mr. Yang, this is not illegal, is it?

279
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,960
Who said that the silk is useless

280
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,080
if you cannot enter the Splendor Showcase?

281
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,400
Miss,

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,640
I would like some silk dyed in this color.

283
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,280
We can place an order right now.

284
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,880
This silk is a new color, correct?

285
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,080
I have never seen it before.

286
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,640
That is correct.

287
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,670
This is a new color produced by my family, the Ji family.

288
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,480
The lovely girls are drunk on wine, their faces flushed.

289
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,460
[From Qu Yuan's "Summons of the Soul"]

290
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,280
Hence, this color is named Flushed Rose.

291
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,320
Since it is a new color,

292
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,840
it has to be registered.

293
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,030
If you sell it without registration,

294
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,640
Ms. Ji,

295
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,470
you will be sent to prison.

296
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,280
When have I ever said I would sell it right now?

297
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,150
The formula must be stable if you wish to register a new color.

298
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,030
The color must be long-lasting.

299
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,030
Your new color has not been tested yet.

300
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,000
Do you suppose

301
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,470
it was a random color produced by chance,

302
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,910
never to be made again?

303
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,590
Everyone,

304
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,320
do you not deem it too hasty a decision

305
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,280
to place an order right now?

306
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,550
Since they have their doubts,

307
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,550
Ms. Ji, would you like to accept an order

308
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,670
from my family, the Yang family, first?

309
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,150
I would like five dans of Flushed Rose silk.

310
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,880
I will be expecting them one month after registration.

311
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,520
We can discuss the price later.

312
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,150
Here is the deposit.

313
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,280
Mrs. Yang, you paid the deposit without signing an order.

314
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,710
Are you not worried that I might cheat you?

315
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,470
Our family can afford to lose this bit of wealth.

316
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,150
Ms. Ji, with talent like yours,

317
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,280
surely such things are below you.

318
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,200
This is merely a formality.

319
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,440
Mr. Yang,

320
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
surely you would not

321
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,280
object to such a small request?

322
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,840
You both willingly agreed to it,

323
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,830
so that is none of my business.

324
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,880
Thank you for your patronage, Mrs. Yang.

325
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,680
I will not disappoint you.

326
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,710
She advertised her silk even though she was not selling it.

327
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,680
She accepted an order for a new color without registering it.

328
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Mr. Yang,

329
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,830
is this not against the rules?

330
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,950
Yes,

331
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,760
it has indeed violated the rules I have established.

332
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,710
Ms. Ji,

333
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,110
you have scattered pom-poms all over the place,

334
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,680
hence disrupting the cleanliness of the venue.

335
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,280
You should clean the place up.

336
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,280
Rest assured, Mr. Yang.

337
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,520
I will definitely rid the venue

338
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,110
of all trash.

339
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,950
Good work, Ms. Ji.

340
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,350
Why are you still here?

341
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,190
Ms. Ji, you are not done with cleaning yet,

342
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,040
so of course, I have to stay and keep an eye on you.

343
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,830
Keep watching then, Mr. Yang,

344
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,040
lest you accuse me

345
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,190
of not cleaning properly.

346
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,190
The falling flowers were a pleasant surprise to everyone present.

347
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,710
Even if I punished you, Ms. Ji,

348
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,560
I cannot prevent the masses from desiring the new silk.

349
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,190
Your efforts were not in vain, Ms. Ji.

350
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,950
However...

351
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,110
However what?

352
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,560
Flushed Rose has stunned the whole crowd.

353
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,160
It may be exchanged for gold,

354
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,000
but it cannot win hearts.

355
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,160
Mr. Yang, what do you mean by that?

356
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,640
If you do not understand it, forget it.

357
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,520
Ms. Ji, can you please

358
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,430
take a look at this silk

359
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,000
and see if there is anything special about it?

360
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,400
Mr. Yang, is this a request?

361
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,160
It can be leverage in a transaction as well.

362
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,950
Transactions must be fair.

363
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,230
If I help you,

364
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,560
what do I get in return?

365
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,190
I will clean the place with you.

366
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,560
How does that sound?

367
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,760
I have asked someone to appraise this silk before.

368
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,350
It is called the imperial yellow silk.

369
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,800
It is probably an imitation.

370
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,160
In terms of color,

371
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,710
it is identical to authentic imperial yellow silk.

372
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,110
However, it feels slightly different to the touch.

373
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,400
They dare not confirm the suspicions,

374
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,830
so I would like you to appraise it, Ms. Ji.

375
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,560
When dyeing genuine imperial yellow silk,

376
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,040
wood ash lye must be used to form a color sediment

377
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,950
to set the dye.

378
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,040
The color mixing process is complex

379
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,230
and the dye is expensive.

380
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,160
It is mainly used to make imperial satin

381
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
as a tribute to the emperor.

382
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,560
As for the silk in my hand,

383
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,040
it was only treated with sulfur to brighten and set the color.

384
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,640
The threads were made with blended silk as well.

385
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,400
The color is also not distributed evenly.

386
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,310
Indeed, its quality is subpar.

387
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,230
If it was made for the emperor,

388
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,920
then why would they

389
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,760
use blended silk with subpar quality?

390
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,950
You should ask the person who dyed the silk.

391
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:31,950
I am not

392
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,560
the right person you should ask.

393
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,400
That is true.

394
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,230
I should not have asked you.

395
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,280
Mr. Yang, what did you mean by

396
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,190
the words you said just now?

397
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,760
Which words? I said a lot of words.

398
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,800
Winning hearts.

399
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,040
Oh, hearts.

400
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,350
Human hearts are like these fallen flowers.

401
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,400
They have no fixed shape or form.

402
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,950
They rise with the wind

403
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,350
and gather with the breeze.

404
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,950
When the wind stops, the flowers fall.

405
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,520
They come together and scatter without a trace.

406
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,110
Ms. Ji, if you wish to win hearts,

407
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,920
you must first identify

408
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,190
the wind that has gathered them

409
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
in the first place.

410
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,590
Mr. Yang, if you are insulting me

411
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,230
for caring about profit instead of connections,

412
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,760
you do not have to go to such lengths.

413
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,350
Is that not the case?

414
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,230
Have you ever lacked money?

415
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,350
I value wealth,

416
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,160
but I obtain it via legal means.

417
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,040
Have you ever been forced into a corner?

418
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,040
Even in hopeless situations,

419
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,950
I will not succumb to crime.

420
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,640
That is remarkable of you, Mr. Yang,

421
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,950
but such virtues are beyond me.

422
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,560
I can only prioritize my gains

423
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,400
and use underhanded tactics.

424
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,430
You have cleaned up enough.

425
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,070
You may go home.

426
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,520
Goodbye.

Yaoting, why are you still here?

429
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,230
It is getting colder these days. Put this on.

430
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,590
I was just done with work,

431
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,400
so I feel quite hot.

432
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,040
I am even sweating. You put it on.

433
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,560
That is exactly why you must be careful not to catch a cold.

434
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,830
I will be fine. Hurry.

I made some warm soup for you. Hurry and drink it.

439

Mr. Ji, I did not know you were here too.

440

If not, I would have made some for you as well.

441
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,350
That is alright.

442
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,190
I do not feel cold at all.

443
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,560
Well, since you are here now,

444
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,710
I do not have to worry anymore.

00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,350
I shall head back and cover up for you now.

446

Do come home soon.

447
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,230
Yaoting, we can go together.

448
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,160
No need.

449
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,350
Have some soup then, Yaoting?

450
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,160
No need!

457

Make up your mind, Mrs. Ji.

458
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,350
Mrs. Hua,

459
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,000
you should be aware that

460
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,950
shopkeepers are ordering the new Flushed Rose silk these days.

461
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,470
Do you not want a part of it?

462
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,430
I can give you some Flushed Rose silk

463
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,040
free of charge.

464
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
You can rewrite the order

465
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,560
so that my family's debt is paid with Flushed Rose silk.

466
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,590
What do you think?

467
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,190
The worth of this silk

468
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,590
may change without warning.

469
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,000
Who knows how long your Flushed Rose can remain in the spotlight?

470
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,310
I would feel more secure

471
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,950
if you pay me real money.

472
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,560
I can lower the price by a third.

473
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,040
You will be gaining a risk-free profit.

would we not profit more if we get the Flushed Rose silk?

Why did you insist on getting money from the Ji family?

What use would I have for the Flushed Rose silk orders?

But the Ji family has cleared their debt.

514
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,280
How do we deal with them now?

515
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,280
New types of silk must be registered before they can be sold.

516
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,760
The Brocade Bureau will verify the new silk

517
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,350
and then get someone

518
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,350
to send the registration document to Chang'an for approval.

519
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,760
This process

520
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,920
takes at least two weeks.

521
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,190
If any trouble crops up in between,

522
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,350
seeing how many orders she has accepted,

523
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,190
she will have a lot to explain to the shopkeepers.

524
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,350
But the Brocade Bureau is impenetrable now.

525
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,110
Yang Jinglan is obviously on the Ji family's side.

If Master has to do everything herself,

00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,760

a few days ago,

540
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,680
my daughter-in-law acted on her own accord

541
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,000
and visited the Ji family

542
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,110
without proper etiquette.

543
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,070
I hope you can forgive her.

544
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,640
Well,

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,880

Mr. Zhao Senior,

554
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,190

In business, fairness is key.

556
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,920
The order of supply must follow the principle of first come, first served.

557
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,710
If Huanhua Dyehouse wishes to last long,

558
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,350
I cannot break this rule.

559
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,190
Of course...

560
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,520
But the Ji family and Zhao family share a bond.

561
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,000
I cannot ignore that.

562
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,350
This half basket of silk

563
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,800
is a token of my sincerity.

564
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,160
It should suffice for you to test your brocade pattern.

565
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,310
Ms. Ji, you are most thoughtful.

566
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,710
I hear the Yang family has already given you an advance deposit.

567
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,470
Indeed. At a time when no one else offered help,

568
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,190
Mrs. Yang recognized the opportunity and supported us when we needed it most.

569
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,470
It's only right

570
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,920
for Yingying to repay them.

571
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,560
Of course...

572
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,400
The Yang family has always been known for their integrity in the brocade trade.

573
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,400
Every brocade merchant seeks talented people.

574
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,760
If the Zhao family had been there,

575
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,710
we never would have stood idly by.

576
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
Naturally.

577
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,110
It is getting late,

578
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,710
and Yingying must return to dye the silk.

579
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,110
We will take our leave.

580
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,710
Summon Xiuyuan

581
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,000
to escort them home.

582
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:01,680
Yes, sir.

583
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,950
At least we have regained

584
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,920
some dignity for our family.

585
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,710
Yingying,

586
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,110
I will say it again.

587
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,310
Mr. Zhao is a good man.

588
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,590
He has done much to support our family.

589
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,470
I once hoped you might marry him.

590
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,920
But after all that has happened,

591
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,110
I have come to realize something.

592
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,920
Breaking off the engagement may not be a bad thing.

593
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,110
If one day you were to marry into the Zhao family,

594
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,000
I dread to think of how much humiliation you might endure.

595
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,880
Mother,

596
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,920
my response is still the same.

597
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,400
The Zhao family

598
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,350
and Mr. Zhao are different.

599
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,400
Silly child.

600
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,310
Marriage is never just between two people.

601
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,560
It is always between two families.

602
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,920
With the Zhao family as they are,

603
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,800
I worry you would only face more grievances in the future.

604
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,000
Mrs. Ji.

605
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,680
Yingying.

606
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,110
Mother...

607
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,280
I am going for a walk in the market.

608
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,760
Why are you staring at me like that?

609
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,310
If you are not saying anything,

610
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,680
I will just head home.

611
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,470
I have designed the pattern

612
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,920
according to your handkerchief.

613
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,520
Really?

614
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,680
I knew you would succeed.

615
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,110
With the pattern done,

616
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,760
even without my Flushed Rose,

617
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,920
your grandfather will surely set you free.

618
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,560
It is not the same.

619
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,800
How is it not the same?

620
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,950
You came here just for me.

621
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,950
That makes it different.

622
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,110
I was still a little slow.

623
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,680
If I had been faster,

624
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,310
I might have seen your falling flowers.

625
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,280
Do you want to see it?

626
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,110
Close your eyes.

627
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,280
And no peeking!

628
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,470
This flower is for you alone.

629
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,110
Are you satisfied?

630
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,950
It is unforgettable.

631
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,710
Flushed Rose is just the beginning.

632
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,110
Once I reconcile with Mr. Chen and the others,

633
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,710
I will focus on growing Silk Society.

634
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,110
In a year or two,

635
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,760
half of the Zhao family's silk

636
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,310
will have to come from us.

637
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,560
Your family

638
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,470
will be falling over themselves to curry favor with me.

639
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,560
Are you saying that

640
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,280
if I do not become Brocade Master by that time,

641
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,760
I will not be worthy of you?

642
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,910
You better work hard.

643
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,360
All right.

644
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,520
But for now, the most pressing matter is

645
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,560
how to reconcile with Mr. Chen.

646
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,710
I have taken several orders for Flushed Rose,

647
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,080
and I can barely keep up.

648
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,190
Help me out, won't you?

649
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:30,870
Hurry up! Let's go!

650
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,800
Why are you slow?

651
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,710
Honestly, Ms. Ji shows so much sincerity.

652
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:36,390
She visits you three times every day!

653
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Why not just accept her apology?

654
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,870
Why insist on being so stubborn?

655
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,280
You can do it yourself.

656
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,360
I cannot do it.

657
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,360
Mr. Jiang,

658
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:46,950
tell her I am not home.

659
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,080
Mr. Jiang, are you home?

660
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,870
He says he is not home.

661
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,000
Please go back.

662
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,000
But my mother said that,

663
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,710
no matter who is at fault,

664
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,560
since everyone chose to work together,

665
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,120
she should not have kept this from us.

666
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,520
Yaoting and I have been running around all day,

667
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
and everyone ignored us.

668
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,360
It was not entirely fruitless.

669
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,280
At least now,

670
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,040
my parents trust you.

671
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,120
Even my father

672
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,950
does not want to control me anymore.

673
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,560
The deal was made,

674
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,870
but the friendship was lost.

675
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,120
It is not worth it.

676
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,470
Yu,

677
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,000
does your tavern have to entertain just anyone?

678
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,470
Can you keep those idle busybodies out

679
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,870
in the future?

680
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,040
Pay me double the price for wine,

681
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,560
and I guarantee you will never see him again.

682
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,870
Not worth it!

683
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,040
Zhuge,

684
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,080
I heard the registration process

685
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,760
requires my personal seal.

686
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,360
What if I do not want to stamp it?

687
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,080
Then there is no other way.

688
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,360
You are known for your fairness and integrity, Mr. Yang.

689
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,910
Surely you would not do such a thing.

690
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,320
Am I not an idle busybody who meddles unnecessarily?

691
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,430
I misspoke.

692
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,560
I will punish myself by drinking the wine!

693
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,630
That is enough.

694
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,230
It was just a joke.

695
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,520
Why take it so seriously?

696
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,120
In business,

697
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,120
one must know when to yield or stand firm.

698
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,910
But does that apply to situations other than that as well?

699
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,950
To you, Mr. Yang, it was a joke.

700
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,470
But to me,

701
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,120
it is my livelihood.

702
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,670
It was I who misspoke.

703
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,950
I apologize.

704
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,560
I am unhappy.

705
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,710
No one can control me.

706
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Even in the middle of the night,

707
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,280
he will wake up feeling regret for his rudeness.

708
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,230
Look at the silk from Mr. Jiang's place.

709
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,360
Does it not look like hair?

710
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,430
If any of you go bald in the future, come to me.

711
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,360
I am sure you can use it.

712
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,520
Hurry up!

713
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,080
What is all the arguing about?

714
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,840
What a coincidence!

715
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,080
We meet again!

716
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,470
Take a look at my newly dyed silk, Flushed Rose.

717
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,670
The weather is far too hot.

718
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,430
I will be in the woods for a while.

719
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,360
Are you going or not?

720
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,080
Did you hear that? Mr. Sang is overheated.

721
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,430
Escort him to the woods!

722
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:11,910
Understood!

723
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,040
Petty men!

724
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,520
Yingying, wait for me.

725
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,710
I will go talk to them myself.

726
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,080
You are being unreasonable!

727
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,430
Us? Unreasonable?

728
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,470
Ji Yingying was even more unreasonable at Lei Zu Festival.

729
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,280
Yingying sincerely wants to make peace with you.

730
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,710
We have been neighbors for years,

731
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,120
washing silk side by side.

732
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,870
Are you going to ignore her forever?

733
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,040
When she wanted to marry into the Zhao family,

734
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,280
did she consider us her friends then?

735
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,710
Yaoting already explained.

736
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,840
It was a misunderstanding.

737
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,470
All a scheme by Mrs. Hua.

738
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,800
My mother said,

739
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,560
without trust, one has no foundation.

740
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,560
Even if it was a scheme,

741
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,000
she abandoned us

742
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,280
for her brother.

743
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,320
A business can recover.

744
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,520
But if someone goes to prison, their reputation is ruined forever.

745
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,870
Can you not tell what is more important?

746
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,150
You expect me to reconcile with her? Never!

747
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,470
How about the rest of you?

748
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,360
What do you say?

749
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,360
Whatever you say is what we will say.

750
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,470
We stand united.

751
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,360
No soft-heartedness here.

752
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,320
No soft-heartedness!

753
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,630
Whoever sides with her today

754
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,470
is this!

755
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,320
Give me back my hairpin!

756
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,560
Or I will be impolite.

757
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
Impolite?

758
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,390
Did you hear that, everyone?

759
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,000
She said she will be impolite.

760
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,670
Oh, how frightening.

761
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,630
Today, without those boys protecting you,

762
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,840
I would love to see

763
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,470
exactly how you plan to be impolite.

764
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,150
I promised my mother I would not fight.

765
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,600
Do not push me into breaking that promise.

766
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,080
But we want

767
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,950
to push you today.

768
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,520
We will push you. We will touch you.

769
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,840
I dare you to touch me!

770
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,190
I'm touching you...

771
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,080
I will beat you to death!

772
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:39,760
Do not do it!

773
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:41,870
Don't you dare touch me!

774
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,560
Yingying,

775
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
we are coming!

776
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,840
You could not even get a hairpin back?

777
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,520
You are hopeless.

778
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,520
Here, take it.

779
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,230
About Lei Zu Festival...

780
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,710
I had no choice

781
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:01,080
about everything that happened.

782
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,870
But regardless,

783
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,230
you all were hurt because of me.

784
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,870
You are not at fault.

785
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,430
It was me who wronged you.

786
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,360
Will you still join me to do business?

787
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,120
Mr. Jiang...

788
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,910
This is it.

789
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,040
You are this.

790
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,280
All of you are this.

791
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,430
Can I take it

792
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,040
as you agreeing to it?

793
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,120
You are hopeless.

794
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,870
Listen carefully,

795
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,160
I have come up

796
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,960
with a new name for Silk Society.

797
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,070
What is it?

798
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:01,680
Bloom Society.

799
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,310
Bloom Society?

800
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,870
As long as we dare to dream,

801
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,680
no worldly chains,

802
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,110
towering mountains, or raging seas

803
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,760
can hold us back.

804
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,440
Those major dyehouses

805
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,760
either have benefactor

806
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,240
or collude with each other

807
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,480
to monopolize the silk trade

808
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,680
and bully others.

809
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
But if we stand united,

810
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,760
supporting each other,

811
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,110
and ensure our silk is of the finest quality,

812
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,310
we will carve out

813
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,550
our own path.

814
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,630
We will never allow ourselves to be bullied again.

815
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,070
We will never judge by birthright,

816
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,680
never cling to old ways,

817
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,480
and never push out our own.

818
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:35,680
We will work together,

819
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,830
and make our name known in Yizhou!

820
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,870
Are you willing to join

821
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:45,240
Bloom Society?

822
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:45,960
Hold on.

823
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,830
Could you say a little less?

824
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,240
What I care about most is,

825
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,440
am I still

826
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,240
the honorary president in Bloom Society?

827
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:52,760
Of course you are!

828
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,760
Then that is settled.

829
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,920
Bloom Society!

830
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:56,200
Yes, Bloom Society!

831
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,070
Bloom Society...

832
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,270
Bloom Society!

833
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,480
Bloom Society.
