[Episode 11]

3
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,040
The Shu Road is difficult,

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,000
more difficult than ascending to the heavens.

5
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,120
Miss Ji.

6
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,270
Are you a ghost?

7
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,910
Why are you running here so early in the morning?

8
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,440
What ghost?

9
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,270
You're injured.

10
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:07,870
I...

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,520
I'll go get Zhuge to help you.

12
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,030
Can I talk to you for a moment?

13
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,110
Your wound needs to be treated quickly.

14
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,240
I can't stand the sight of blood.

15
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,080
You're afraid I'll drag you down?

16
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,190
Sorry for the trouble.

17
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,270
Wait a minute.

18
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,240
I hope you didn't get into too much trouble.

19
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Otherwise, I'll throw you into the river.

20
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,440
Wait.

21
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,390
This is Li Bai?

22
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,630
When you asked me about the names of people from Shu,

23
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,240
I knew you'd use them for this.

24
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,030
Thank you for your guidance.

25
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,470
I'm planning to partner with the merchants to sell brocade clothes.

26
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,600
You're entering the brocade business?

27
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,320
You certainly have lofty ambitions.

28
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,720
Our family used to be in the brocade weaving business.

29
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Come sit over here.

30
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,910
Are you planning to treat me through the curtain?

31
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,110
I'm not a doctor.

32
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,630
If you want to save a life, you wouldn't come to me.

33
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,470
Clean the wound.

34
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,600
You seem pretty upset.

35
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,070
Is it because you lost the fight?

36
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,640
Do I look like someone who can't accept losing?

37
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,920
That depends on what you lost.

38
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,640
What do you think shouldn't be lost?

39
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,000
For me,

40
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
it's family and belief.

41
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,920
I remember when I first entered the society,

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,830
love was love,

43
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,440
and hatred was hatred.

44
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,670
Anyone who dares to commit an evil deed in front of me

45
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,720
must first ask my sword.

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,110
But now, as an official,

47
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,040
everything is different.

48
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,790
It seems there's no black and white anymore,

49
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,510
and no good and evil.

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,640
If you want to pull the evil spirits out of hell,

51
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,230
you must first roll through hell yourself.

52
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,040
I've grown to hate this so much.

53
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,160
My master,

54
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,640
such a clean and tidy old man,

55
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,920
how did he endure it?

56
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,640
It seems you don't want to talk with me.

57
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,320
You always speak in riddles,

58
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
advancing step by step.

59
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
I don't understand.

60
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,230
So I don't know how to have a conversation.

61
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,110
You want to understand?

62
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,110
But if you understand,

63
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,350
you won't be able to leave this boat.

64
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,510
I must know the answer first,

65
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,670
then I'll consider

66
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,640
whether I should board your boat.

67
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,950
Then take a look at this.

68
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,790
Where did you get this from?

69
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:45,920
I found it.

70
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,950
Is there a problem?

71
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,230
I don't know.

72
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,040
The former brocade officer, Shen Rufeng, was my master.

73
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,230
I don't believe he died of illness.

74
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,000
I came back to Yizhou this time

75
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,270
to investigate his death.

76
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,760
I found this silk

77
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,720
when I was investigating his corpse.

78
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:13,600
This silk

79
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,830
is made using my father's Shu Red Silk formula.

80
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,790
But dyeing silk is different from weaving brocade.

81
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,510
The weather, temperature, and humidity

82
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,230
can change the silk color in an instant.

83
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,550
You must stand by the dye vat

84
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,640
and adjust accordingly.

85
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,790
So,

86
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,200
even with the secret formula,

87
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:33,720
it's not guaranteed to dye true Shu Red Silk.

88
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,790
You mean this silk is fake?

89
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,440
To brighten and set the color,

90
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
it's been treated with sulfur smoke.

91
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,880
It's miles away

92
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,790
from true Shu Red Silk.

93
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,480
After my father passed,

94
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,320
there have occasionally been

95
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,640
fake Shu Red Silk products on the market.

96
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,510
I've seen it a few times.

97
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,880
This one is the closest to the real thing.

98
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,160
Last time you mentioned

99
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,640
the court urgently needing Shu Red Silk to make clothing for the Empress.

100
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,320
You didn't rush in desperation

101
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,550
and treat this silk as Shu Red Silk,

102
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,880
then send it off to Chang'an, did you?

103
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,040
Do you remember

104
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,040
why your father was sentenced?

105
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,000
What exactly are you trying to say?

106
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,000
Before my master died,

107
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,760
he was investigating Shu Red Silk

108
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,230
and the case concerning your father.

109
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,510
Have you considered

110
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,640
that what we seek

111
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,670
could very well be the same truth?

112
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,790
So this is why you

113
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,470
have come to find me today.

114
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,000
I didn't plan to say this before,

115
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,080
but somehow,

116
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,200
while talking,

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,110
I've ended up telling you everything.

118
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,880
You don't believe me?

119
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,880
Well, the future is long.

120
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,000
One day, I'll make you believe.

121
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
But for now,

122
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,000
I still need your help

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
to tie this bandage.

124
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,670
Hot water is free,

125
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,670
but the wound medicine costs five qian.

126
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,470
I don't have any money.

127
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,790
But I can give you one life.

128
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,520
Come on.

129
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,440
Please tie it gently.

130
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,440
You have quite a strong grip.

135
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,230
and feeling jealous.

136
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,520
Don't mind it.

137
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,880
I'll throw it away.

138
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,760
No need.

I suspect that in the future,

141
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,110
everyone in Yizhou will see me like this.

142
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,280
I don't care.

143
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440

Mr. Yang has power too.

He can live his life freely

[Brocade Bureau]

156
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,550
This silk cannot be presented to the court.

157
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,880
Now that you've delivered this fake silk to Chang'an,

158
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,790
you must acknowledge it as genuine.

159

In the heart of Mount Qingcheng,

164

there's a place called San Pool.

165

Have you heard of it?

166
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,030
I've heard of it.

167
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,840
Send someone to search near there,

168
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,030
especially around places with blue wildflowers.

169

That's it.

172
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,000
Look here,

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,670
this kind of blue is mostly extracted from mineral dyes

174
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,520
and rarely appears in herbs.

00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,230
He might be even harder to deal with than Niu Wuniang.

190
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,490
[Niu Jin, Deputy General of Jian'nan Street]

191
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,710
[Peace and Prosperity]

192
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,280
Welcome General Niu back to the city!

193
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,520
Governor Zhang, you're too kind.

194
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,760
[Governor Zhang]

195
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,000
Your efforts have greatly benefited the people of Jian'nan.

196
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,320
Such hard work!

197
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,840
It's been a year,

198
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,760
and you're still as impressive as ever!

199
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,280
General Niu,

200
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,280
after such a long journey,

201
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,710
I've prepared a welcome feast for you.

202
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,350
I hope you'll grace us with your presence.

203
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,910
You're the new Brocade Officer?

204
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,910
I am Yang Jinglan, pleased to meet you.

205
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,470
Your elder brother has been renowned as the Brocade Master

206
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,520
for several terms.

207
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,760
I never expected you would make such a mark as well.

208
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,960
Becoming the Brocade Officer of Yizhou.

209
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,550
You flatter me, General Niu.

210
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,910
This is my first time in office.

211
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,910
I welcome any advice you have.

212
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,030
Though Deputy General Niu

213
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,710
is not a virtuous person,

214
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,590
this Yizhou city

215
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,590
is the military commissioner's Yizhou.

216
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,710
Governor Zhang

217
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:51,880
is the military commissioner's eyes in the city.

218
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,910
As long as Zhang's here,

219
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,520
Deputy General Niu

220
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,520
won't dare to act openly.

221
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,110
The whole city came to greet him,

222
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,350
but he didn't even dismount his horse.

223
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,000
Niu Jin holds the military power.

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,520
He's had countless military achievements.

225
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,960
He's the top general under the military commissioner.

226
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,910
Naturally, he doesn't care about anyone.

227
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,110
But he's just a Deputy General.

228
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,710
No matter how arrogant he is,

229
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,710
he still has to respect a few things.

230
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,960
People say you're indifferent to others,

231
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,000
but I don't think so.

232
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,710
Human kindness must be shown to those who have humanity.

233
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,440
If they have no humanity,

234
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,760
why should I care for them?

235
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,710
Thank you for your compliment.

236
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,910
Did you ask me to meet here today

237
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,350
because the clothes are ready?

238
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,030
The clothes are in the shop across the street.

239
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,910
Later, please take a look.

240
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,000
Miss Ji, your good ideas

241
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,670
are sure to be accepted

242
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,150
by anyone you partner with.

243
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,960
So why

244
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,320
approach me?

245
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,520
Bloom Society has just been established.

246
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:06,320
It's famous, but lacks depth.

247
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,150
Allying with the top brocade merchants is the best choice.

248
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,550
You are upright,

249
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,710
kind, and generous,

250
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,150
so you're naturally my first choice.

251
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,670
If you were a man,

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,790
you would surely accomplish great things.

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,350
For centuries to come,

254
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,150
there have been many successful women.

255
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,000
There's Ba Qing, Zhuo Wenjun,

256
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Empress Wu,

257
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,910
and even Nuwa.

258
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,150
Humankind was created by Nuwa,

259
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,520
meaning a woman created this world.

260
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,230
My view was too narrow.

261
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,370
[Niu Residence]

262
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,520
Father, please have some tea.

263
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,520
You have such courage.

264
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,520
You dare to make decisions about your own marriage!

265
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,110
This has nothing to do with you.

266
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,830
Leave now.

267
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,590
Yes.

268
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,800
Father,

269
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,470
I am not in love with Zhao Xiuyuan,

270
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,190
but I am considering you.

271
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
You're aiming for the brocade business.

272
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,350
Rather than marrying me off to a distant relative,

273
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,160
why not promise me

274
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,280
to a future Brocade Master?

275
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,310
A future Brocade Master?

276
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,520
The Zhao family is just a merchant family.

277
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,950
How can they compare to the military commissioner's distant relatives?

278
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,880
Father, you are the military commissioner's trusted confidant,

279
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:01,400
with your troops stationed outside Yizhou City.

280
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,190
Alliances with distant relatives will bring us no benefit.

281
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,000
In Yizhou's brocade business,

282
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,710
the Yang family has held the title of Brocade Master for five years.

283
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,950
We've only been able to weave brocade in the mountains.

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,760
If I marry into the Zhao family,

285
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,920
let them replace the Yang family

286
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,470
and become the new Brocade Master,

287
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,190
taking over the court orders,

288
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,110
wouldn't it be a legitimate way to change the situation?

289
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,520
Have you told this to the Zhao family?

290
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,310
Once I marry into the Zhao family,

291
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,470
we'll become one family.

292
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,920
Their success will be our success,

293
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,000
their downfall, our downfall.

294
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,110
I think

295
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,710
they'll understand this logic.

296
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,640
This logic,

297
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,280
I'm afraid even you haven't fully understood yet.

298
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,710
I'm not only thinking about my own marriage.

299
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,000
I have already found a weakness in Yang Jinglan.

300
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,190
Whether to kill, investigate, or spare him,

301
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,680
it's up to you.

302
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,110
I've heard that Yang Jinglan found the brocade workshop.

303
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,830
The trap to lure him in was fake,

304
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,590
but our real brocade workshop

305
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,920
is still at the original location,

306
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,070
heavily guarded.

307
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,310
Please rest assured.

308
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,950
Three brocade officers have died in succession.

309
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,680
The court didn't investigate before

310
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,310
because it had more pressing concerns.

311
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,310
Now that the Crown Prince has eased the rift between the factions,

312
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,710
the court won't turn

313
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,710
a blind eye like before.

314
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
Shu brocade is priceless.

315
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,880
The court will never ignore it.

316
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,680
Once this batch of brocade is completed,

317
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,470
immediately deal with the brocade workshop

318
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,920
to avoid future complications.

319
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,520
As for that brocade officer,

320
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,710
don't act against him for now.

321
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
I understand, Father.

322
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,520
Greetings, my father-in-law.

323
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,560
What brings you here?

324
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,310
Lady Wuniang sent someone to inform me that you've returned,

325
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,710
so I came to pay my respects.

326
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,110
If she hadn't said anything, you wouldn't have come, would you?

327
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,800
As a lowly son-in-law,

328
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,880
I feared that coming on my own

329
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,710
might offend you.

330
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,520
Why did you call him here?

331
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,760
There's something

332
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
I'd like you to look at.

333
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,710
I also called Mr. Zhao here

334
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,520
so he can see my dowry.

335
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,310
Shu Red Silk!

336
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,230
Just now,

337
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,950
you were calm and composed in front of my father,

338
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,520
acting appropriately.

339
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,310
It seems

340
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,640
you've thought things through.

341
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,760
I was just fulfilling my duties

342
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,280
as a husband and son-in-law.

343
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,880
You're adapting so quickly.

344
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,560
It makes me a little worried.

345
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,310
Since the marriage is already a fact,

346
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,070
even if I'm unhappy,

347
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,830
I'll still fulfill my responsibilities as a husband.

348
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,160
As for you,

349
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,760
I don't expect you to honor your parents-in-law

350
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,710
or get along with your sisters-in-law.

351
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,920
But I do hope you understand

352
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,070
the basic manners of a daughter-in-law.

353
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,830
Dear neighbors and folks,

354
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,950
The poet Du Fu once said,

355
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,740
[From Du Fu's "Happy Rain on a Spring Night"]

356
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,520
"Dawn sees saturated reds,

357
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,680
The town's heavy with blooms."

358
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,680
This speaks to the brilliance of Shu brocade.

359
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,830
Not long ago,

360
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,950
our Bloom Society

361
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,880
borrowed the poetry

362
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,470
of Poet Qinglian and Xue Tao

363
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,560
to inspire creativity.

364
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,400
We collaborated with the Yu family

365
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,430
to create ten sets of gorgeous clothing.

366
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,070
Today, we present them for your enjoyment!

367
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,190
Bravo!

368
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,280
Shu Red?

369
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,560
Isn't Shu Red already gone?

370
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,710
What's going on?

371
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,880

How is it like the original?

557
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Over the years,

558
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,560
many have claimed to have dyed it,

559
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,230
but in the end,

560
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,190
none of them are true.

561
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,040
Call the Ji siblings to appraise the silk!

562
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,160
[Yuebuhuan Inn]

563
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,950
Hurry!

564
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,760
Let's count today's earnings.

565
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,760
We'll split them with the Yu family, 60-40.

566
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,920
60-40 split.

567
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,230
We've made quite a profit today!

568
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,070
Yingying, bad news!

569
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,560
Yaoting.

570
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,950
Zhao Xiuyuan

571
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,400
has dyed Shu Red Silk!

572
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,350
Mr. Yang,

573
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,760
we invited you here today

574
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,800
to publicly confirm

575
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:52,590
whether this Shu Red Silk is real or fake.

576
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,640
General Niu,

577
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,430
this Shu Red Silk

578
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,310
is hard to distinguish with the naked eye.

579
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,070
But I remember

580
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,470
the real Shu Red Silk

581
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,470
wouldn't fade even in alkaline water.

582
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,840
That's a way to tell

583
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,670
if it's real or fake.

584
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:13,710
Apply alkaline water.

585
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,360
Please, everyone, inspect the silk.

586
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,470
Congrats to Mr. Zhao for reviving Shu Red Silk!

587
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,360
General Niu,

588
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,120
since Mr. Zhao has successfully dyed Shu Red Silk

589
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,320
and is the future head of the Zhao family,

590
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,670
it's certainly a cause for celebration!

591
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,520
The future is bright for him!

592
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,950
Mr. Yang.

593
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,190
As for this Shu Red Silk,

594
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:12,870
everyone,

595
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,040
does anyone

596
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
still have objections?

597
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,150
I have an objection!

598
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,320
Miss Ji, you have arrived just in time.

599
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,470
Let's see how it compares

600
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,710
to your father's Shu Red Silk.

601
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,360
Yingying,

602
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
Niu Jin's power is immense.

603
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,120
Even if you're sharp,

604
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,190
you can't shake him.

605
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,120
Think carefully.

606
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,600
This silk's color is wrong.

607
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,600
True Shu Red Silk

608
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,870
remains unchanged in alkaline water.

609
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,470
But this silk has already faded.

610
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,760
Everyone, you can carefully inspect the red silk in your hands.

611
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,600
If the red used to be perfect,

612
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,000
now it's only at seventy percent.

613
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,190
Only seventy percent...

614
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,150
Can everyone see the difference now?

615
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,390
Xiuyuan,

616
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:18,190
the Shu Red Silk you worked so hard to dye

617
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,560
is now being publicly questioned by Miss Ji.

618
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,320
You're not going to say anything?

619
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,630
As we all know,

620
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,040
Shu Red Silk

621
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,120
was created by Miss Ji's father.

622
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,520
The silk created by her own father

623
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
was lost for many years

624
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,670
but now someone else has dyed it.

625
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,190
She finds it hard to accept,

626
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:58,800
which is understandable.

627
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,120
Brocade has elegance,

628
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,670
and people should have character too.

629
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,600
Today, I won't believe

630
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,520
that only I can recognize

631
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,080
the fading of this silk.

632
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,000
Everyone here

633
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
is in the brocade business,

634
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,600
and your ability to distinguish colors is exceptional.

635
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,760
Today, the truth of right and wrong

636
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,320
rests with all of you.

637
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,870
I humbly ask you

638
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,190
to carefully examine the silk in your hands.

639
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,800
See if it really is unchanged.

640
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,360
Everyone, this matter concerns the art of Shu brocade.

641
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,710
If this centuries-old art of Shu brocade

642
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,600
is judged by only one person's word,

643
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,080
it may never have made it to today!

644
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,910
Please, think this over.

645
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,120
I ask you all to speak honestly!

646
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,390
General Niu,

647
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,520
I may not be able

648
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,910
to distinguish the fading or not,

649
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,120
but I've personally touched

650
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,150
the Shu Red Silk dyed by the Ji family.

651
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,190
The texture is indeed different.

652
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,470
Oh...

653
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,360
Sit down!

654
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,120
Yes.

655
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,190
Mr. Yang,

656
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,190
your sense of touch

657
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,520
is just like Miss Ji's eyes,

658
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,560
both from an individual perspective.

659
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,120
Think carefully before you answer.

660
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,560
Miss Ji,

661
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,560
you just want to clarify everything in front of everyone, right?

662
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,760
Fine.

663
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,560
I'll ask for you.

664
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,190
Mrs. Yang,

665
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,000
is this indeed Shu Red Silk?

666
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,670
As for me,

667
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,120
I only know business,

668
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,910
not brocade weaving.

669
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,000
So,

670
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,710
I can't tell the difference in the silk.

671
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,760
Mr. Sun,

672
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,950
is this the real Shu Red Silk?

673
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,320
Absolutely.

674
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,000
Without a doubt.

675
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,120
Mr. Wang?

676
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,000
It's absolutely authentic.

677
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,120
It is truly Shu Red Silk.

678
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,120
What do you all think?

679
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,190
It is indeed Shu Red Silk!

680
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,630
Turning lies into truth

681
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,230
and reversing right and wrong.

682
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,080
Yingying,

683
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,000
have you seen clearly now?

684
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,230
This

685
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,840
is power.

686
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,840
Miss Ji,

687
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,910
since everyone else believes it,

688
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,000
why deceive yourself?

689
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,630
