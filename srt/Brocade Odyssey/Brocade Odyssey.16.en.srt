[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,270
The Yu's brocade has been known for their quaint patterns.

4
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,910
Mr. Yu's son

5
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,230
once tried to recreate this ancient pattern from Gubei Village,

6
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,590
but he tragically lost his life there by accident.

7
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,830
Over the years,

8
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,000
Mr. Yu has longed

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,270
to fulfill his son's wish,

10
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,870
but he has never succeeded.

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,680
This has always been his deepest regret

12
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,080
and one of the reasons he refused to sell the brocade workshop

13
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,800
despite having no interest in running it.

14
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,230
So, if we retrieve the pattern from Gubei Village,

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,870
we might be able to persuade Mr. Yu?

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,830
I hope so.

17
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:14,830
Yingying,

18
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,720
this is my first time to be so far from home.

19
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,520
Now this feels like a proper runaway!

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,080
Please don't say that.

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,240
If your father and mother hear this,

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,830
they will blame me again.

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,190
[Gubei Village]

24
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,720
There are sheep over there!

25
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,360
If you catch me, I will give you this flag.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,080
Stop right there.

27
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,030
Give me the flag!

28
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,030
Give me the flag...

29
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,910
Yingying, look!

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,390
The pattern on that flag

31
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,880
matches the one in the drawing.

32
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,000
It was drawn on the flag.

33
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,630
While the shapes are identical,

34
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,880
they lack the depth, texture, and intricate details

35
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,190
present in the drawing.

36
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,110
They must have created

37
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,240
a rough sketch based on an old brocade.

38
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,630
I must have made a mistake.

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
Why don't you take a closer look?

40
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,470
Maybe you will spot something else.

41
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,270
I'm certain they will be more likely to show it

42
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,910
to a gracious and kind lady like you.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Very well, I shall go ahead.

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,800
I will join you shortly.

45
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,800
Pin!

46
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,630
Let her go.

47
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,600
She needs to see it in person

48
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,080
and learns that there are other paths in this world.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,390
It is up to her which path

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,360
she wants to take.

51
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,110
Wang, the ritual is about to start.

52
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:24,880
Hurry up...!

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,910
Let's go!

54
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,320
Ritual?

55
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,000
They are holding a ritual today.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,270
Let's go take a look, too!

57
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,320
Outsiders, please stop here.

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,270
Pardon us.

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,360
[From Classic of Poetry, Harvest]
Abundant millet and ripened grain.

60
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,110
Granaries brimming with their gain.

61
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,240
Boundless harvests beyond compare.

62
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,270
From them, wine and sweet ale are made.

63
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,550
I never imagined we'd cross paths

[From Classic of Poetry, Harvest, "A warm tribute to ancestors of old".]

65

[From Classic of Poetry, Harvest, "To honor the sacred rites"]

67
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:03,910
It seems kismet brought us together.

68
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,240
Mr. Bai, I knew you would be here.

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,910
[From Classic of Poetry, Harvest, "May abundant blessings fill the air".]

70
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,270
I'm here the same reason

71
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,670
as you are.

72
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,440
Mr. Bai, it seems you truly desire

73
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,030
the Yu's brocade workshop.

74
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,640
Did it feel like I wasn't serious before?

75
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,230
Looks like we will be facing off against each other today.

76
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,920
The ceremony is complete.

77
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,830
Chief,

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,000
could you please make an exception

79
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,600
and help me out this once?

80
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,200
There is nothing else

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,070
I ask for in the rest of my life.

82
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,200
The only thing I care about

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,880
is this brocade design.

84
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,480
It was my son's obsession,

85
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,600
and it has become mine as well.

86
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,880
I beg you. Please let me see it once more

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,670
before my life ends.

88
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,110
You understand the situation.

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,880
After what happened to your son,

90
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,510
we have banned outsiders

91
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,720
from coming near the artifact.

92
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,720
It aims to stop others

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,390
from being drawn in

94
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,720
and meeting the same fate.

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,110
I didn't expect

96
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,000
Mr. Yu to be so fixated.

97
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,920
Mr. Bai, do you not have your own obsessions?

98
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,390
Yes, I do. My obsession is Shu brocade.

99
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,920
What? You don't believe me?

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,830
Yes, I believe you. Why wouldn't I?

101
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,600
Ms. Ji, what about you?

102
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,720
Do you have an obsession?

103
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
It's about brocade as well.

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Distract him for me.

105
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,040
Mr. Bai, I'm one of Yingying's friends.

106
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
I'm the owner of Yuebuhuan Inn in Yizhou.

107
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,040
It's a pleasure to meet you.

108
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,830
The pleasure is mine.

109
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Mr. Yu!

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,830
Ms. Ji!

111
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,670
Mr. Yu.

112
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,160
Ms. Ji,

113
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,760
Xi must have told you that I was here.

114
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,920
Ms. Ji, did you come here for the brocade workshop?

115
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,510
Yes.

116
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm also here to honor a century-old heritage

117
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,070
and follow my passion for brocade.

118
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,920
You should understand

119
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,040
that our Ji family has its own obsessions as well.

120
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,830
That is why I empathize with you

121
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
and want to help you.

122
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,040
You are willing to brave any risk

123
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,480
just to bring Shu Red back.

124
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,320
I really admire you, Ms. Ji.

125
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,390
It's just that

126
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,000
the Yu family has no heir like you.

127
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,160
Mr. Yu...

128
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,320
Yingying.

129
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,230
Why are you here? Where is Bai Sheng?

130
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,440
He left after exchanging a few pleasantries,

131
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,230
saying he wanted to have a look around the village.

132
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,440
What a pity.

133
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,270
I was thinking of challenging him.

134
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,440
He knows martial arts?

135
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,670
He has strong lower body

136
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,720
and steady breathing.

137
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,600
He is a formidable

138
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
martial arts expert.

139
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,350
Who are you? How did you get in here?

140
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,760
How dare you trespass in our ancestral hall?

141
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,350
The brocade design has been stolen!

142
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,880
Don't let him get away! Get him!

143
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,670
What?

144
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,200
The brocade design has been stolen?

145
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't let him get away!

146
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,440
Hurry...!

147
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,640
Catch him!

148
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,400
Chief,

149
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,030
what is going on?

150
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,320
What happened?

151
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,200
Mr. Yu,

152
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,350
our village has been nothing but welcoming

153
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,280
especially toward you.

154
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,280
And yet, you've brought these outsiders

155
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,760
to steal our sacred artifact.

156
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,470
Is this the way you treat your host?

157
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,200
What did you say?

158
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,230
The brocade design was lost?

159
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,230
You must have worked together

160
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,150
to steal our brocade!

161
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,550
Exactly! Hand over the brocade design

162
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,000
and spare yourself the interrogation.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
Speak up! Where did you hide it?

164
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,910
Hand it over! Hand over the brocade design!

165
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,470
Hand it over! Where did you hide it?

166
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,230
Hand it over now! Speak!

167
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,960
Tell us!

168
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,030
Ms. Ji!

169
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,150
Help,

170
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,960
Ms. Ji!

171
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,470
Outsiders?

172
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,280
They are outsiders too.

173
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,710
Don't try to run!

174
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,840
You outsiders

175
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,910
must be on board with this.

176
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,710
If the brocade design is not on him,

177
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,470
it must be with you.

178
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,400
I...

179
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,840
Before this,

180
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,350
none of us had even crossed the threshold.

181
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,230
If you don't believe us, go and ask him.

182
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,230
He can vouch for us.

183
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,550
When they attempted to enter earlier,

184
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,520
I halted them at the gate.

185
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,880
I saw them head into the village instead.

186
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
Then why are you outsiders

187
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,550
in our village in the first place?

188
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,710
You must be up to something.

189
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,670
If you don't trust us,

190
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,840
search us then.

191
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,110
We can come with you

192
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,880
to send that man to the bureau.

193
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,640
The officials will investigate

194
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,440
and confirm that we barely know him.

195
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,150
Ms. Ji,

196
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,880
it is one thing that you turn a blind eye to my dilemma,

197
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,550
but must you fan the flames?

198
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
Mr. Yu,

199
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,350
don't you wish to know

200
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,790
where the brocade pattern is?

201
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,440
You may not know this,

202
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,550
but Ms. Ji is exceptionally clever.

203
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,520
I believe

204
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,550
she can help you recover the brocade pattern.

205
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,150
Ms. Ji,

206
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,760
if you truly have a solution,

207
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,470
please share it.

208
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
I want

209
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,350
for nothing more in the rest of my life.

210
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,440
All that is left for me is that brocade design.

211
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,440
If you can truly help me see it once more,

212
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
I will gladly give you

213
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,640
the brocade workshop.

214
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,230
Ms. Ji,

215
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,230
please, I beg you.

216
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,320
Yingying, please reconsider.

217
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,230
Once you speak up,

218
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,320
you will be involved in this mess.

219
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,550
With so many people here,

220
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,880
I can't protect all of you.

221
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,470
The brocade pattern wasn't stolen by him.

222
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,350
He was caught red-handed.

223
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,440
Are you implying that

224
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,350
he did not steal it?

225
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,280
With his cunning and skills,

226
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,350
if he had truly stolen it,

227
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,910
you would never have been able to catch him.

228
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,230
The only reason he surrendered

229
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,320
and dragged others down with him

230
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,550
while he sat back and watched

231
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,840
is because he did not steal the brocade.

232
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,350
I am astonished

233
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,520
at how well Ms. Ji

234
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,910
has come to understand me

235
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:27,880
in just a few days.

236
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,150
Madam,

237
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,280
if you wish to save him,

238
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,470
you must show us the evidence.

239
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,030
I don't have any,

240
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,910
but I can help you find the real thief

241
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
and recover the brocade pattern.

242
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,150
Are you sure about this?

243
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,110
Why not give it a try?

244
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,150
But if you fail,

245
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,880
all of you will be buried in the ground

246
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,320
to atone to God of Grain.

247
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:48,280
Yes.

248
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,080
That is how it should be!

249
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,790
So be it.

250
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,080
Alright.

251
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,840
But I have one condition.

252
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,080
Chief, please allow me

253
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,880
into the ancestral hall to pray.

254
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,080
I would like to pray to the God of Grain for guidance in finding the real thief.

255
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,080
Outsiders aren't allowed

256
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,880
to enter our ancestral hall.

257
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,280
You don't trust us,

258
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,280
but surely you trust your God of Grain?

259
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,280
Everyone,

260
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,760
I have received guidance from the God of Grain.

261
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,960
We will definitely catch the true thief today.

262
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,880
Chief,

263
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,320
I need a bowl of clean water

264
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,910
and some plant ash.

265
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,470
You two, get everything prepared.

266
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,640
I observed your brocade

267
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,230
from far earlier.

268
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,280
It had a base color mixed with green.

269
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,960
In the past, there was only one way to dye fabric green,

270
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,470
which was to use minerals.

271
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,280
There is a special substance in these minerals

272
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,710
which will turn red when it comes into contact with water

273
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,960
mixed with plant ash

274
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,790
and remains so for ten days without fading.

275
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,640
Everyone, take a look!

276
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,590
My hands remain unstained

277
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,080
because I never touched the brocade.

278
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,550
Chief,

279
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,000
please lend me your hands.

280
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,000
See? His hands turned red.

281
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,550
Chief touched the brocade before,

282
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,230
which is why his hand reacted.

283
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,320
Mr. Bai here...

284
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,840
Alright.

285
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,000
Let me give it a try too.

286
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,110
Everyone, everyone,

287
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,790
stay calm.

288
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm not running away.

289
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,590
Come on.

290
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,880
It doesn't seem to be him.

291
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,000
So, we have proven our innocence.

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,670
Next,

293
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,000
we will need to test each and every villager.

294
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
Line up, everyone.

295
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
We will test you one by one.

296
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,080
Why does the water turn red like that?

297
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Even if the mineral has this property,

298
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,670
how could it still work

299
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,030
after a hundred years?

300
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,760
I do not have to explain myself to a thief.

301
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,470
I am just curious.

302
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,000
I wanted to look at that brocade.

303
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,710
Who knew that this would happen?

304
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,000
I am innocent too.

305
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,200
You could have escaped.

306
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,150
Why did you get us involved in this?

307
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,670
If I escaped,

308
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,230
that would make me seem guilty.

309
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,440
Besides, if I had truly fled,

310
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,910
wouldn't the real thief

311
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,350
have escaped as well?

312
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,440
Ms. Ji,

313
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,590
what is so special about the water?

314
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,590
I hope you will share it with me.

315
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,320
Dear God of Grain,

316
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,280
I am a descendant of the Ji family

317
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,080
from Huanhua Dyehouse, Ji Yingying.

318
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,590
I came to Gubei Village

319
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,110
to have a look at the brocade pattern.

320
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,550
I have no intentions of being disrespectful.

321
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,000
God of Grain, you are a generous God.

322
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Please forgive me.

323
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,440
Yes.

324
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,400
God of Grain told you the method?

325
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,230
No.

326
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,470
Why did you say yes, then?

327
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,080
But He told me

328
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,590
that if you cooperate with me,

329
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,440
this matter can be resolved.

330
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,960
Ms. Ji,

331
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,590
you must not lie

332
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,790
before the God of Grain.

333
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,150
Why would I?

334
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
He knows that I am helping Him too.

335
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,960
There are no other choices now.

336
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,670
Why not give it a try?

337
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,590
If it can be found,

338
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,400
nothing will happen to us.

339
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If we cannot find it,

340
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,080
you can bury me for it.

341
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,670
Okay.

342
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,000
Please give me your hand.

343
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,880
Rub this powder evenly.

344
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,640
There is no trick.

345
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,880
The Chief simply went along with it.

346
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,550
I understand now.

347
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,550
You are wagering on human nature.

348
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,080
But what if

349
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,670
it was not the villagers who did it?

350
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,320
To act faster than Mr. Bai

351
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,350
and immediately turn around to accuse someone of theft,

352
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,710
I can think of no one else

353
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,230
but the villagers.

354
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,470
That is logical.

355
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,320
Liu Er!

356
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,520
Where are you going?

357
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,760
I did not steal the brocade design.

358
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,110
Why should I be tested?

359
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,710
I have things to do at home!

360
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,710
Bring him back!

361
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,880
Why should you skip it?

362
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,910
I suppose we found it.

363
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,840
I did not steal it!

364
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,710
Why should I be tested?

365
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,150
I...

366
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,760
You have to be tested!

367
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,760
Liu Er,

368
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,110
did you steal the brocade design?

369
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,400
I did not!

370
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,830
Why are you afraid of the test if you did not?

371
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,800
Test! You must be tested!

372
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,560
Test! You have no choice but to do it!

373
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,400
You must be tested!

374
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,470
Give me your hand!

375
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,280
Hand!

376
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,680
Give him your hand!

377
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,110
Give it!

378
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,110
Test! You must be tested!

379
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,680
Hand!

380
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:19,920
God of Grain!

381
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,520
Forgive me!

382
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,040
God of Grain, please forgive me!

383
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,070
I was forced to do this!

384
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,560
Liu Er,

385
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,040
what have gotten into you?

386
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,950
How dare you steal the brocade design!

387
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,470
Are you tired of living?

388
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,350
Do you want to be buried alive?

389
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,710
Chief,

390
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,040
I was forced to do that!

391
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,830
Surely you must know...

392
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,110
My son fell sick recently.

393
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,920
I truly don't have the money for his medical bills at the moment.

394
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,760
If God of Grain is truly protecting me,

395
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,400
He will not blame me

396
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,280
for stealing it and then selling it off

397
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,680
to get money for my son's illness!

398
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,110
You sold the brocade design?

399
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,520
Beat him!

400
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,430
Hit him!

401
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,520
Kill him!

402
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,230
I was not able to sell it.

403
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,230
I was too nervous

404
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,830
when stealing it.

405
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,880
I did not control my strength.

406
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,280
It is in ruins now.

407
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:13,710
Liu Er!

408
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,110
You have a death wish!

409
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,880
You have wronged the whole village!

410
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,280
I admit!

411
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,110
I deserve to die!

412
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,280
But I want to say

413
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,160
that we are all too poor!

414
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,350
Instead of guarding it,

415
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:32,470
why not sell it off

416
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,830
to get us all some money?

417
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,470
Not just my family!

418
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,230
There are Mrs. Zhang's Chunfen

419
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,710
and Liu Wu's Xiao Mutou.

420
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,350
Which of them did not die or become crippled

421
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,830
because they lacked the money to see a physician?

422
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,350
Even your family, Chief!

423
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,560
This brocade design

424
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,830
was bestowed upon our ancestors after they planted the grains,

425
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,830
when they were poor

426
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,760
but protected by the God of Grain!

427
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,070
He was able to save our ancestors.

428
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,400
If He is truly capable of protecting

429
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,070
us now,

430
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,430
He should save us as well!

431
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:27,920
I guess...

432
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,070
I guess I really should not be so stubborn.

433
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,590
Everyone,

434
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,160
I have a plan.

435
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,950
This brocade is already broken.

436
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,920
Why don't you give this to Mr. Yu?

437
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,520
He can return this old brocade

438
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
once he has created a new brocade.

439
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,880
We will give this village some money

440
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,110
for every piece of brocade sold

441
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,040
so that you can all live a good life.

442
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,070
If anyone in the village

443
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,470
wishes to learn how to weave brocade

444
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,470
or seeks to make a living from it,

445
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,230
I am willing to lend a hand.

446
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,110
Can this be repaired?

447
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,880
No.

448
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
While you did not steal it,

449
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,000
it was ruined when you arrived.

450
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,920
That means the God of Grain does not welcome you.

451
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,830
No, you have got it wrong.

452
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,950
We came here

453
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,470
just after your brocade broke.

454
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,110
Mr. Yu comes from a brocade weaving family.

455
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,640
I am specialized in dyeing and selecting colors for silk.

456
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,230
Ms. Zhu is the best at embroidering

457
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,880
from Yizhou.

458
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,470
I suppose your God

459
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,070
brought us here to help you repair this brocade

460
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,710
and begin anew.

461
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:52,830
You...

462
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,640
You can really repair the brocade?

463
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,430
Mr. Yu, are you willing to assist?

464
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,680
Shu brocade has been revered since the Wei and Jin dynasties.

465
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,640
It has endured much through the ages,

466
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,880
but as long as there is a glimmer of hope,

467
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,710
we Shu Jin family will not give up easily.

468
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,110
That is why Shu brocade has been passed down through the generations

469
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,520
and survived all crises.

470
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,230
Instead of guarding yourself from outsiders forever,

471
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:24,680
why not stand up today

472
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,470
so that others cannot easily hurt you?

473
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,310
If the Yu family becomes stronger,

474
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,830
the Yu family's descendants will be blessed too.

475
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,760
Grandfather,

476
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,070
this is Father's favorite brocade.

477
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay.

478
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,640
Okay!

479
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,450
[Gubei Village]

480
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,830
Ms. Ji,

481
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,470
the silk you requested.

482
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,880
Thank you!

483
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,230
Commissioner!

484
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,470
You have great skills!

485
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,710
[Mu Hui, Yizhou's military commissioner]

486
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,280
Come on! It's your turn now!

487
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:11,560
[Xue Yu]

488
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,350
Commissioner...

489
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,830
It is fine.

490
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,160
Mr. Yang is skilled at fighting.

491
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,640
I am sure

492
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,520
he will not harm me.

493
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,110
Since you trust me,

494
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,470
why not

495
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,470
raise the stakes?

496
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,520
Yang Jinglan!

497
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,760
What are you trying to do?

498
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,230
Commissioner,

499
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,710
I am willing to accept the arrow on your behalf.

500
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,710
Wait.

501
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,430
I...

502
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,830
did not agree

503
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,280
to shoot for the apple on his head.

504
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,950
Protect the commissioner!

505
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,160
You were certain

506
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,470
that I

507
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,400
would protect the book?

508
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,680
I heard that you are a lover of historical manuscripts.

509
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,310
You love books as much as your life.

510
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,470
Why would you allow me

511
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,160
to ruin your historical manuscript?

512
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,560
If...

513
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,310
I did not block it in time?

514
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,160
This arrow

515
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,310
would land close to it.

516
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,710
Brave and smart.

517
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,160
Very good.

518
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,680
Get him some tea!

519
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,680
Thanks, Commissioner!

520
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,560
Smuggling tribute brocade.

521
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,680
Faming the Brocade Master.

522
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,350
Murdering brocade officers.

523
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,110
Is Niu Jin

524
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,710
that free?

525
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,070
Commissioner,

526
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,920
General Niu has been your friend for years.

527
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,310
I do not dare hope

528
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,880
that a few words from me

529
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,680
can earn your trust.

530
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,830
I only ask that you will give me

531
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,950
the opportunity to investigate this.

532
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,110
If it is proven,

533
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,520
I am willing to eradicate the evil for you.

534
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,880
What if it is not?

535
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
If it is not proven,

536
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,430
General Niu is innocent.

537
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,920
Your relationship with him will be even stronger.

538
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,950
After so much investigations,

539
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,470
I worry that the false accusations

540
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,310
would also become the truth.

541
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,040
I have heard that the reason you have come

542
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,680
is to clean up the brocade businesses in Yizhou.

543
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,880
Yizhou is your territory.

544
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:18,560
The brocade business is your business.

545
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,230
I am here

546
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,590
only to investigate

547
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,280
who caused the death of my master.

548
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,280
Your master?

549
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,430
The previous brocade officer, Shen Rufeng.

550
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,880
An unknown officer

551
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,160
is able to mentor a student like you?

552
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,350
Yes.

553
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,430
Shen Rufeng is indeed

554
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,070
an unknown officer,

555
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,000
but I wonder if you

556
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,280
have heard of Shen Qingping?

557
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,070
Shen Qingping?

558
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,160
That man

559
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,430
who fought against ten men alone...

560
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,710
The one who defeated the envoys from ten countries?

561
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,710
Yes.

562
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,680
Commissioner,

563
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,310
is it said that when he was the commander of the Royal Guards,

564
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,920
he once taught many of the princes.

565
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,350
He is the unnamed teacher of the crown prince.

566
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,310
Why would someone like this

567
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,110
be willing to hide this true identity

568
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,470
and become a brocade officer?

569
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,070
Why would he die in a foreign land?

570
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,230
That is enough to prove the severity of this case

571
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,640
and the depth of the conspiracy.

572
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,680
You should know

573
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,520
what can be investigated

574
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,640
and what cannot.

575
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,640
Otherwise,

576
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,920
the reinforcements in Chang'an

577
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,680
will not be able to help

578
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,280
the crisis in Yizhou.

579
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,310
I understand.

580
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,000
Why don't...

581
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:48,520
you...

582
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,710
supervise my investigation?

583
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,800
Nobody specific was appointed

584
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,920
to deliver the tributes,

585
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,190
but the commander

586
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,680
is used to selecting men from his camp.

587
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,160
The one who delivered the tribute brocade ten years ago,

588
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,470
the ones you are looking for,

589
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,430
are those three.

590
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,470
One!

591
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,880
Two!

592
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,470
I wonder

593
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,710
who you will send to deliver the Shu Red brocade

594
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,160
this time.

595
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,950
You have good physique

596
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,280
and are good at fighting.

597
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,830
If you ever decide to resign as a brocade officer,

598
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,280
you can come join the army!

599
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,230
You must be joking, General Xue.

600
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,110
My sword is too short.

601
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,470
I cannot protect so many people.

602
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,640
It is challenging enough to protect

603
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,310
one fearless person.

604
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,880
However,

605
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,760
I still have to thank you.

606
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,160
One!

607
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:33,520
Two!

608
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,880
The Chief is here!

609
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
It is done!

610
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,350
It has been repaired!

611
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,950
Is the brocade truly repaired?

612
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,110
It has been repaired. Look!

613
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,640
It is true! It has really been repaired!

614
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,800
Put it down! Quick!

615
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,310
This is our sacred item!

616
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,110
Remarkable!

617
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,070
Put it back!

618
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,190
Move aside!

619
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,350
Mr. Yu!

620
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,160
Ms. Ji,

621
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
if you have time in a few days,

622
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,070
please come to my place to discuss

623
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,920
the transfer of the dyehouse.

624
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,880
Mr. Yu,

625
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,040
I still stand by what I said.

626
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,760
I don't want your dyehouse.

627
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,680
I want to work with you.

628
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,350
Shu brocade has been passed down through the generations,

629
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,830
but it is not because every family had an heir.

630
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,230
It is because the Shu brocade businesses supported one another

631
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,350
and ensured its survival.

632
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,110
That is why we still have the Shu brocade today.

633
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,680
I wonder if the Bloom Society and I

634
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,950
will have the honor

635
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,680
of inheriting

636
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,680
the Yu family's technique.

637
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,110
Good.

638
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,920
Since your ambition knows no bounds,

639
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
why should I fear?

640
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,400
Very well!

641
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,280
I shall give it my all

642
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,640
and make another attempt.

643
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,160
I can see you floating!

644
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,280
Grandfather is floating!

645
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,110
The renewed life of this brocade design

646
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,110
is thanks to the aid of each and every one of you.

647
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,640
Let us...

648
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,230
... ready the feast!

649
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,190
Begin the dance to honor the arrival of our esteemed guests!

650
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,800
Yes!

651
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,350
Let's go!

652
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,470
Look at it if you wish!

653
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,760
It is inappropriate.

654
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,760
But you wished to look.

655
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,950
No, I don't.

656
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,320
[From Classic of Poetry's Cry of the Ospreys]

657
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:44,880
Why must it be gentlemen who wishes

658
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,950
beautiful and virtuous ladies?

659
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,430
Why can't a lady wish for

660
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,680
handsome and chivalrous gentlemen?

661
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,560
Most of the rules for women in the society

662
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,680
are ridiculous!

663
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,680
But if you rebel against it,

664
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
they will think that you are the ridiculous one.

665
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,000
Remarkable!

666
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,350
I was able to weather this crisis

667
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,710
thanks to you, Ms. Ji.

668
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,760
Someone as cunning as you

669
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,160
would have escaped unscathed

670
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,760
even without my assistance.

671
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,310
If I could have escaped on my own,

672
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,800
why would I have given this opportunity

673
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
to you?

674
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,160
Indeed! Why is that so?

675
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,640
Yeah, I wonder why.

676
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,430
I wonder if there will be an opportunity

677
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,760
for us to do business together in the future.

678
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:29,950
If I do have the opportunity,

679
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,350
I hope you will approach it with honesty.

680
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,800
Ms. Ji, Ms. Zhu,

681
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,800
let us dance together!

682
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,400
Sure!

683
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,070
Whether for the brocade workshop

684
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,070
or the brocade pattern,

685
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,830
I will acquire it sooner or later.

686
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,350
But a person

00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,760
both interesting and useful

688
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,430
is a rare encounter.

689

Halt!

690
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,120
Why are you here?

691
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,710
There are many wicked people in the world.

692
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,870
I fear you may fall into their trap

693
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,910
and be sold away.

694
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,910
Good day, Mr. Yang.

I am Bai Sheng.

696
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,040
Mr. Bai, where are you from?

697
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,320
I am from Nanzhao.

698
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,280
What is your occupation?

699
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,120
My family's assets are enough to support me.

700
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,840
What are you doing in Yizhou?

701
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,600
I was drawn by its reputation.

702
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,080
I came here to experience its culture.

703
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,320
Whose reputation have you heard of?

704
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,040
Mr. Yang, are you interrogating me?

705
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,430
As Yizhou's brocade officer,

706
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,040
it is my duty to interrogate

707
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,080
anything that may affect Yizhou,

708
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,630

Ms. Ji and I went thought a life-or-death situation.

She knows me better.

Why don't you ask her?

713
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,520
It was not as exaggerated as that!

714

We were just fighting over business!

You were just working together.

716
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,630
It was not only business.

718
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,630

728
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,230
I suppose she did not notice.

729
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,910
There is a type of quiet

730
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,430

00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,360
and they thanked me,

755
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,320
praising my skills.

756
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,760
They even called me storekeeper!

757
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,800
Mother,

758
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,910
there is no need to find me a husband.

759
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,910
I can manage the family business.

760
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,190
I can take care of you and Father.

761
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,710
We want you to go on dates

762
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,000
because we are growing older.

763
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,670
If you can yourself a reliable husband,

764
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,670
your father and I will have no worries.

765
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,870
Who says I have nobody to rely on?

766
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,390
The Bloom Society is my support.

767
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,950
Mother, I have always listened to you.

768
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,120
Can you trust me this once, please?

769
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,630
Your father and I

770
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,910
have more experience than you!

771
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,520
Would we lead you astray?

772
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,600
We have worked so hard,

773
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,710
all for your own good!

774
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,390
I can choose my own path!

775
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,280
I shall never regret,

776
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,710
even if I should fall and be wounded!

777
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,520
You have been possessed!

778
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,800
You must have been possessed!

779
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,150
Very well! If I cannot persuade you,

780
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,870
I will fetch your father

781
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,120
so that he may rouse you!

782
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,040
Your father and mother

783
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,600
selected the easy path for you.

784
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,120
A safe path.

785
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,910
The path you have chosen

786
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,520
will be fraught with hardship.

787
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,560
Have you considered it carefully?

788
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,710
I have never been more certain than I am at this moment.

789
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,430
Good!

790
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,800
You may stay in my home for as long as you wish.

791
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,280
I am going home.

792
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,600
I am my parents' daughter after all.

793
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Though they cannot understand me now,

794
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
there will come a day when I can prove myself.

795
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,280
They will surely support me then.

796
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,320
Mother, you are here!

797
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,950
Pin and her mother have left?

798
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,870
Mother, I am sorry.

799
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:44,000
Mother, let me explain.

800
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,320
I did not stay out

801
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,390
the whole night on purpose.

802
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,950
I was not alone!

803
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,080
Yu and Pin were both with me!

804
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,430
Mother, I will not do this again!

805
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,520
You have been working for days.

806
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,080
Go and get some rest, quickly.

807
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,520
Mother, are you not angry with me,

808
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,560
nor scolding me?

809
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,280
I have scolded you so many times.

810
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,230
Has it made any difference?

811
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,560
Mother!

812
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,280
I knew you were the best!

813
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,120
You are so kind

814
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,150
and generous!

815
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,710
Your brother has gathered

816
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,910
the ingredients for the dye.

817
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,120
You must not delay

818
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,950
the preparations for the tribute brocade.

819
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,470
Hurry and take a nap!

820
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,910
Once you wake, get to work!

821
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,190
Stop wandering about all the time.

822
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,150
Yes! I will go get a nap now.

823
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,280
You are the best!

824
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,280
Hurry up!

825
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,470
Pin?

826
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,600
Shisi.

827
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,950
I...

828
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,840
I brought some pastries from San Hua Pavilion.

829
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,190
I am here to apologize to you.

830
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,190
Apologize?

831
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,470
I said the wrong thing and made you upset.

832
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,710
I have reflected upon it for some time,

833
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,040
yet still, I know not how to atone for my words.

834
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,280
In all my years, I have never offered an apology to anyone.

835
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
How about this?

836
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,670
I will do whatever is needed,

837
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,840
if only to see your anger ease.

838
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,630
It is I who should offer the apology.

839
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,840
I was in a bad mood,

840
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,430
and I took it out on you.

841
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,470
I am fine.

842
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,870
Is this still about the blind dates, then?

843
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,390
In truth,

844
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,710
I was not jesting.

845
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,040
Once I have convinced my father,

846
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,080
I will go to your family...

847
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,630
To...

848
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,430
To propose to you.

849
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,910
I have given it much thought.

850
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,040
I will not rush into courting.

851
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,630
Yingying is a woman.

852
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,000
I am also a woman.

853
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,710
She is capable of supporting her family's business,

854
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,470
and so can I.

855
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,630
But you must not shirk the duty of marriage for your entire life!

856
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,430
Shisi,

857
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,360
thank you for liking me.

858
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,190
Even if the day comes when I must marry,

859
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,280
I would seek

860
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,840
a man who can share with me

861
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,040
the trials and triumphs of life,

862
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,040
one who will stand beside me in battle.

863
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,840
And that person is not you.

864
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,430
I am sorry.

865
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,760
I do not care for that.
