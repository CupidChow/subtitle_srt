00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,760
[Brocade Bureau]

4
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,920
What is the update on the foreign merchants?

5
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
We've looked into the foreign merchants

6
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,160
transporting brocade to Nanzhao.

7
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,520
No problem was found in their records, finances, and personnel.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,960
You have recovered?

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,360
What do you think?

10
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Looking at you now,

11
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,320
it seems you are ready to crash another wedding.

12
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,160
Forget it.

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,120
I feel happy enough to have Yingying.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
What is this?

15
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,720
Oh, right.

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
Our group that investigated in Nanzhao has returned.

17
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,320
Turns out Bai Sheng is Prince Bai of Nanzhao.

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,470
Bai Sheng.

19
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,160
Prince Bai.

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,000
Here is the evidence.

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,400
Shu Red Brocade?

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,960
Draft another document

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,360
to explain the matter clearly.

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,880
We should ask the Crown Prince to intervene.

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,160
The intervention needs to happen fast.

26
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,720
Write this:

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,320
"If there is any delay,

28
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,600
your junior's life will be at stake."

29
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,720
That said,

30
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,200
although we have the evidence,

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,600
he is still the prince of Nanzhao.

32
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,480
The court

33
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,160
would not risk offending them.

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,920
Prince Bai of Nanzhao is conspiring

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,120
with the general of Yizhou.

36
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,200
Even if Prince Bai cannot be detained,

37
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,760
we must arrest Niu Jin first.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,720
Also,

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,520
make sure to mention in your document

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,560
that this Shu Red wedding attire belongs to my wife.

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,800
She is kind enough

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,880
to let them see it.

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,520
Take good care of it

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,120
and return it as soon as possible.

45
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,800
Alright.

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,640
Should we keep investigating the foreign merchants?

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,840
Of course.

48
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,000
We had better get more evidence.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,680
Besides those we already know,

50
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,520
check the merchants transporting other goods as well.

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,760
Those merchants are full of tricks.

52
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,160
They're good at evading taxes.

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,360
The fact that they claim they will not head to Nanzhao

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,960
does not mean they will not go there.

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,600
But so many foreign merchants

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,680
are passing through Yizhou.

57
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
It will be impossible

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,360
to check them all in time.

59
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,280
We do not need to investigate every single one.

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,720
Then how should we do it?

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,400
Have some tea.

62
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,120
Do you think I can have tea?

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
I still have plenty of work to do.

64
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Tell me.

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,840
How much is Shu brocade worth?

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,960
The brocade is as valuable as gold.

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
Next question.

68
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,360
Who should wear such fine brocade?

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,960
High-ranking officials

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,200
and distinguished nobles.

71
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,440
But if ordinary folks

72
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,920
were able to enjoy such luxury,

73
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,520
they would surely sing praises

74
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,840
about the Yang family's generosity.

75
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,520
This would also help the Yang family build good ties.

76
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,240
What use are the praises

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,800
of lowly folks?

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,760
Let me teach you something.

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,600
If the poor were to wear brocade,

80
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,040
it would spoil the nobles' refined taste.

81
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
It is just brocade fragment.

82
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,120
Are those nobles really that petty?

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,920
What insolence!

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,800
How dare you disrespect your elder!

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,840
Is this how you speak to your uncle?

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,360
Mrs. Yang,

87
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,200
the new bride does not know any better.

88
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,760
No matter how busy you are,

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,760
you should still find time to discipline her.

90
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,160
Thankfully, Sir Yang showed up just before

91
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,360
anything could go wrong.

92
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,520
I was the one who permitted Yingying

93
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,000
to use the brocade fragment.

94
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,960
If Yingying is truly at fault,

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,520
then as the matriarch,

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,160
I should take responsibility too.

97
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,360
Madam...

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,240
Yingying,

99
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,800
please hold your tongue.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,120
You have always been meticulous in managing

101
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,560
the Yang family business.

102
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,560
Someone must have manipulated you

103
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,600
and clouded your judgment.

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,160
We trust you will handle this fairly

105
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,520
to preserve the Yang family's dignity.

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
I had a lapse in judgment.

107
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,400
Luckily, Sir Yang intervened

108
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
before anything could go wrong.

109
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,240
That said,

110
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,240
we must not make a big deal of this.

111
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,320
If this blows up,

112
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,560
it could tarnish

113
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,760
the Yang family's name.

114
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,960
What do you all think?

115
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,120
Well...

116
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,600
You are the one in charge.

117
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,560
Just handle it as you see fit.

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Yingying,

119
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,920
stop the brocade fragment business.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,240
Since you are new to the family

121
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,640
and unfamiliar with the Yang family's rules,

122
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,920
it almost led to a major incident.

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,760
Copy the Yang family's rules three times.

124
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,480
Sure.

125
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
Three times.

126
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,560
Make sure you do not miss a single word!

127
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,560
I promised you,

128
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,720
but I ended up stopping you.

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,720
I broke my word.

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,920
I am sorry.

131
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,440
We cannot fight with the clan.

132
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,520
We may come out on top today,

133
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,440
but tomorrow is another story.

134
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,440
I am married into the Yang family.

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,760
Despite being in charge,

136
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,840
I must abide by the Yang family's rules.

137
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,240
Can't these rules be changed?

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,640
The Yang family's rules have been passed down

139
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,760
for generations

140
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,160
and are deeply ingrained in the family.

141
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
They are not so easy to change.

142
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,380
[Yuebuhuan Inn]

143
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I used to think that the wives of wealthy families

144
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,280
just spent their days counting money.

145
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,080
But it seems like

146
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
every family has its own troubles.

147
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
You thought wrong.

148
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,240
Those elders are all so difficult to deal with.

149
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,320
If you do it wrong,

150
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,520
they criticize you.

151
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,280
But if you do it right,

152
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,670
they accuse you of breaking the rules.

153
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,160
My mother warned me not to cause any trouble,

154
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
but now trouble troubles me instead.

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
What would you do?

156
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,280
Leave, or just put up with it.

157
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,520
Is there no other choice?

158
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,480
If there were,

159
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,760
I would not have left the Yang family.

160
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,640
Well, I'm choosing the third option.

161
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,880
What is it?

162
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,520
I have not figured it out yet.

163
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,880
Maybe it will be

164
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,040
all for naught in the end.

165
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,560
I will continue the brocade fragment business.

166
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,120
I do not care who is in charge.

167
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,960
I just want to prove that they are wrong.

168
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,480
I think it is a good idea.

169
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,080
If the Yang family refuses to sell it,

170
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,320
our Bloom Society can make and sell it ourselves.

171
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,880
I also think it is a great idea.

172
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,640
Would Ms. Ji be interested in selling it

173
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
in the foreign market?

174
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
Mr. Bai, you came uninvited,

175
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,840
which seems a little improper.

176
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,880
Apologies,

177
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,880
that was rude of me.

178
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,960
But I have been meaning

179
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,520
to meet Ms. Ji

180
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
for quite a while.

181
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,480
I heard

182
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,080
your brocade fragment business ended,

183
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,760
and it is such a pity.

184
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,720
So I came here today

185
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,680
to discuss a potential collaboration with you.

186
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,560
The profit made from the brocade fragment

187
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,480
is hardly anything for someone like you.

188
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,560
So, you see,

189
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,680
business is just a front

190
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,520
to build a friendship with you.

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,560
I don't see why not.

192
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,880
But if we are collaborating,

193
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,520
I will be the one setting the terms.

194
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,320
As you wish, Ms. Ji.

195
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,680
Come this way!

196
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
Shu brocade sachets,

197
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,040
Shu brocade gift boxes,

198
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,840
and Shu brocade products!

199
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,000
Come on, take a look!

200
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,280
Sharing joy with the people through Shu brocade products!

201
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,760
Shu brocade pouches, Shu brocade sachets,

202
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,000
Shu brocade gift boxes!

203
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,800
Come and have a look, everyone!

204
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,960
Miss, this is

205
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,760
really beautiful!

206
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
It is our own Shu brocade gift box.

207
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Feel free to take a look.

208
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,080
It's so good.

209
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,280
How about

210
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,400
this brocade gift box?

211
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,080
Where did you get these brocades from?

212
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,040
Who permitted you to sell these things here?

213
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
Sir,

214
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,520
Shu brocade is as valuable as gold.

215
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,360
Even the brocade fragments and sample pieces are too precious to waste.

216
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,160
So, we have decided to make

217
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,120
small accessories from them.

218
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:04,760
Yeah.

219
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,280
These are just the brocade fragments from your clothing.

220
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,080
We use them to make small accessories

221
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,480
that everyone can afford.

222
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,840
This is the spirit of sharing joy with the people.

223
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,680
Goods come in all qualities and prices,

224
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,680
just as people are separated into classes.

225
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,480
They don't deserve to use

226
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,880
what I use!

227
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,360
Why not?

228
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,280
Shu brocade is made by the people.

229
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,560
Why don't they deserve to use it?

230
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Yeah!

231
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,680
Regardless of how successful your business gets,

232
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
you still need to hire ordinary folks

233
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,720
and sell your goods to them.

234
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,320
By granting them these small favors,

235
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,280
they will gladly work for you

236
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,760
and buy more of your goods.

237
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,720
Is that not a good thing?

238
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,120
Mr. Sang,

239
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,080
I do not mind these things,

240
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,920
but the other officials

241
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,160
will never buy your words.

242
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,840
They are wrong.

243
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,840
You are wrong.

244
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,960
Why so?

245
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,120
Because those officials are much more particular.

246
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,840
There was once a minister

247
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,680
in the previous dynasty

248
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,680
who wore patched clothes to court.

249
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,760
He was later praised by the emperor and many officials.

250
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Shu brocade is beautiful,

251
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,560
and you can use it to earn a reputation for sharing joy with the people.

252
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,800
Is that not a good thing?

253
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,960
Yeah! Is that not a good thing?

254
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,040
Let me tell you one more thing.

255
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,160
What was it again?

256
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,730
[From Clear Water as a Mirror by poet Cui Hao in Tang dynasty]

257
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,160
May the legacy of virtue

258
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,320
resonate through the ages.

259
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,000
May the legacy of virtue

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,320
resonate through the ages!

261
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
Mr. Sang, your words

262
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,920
have truly enlightened me.

263
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,760
Well...

264
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,120
In that case, I will take

265
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,280
a few of these.

266
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,120
Yeah! Go on!

267
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,040
It is all about sharing joy with the people.

268
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,440
Everyone is welcome here!

269
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,520
You have changed so much

270
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,880
in just three days.

271
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,280
This is nothing.

272
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,560
It is all thanks to Ms. Ji,

273
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,480
our former president, for showing me the way.

274
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,840
Shu brocade accessories!

275
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,240
Shu brocade pouches!

276
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,680
Everyone, come take a look!

277
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
What a pity.

278
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,080
Why do you say so?

279
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
If this had happened some days ago,

280
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,480
you would have been the one

281
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,040
calling the shots there.

282
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,600
But now,

283
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,480
after you have married into the Yang family,

284
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,920
you no longer have that freedom.

285
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,480
Mr. Bai,

286
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,880
I heard that men from Nanzhao

287
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,760
usually inherit the last word of their father's name as their surname.

288
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,640
What is your father's name?

289
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,480
Ms. Ji, why are you suddenly

290
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,880
so interested in me?

291
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,880
Well, you know everything about me,

292
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,000
but I know very little

293
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,680
about you.

294
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,480
You will never fail only if you know your enemy as well as yourself.

295
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,640
I need to know your weaknesses

296
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,320
before I can continue working with you without worrying.

297
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,280
Weakness?

298
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,880
Very well.

299
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,240
My weakness

300
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,880
is that I do not eat sweet food.

301
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
You are not sincere at all.

302
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,360
Fine.

303
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,480
I was just joking.

304
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,560
No need to take it seriously.

305
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,760
But you do not seem

306
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,360
the type to jest.

307
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,480
Alright. What do you want to know?

308
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
I will tell you

309
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
everything that I know.

310
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,720
Really?

311
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,760
Yes.

312
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,080
Why don't you tell me about Nanzhao?

313
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,120
I thought you wanted to get to know me better?

314
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,240
Why are you asking about Nanzhao?

315
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,880
People are shaped by their roots.

316
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,880
It is only natural for me to start with your background.

317
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,160
Is that so?

318
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,040
Alright.

319
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,720
What would you like to know

320
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,480
about Nanzhao?

321
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,640
For example...

322
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,360
Nanzhao's brocade business.

323
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,560
What are the kinds of Nanzhao merchants that come to Yizhou?

324
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,040
Does Nanzhao have their own brocade manufacturing?

325
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,320
The answers to these questions

326
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,080
will be very long.

327
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,840
It is fine. Take your time.

328
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,960
But the problem is... I'm starving right now.

329
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,480
How about this?

330
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,360
Buy me a meal.

331
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
We will talk as we eat. Is that OK?

332
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,240
Shopkeeper! Get us a bowl of lamb noodles!

333
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,480
Coming!

334
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,160
One bowl of lamb noodles?

335
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,080
Is it not sufficient?

336
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,880
It is.

337
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,680
Please enjoy.

338
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,880
Alright, thank you.

339
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
This is your wages.

340
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,840
You can only have it after you answer me.

341
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Very well.

342
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,280
Nanzhao's silk is not the same as that in Zhongyuan,

343
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,120
so it cannot be made into brocade.

344
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,680
That is why all these years,

345
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,120
Nanzhao has been purchasing brocade from Yizhou.

346
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,280
Merchants usually depart from Yizhou.

347
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,120
They travel by the Shu-Yuandu route.

348
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
You must stay calm.

349
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,120
With Ms. Ji's character,

350
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,440
she would never...

351
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,640
My wife

352
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,070
has the freedom to work with anyone she likes.

353
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,310
But who is that with her?

354
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
That is Prince Bai!

355
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,640
I am depending on you.

356
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,830
Must we do this?

357
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,720
Mr. Yang's newly acquired prized steed

358
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,680
was accidentally lost in Fan City!

359
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,520
All merchants are requested to cooperate

360
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,840
and await Mr. Yang's investigation!

361
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,480
You lost your horse?

362
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,560
Yes! A good horse was lost just like that!

363
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,240
Mr. Bai

364
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,880
will not mind if I have a look at your residence, will you?

365
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,360
Do you suspect

366
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,960
that I stole your horse?

367
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,840
I ate from that just now.

368
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,240
So sweet!

369
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,680
No!

370
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,680
I do not suspect you.

371
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,240
I suspect all of you here.

372
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,240
Chi Hu,

373
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,440
take Mr. Yang to the stables to have a look.

374
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,960
Yes.

375
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,880
Mr. Bai, is there something wrong with your ears?

376
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,520
I said everyone!

377
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,720
Why?

378
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,280
You want to blow me off with your servant?

379
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,640
Please do not misunderstand. That is not my intention.

380
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
But I

381
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,280
have something to discuss with Ms. Ji.

382
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,520
I can't leave now.

383
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
Yingying, you can come with us.

384
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,480
Husband and wife should be united.

385
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,240
What is there that I cannot hear?

386
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,680
Yang Jinglan.

387
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,520
Even if you are officially married,

388
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,120
you are not able to listen in

389
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,120
on everything about her business.

390
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Mr. Bai, give us a moment.

391
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,960
Come with me.

392
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,240
Please wait a moment.

393
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,720
Yingying.

394
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,640
Must you force him into a corner?

395
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,840
Did you not head to Chang'an already?

396
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,480
There is not enough evidence.

397
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,680
I am doing this now

398
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,280
to make him think that I am suspicious of him

399
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,080
and getting close to him.

400
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,160
So he will not dare to simply make a move.

401
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,080
We need to buy time for Chang'an.

402
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,680
What are you doing here?

403
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,440
For business, of course!

404
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,080
Do not worry. I am only focused on the business.

405
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,280
I am not taking risks.

406
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,280
Alright. Since you are here,

407
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,040
I will leave.

408
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Alright! You can leave.

409
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,960
Put your hand down. Raise your voice!

410
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,040
Why are you not going home since I have come?

411
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Why are you raising your voice?

412
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
I will go right now!

413
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,040
Go to hell!

414
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,120
Ms. Ji?

415
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,440
Ms. Ji!

416
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,560
Mr. Bai,

417
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,120
my wife was rude

418
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,320
to leave without a word.

419
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,880
I apologize to you on her behalf.

420
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,880
You are taking this too seriously.

421
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,640
Ms. Ji has always been like this. It is fine.

422
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,360
What is it?

423
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,360
Stable.

424
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,280
Stable!

425
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,360
Here. This way, please.

426
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,280
Look at this! Horses from Nanzhao are really different.

427
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,360
How could you tell?

428
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,560
Tubo is arid.

429
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,880
Nanzhao is humid.

430
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Zhongyuan is in the middle.

431
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,880
Horses that have been in different regions

432
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,080
have a different shine to their coat.

433
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,480
Do you think horses will get used to their current climate

434
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,320
after being there for a long time just like humans?

435
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
We will find it out after we have tested it.

436
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,120
Mr. Bai, please lend me your pouch.

437
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,680
This proves

438
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,880
that it hasn't forgotten Nanzhao's scent.

439
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,920
Is the horse you are looking for

440
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,080
inside my stable?

441
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,480
It is not here at all.

442
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,480
After all, I bought a good and loyal horse.

443
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,080
Zhuge! Let's go.

444
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,240
Tell our men not to make any moves lightly.

445
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,000
Cooperate with him

446
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,880
however he investigates.

447
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,360
At this point, the more moves we make,

448
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,880
the easier it will be to make a mistake.

449
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,440
Also,

450
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,240
send some men to keep watch on Niu Jin.

451
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
He is not the type to sit back and wait for things to happen.

452
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
We are not the only ones in this mess.

453
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,320
Yes.

454
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,840
So are we going to disrupt

455
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,280
Ji Yingying's business in the foreign market

456
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:47,960
or...

457
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,440
We are not going to do that,

458
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,640
but we are going to help her instead.

459
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
The more successful her business is,

460
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,320
the bigger the conflict she has with the Yang family.

461
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,640
Mr. Liu?

462
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,480
Ms. Ji,

463
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,840
you are back.

464
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
You are...

465
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
I am old.

466
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,840
I am not able to work anymore.

467
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
I am leaving the Yang family now.

468
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,440
I was planning to leave without a word.

469
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,040
But you

470
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,120
helped me before.

471
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,640
I must bid farewell to you properly.

472
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,400
I wish you and Mr. Yang safety and success.

473
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,040
Why are you leaving suddenly?

474
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,040
Did my issues cause you trouble?

475
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,120
Ms. Ji,

476
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,800
please stop asking.

477
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
If you do not tell me the truth,

478
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,520
I will speak to the matriarch right now.

479
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,320
Do not do that.

480
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,960
Sir Yang said that

481
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,040
I got you into the brocade fragment business.

482
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,640
He said that I harbored bad intentions.

483
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,240
He sent me away.

484
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,120
However, the matriarch felt bad for me

485
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,040
and gave me a large sum of wages.

486
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,840
It will be enough to support my family for a long time.

487
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,440
Preposterous!

488
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,560
How dare you slack off while serving Sir Yang!

489
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:11,240
How dare you slack off while serving Sir Yang...?

490
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:12,920
Stop.

491
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,520
Get up.

492
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,640
Ms. Ji...

493
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,440
Uncle Yang,

494
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,120
what did Jin Xiu do

495
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,880
to make you hit her?

496
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,440
I came to your quarters.

497
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,760
She slacked off while serving me!

498
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,480
She deserves to be beaten.

499
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,680
I might believe you

500
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,440
if you said it was someone else,

501
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,040
but Jin Xiu

502
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,640
is the most rule-abiding maid in the Yang residence.

503
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,920
Not just you,

504
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,680
even if a dog came in,

505
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,400
she would attend to it according to our rules.

506
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,840
Ji Yingying, have you lost your mind?

507
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,000
Are you insulting me?

508
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,480
How did I insult you?

509
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,640
Come at me if you are upset.

510
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,640
Even if my people really made a mistake,

511
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,240
there is no need for you to be involved.

512
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,040
Fine.

513
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,800
I will tell you clearly

514
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
that I am here for you!

515
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,040
I beat her to punish you.

516
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
It is your fault for selling those brocade fragments.

517
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,440
I want to tell everyone

518
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,760
that I am beating her to punish you!

519
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,680
Continue!

520
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,240
Try it and see!

521
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,920
The brocade fragments

522
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,240
are being sold by Bloom Society

523
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,440
in Fan City.

524
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,640
It has nothing to do with me

525
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,200
or the Yang family at all.

526
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,840
Even if you brought the whole clan here again,

527
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,680
I did not do anything wrong.

528
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,240
Nothing at all?

529
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,880
Let me ask you,

530
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
do you admit

531
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,600
that you are working in public

532
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,520
and

533
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,840
are suspected of being intimate with other men

534
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,680
despite being a daughter-in-law of the Yang family?

535
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,000
Which businesswoman does not have to be out in public when doing business?

536
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,280
Do you dare

537
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,080
to bring this up in front of the matriarch?

538
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Being intimate with other men...

539
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,240
There were so many people in the city today.

540
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,440
Jinglan was there too.

541
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,240
I did not cross the line at all.

542
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,920
Please do not judge people

543
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,040
with your dirty thoughts.

544
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,680
Me?

545
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,800
You are so useless!

546
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,800
I am going to beat her today.

547
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,440
Let me see who dares to stop me!

548
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,200
The Yang family's Rule 23 states

549
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,040
that servants should follow the lead

550
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,440
of their masters with proper decorum.

551
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,680
Rule 65 states

552
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,080
that there is a distinction between internal and external affairs.

553
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,280
Internal matters should be prioritized and external ones are not to affect them.

554
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

555
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,680
What do you mean by that?

556
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,880
Thanks to you,

557
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,320
I copied the Yang family's rules three times.

558
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,240
I am very familiar with it.

559
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,480
These two rules mean

560
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,880
that I am going back to my mother's home.

561
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,040
As my personal maid,

562
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,440
Jin Xiu must go with me.

563
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,200
As for this punishment,

564
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,440
we will talk about it again when I get back.

565
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,000
Jin Xiu,

566
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,720
pack our bags. We are leaving.

567
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,240
Yes.

568
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,280
Why are you still here?

569
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,720
Did I recite any of the rules wrongly?

570
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,520
Or are you staying to see me off?

571
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,320
I am leaving!

572
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,520
You are going to your mother's home?

573
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,040
Wonderful!

574
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,440
Never come back again

575
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,120
if you can.

576
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,400
Let's go!

577
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,920
Wait.

578
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,720
Leave the punishment stick here.

579
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,120
Let's go!

580
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,720
[Huanhua Dyehouse]

581
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,320
Mother's cooking is still the best!

582
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,520
Eat slowly. Nobody will get at it against you.

583
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,120
Here.

584
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,160
Ms. Ji, mind your manners!

585
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,520
You can leave us.

586
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,200
Get some rest.

587
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,800
There are not so many rules here.

588
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,160
Ms. Ji,

589
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
according to the Yang family's rules,

590
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,480
when you are outside, I have to...

591
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,680
I have to complain to my brother and mother!

592
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,080
It is not convenient with you around.

593
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,240
Hurry up and get some rest!

594
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,960
My orders are also the Yang family's rules.

595
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,760
Yes.

596
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,320
Yingying, this girl...

597
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,280
Mrs. Yang saved her life once.

598
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,560
She wants to repay Mrs. Yang,

599
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,200
so the Yang family's rules have completely brainwashed her.

600
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,920
You said that you have complaints.

601
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,520
Is Yang Jinglan not treating you well?

602
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,760
No.

603
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,280
It is not Yang Jinglan who is not treating me well.

604
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
It is the Yang family.

605
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,560
The Yang family?

606
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,920
It is not exactly the Yang family.

607
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,520
It is... It is my opinion

608
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,000
that are conflicts with the Yang family's rules.

609
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,520
Are you on the right side

610
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,080
or are the rules on the right?

611
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,800
Those rules

612
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,160
maintain the operation of the whole Yang family clan.

613
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,160
It is not completely useless.

614
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,200
But it is too rigid.

615
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,120
Some are not compassionate at all.

616
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Some only benefit the clansmen

617
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,280
while holding back the advancement of the whole Yang family.

618
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,520
You have it broken down so well.

619
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,800
You must have made up your mind, have you not?

620
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,960
Just do what you want.

621
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,680
I trust you.

622
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,960
Those who follow me will succeed,

623
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,080
those who reject me will perish.

624
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,800
Gui!

625
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,960
Mr. Yang.

626
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,280
Jinglan is here?

627
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,280
Come on!

628
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,800
Mother.

629
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,800
Ji Gui, get a set of utensils!

630
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,560
I am here just in time.

631
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,520
Would you all

632
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,520
like to try my cooking?

633
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,520
Quickly! Have a seat.

634
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,560
Here.

635
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,400
Why did you come?

636
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,760
I came back for a visit

637
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,000
because I missed my mother and brother.

638
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,000
I missed my family too.

639
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,960
That is why I came back to visit.

640
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,080
There are so many dishes!

641
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,280
Especially this one!

642
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,600
I know it will taste good from the looks of it!

643
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,880
Mother means

644
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,280
that you should come more often.

645
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,000
Come whenever you want, alright?

646
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,760
Yes,

647
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,680
Madam!

648
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,200
Eat some! Try this.

649
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,000
Here!

650
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,120
Mother,

651
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,080
I am really not that fragile.

652
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
I have made up my mind

653
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,360
about how to deal with them

654
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,080
during the journey.

655
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,560
I will not admit defeat.

656
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,520
You are very strong.

657
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,920
That is your ability.

658
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,680
But I want to protect you,

659
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,000
which represents my feelings.

660
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,360
Are you willing

661
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,760
to accept my feelings?

662
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,920
I would like to hear it.

663
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,680
I would like to hear it too.

664
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,920
Tell me.

665
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,320
Alright.

666
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,120
I have sent my men to check the accounts of the Yang family's stores.

667
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,200
The reason?

668
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,320
My second uncle says

669
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,720
that everyone in the Yang family

670
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,360
follows the rules except my wife

671
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,160
and that they can pass any investigation.

672
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,960
If it's true,

673
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,920
we will investigate them thoroughly

674
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,520
to see if they follow rules.

675
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,480
Crush one's spirit to destroy their soul.

676
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,120
Here!

677
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,200
Let's toast to the crushing of their spirits!

678
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,920
Cheers.

679
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,760
Let's toast to not taking alcohol

680
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,800
for three months

681
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,760
and to a long and healthy life.

682
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,720
Cheers.

683
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
I will follow your advice, my dear.

684
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,720
Ji Yaoting!

685
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,400
Show yourself.

686
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,080
Show yourself!

687
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,720
I am leaving if you do not show yourself.

688
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,120
No! Please don't go.

689
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,840
Did you make this swing?

690
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,160
Yes.

691
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,280
I submerged these wood in herbs.

692
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,520
The book says that this can prevent mosquitoes and bugs from coming close.

693
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,720
Why are you holding that?

694
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,560
I planted some peach trees over there.

695
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,400
It will bloom this time next year.

696
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,000
Do you know why I come here on this day every month?

697
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,280
The eighth of each month

698
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,720
is the date when merchants return home.

699
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,280
From this spot,

700
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,520
you can see the route your father takes.

701
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,600
You and your mother always waited for him here.

702
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Later on,

703
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,000
you came here alone

704
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,680
to think of them.

705
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,800
The bell on the swing

706
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,120
was given to me by your father's friend.

707
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,920
It was the horse bell that they used.

708
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,000
I wanted to let you

709
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,280
feel more comfortable

710
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
whenever you remember them here.

711
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,800
When you think of this place again,

712
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,120
you will have more good memories.

713
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,840
Did I...

714
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,760
make a mistake somewhere?

715
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,920
You did very well.

716
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,320
I am very touched.

717
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,280
But I am not a debutant who has not experienced life.

718
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,560
When one is deeply in love,

719
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,960
who would not be willing to go all out

720
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,920
and be understanding?

721
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
But as the days go by...

722
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,800
Nobody can predict

723
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,000
how the future would look like.

724
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,160
That is why I do not want to make any other promises to you.

725
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,680
I will prove myself to you by my actions.

726
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,520
Why are you so stubborn?

727
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,480
If I can find the start of the silk thread,

728
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,360
I can fix them up tidily.

729
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,040
But there are times

730
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,760
you cannot find the start of the thread.

731
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,560
It is crisscrossed

732
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,710
over and over.

733
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,710
It can never be fixed again.

I shall take my leave now.

752
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,340
♪A lifetime unfolds, a solitary bloom♪

753
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,210
♪Even if we part, I will♪

754
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,970
♪Hold on long♪

755
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,550
♪Love has no strength to break free♪

756
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,290
♪Even if it ends with no decree♪

757
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,760
♪You are a falling leaf, brushing past me♪

758
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,260
♪Stirring ripples, a whirlpool set free♪

759
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,740
♪Year after year♪

00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,280
♪Memories entwined, stronger than love’s song♪

00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,740
♪A lifetime unfolds, a solitary bloom♪

00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,960
♪Even if we part, I will♪

763
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,630
♪Hold on long♪

764
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,160
Next rule.

765
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,320
Brocade weaving begins at Mao hour

766
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,360
and ends at You hour.

767
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,920
You will be paid monthly.

768
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,960
A day's wages will be deducted if you miss a day of work.

769
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,520
If you miss ten days of work,

770
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,360
then your wages for the month will be deducted.

771
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,080
That is not fair.

772
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Who would start working at Mao hour?

773
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,560
That seems to be a little

774
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,120
inhumane!

775
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
Nobody starts working at Mao hour!

776
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,600
Who prepared the porridge you eat at Chen hour?

777
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,360
Who swept the clean roads you walk past

778
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,400
at Wu hour?

779
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,720
Those are servants.

780
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,480
Craftsmen...

781
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,920
Are also workers.

782
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,560
They also have to make money to survive.

783
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,120
That is still unreasonable!

784
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,520
Why should a month of wages be deducted

785
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,400
if you missed ten days of work?

786
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,360
Brocade weaving is different from other occupations.

787
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
You can still make up for it if you miss a day of work.

788
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,640
But if you miss ten days of work,

789
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,800
someone else needs to be covered for you

790
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,320
or the whole brocade workshop's deadline will be delayed.

791
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,000
A large sum of penalty needs to be paid to the customer who places the order.

792
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,720
The wages for the person who covers for those who miss work

793
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,560
are usually taken

794
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,120
from the one who causes the situation.

795
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,280
Then...

796
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,320
Then that is reasonable.

797
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,320
Yingying,

798
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,360
I told you that I couldn't do this

799
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,360
but you made me come!

800
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
I should just leave.

801
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,320
Sit properly.

802
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,680
Today's objective is to ask all of you

803
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,080
to give opinions

804
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,120
based on your own perspective.

805
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,760
There are old and young people here.

806
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,600
We have brocade weavers and dyehouse workers here.

807
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,920
We have insiders and outsiders here.

808
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,320
This way, we will be able to have a more holistic discussion

809
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,360
about the advantages and disadvantages of the rules.

810
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,520
You are not that wrong.

811
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,400
Deducting a month of wages

812
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,960
for missing ten days of work

813
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,760
does not seem that reasonable.

814
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,960
The brocade industry has its own characteristics,

815
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,320
but a brocade weaver is only working to make money.

816
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,920
If it is not unavoidable,

817
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,680
they will not be willing to miss work.

818
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,480
If they are forced to miss work due to illness or injury

819
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,600
and have a month of wages deducted,

820
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,280
would that not be pushing them lower in their time of need?

821
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,280
That is right! That is what I meant.

822
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,480
Ms. Zhu, you are indeed my soulmate!

823
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,800
Well... I mean,

824
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,520
Ms. Zhu is correct.

825
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,920
This rule is indeed a little unreasonable.

826
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,400
Do you all still think

827
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,720
there is anything else that is unreasonable?

828
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,520
It is all unreasonable.

829
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,920
The people pushing their horse faster

830
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,120
would not care how the horse thinks.

831
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,360
What does that have to do with horses?

832
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,720
Who is buying horses?

833
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,160
Mr. Yu.

834
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
Please sit.

835
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,360
Nobody is buying horses.

836
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,120
We are discussing the rules in the brocade industry.

837
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,720
This is because some rules were set since long ago

838
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,480
so it is no longer relevant in today's society.

839
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,000
Some seem to have secured existing benefits

840
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,720
but it has actually hindered long term growth.

841
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,200
That is why

842
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,920
I have gathered everyone here to talk about it today

843
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,120
to see if there are any unreasonable points.

844
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,720
Xi was rambling again.

845
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,560
What does it have to do with horses?

846
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,560
No.

847
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Xi meant to say

848
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,720
that the rules are written by the employers.

849
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,720
It is expected that it guards the benefits of the employers.

850
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,000
None of the rules

851
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,360
would protect the employees.

852
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Instead of questioning if the rules make sense,

853
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,360
we should ask ourselves which side are we on.

854
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,480
Which side do you want to be on?

855
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,120
I am an employer,

856
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
but I am also an employee.

857
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,560
It does not matter which side I am on.

858
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,520
I am on the side of justice.

859
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,880
I do not want the weavers who work hard

860
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,920
to not be able to afford a few pieces of Shu brocade,

861
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,560
or be sent away without a proper reason

862
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,320
like Liu.

863
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,360
Or be too afraid to go to a doctor

864
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,400
when they fall sick.

865
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,080
Philanthropist!

866
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,320
Of course, I want to make money too.

867
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,440
Being good to my employees does not conflict

868
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,600
with making money.

869
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,360
If they have a better quality of life,

870
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,520
they would be more motivated.

871
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,000
Then the products of their work

872
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,520
would be worth even more.

873
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,720
How about this?

874
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,880
Let us add one more rule.

875
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,520
Those who do well

876
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,480
will be paid more.

877
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,600
This would indeed achieve a win-win situation.

878
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,920
When we have set up the rules properly,

879
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,720
we can experiment with them

880
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,640
on our family's new brocade workshop.

881
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,520
Some of the rules can also be used in Bloom Society.

882
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,640
Dyeing and weaving are not that different.

883
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,560
I agree!

884
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,040
I am old now.

885
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,080
These apprentices

886
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,440
are the future of the Yu family.

887
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,040
Have you heard everything just now?

888
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,160
Do you have any thoughts? Voice them out.

889
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:43,960
Say something!

890
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,440
What is wrong?

891
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,640
Have all of my apprentices become mute?

892
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,280
Master,

893
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,080
I think

894
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,520
that men will all die.

895
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,840
Yu Huai'en, you will lose all your hair if you copy me!

896
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,760
W-Why would he lose his hair?

897
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:00,840
I will pull it off.

898
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,680
S-So that is why!

899
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,040
I meant to say that men will all die one day,

900
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,120
why are rules not allowed to die?

901
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,720
Mountains will return to the sea.

902
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,320
Clouds will turn into rain.

903
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,840
Natural events will happen naturally

904
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,920
and evolve naturally.

905
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,440
Good!

906
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,680
You are very perceptive!

907
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,960
I suppose my family

908
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,560
will also have to go with the flow of nature.

909
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,520
Jin Xiu told me

910
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,600
you have always preferred plain food.

911
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,560
I ordered a few dishes

912
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,640
according to your preference.

913
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,880
Thank you for your thoughtfulness.

914
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,840
How has your mother been lately?

915
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,000
Is she feeling better?

916
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,040
Thank you for your concern.

917
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,880
Mother is very well.

918
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,840
Since you went home,

919
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,840
spend more time there

920
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,440
and accompany her.

921
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,000
Actually,

922
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,560
the reason I did not return to the Yang residence

923
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,240
is not to take care of my mother,

924
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,880
but...

925
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,800
I do not have the confidence to return to the Yang residence yet.

926
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,520
Leave us.

927
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,400
Yes.

928
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,440
Is it because

929
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,680
you are still upset

930
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
about the sample pieces?

931
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,640
Yes,

932
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,200
and no.

933
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,480
After the incident with the sample pieces,

934
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,640
I understood a few things.

935
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,120
The main branch of the Yang family
