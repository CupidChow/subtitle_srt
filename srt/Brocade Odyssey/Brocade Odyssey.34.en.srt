[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 34]

3
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,200
Your Highness, are you saying

4
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,240
you want my soldiers pretend to be from Nanzhao

5
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,640
then fight against themselves?

6
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,080
I am but a regular prince with no actual power.

7
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,280
I do not have my own army.

8
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Thus, General Niu,

9
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,800
I trust that you shall muster sufficient forces

10
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
and see to this matter personally.

11
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,280
What exactly do you want?

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,800
I want you as an ally.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
Naturally,

14
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,240
this is an assault on the city, after all.

15
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,030
There shall be spoils of war to divide.

16
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,030
By chance,

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,320
I have certain belongings left in Yizhou.

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,680
General Niu, I trust

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,480
that you might see them safely returned to me.

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,200
What you truly desire

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,240
are the skilled artisans of Yizhou's brocade industry, is it not?

22
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,200
This is why I say that

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,000
you know me best.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,840
Yizhou has long been a cradle of talent.

25
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,240
So long as Huanhua Creek exists,

26
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,080
and so long as you remain,

27
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,880
its gifted artisans will persist,

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,880
rising stronger

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,240
with each setback.

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Yet, this chance you have now

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,080
is but

32
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,040
once in a lifetime.

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,360
Let me caution you, General Niu,

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,400
indulge as you may,

35
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,440
but do not overstep.

36
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,000
To go too far would only sow seeds of discord,

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
deep and lasting,

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,880
between Datang and Nanzhao.

39
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,440
Such a rift wouldn't be good.

40
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,480
Worry not, Prince Bai.

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,840
It is my own city.

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,840
I would not bear to destroy it.

43
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,240
Very well.

44
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,280
Ah, how comforting it is to have someone to long for.

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,560
No matter how far your journey takes you,

46
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,800
home will always remain where you left it, waiting steadfastly for your return.

47
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,000
You are envious of me?

48
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,760
General Xue.

49
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,280
This...

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,760
The commissioner is busy.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
He is not able to see you for now.

52
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,960
Just rest easy and wait here.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,400
I am now a fugitive.

54
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
The commissioner

55
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
would do well to tread cautiously.

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,560
Fret not.

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,360
The day will come when your name shall be cleared.

58
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,390
I am in no haste to clear my name.

59
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,680
However,

60
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,240
Prince Bai has met with Niu Jin in Yizhou.

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,800
With Niu Jin commanding an army at his disposal,

62
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,000
their alliance would surely

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
lead to a disastrous misstep.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
I can only hope the commissioner makes his decision without further delay.

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,640
It is precisely because of Niu Jin's army

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,960
that the commissioner

67
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,280
cannot act in haste.

68
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,360
Just wait here patiently.

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,840
General Xue.

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,080
No.

71
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,000
I must make a trip back to Yizhou.

72
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,960
You were just caught

73
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,880
and now you want to run again?

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,640
The commissioner surely has his reasons

75
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
for keeping watch at this time.

76
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,200
I, too, must make my own preparations.

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,160
Fang,

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,640
I must trouble you to serve as a hostage.

79
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Help me pass a message to the commissioner.

80
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,920
If Yizhou remains safe,

81
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,000
I shall return swiftly to face my punishment.

82
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
You must return soon.

83
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,800
I am not happy staying here.

84
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,480
Worry not.

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
Wait for me to come back.

86
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,080
I will bring wine for you.

87
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,320
Take any chance

88
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,200
to run.

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,000
Forget about the rest.

90
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,640
Remember,

91
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,640
even if you must humble yourself and submit,

92
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,160
you must survive.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,800
Survival is all that matters.

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Grandfather,

95
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,480
please forgive me.

96
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
I truly did not know

97
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,640
there were still things in this world

98
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
worth caring for.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,200
I want you to live.

100
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
You are the smartest and most talented man

101
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,400
in our family.

102
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,160
The Zhao family will only have hope

103
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360
if you remain alive.

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,760
Get up!

105
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,040
Get up!

106
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,600
Remember!

107
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Let him go!

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Staying alive is your top priority!

109
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,600
Come at me if you want!

110
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,400
Bai Sheng,

111
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,920
do not think that I do not know you are behind this!

112
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,360
I know you are here! Show yourself!

113
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,080
Mr. Zhao,

114
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
I hope you have been well.

115
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
Nanzhao's Prince Bai.

116
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,000
No wonder you could spend so much money.

117
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,360
You only wanted someone who could weave brocade.

118
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,040
You could have just taken me with you.

119
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,120
Why did you capture

120
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,440
my whole family?

121
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,760
Many believe that

122
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
you care for only one person.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,840
Yet,

124
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
I think you truly care

125
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,160
for the entire Zhao family.

126
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,760
But there is something

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,440
you have wrongly accused me of.

128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,600
Of all your family,

129
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,880
is it only you that I desire.

130
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,840
It is your fault

131
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,640
for being so talented.

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,600
As for the others...

133
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,560
Deputy General Niu

134
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,040
will surely find other uses for them.

135
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,880
What do you want to do?

136
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
What do you think?

137
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Why ask the obvious?

138
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,960
When we reach Nanzhao,

139
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
you will see Ji Yingying.

140
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,200
My promise to you

141
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
will then be

142
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,240
considered fulfilled.

143
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,760
She will not leave with you.

144
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,120
Every wolf is stubborn

145
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,240
before it is tamed.

146
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,080
As for me,

147
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
whether I can tame her

148
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,280
will depend on my own skill.

149
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,760
She is not a wolf.

150
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,280
You are. You are the wolf.

151
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,560
Ms. Ji,

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
I did not let you down.

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,080
Mr. Yang is safe now.

154
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,560
Good.

155
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,000
Very good.

156
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,400
Thank you.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
You are welcome.

158
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,800
I wonder how Yizhou fares at this moment.

159
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,400
I have come to an agreement with the main brocade merchants

160
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,280
to protect our own workers

161
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,440
and remain indoors.

162
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
But when I entered the city earlier,

163
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,480
I learned that Mr. Zhao Senior

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,800
and their entire household

165
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
have vanished without a trace.

166
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Vanished?

167
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,120
Yes.

168
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,200
Mr. Zhao Senior would not break his promise in this matter.

169
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,960
Unless...

170
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,480
...he is no longer able to make his own decisions.

171
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,200
I will send men to investigate this at once.

172
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,560
No.

173
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,200
The ones with the power to move an entire family

174
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
are not our match.

175
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,360
Mr. Zhuge,

176
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,040
please inform Governor Zhang about this immediately.

177
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,840
Request that he send soldiers to investigate.

178
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,040
If necessary,

179
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,000
they must report this to the commissioner without delay.

180
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,400
Alright. Do not worry.

181
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,600
Leave this to me.

182
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,160
The city is no longer safe.

183
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,800
Let our warriors have a good meal tonight.

184
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,200
Yes.

185
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,760
Victory or defeat

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,600
will be determined by this one move.

187
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,920
Ji Yingying,

188
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,480
your moon

189
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,760
longs to be in place

190
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,040
where it can meet your gaze

191
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,040
the moment you look up.

192
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,840
The Zhao family

193
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
was wiped out overnight.

194
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,760
How many men were needed to accomplish this?

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,680
Zhuge Hong,

196
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,480
write this up at once.

197
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,600
I am going to meet the commissioner in person.

198
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,160
Yes, sir.

199
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Move faster!

200
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,760
Governor! Protect the governor!

201
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,360
That person is from Nanzhao! Chase him!

202
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,520
It is an honor

203
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,240
to be chosen by His Highness.

204
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,040
Those whose names are on this list

205
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,360
are given two choices.

206
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,840
You will either come with us,

207
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,560
or...

208
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,840
I will kill off those not selected by His Highness

209
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
and take you with me.

210
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,200
Those whose names I call

211
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,640
should stand behind me.

212
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,800
Yingxi Dyehouse's Mr. Chen.

213
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,240
Liuyue Dyehouse's Mr. Jiang.

214
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,280
Luoxia Dyehouse's Ms. Zhu.

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,240
Cailuan Dyehouse's Mr. Sheng.

216
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,600
Cailuan Dyehouse's Mr. Sheng.

217
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,200
Mr. Sheng is...

218
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
Do not tell me he is not here.

219
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,800
Since Ji Yingying has gathered you here

220
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,400
to protect you all together,

221
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,600
none shall be left behind.

222
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,560
Cowardly personality.

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,960
Often seen carrying medicine around.

224
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,720
Likes to bring up his mother's teachings.

225
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,120
Take him.

226
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,280
Next.

227
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,950
Yaoyue Dyehouse's Mr. Liu.

228
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,640
What are you planning to do?

229
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,280
Huacai Dyehouse's Feng Dalang.

230
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,280
Feng Sanlang.

231
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,120
I do not know.

232
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,880
You asked me why I have feelings for you

233
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,760
and how long they will last.

234
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,920
I do not know.

235
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,120
All I know is that

236
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,120
I cannot leave you.

237
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
I want to be with you

238
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,720
no matter where you go.

239
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,720
The last one.

240
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,520
Ji's Brocade Workshop,

241
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Ji Yaoting.

242
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,480
Ting...

243
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,920
Mother,

244
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,080
they only want us to weave brocade for them.

245
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,560
They are not after our lives.

246
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,680
It is only through our survival that we shall be

247
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,120
reunited once more.

248
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,480
Ting...

249
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,800
Mother, fret not.

250
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,680
All shall be well.

251
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,280
Mr. Ji, stay a moment.

252
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,920
His Highness is concerned that Mrs. Ji's delicate health

253
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,720
may not bear such a shock.

254
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,120
Should she be troubled, His Highness would surely incur Ms. Ji's ire.

255
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,400
Thus,

256
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,200
he wishes for you to remain with her for the time being and tend to her needs.

257
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,560
You may proceed to His Highness with Ms. Ji later.

258
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,200
Oh, yes.

259
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,560
His Highness has a message for Ms. Ji, which he bids you to convey.

260
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,520
[The Yang Residence]

261
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
Ma'am.
[*She is referred to as Mr. Yang's wife here.]

262
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,760
Breakfast is served.

263
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,680
Please have some food.

264
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
I am no longer Mr. Yang's wife now.

265
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,720
It is not appropriate

266
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,520
to call me that.

267
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,560
You will be again

268
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
when Mr. Yang gets back.

269
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,040
Take care of your health.

270
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,040
Please have some food.

271
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,120
Come.

272
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
Let me help you.

273
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,240
Yingying.

274
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,680
Yingying!

275
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Mother!

276
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,360
Yingying.

277
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,280
Yaoting!

278
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,360
I am sorry.

279
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,760
I was too late.

280
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,880
After they were taken away,

281
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,560
I dispatched men to trail them in secret,

282
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,360
hoping to uncover their stronghold.

283
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,520
But we still ended up losing them.

284
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
What is the message that Sheng Fengze

285
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,840
bade you to deliver to me?

286
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,280
He said that Ji Yingying alone

287
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,480
is worth hundreds of craftsmen.

288
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,720
I would rather we forgo this deal.

289
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,920
Yingying!

290
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,310
Listen to me.

291
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,520
Savages are not to be trusted.

292
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,880
Even if you were to go to him,

293
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,280
they would still not release the others.

294
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,480
He is indeed untrustworthy.

295
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,070
However, Mother,

296
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,310
it is only by going myself

297
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,070
that I can gather more information.

298
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,440
Only then will I be able to negotiate with him.

299
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,070
I can then...

300
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,160
I know! I know all that.

301
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,350
My daughter

302
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,840
is very strong.

303
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,080
You are loyal to your people.

304
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,360
But I cannot bear to see you

305
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,480
take such risks for others.

306
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,160
All I ask is that you remain safe and sound.

307
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,520
Mother,

308
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,080
they are not others.

309
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,880
They are my friends, who have stood by me through thick and thin.

310
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Sheng Fengze is a psychopath

311
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,160
who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.

312
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
His letting Yaoting stay behind

313
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,880
is both a gesture of sincerity

314
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,560
and a threat.

315
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,240
If I do not go,

316
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,080
he will devise an even more cruel plan.

317
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,760
Ms. Ji,

318
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,560
there is a carriage at the entrance.

319
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,880
Who is it?

320
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,360
The carriage was empty,

321
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,480
but I did find this.

322
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,480
Leave us.

323
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,880
Yes.

324
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,720
This belongs to Pin.

325
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,520
Pin...

326
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,880
That carriage was sent by Sheng Fengze to pick me up.

327
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,280
Mother,

328
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,880
I must go.

329
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,160
I will go with you.

330
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
As you said,

331
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,160
he is a psychopath

332
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,560
who will stop at nothing until he achieves his goal.

333
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,520
And he wanted both of us from the start.

334
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,240
Why should I stay behind

335
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,160
and make things worse?

336
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,000
Besides,

337
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,800
I know you will not simply let this go.

338
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,480
If your plan succeeds,

339
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,440
I will escape with you if I can.

340
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,480
And if...

341
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,400
...we are unfortunate enough to be caught and made to work as coolies,

342
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,560
I will be there to look out for you.

343
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,680
Mother,

344
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,920
please give us your permission.

345
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,120
Mother, please give us your permission.

346
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,560
Farewell, Mother.

347
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:41,920
Let's go.

348
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,760
Ms. Ji,

349
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,760
is there anything I can do?

350
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,520
I will have guards follow us in secret

351
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,720
and leave messages for you whenever possible.

352
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,400
I hope you can track down those craftsmen

353
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,560
by following our trail.

354
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,560
Understood.

355
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,000
One more thing.

356
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,560
I am still uneasy

357
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,040
about the disappearance of the Zhao family.

358
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,120
The governor was attacked.

359
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,920
I hope you can assist Chief Sang

360
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,120
in uncovering the truth swiftly

361
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,920
and restore peace to Yizhou.

362
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,360
Understood. Leave it to me.

363
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,440
I will do the best I can to protect Yizhou.

364
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,640
Ms. Ji,

365
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,560
you two must take care.

366
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,080
Farewell.

367
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,920
Farewell.

368
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
Yingying,

369
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,960
the carriage does not even have a groom.

370
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Where are we heading to?

371
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,560
Yaoting,

372
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,640
we cannot let him manipulate us.

373
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,840
Your Highness.

374
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,280
Our carriage is back.

375
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,920
But it is empty.

376
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,240
There is only a note.

377
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,080
I took hostages.

378
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,680
She chose the location.

379
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,840
We each have a card up our sleeve.

380
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,920
This is only fair.

381
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,440
Ji Yingying has always been very cunning.

382
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,640
She must have set up a trap

383
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,800
to lure you into the city.

384
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
This is a trap.

385
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,640
You must not go.

386
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,600
Do you think he will really come?

387
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,800
He is so confident.

388
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,480
Everything is going according to his plan.

389
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,640
Why would he not come?

390
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,920
I suppose

391
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Ms. Ji still knows me the best.

392
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,000
Long time no see.

393
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,440
Sadly,

394
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,000
there are only two chairs

395
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,360
in my courtyard.

396
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,000
I am not able to have extra guests.

397
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,440
Mr. Ji,

398
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,680
please.

399
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,000
Yaoting,

400
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,800
wait for me outside.

401
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,600
You must be careful.

402
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Ms. Ji, please.

403
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,480
How many people do you think I can exchange for?

404
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,200
How many do you think?

405
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,560
Half.

406
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,200
Half of the craftsmen you captured.

407
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,400
This price is rather steep.

408
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,440
I am offering myself

409
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,960
in exchange for those who already belong to Yizhou.

410
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,040
You know well who has profited from this.

411
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,080
The amount I have spent to capture these people...

412
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,600
On average,

413
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,160
it should be about 100 gold pieces each.

414
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,760
I could have caught more

415
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,600
to spread my costs thinner.

416
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,600
Who would have thought that you, Ms. Ji, would be so clever?

417
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,560
Aside from the Zhao family,

418
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,560
you managed to hide the others without leaving a trace.

419
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:52,600
No.

420
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,480
I was still too slow.

421
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,800
From the moment you stole the pattern...

422
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,160
From the moment Mianzhou's brocade workshop was set up...

423
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,720
I should have sensed something was amiss.

424
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,000
Exactly how many craftsmen am I able to exchange for?

425
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,560
I think

426
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,200
we should call it a business deal

427
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,280
rather than a hostage exchange.

428
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,280
Since you can lead

429
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,200
merchants thousands of miles

430
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,400
to Tubo to sell brocade,

431
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,160
surely you can also lead craftsmen

432
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,760
to Nanzhao to weave brocade.

433
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,440
Perhaps

434
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,400
this is just another way to expand trade routes.

435
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,200
This is not an expansion of trade routes.

436
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,560
This is capturing us as slaves

437
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,480
and forcing us to admit that we stayed willingly.

438
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,600
Look at you!

439
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,880
You are fully aware

440
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,640
that you are the prey

441
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,760
and I am the hunter.

442
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,400
What more is there for you

443
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,200
to negotiate with me?

444
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,400
If I truly had nothing,

445
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,000
why would you bother negotiating with me here?

446
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,600
You could easily tie me up and take me with you.

447
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,280
Let me amend my terms.

448
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,400
Release three groups of people.

449
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,000
Keep talking.

450
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,080
Those who are above 50 years old.

451
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,680
Those who are weak and sickly.

452
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,440
Those who have elderly parents.

453
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,440
Elderly parents?

454
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,680
That is not the minority.

455
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,480
How about those with elderly parents and are also an only child?

456
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,160
Release them.

457
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,840
Very well.

458
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
I will agree to your terms.

459
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
However, you must pay the deposit first

460
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,560
before I can feel secure in releasing them.

461
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,920
Oh, Ms. Ji!

462
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,000
You still are not sincere in working with me.

463
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,720
What did you do?

464
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,720
Yizhou

465
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,360
is about to fall into chaos.

466
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,320
Kill!

467
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,480
Sheng Fengze!

468
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,160
No.

469
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,080
Your lot from Nanzhao

470
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,240
could never muster this on your own.

471
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,280
Where did you gather so many men?

472
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,080
You are so clever, Ms. Ji.

473
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,440
You should be able to guess who I am working with.

474
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,360
Niu Jin.

475
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,720
Kill!

476
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,680
Kill!

477
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,920
Close the doors!

478
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,720
Your Highness,

479
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,160
Yaoting!

480
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,200
Niu Jin never made it to Yizhou.

481
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,600
Instead, he waylaid the Commissioner en route

482
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,000
and now lays waste to the city,

483
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,120
masquerading as forces of Nanzhao.

484
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,800
I suppose it's an utter chaos out there.

485
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,680
I fear you yourself might be in peril.

486
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,720
I fear your dealings have gone awry.

487
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,120
Not only have you slaughtered the common folk of Yizhou,

488
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,800
but you now bear the blame for assassinating Yizhou's commissioner as well.

489
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,920
If he intends for me to shoulder all these crimes,

490
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,160
his surest course would be

491
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,320
to silence me with death.

492
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,360
Nanzhao traitor, Sheng Fengze!

493
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,680
Open the door!

494
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,200
Charge with all your might!

495
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,480
Come!

496
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,920
You know better than I do!

497
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,160
Once Niu Jin's men break in,

498
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,120
no one inside will be left alive.

499
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,560
Nanzhao traitor!

500
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,600
Chase after him!

501
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,080
Kill them!

502
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,800
[Yizhou Governor's Residence]

503
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,600
Get inside!

504
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,040
You will be safe once you are inside! Hurry!

505
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,120
You are alright.

506
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,800
Don't cry. Your father and mother will come for you.

507
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,320
You must be strong.

508
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,280
Guards!

509
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,200
Bring him in.

510
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,280
Come on, little boy.

511
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,440
Go!

512
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Hurry up!

513
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,640
Yang Jinglan!

514
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,880
Yang Jinglan!

515
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,680
Yaoting!

516
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,840
How are you? Where is Yingying?

517
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,640
Yingying... Yingying got taken away by Bai Sheng.

518
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,480
Niu Jin's men are still after them.

519
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,240
But... But I do not know where they are headed!

520
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,440
Bai Sheng... When was this?

521
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,720
Just a moment ago.

522
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,280
Yaoting, it will be alright.

523
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,240
I will bring Yingying home safely.

524
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,960
Take care of yourself.

525
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,560
I am off!

526
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,800
You must be careful!

527
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,840
The Nanzhao traitor dares to assassinate the commissioner!

528
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,760
I, Niu Jin,

529
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,400
swear upon this sword today

530
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,200
to defend the peace of Yizhou

531
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,400
and share the same fate as its people. Attack!

532
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,960
General,

533
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,120
this city is teeming with our own men.

534
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,280
Are we going to kill them all?

535
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,440
Our men?

536
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,520
Are not those who ravaged the people of Yizhou

537
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,040
soldiers of Nanzhao?

538
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,720
Every one who plundered Yizhou's folk

539
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,040
shall be wiped out!

540
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,480
Let no Nanzhao traitor survive! Attack!

541
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,960
Those who are above 50 years old,

542
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,920
those who are weak and sickly,

543
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,080
and those are are an only child

544
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,000
who have

545
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,920
elderly parents...

546
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,110
The people you want me to release

547
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:00,080
are all here.

548
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,920
There are hundreds and thousands of Yizhou craftsmen captured.

549
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,830
I do not need to count them to know that

550
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,270
this cannot be all.

551
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,310
Those have likely

552
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,310
already reached Nanzhao.

553
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,150
I cannot release them, even if I wished to.

554
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,280
Sheng Fengze.

555
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,790
I will honor the promises

556
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,230
I made to you.

557
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,430
If you choose to break your word,

558
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,960
I cannot guarantee the safe return of these people

559
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,040
to Yizhou.

560
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,000
Yizhou's brocade shall be passed down through the ages.

561
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,790
As long as you remain,

562
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,630
the brocade shall endure.

563
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:58,600
Ms. Ji, thank you!

564
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,630

Are there any who oppose?

623

00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,600

629
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,480

Commander,

636
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,160
someone saw Yang Jinglan

637
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,840
entering the city during the battle.

638
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,160
Will he affect our plans?

639
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,880
No.

640
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,800
Mu Hui is dead.

641
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,200
I have taken command of Jian'nan's troops

642
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,840
and entered Yizhou with my army.

643
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,440
The government

644
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,000
has no choice but to acknowledge me as commissioner now.

645
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,440
Yang Jinglan is powerless to stop me.

646
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,440
But Sheng Fengze...

647
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,080
Get our men to send word to Nanzhao.

648
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,240
Yes, sir.

649
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,600
Commissioner Mu learned that Nanzhao's men had entered the city

650
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,560
and hastened to send cavalry.

651
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,000
However,

652
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,400
he fell into Niu Jin's ambush.

653
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,440
Lieutenant General Li betrayed us

654
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,800
and joined forces with Niu Jin.

655
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,800
The commissioner's troops

656
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,800
were all wiped out.

657
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,360
Commissioner Wu

658
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,280
gave his life to ensure my escape.

659
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,480
Many other brave warriors aided me along the way,

660
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,880
and that is how I narrowly survived.

661
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,560
There is one more thing

662
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
you may not know.

663
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,360
It was not the Nanzhao troops

664
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,800
who attacked Yizhou.

665
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,880
It was Niu Jin who masterminded it all.

666
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,280
There is no justice.

667
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,760
There is no justice!

668
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,040
These two fake Nanzhao soldiers

669
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,640
were captured by me amid the chaos.

670
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,400
General Xue, you may take them to the capital

671
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,760
as proof of this treachery.

672
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,680
Very well.

673
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,480
I shall make my way to Chang'an.

674
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,800
Even at the cost of my life,

675
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,240
I will ensure that Niu Jin's heinous deeds

676
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,800
are laid bare before all the realm.

677
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,480
I will petition His Majesty

678
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,440
to rid the empire of these traitors.

679
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,760
Mr. Yang,

680
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,480
Jian'nan is overrun with Niu Jin's people.

681
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,920
Why not come with me

682
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,080
to Chang'an?

683
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,800
Once the government issues the command to bring down Niu Jin,

684
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,920
I shall lead the troops to Nanzhao

685
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,680
and rescue your wife.

686
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,200
Your plan is indeed sound.

687
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,080
However, it will take time for the government

688
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,680
to move against Niu Jin.

689
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,200
My wife is currently surrounded by the enemy,

690
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and I cannot afford to wait.

691
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,480
Nor will I wait any longer.

692
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,800
I am familiar with Nanzhao.

693
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:34,800
I will go with you.

694
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,760
The fewer who sneak into Nanzhao,

695
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
the better.

696
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,960
You mean the fewer who go,

697
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,040
the fewer will perish.

698
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Sheng Fengze is a wily and treacherous scoundrel.

699
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
How is your journey to Nanzhao any different from walking into hell itself?

700
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,000
The difference is that

701
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,880
you will ensure the safe passage of General Xue and Zhuge

702
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,360
to Chang'an.

703
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,640
We will work together.

704
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,240
You will assist my escape from Nanzhao.

705
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,080
You always have a way with words.

706
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,880
I can never win in any argument against you!

707
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,400
I will stay.

708
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,960
Stay where?

709
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,240
I will stay in Yizhou.

710
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,160
Zhuge...

711
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,840
I know what you want to say.

712
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,360
Firstly, the journey to Chang'an is fraught with peril,

713
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,680
and I'm without the skills of a warrior.

714
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,000
I do not wish to be a burden to you.

715
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,160
Secondly,

716
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,040
those brocade families who were not captured by Nanzhao

717
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,440
will surely return to Yizhou.

718
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,360
Yizhou cannot stand without the Shu brocade,

719
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,880
nor can it do without a brocade officer.

720
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,000
Thirdly,

721
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,600
when you return

722
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,880
to set matters right in Yizhou,

723
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,400
you will need someone within the city

724
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,680
to act from the inside.

725
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,320
It is, therefore, most prudent for me

726
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,840
to remain behind.

727
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,840
Yang Jinglan, I am no longer your subordinate.

728
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,080
You have no right to command me.

729
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,400
Indeed,

730
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,400
you are no longer my subordinate,

731
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,040
but as a friend,

732
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,320
I beseech you

733
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,720
to exercise caution.

734
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,360
Work within your means.

735
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,440
I will.

736
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,800
Very well, let us each go our own way.

737
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,200
In due time, we shall meet again in Yizhou.

738
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,800
Ms. Ji, why are you not asking me today?

739
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,640
It is not that I am unwilling to speak,

740
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,800
but we are leagues away

741
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,640
from Yizhou.

742
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,040
Even if I were to tell you,

743
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,440
it would be of no use.

744
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,600
There is no need

745
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,560
to add to your burdens.

746
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,600
Where are Ms. Zhu and the others?

747
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,280
They traveled faster than we did

748
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,600
and should have arrived by now.

749
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,440
Perhaps they have already settled.
