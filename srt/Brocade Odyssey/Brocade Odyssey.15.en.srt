[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,190
I really can't tell the difference

4
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,000
between these two threads.

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,080
Neither can I.

6
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Let's compare them together.

7
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,630
Can you see it clearly now?

8
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,800
This strand seems a bit lighter in color.

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,390
Shu brocade is woven with countless threads,

10
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,670
and if the color of just one thread is off,

11
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,390
the entire brocade will lose its brilliance.

12
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
Start by observing this bunch,

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,390
then take out each thread one by one,

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,670
until your eyes can adapt.

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,360
When you can distinguish even two threads,

16
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,000
you'll understand

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,190
which colors can make a world of difference

18
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,270
and truly enhance the brocade.

19
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,080
Isn't this what the brocade merchants need to learn?

20
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,440
What if we help them master this step?

21
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,000
Our Bloom Society now offers not just Flushed Rose

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,190
but also Shu Red Silk

23
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,000
and specialty silk thread from various houses.

24
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,800
But if we want to level up,

25
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,830
we can't just dye silk,

26
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,110
nor can we only sell silk.

27
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,550
Then what else can we sell?

28
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,830
If buyers are willing to pay extra,

29
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,440
we can help match silk and select colors

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,750
for their brocade designs.

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,440
But the problem is, no one's buying our silk.

32
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,520
Why are you pulling me?

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,190
She'll find out eventually.

34
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,880
Yingying,

35
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,630
Zhao Xiuyuan's tribute brocade arrangement

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,030
is not equally distributed like with the Yang family.

37
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,190
He only shares it with brocade merchants loyal to him,

38
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,880
with that "submit and prosper,

39
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,360
resist and perish" attitude.

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,030
So now that people know you offended him,

41
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,190
they don't dare

42
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,750
to buy silk from our Bloom Society.

43
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,550
On top of that, many are saying

44
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,190
you've crossed Deputy General Niu,

45
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,240
making them even more reluctant to come.

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,670
Indeed, I've offended Niu Jin.

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,830
If you guys...

48
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,000
If what?

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,000
We're already in the same boat.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,390
How could we possibly disembark now?

51
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,160
Even if I told others

52
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,800
I have nothing to do with Ji Yingying

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,670
and we'd never interact again,

54
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,750
who would believe me?

55
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,160
Exactly, no one would.

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,520
And right now, only the Yizhou brocade merchants

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,630
have stopped buying our silk.

58
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,600
At worst, we'll find buyers elsewhere.

59
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,190
Have you heard?

60
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,440
A merchant has arrived in Fan City recently.

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,190
He's incredibly rich.

62
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,470
Indeed.

63
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,190
He spends a fortune on brocade.

64
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,390
Really?

65
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,550
And that's not all.

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,390
He displays every piece of brocade

67
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,000
offered to him outside his mansion

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,270
for public review.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Mother.

70
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,000
Mother, I'm better now.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
I don't need to drink it anymore.

72
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,600
It replenishes energy and nourishes blood.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,440
Replenishes energy and nourishes blood...

74
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,350
Mother, it's bitter!

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,350
Mother, one isn't enough.

76
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,040
Yingying...

77
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,830
what's wrong with your mother?

78
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,790
I made her angry.

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,670
Now she ignores me, except to make me

80
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,760
take medicine or eat.

81
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,320
All mothers in this world

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,200
are all the same.

83
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,670
Who else?

84
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,550
My mother!

85
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,070
That makes me feel so much better.

86
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,790
Why isn't Pin here yet?

87
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,790
She...

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,480
Her mother dragged her to another blind date?

89
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,790
Another blind date?

90
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,830
No way!

91
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,350
I'm her hero.

92
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,350
I must save her!

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,070
I will never leave Bloom Society!

94
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,230
Stop right there!

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Ji Yingying is nothing but trouble,

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,880
causing problems all day long!

97
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,640
Just look

98
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,510
at what you've become!

99
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,600
Before joining Bloom Society,

100
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,200
you've never acted so rebellious!

101
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,200
I'm telling you,

102
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,110
if you keep this up,

103
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,600
you really won't be able to get married!

104
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,550
Then so be it!

105
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,640
- What's the big deal? - Just stop.

106
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:41,160
I...

107
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,550
Sir,

108
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,200
please don't be mad...

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,640
Don't stop me!

110
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,790
Sir, wait!

111
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,760
You go first!

112
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,070
Sir, please don't be angry!

113
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,830
Mrs.,

114
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,880
don't worry, I'll talk to her.

115
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,160
Rest assured.

116
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,760
Pin!

117
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,480
Pin.

118
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,600
Your mother forced you into another blind date?

119
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,000
Sang Shisi,

120
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,600
can you just leave me alone?

121
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,950
Pin,

122
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,550
some men may lack taste,

123
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,040
but that doesn't mean all men do.

124
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,550
I happen to like you just as you are.

125
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,040
Please,

126
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,000
stop talking.

127
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,320
Pin, don't worry.

128
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,390
If your mother forces you again,

129
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,790
just tell her I'm willing to marry you!

130
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:10,600
Shut up!

131
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,670
Who wants you to marry me?

132
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll never get married in this life.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,830
I won't get married!

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,160
It's fine if you don't want to get married.

135
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,040
But don't cry.

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,600
You don't understand.

137
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,390
You don't know anything.

138
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,440
Stop following me!

139
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,160
I...

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
I want to know.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But you won't tell me anything.

142
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,550
Yingying.

143
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,760
Pin, why are you here?

144
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,550
Did you argue with your mother again?

145
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
I've run away from home.

146
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm never going back.

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,040
But I don't know where to go.

148
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,830
Don't cry.

149
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,440
It's fine. You can stay at my place.

150
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,760
My mother likes you so much.

151
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,440
She'd love for you to live with us every day.

152
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,070
I mean

153
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,790
I don't know where I'll go in the future.

154
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,830
I understand.

155
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,390
Don't worry.

156
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,440
Just keep moving forward.

157
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,390
Maybe you'll figure it out later.

158
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,160
I'll take you somewhere right now!

159
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,230
Heads up.

160
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,040
She already owes me three jars of wine!

161
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
Yingying, where are we going?

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,790
A strange person has come to Fan City.

163
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,640
Let's check him out.

164
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,550
Fan City?

165
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,600
My mother says Fan City is full of crooks.

166
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,640
They're all bad people.

167
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,950
Your mother also says I'm a bad person.

168
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,550
Am I?

169
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,600
You can't just rely on hearsay.

170
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,830
You need to see for yourself.

171
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,550
Besides, we've got Yu with us,

172
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:55,070
so no worries.

173
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,230
I hope everything goes smoothly today

174
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,000
and we can return home before dark.

175
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,350
Is that strange person surnamed Bai?

176
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,640
He made a big scene

177
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,760
spending money like water.

178
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,790
So you've heard about it too.

179
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,600
Someone throwing money around like that...

180
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,600
either they've lost their mind,

181
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,270
or they have a hidden agenda.

182
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,390
He must have a hidden agenda.

183
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,440
He's using public evaluation

184
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,160
to find out the true value of Shu brocade,

185
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,390
then buying it close to its actual price.

186
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,790
Plus, in a short time,

187
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,640
he's made a name for himself.

188
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,200
So clever.

189
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,230
So cunning.

190
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,200
What an opportunity.

191
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,400
All kinds of rare stones!

192
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,400
Take a look!

193
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,590
Hey there, my friend,

194
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,470
come and check out our gemstones!

195
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,960
Most of the brocade merchants in Yizhou

196
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,110
no longer dare to buy silk from Bloom Society.

197
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
I have no choice but to try my luck here.

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Since Mr. Bai

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,030
spends so lavishly,

200
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,670
he might just be bold enough to work with us.

201
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,230
That's like asking blood from a stone.

202
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,350
It's better than living without hope.

203
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,030
Beautiful!

204
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,880
Thank you!

205
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,400
Ms.,

206
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,000
it's five wen.

207
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,400
Others sell five for one wen,

208
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,960
and you're charging one for five wen?

209
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,030
What a deal... robbery with a bun as a bonus!

210
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,350
The bun's cheap.

211
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,280
It's the dance that's expensive.

212
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,280
No wonder people say

213
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,590
Fan City folks are the best at business.

214
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,880
Where is Mr. Bai in Fan City?

215
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,590
Six wen.

216
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,350
You shouldn't be so greedy.

217
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,590
Yu.

218
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,590
The bun is free,

219
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,840
but flying costs six wen.

220
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,280
So, will you pay or show us the way?

221
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
What a great way to make money,

222
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,790
but you should know your limits,

223
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,790
or you might anger people

224
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,640
and can't win them.

225
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,590
It's not worth it.

226
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,590
Try it.

227
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,880
Try it.

228
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,590
A five-wen bun...

229
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,280
This is an authentic Lingyanggong-pattern brocade.

230
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,200
It's been passed down for a hundred years.

231
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,960
If it weren't for my family needing money,

232
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,400
I'd never sell it.

233
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,550
Please, everyone, offer a fair price.

234
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,590
Thank you all.

235
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,670
Thank you all!

236
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,320
A hundred years?

237
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,230
How can the colors still be so vivid?

238
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,550
This is what Shu brocade is all about.

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,350
Timeless and enduring.

240
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,230
However...

241
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,520
This is

242
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,440
what you all think

243
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,670
this brocade is worth.

244
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,230
Does anyone else have a different opinion?

245
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,200
Turns out he noticed something.

246
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,200
Noticed what?

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,400
That there's something wrong with the brocade.

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,590
Anyone else want to bid?

249
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,030
I'll bid!

250
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,440
This Ms. says this brocade

251
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,440
[Zero]
is worth absolutely nothing.

252
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,590
She clearly doesn't understand!

253
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,080
Then tell me,

254
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,350
do you think this brocade is fake?

255
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,150
Mr. Bai,

256
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,880
don't listen to this troublemaker's nonsense.

257
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,200
It's obvious to everyone.

258
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,030
This brocade is definitely not fake!

259
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,200
Indeed, it's not fake,

260
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,000
but it's not entirely genuine either.

261
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,350
I may not be highly skilled,

262
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,150
and I am in the silk trade.

263
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,910
But I simply can't stand

264
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,350
any form of deception.

265
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,000
That's why I had to speak up.

266
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,030
If judged on its own,

267
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,640
this brocade is worth some money.

268
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,550
But in business, without integrity,

269
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,230
even the finest goods

270
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,880
become worthless.

271
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,470
This brocade isn't fake,

272
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,150
but it's not a hundred years old either.

273
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,110
The pattern on it

274
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,200
uses the linked bead horse motif.

275
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,470
So what?

276
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,520
Lingyanggong pattern often favored

277
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,440
linked bead and horse motifs.

278
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,400
But that's recent Lingyanggong pattern.

279
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,670
A hundred years ago, Lingyanggong pattern

280
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,590
didn't favor linked bead motifs.

281
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,350
They used Tuanke pattern instead.

282
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Even if they uses linked bead motifs,

283
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,400
it's usually double-linked beads, not this single-link bead style.

284
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,230
This is a pattern from our imitation

285
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,000
of Persian brocade design,

286
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,230
not the early Lingyanggong pattern.

287
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
What Tuanke pattern?

288
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,350
You dare spout nonsense in front of Mr. Bai?

289
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,000
You must have a death wish!

290
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,710
How dare you act out?

291
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,710
How dare you act out?

292
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,590
This Ms.

293
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,960
hasn't finished speaking yet.

294
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,760
Do you plan to resort to violence?

295
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
Mr. Bai...

296
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,440
She...

297
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,880
She's making baseless accusations,

298
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,590
clearly slandering me!

299
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,590
He says you lack evidence.

300
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,760
What do you say?

301
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,960
Mr. Bai, please look here.

302
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,960
The thread color used here

303
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,030
is between water blue and pale white.

304
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,790
It's a new color

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,030
known as crust green.

306
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,910
It was first dyed fifteen years ago

307
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,960
by Shen Yang from the Shen's Dyehouse.

308
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,590
So tell me,

309
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,910
how could it possibly appear

310
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:25,150
on a brocade claimed to be ancestral?

311
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,400
This ancestor seems far too young!

312
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,590
Why do you get to decide its color?

313
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,910
I say

314
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,150
it's just water blue!

315
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,590
It's not up to me to decide.

316
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,280
But the Brocade Bureau can test the silk and dye.

317
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,520
Mr. Bai, you can take it to the Brocade Bureau.

318
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,670
A test will reveal the truth.

319
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,000
I... I'm not selling it anymore!

320
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Sir, please have mercy!

321
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,400
Sir,

322
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,710
please have mercy!

323
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,790
I... I won't do it again.

324
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,400
I... I will never do it again!

325
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,230
I spend a fortune on brocade,

326
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,840
inviting Shu brocade experts to witness it.

327
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,640
Isn't that sincere enough?

328
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,840
And yet you tried to deceive me?

329
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,790
Take him to the authorities.

330
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,670
Mr. Bai...

331
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,230
Please spare me!

332
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,640
Everyone,

333
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,640
today's brocade appraisal

334
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,880
is now over.

335
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,910
Come early tomorrow.

336
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,550
Please disperse.

337
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I am Bai Sheng.

338
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,400
May I ask your name, Ms.?

339
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,200
I am Ji Yingying.

340
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,550
So, you're Ms. Ji.

341
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
You've heard of me?

342
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,400
The very first day I arrived in Yizhou,

343
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,880
I saw your phoenix soar.

344
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,230
You have sharp eyes.

345
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,230
I, too, am a lover of brocade

346
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,470
and I have a few pieces at home.

347
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,880
I'd like you to appraise.

348
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,150
If you find any fakes,

349
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,880
how about three gold leaves per fake?

350
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,790
It's almost dark.

351
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,840
I trust you both can keep this a secret

352
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,230
from my mother, right?

353
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,280
[The Bai Residence]

354
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,080
This way, please.

355
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,760
Feel free to take a look around.

356
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,150
This geometric brocade with sheep motifs

357
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,280
was popular during the Wei and Jin dynasties.

358
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,880
It's rarely seen today.

359
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,000
This floral Tuanke brocade with birds,

360
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,400
though a common design,

361
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,880
is exquisitely woven

362
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,840
and naturally colored,

363
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,840
making it a rare treasure.

364
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,350
Ms. Ji, that sigh of yours...

365
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,350
does it mean

366
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,470
you think this brocade is fake?

367
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,640
Your collection consists only of authentic, top-grade pieces.

368
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,350
I doubt I'll earn any gold leaves today.

369
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Ms. Ji,

370
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,040
your righteous intervention today

371
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,880
saved me from being deceived.

372
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,000
This gold leaf is rightfully yours.

373
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,590
Even if I hadn't stepped forward,

374
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,590
you wouldn't have fallen for the scam.

375
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,190
You noticed the brocade had issues.

376
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,040
Otherwise, you wouldn't have repeatedly asked

377
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,000
if anyone else wanted to bid.

378
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,800
You just needed someone

379
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,470
to point it out clearly for you.

380
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,190
That's why I said...

381
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,640
Ms. Ji, you have sharp eyes.

382
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,280
I wonder, Mr. Bai,

383
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,070
would you use your gold leaves to buy silk instead?

384
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,280
Buy silk? What do you mean?

385
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,000
Shu brocade is precious,

386
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,800
but high-quality silk is even harder to come by.

387
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,040
I can dye the finest silk

388
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,400
in all of Yizhou.

389
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,680
To be honest with you,

390
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,800
I don't know how to weave brocade,

391
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,880
nor do I know how to dye silk.

392
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,000
These are merely interests for me,

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,800
not business ventures.

394
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,230
Just interests?

395
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,280
Then, in your view,

396
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,680
what is my purpose?

397
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,000
I thought you had

398
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
a grand business opportunity waiting for me.

399
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,590
Looks like I'm going to disappoint you.

400
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,190
If it's just about buying brocade,

401
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,400
why go through all this trouble?

402
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,190
I know exactly whose brocade is the best in town.

403
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,590
If you're interested,

404
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,560
I can introduce you to the brocade merchants.

405
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
Ms. Ji, by doing this,

406
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,760
what do you hope to gain?

407
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,040
Favors.

408
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,160
Favors?

409
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,280
To be frank,

410
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
due to some misunderstandings,

411
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,110
most of the brocade merchants in town

412
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,000
no longer buy my silk.

413
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,680
But if I introduce

414
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,190
your business to them

415
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,590
and they profit handsomely,

416
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,230
how could they refuse to use my silk?

417
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,590
Then, if I were to start a business,

418
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,470
why not deal with them directly

419
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,280
instead of going through you?

420
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,000
You could,

421
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,830
but in Yizhou, do you know

422
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,830
each house's specialties?

423
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,190
Their material quality?

424
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,800
When to buy at the lowest price?

425
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,470
Do you know which designs

426
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,800
are currently trending

427
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,590
and which are outdated stock?

428
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,560
Of course,

429
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,800
you could hire someone to find all this out.

430
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,710
But why hire

431
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,040
a stranger

432
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,000
when you could work with someone

433
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,680
who has no other options

434
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,950
and seeks

435
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,000
mutual benefit with you?

436
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,950
I naturally trust you.

437
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,470
However,

438
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,280
this time I've completed my brocade purchase

439
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,880
and am quite satisfied.

440
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,280
No matter. There's always another day.

441
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,880
I hope there'll be opportunities in the future

442
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,190
to collaborate with you.

443
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,040
Certainly.

444
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,590
Farewell.

445
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,400
I won't see you out.

446
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,470
Not doing business,

447
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,160
yet gaining such fame...

448
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,590
either he's crazy or he's scheming.

449
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,800
Master,

450
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,000
we need an opportunity

451
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,400
to break into Yizhou's brocade industry.

452
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,070
And now Ji Yingying

453
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,830
is seeking a partnership.

454
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,230
Since you're interested in her,

455
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,830
why not take this chance

456
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,800
to agree to her proposal?

457
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,640
For now, we are just one option for her,

458
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,830
not her only choice.

459
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,280
When she hits rock bottom,

460
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,800
then we can name our price.

461
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,350
No rush. Let's wait and see.

462
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,350
Brocade Master Zhao,

463
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,800
I've noted the amount of Shu Red Silk.

464
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,760
Once the silk thread and dyes are ready,

465
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,000
I'll begin dyeing.

466
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,280
I promise it won't delay the brocade weaving.

467
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,040
That's not why I came

468
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,280
to see you today.

469
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,680
Recently, there's a rumor

470
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,680
saying you've offended me

471
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
and the Niu family,

472
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,560
causing brocade merchants to avoid buying your silk.

473
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,280
I have an idea:

474
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,520
how about the two of us

475
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,000
stroll through the streets together?

476
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,350
If people see us getting along,

477
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,400
the rumors

478
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,280
will fall apart on their own.

479
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,590
Those aren't just rumors.

480
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,350
Niu Jin did offend me,

481
00:21:58,470 --> 00:21:59,590
and so did you.

482
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,400
You're holding General Niu in check,

483
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,230
so Niu Wuniang

484
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,280
is trying to outdo you in business

485
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,950
to curry favor with General Niu.

486
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,800
That's why she spread the rumors.

487
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,560
I'm competing with Niu Wuniang in the Zhao family's domain,

488
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,190
so I can't openly help you.

489
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,000
But, Yingying,

490
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,190
you must know

491
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,400
I would never harm you.

492
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,560
The Yu family has struggled for years,

493
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,280
and they failed to secure the tribute brocade order.

494
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,400
So Yu Shu wants to sell it off.

495
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,400
Why are you telling me this?

496
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,590
Because you once said,

497
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,830
"The one who truly understands me

498
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,470
is Mr. Zhao."

499
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,590
Even if I didn't tell you,

500
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,560
you would find out

501
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,640
and take action.

502
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,400
That place was once your home.

503
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,470
It's filled

504
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,280
with memories of your father.

505
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,160
Moreover, acquiring it

506
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,470
would shorten your journey

507
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,190
from silk to brocade.

508
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,800
This is all my savings.

509
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,040
Take it

510
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,190
as a loan from me for now.

511
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,280
Did you intentionally withhold the order from the Yu family?

512
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,190
Yang Jinglan would take risks for you,

513
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,400
and so would I.

514
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,400
Mr. Zhao,

515
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,000
some things are better left in the past.

516
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,590
If you can't let go,

517
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,470
there's no need to do anything for me.

518
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
All I hope is that you face yourself

519
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,000
and live

520
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,680
with a clear conscience.

521
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,590
Tell me,

522
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,160
if my master already knew

523
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,680
there was something wrong on Mount Qingcheng,

524
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,280
why didn't he report it and request aid?

525
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,160
Unless

526
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,230
he was already surrounded,

527
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,830
isolated with no support.

528
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:27,590
I thought

529
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,430
causing a big stir here

530
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,000
and exposing everything

531
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,070
would bring the culprit to justice.

532
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,400
But who could have guessed

533
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,070
that power could so easily manipulate truth,

534
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,160
turning black into white?

535
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,350
And Niu Jin hesitates

536
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,800
because he's afraid someone powerful might back me.

537
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,230
Otherwise, he wouldn't hold back.

538
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
My master, back in the day,

539
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,190
faced his challenges all alone.

540
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,000
It must have been worse

541
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,920
than what we face now.

542
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,760
He knew

543
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,070
if he died,

544
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,470
the first one to investigate would be me.

545
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,110
So,

546
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,560
[Tomb of Shen Rufeng]
he left me clues.

547
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,430
He deliberately revealed his movements

548
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,470
to those guards

549
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,430
to let me know

550
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,920
there's something wrong with this mountain.

551
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,310
Your master was truly meticulous,

552
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,280
planning everything thoroughly.

553
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:25,310
But since he was so certain I'd return,

554
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,710
shouldn't he have left a clue

555
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,310
that only I could find?

556
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,430
Kid,

557
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,070
there are no clues

558
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,230
because the previous two brocade officers were clueless.

559
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,640
When they died,

560
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,280
they didn't think to leave any clues either.

561
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,430
"Even in death, a hero's bones carry fragrance,

562
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,400
unashamed before the world's greats."

563
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,190
This is my master

564
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,560
telling me

565
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,560
that even in death,

566
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,350
his remains can serve as evidence.

567
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,310
Go get me a shovel.

568
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,000
Let me just mention you...

569
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,590
this is your master's grave.

570
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,830
Can you really take

571
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,640
his offhand words seriously?

572
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,160
I know, but I understand him.

573
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
I trust him.

574
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,110
Even if it cost his life,

575
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,350
he would leave me a clue.

576
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,400
Master,

577
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,560
your disciple has failed you,

578
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
unable to uncover

579
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,560
the Yizhou case alone.

580
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
I beg you,

581
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,310
guide me one more time.

582
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,750
[Tomb of Shen Rufeng]

583
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,430
Not bad skills, huh?

584
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,920
Just look at who your master is.

585
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,830
Old man.

586
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,640
Call me Master.

587
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,590
Zhuge, come over here.

588
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,000
Every one of my master's bones is injured,

589
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,830
except this one.

590
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,640
The marks on it are different.

591
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,710
Judging by the traces,

592
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,430
this was definitely not caused by an outsider.

593
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,950
Then this is...

594
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,710
This is...

595
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,710
his final message to me.

596
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,470
No information could get out,

597
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,560
and no one could be trusted.

598
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,310
He had no choice

599
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:15,880
but to use his blade as a pen

600
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,310
and his bones as paper

601
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,950
to leave me a clue.

602
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,590
Old man,

603
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,640
I got your message.

604
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,560
I swear,

605
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,280
I will

606
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,160
hunt down the ones who harmed you,

607
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,070
and bring them to you,

608
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,350
kneel before you.

609
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,870
[The Yu Residence]

610
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,640
Ms. Ji, this way, please.

611
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,560
The head of the household is meeting a guest.

612
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,800
Please wait a moment.

613
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
No problem, we're all part of the Shu brocade family.

614
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,640
Let's chat together.

615
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
That voice sounds familiar.

616
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,350
I didn't expect it to really be you, Ms. Ji.

617
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,310
Mr. Bai, why are you here?

618
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,590
The Yu family's century-old brocade business

619
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,640
naturally has some treasures worth acquiring.

620
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:47,800
I'm here today to buy the Yu family's brocade workshop.

621
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,920
Just yesterday, you told me

622
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,950
you neither understand brocade

623
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,160
nor do business.

624
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,160
After hearing your words yesterday,

625
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,110
I was quite inspired.

626
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:59,110
I thought, why not give it a try?

627
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,190
Especially with such a great opportunity.

628
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,800
Your bold moves are remarkable.

629
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,590
Just a passing thought,

630
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,230
and you aim to swallow up

631
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,040
one of Yizhou's three major brocade merchants.

632
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,590
I believe

633
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,640
that if you're going to do business,

634
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,710
you might as well go big.

635
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,800
Ms. Ji has arrived?

636
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,000
Then please, step inside.

637
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:21,710
This way, please.

638
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,760
Greetings, Mr. Yu.

639
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,350
Greetings, Mrs. Yang.

640
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,760
Ms. Ji,

641
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,350
as for the balance for the silk thread purchased last time,

642
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,760
I've had it prepared.

643
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,760
You can verify

644
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,760
and collect it at the accounts room shortly.

645
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,920
As for your proposal to collaborate with this workshop,

646
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,760
letting Bloom Society assist in silk selection and matching,

647
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,430
whether to agree

648
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,040
depends on the new manager.

649
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:03,110
Has the new manager been decided?

650
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,470
Not yet.

651
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,590
But you can listen first

652
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,430
to see what conditions

653
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,350
might satisfy you.

654
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,760
What prices have the two of you offered?

655
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,880
Around 30%

656
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,230
above market rate.

657
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,160
Mr. Yu,

658
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,880
while the Yang family's offer

659
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,310
doesn't match Mr. Bai's high price,

660
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,760
our family has a long history in brocade weaving.

661
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,000
If the workshop is entrusted to us,

662
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,800
it will certainly thrive for generations,

663
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,190
without ruining its name

664
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:38,920
or mistreating your craftsmen.

665
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,640
Ms. Ji,

666
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,190
between the two of us,

667
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,560
who do you find more appealing?

668
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,400
You offer a high price

669
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,520
while Mrs. Yang values sentiment.

670
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,520
Both are quite sincere.

671
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
But in my view,

672
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,760
neither offer

673
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,760
is compelling enough.

674
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,520
The Yu family has a century-old legacy.

675
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,310
If we alter it so drastically,

676
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,160
isn't it a pity?

677
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,760
Mr. Yu has worked tirelessly all his life,

678
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,760
bringing glory to the Yu family's brocade.

679
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,950
Such dedication and achievements

680
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,350
cannot be measured by any price.

681
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,430
The business world has its highs and lows.

682
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,520
Where there is glory, there is also decline.

683
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,560
If I'm not mistaken,

684
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,280
this place

685
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,640
was once the Ji family's old home.

686
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,830
The Ji family's brocade was once so illustrious,

687
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,520
but now?

688
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,920
I don't need to say more, do I?

689
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,040
Mr. Yu, I'm here today

690
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,520
to discuss this very business deal.

691
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,710
Bloom Society is willing to invest in the Yu family,

692
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,350
providing silk while the Yu family weaves brocade.

693
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,310
This partnership would solve your current difficulties

694
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,310
and preserve the Yu family's brand.

695
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,160
Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds?

696
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,350
Ms. Ji, are you aware

697
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,760
how much this "best of both worlds"

698
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,190
you speak of would cost?

699
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,560
Yesterday you said you were in a difficult position.

700
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,350
How is it that today you can suddenly produce the money?

701
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,310
Yesterday, I said that

702
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,160
because I thought we could collaborate.

703
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,400
I didn't expect we'd become rivals today.

704
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,350
If I successfully acquire

705
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,830
the Yu family's brocade workshop,

706
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,350
I will definitely cooperate with you to purchase silk.

707
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,110
Mr. Yu, you know I never make empty promises.

708
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,560
The financial issues will be resolved,

709
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,310
but I ask you

710
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,040
to give me a chance.

711
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,950
Let me think it over

712
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,350
for another two days.

713
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,430
Mr. Yu,

714
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,800
if you have any concerns,

715
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,800
feel free to speak openly.

716
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,190
Mrs. Niu...

717
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,950
I've heard Mr. Yu intends to sell the brocade workshop.

718
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,840
Is there a safer choice

719
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,760
than selling it to the Brocade Master?

720
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,470
There's no rush for a reply, Mr. Yu.

721
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,320
Today, I mainly came by

722
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,670
to deliver someone along the way.

723
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,950
Grandfather!

724
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,520
Xi!

725
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,320
Xi, why are you in the carriage?

726
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,430
I happened to meet her on the road.

727
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,670
I heard that Ms. Yu has a childlike heart

728
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,910
and lacks worldly experience.

729
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,910
Mr. Yu, you must take good care of your granddaughter.

730
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,950
Next time, she might not be so lucky.

731
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,280
Thank you, Mrs. Niu,

732
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,390
for bringing Xi back to me.

733
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,670
I'll wait for you at the Zhao residence.

734
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,840
Xi,

735
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,950
are you hurt in any way?

736
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,870
Grandfather, I'm fine.

737
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,000
The masked lady

738
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,120
wasn't trying to harm me.

739
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,520
Mr. Yu.

740
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Ms. Ji,

741
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,760
without my company,

742
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,600
Xi

743
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,910
would never go out alone.

744
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,870
Let me be honest with you:

745
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,760
I can do without the brocade workshop,

746
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,710
but...

747
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,760
I will never allow any harm

748
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,800
to come to my Xi.

749
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,230
When power meddles

750
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,230
in business,

751
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,600
it ceases to be just business.

752
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,760
Mr. Yang,

753
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,560
I hope you'll cut through these villains sooner.

754
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,190
Zhuge,

755
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,800
take a look.

756
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,950
Does this seem familiar to you?

757
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,870
Spin them.

758
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,560
This pattern looks like the one

759
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,360
on the back of a logistics officer's order.

760
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:33,950
Are you sure?

761
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,280
We agreed

762
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,280
action is your part,

763
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,120
and writing is mine.

764
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,710
Before coming here,

765
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,040
I specifically reviewed all reports

766
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,520
and official documents about Shu brocade.

767
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:45,800
Logistics officer?

768
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,080
Shu region's logistics officers

769
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,870
are always appointed by the military commissioner.

770
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,360
And every year,

771
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,190
a different person is assigned.

772
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,800
Then we'll meet them all.

773
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,950
You're planning to meet the military commissioner?

774
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,560
Even though Niu Jin and the military commissioner

775
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,870
are stationed in different locations,

776
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,520
if you meet the military commissioner,

777
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,120
Niu Jin will likely find out.

778
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,670
Killers aren't afraid,

779
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,080
but saviors have to hide.

780
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,520
This world isn't right.

781
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,390
I'm going to change it.

782
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,520
Should we

783
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,390
inform Ms. Ji about this?

784
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,320
No need.

785
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,910
Capturing the culprit and revealing the truth

786
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,280
is our responsibility.

787
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,190
She's just an ordinary person.

788
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,670
She should happily run her business

789
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,000
and live her life in peace.

790
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:34,190
All right.

791
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,000
[The Yu Residence]

792
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,760
Yingying,

793
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,760
should we just knock on the door?

794
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,520
This isn't the first time you've met Mr. Yu.

795
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
When he says no visitors,

796
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,760
he means no visitors.

797
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,670
If he's refusing visitors,

798
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,320
does that mean the brocade workshop is no longer for sale?

799
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:06,470
If someone wants to sell their brocade workshop,

800
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,080
what do they want most?

801
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,520
If he wants money,

802
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,710
Mr. Bai is willing to spend extravagantly.

803
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:16,670
If he wants support for Yu family craftsmen

804
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,710
and techniques,

805
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:19,710
the Yang family is the best choice.

806
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,710
If he wants to preserve the Yu family's legacy

807
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,950
and get through this crisis,

808
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,560
then he should choose me.

809
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,870
But he hasn't chosen anyone.

810
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,320
Could it be that Niu Wuniang has threatened him?

811
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,150
He's not the type to hesitate.

812
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,120
Besides, if he had truly caved to Niu Wuniang's threats,

813
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,150
his workshop would already belong to the Zhao family.

814
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,950
Now that he's shut himself away,

815
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:49,910
he must be conflicted.

816
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,800
He's unsure whether he should sell the workshop.

817
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,280
This also shows

818
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,840
that none of our offers

819
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,320
are what he truly wants.

820
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,760
Then what does he want?

821
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,870
That's why I'm here.

822
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,080
Let me tell you, in the Yu family,

823
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,470
there's one person who understands Yu Shu

824
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,870
even better than Yu Shu himself.

825
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:11,710
You lost again.

826
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Chickens lay eggs,

827
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,360
and eggs hatch chickens.

828
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,470
So tell me,

829
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:21,120
which came first, the chicken or the egg?

830
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:22,630
I...

831
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,670
I wouldn't know.

832
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,560
You figured out Mr. Yu so quickly.

833
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,230
You really can't be underestimated.

834
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,390
If pigs have another life and become human,

835
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,560
then is this person a human or a pig?

836
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,150
What on earth

837
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,520
is going on in your head every day?

838
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,710
They all say I'm silly,

839
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,710
but I think you're even sillier than I am.

840
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:43,430
You...

841
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,120
Ms. Ji.

842
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,080
Ms. Yu.

843
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,120
Oh, Mr. Bai, you're here too.

844
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,320
Ms. Ji,

845
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,670
what brings you here?

846
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Whatever brought Mr. Bai

847
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,150
is what brought me.

848
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,760
What's this? Losing to Ms. Yu?

849
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,080
As you can see,

850
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,760
a complete loss.

851
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,670
Ms. Yu, you're quite impressive.

852
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,560
Is your grandfather at home?

853
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,280
My grandfather is preparing for a trip in a few days.

854
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,520
He's packing his things.

855
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,520
A trip?

856
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,320
Where's he going?

857
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,520
You have to do the same as Mr. Bai.

858
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,800
Win me first, then I'll tell you.

859
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,600
You're really good!

860
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,190
I'm still one step behind.

861
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,360
You're seven steps behind.

862
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
If you land more than seven, you win.

863
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,080
Exactly seven steps.

864
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,190
You win!

865
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:52,950
This round doesn't count.

866
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,040
I lost.

867
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,040
That wasn't a five just now.

868
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:57,040
It was a four.

869
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,040
Then why did it change on its own?

870
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,320
When I do business,

871
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,600
I stick to my principles.

872
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,430
If people treat me sincerely,

873
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,150
I'll return the sincerity.

874
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,080
It's just a game.

875
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,080
Ms. Ji,

876
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:17,040
you haven't forgotten why you came here, right?

877
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,080
Want to play another round?

878
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,080
No need.

879
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,430
Ask me whatever you want.

880
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,670
I'll tell you everything.

881
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,630
If people treat me sincerely,

882
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,080
I'll return the sincerity.

883
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,320
You said it.

884
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,560
All right, tell me,

885
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,840
if your grandfather

886
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,520
isn't preparing to sell the workshop,

887
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,760
what's he planning to do?

888
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,360
You all want the workshop,

889
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
but my grandfather

890
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,870
wants this.
