Even if the day comes when I must marry,

4
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,870
I would seek

5
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,440
a man who can share with me

6
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,630
the trials and triumphs of life,

7
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,630
one who will stand beside me in battle.

8
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,440
And that person is not you.

9
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,120
I don't care at all.

11
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,670
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,880
I don't want to hurt you,

13
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,880
but I don't want to keep

14
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,190

Tell him to buy

21
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,600
some looms and silk thread secretly.

22
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,960
And then, ship them in batches to Nanzhao.

23
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,160
Remember, don't leave any traces.

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,470
As for that pattern brought back

by the Yu family from Gubei Village,

26

do you want me to steal it?

Let's leave it with Ji Yingying.

I believe she'll surprise me.

29
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,240
Didn't you want to use that pattern

Is this Shu Red

I've also looked into Bai Sheng.

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,200
He's a smart merchant

56
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,350

57
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,350

most merchants

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,950
have some hidden depths

62
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,040
and aren't really harmless.

63
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,640
At least he's not afraid of the Niu family

64
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,720
or the Zhao family.

65
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,160
If necessary,

66
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,440
rather than choosing someone tangled up in problems,

67
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,040
why not pull this newcomer

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,440

70
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,200
why not give it a try?

71
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,440

to join you?

79
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,160
Is it that difficult?

80
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,110
Who asked me

81
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,920
to give you support before?

82
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Why are you so angry?

we've been married for a while now,

The whole Zhao family knows why.

153
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,110
Don't think I don't know

what you are planning to do.

155
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
I just want a peaceful marriage,

156
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,470
but now

157
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,200
it seems like a plot?

158
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,080
What kind of person are you,

159
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,960
thinking of a peaceful marriage?

160
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,280
You only want to get pregnant with my child,

161
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,790
and then I'll be useless.

162
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,550
Then you can legitimately control

165
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,640
Isn't the Zhao family's old ones good enough?

166
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,350
Or do you want to learn from Ji Yingying

167
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,670
to amaze everyone,

168
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,030

169
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,000
to be valued by the Military Commissioner?

170
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,710
After that,

171
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,030
you won't need to rely on my Niu family's power anymore, right?

172
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,760
I heard that the other day,

173
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,470
you sent a message to Ji Yingying.

174
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,790
As for the Yu family,

175
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,590
you purposely excluded them

176
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,150
and sent them to Ji Yingying, right?

177
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,760
If my father knew

178
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,200
that you are such a double-dealing person,

179
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,150
I don't know what he would think.

180
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,000
He probably hasn't had the mood lately

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,590

What great courage you have.

191
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,350
Without you,

192
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,670
my Zhao family would still weave brocade for General Niu.

193
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,280
But without me,

194
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,590
you would

195
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,200
be worthless.

196
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,320
As for what's of greater importance,

197
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,400
you know it better than me.

199
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,760
Sir, please come in.

200
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,790
Mr. Yu, the brocade is about to be made.

201
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,110
Our Bloom Society also has skilled weavers.

202
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,670
Today, I'd like to recommend someone to you.

203
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,960
I'm Ji Yaoting from the Ji family. Greetings.

204
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,110
I'm not good at pattern design

205
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,320
but excel in the weaving process.

206
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,590
I'm willing to lend a hand to you.

207
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,320
Mr. Ji, please sit.

208
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,520
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

209
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,440
For nine years,

210
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,150
my hands

211
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,150
have never rested.

212
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,960
Your skill is no less than before.

213
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,880
Our workshop welcomes you to join us.

214
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,520
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

215
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,280
Mr. Yu,

216
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,230
I have another matter to discuss today.

217
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,280
The Grain Brocade is ancient,

218
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,520
simple, and rich in tradition,

219
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,840
but people nowadays are seeking something new.

220
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,520
Just relying on the existing patterns

221
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,150
might not attract enough attention.

222
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,080
I want to increase its liveliness and shine

223
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,280
without changing the original patterns.

224
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,030
Perhaps by adjusting the silk thread colors

225
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,520
or reworking the patterns

226
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,320
to make it gleam and shine.

227
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,080
Then, we'll get a Rippling Grain Brocade.

228
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,550
Rippling Grain Brocade?

229
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,080
Golden grain ears

230
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,030
sway in the wind,

231
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,840
stirring up waves of rice.

232
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,350
Miss Ji,

233
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,550
the light and dark gloss of brocade

234
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,710
generally depends

235
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,080
on the gloss of the silk thread and color ratio,

236
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,840
as well as the weaving method.

237
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:11,670
To emphasize the sense of flowing waves,

238
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,710
the technique and color ratio

239
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,710
must be innovative.

240
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,640
Of course, the difficulty

241
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,910
is no less than developing a new type of brocade.

242
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,470
I haven't even restored

243
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,590
the Grain Brocade pattern yet,

244
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,110
and you want me to weave it with a rippling effect?

245
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,280
That truly is a hard task.

246
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,320
My elder brother also said this yesterday.

247
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,440
But I believe

248
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,760
since we're going to weave it,

249
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
why not make it the best we can?

250
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,150
I can help with the coloring.

251
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,150
We can borrow the technique from Shu embroidery for the patterns.

252
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,710
But for the weaving method,

253
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,470
we still need you and the masters

254
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,670
to study it further.

255
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:05,520
Ji Yingying, this research into Rippling Grain Brocade

256
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,280
is not just a technical issue.

257
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,230
So, are there any other problems?

258
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,350
Without money, we can't weave brocade.

259
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,680
Miss Ji,

260
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,680
developing a technique

261
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:23,110
requires a large investment at the start.

262
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,470
But the Yu family and Bloom Society...

263
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,070
Wasn't the money I invested before enough?

264
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,680
Thanks to your support,

265
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,880
we were able to provide for the workers and looms.

266
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,920
But,

267
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,160
to research a new brocade...

268
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,560
How much is needed?

269
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,280
At least ninety guan.

270
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,070
Mr. Yu,

271
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,920
you and Yaoting just focus on studying how to weave it,

272
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,230
as for the money...

273
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,040
Money?

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,110
I have enough money,

275
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:02,470
and I look handsome.

276
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,470

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,950
please continue.

280
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,040
As for the money, I'll figure out.

281
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Figure it out?

282
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:23,830
She doesn't like me, but what can I figure it out?

283
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,040
I'm not attached to her!

284

how will Pin ever face anyone again?

302

I didn't think that far.

303

Then what did you think?

304
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,310
I just want to be the kind of man Pin likes

305

306
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,590
and will stand beside her in battle.

But I'm not that kind of man.

What should I do, Yingying?

309
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,680
Don't worry about what kind of man Pin likes.

310
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160

that she would surely surprise me.

Sheng,

350
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,230
you should stay away from Ji Yingying

The one who loses won't be me.

00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,880
once they fall in love,

357
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,040
it often clouds their judgment and choices.

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,350
If Ji Yingying wants to develop her career,

359
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,560
that's not good for her.

00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,520

to keep her away from Yang Jinglan.

Miss Ji really came up with a good idea.

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,160

00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,560

00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,880
I know, I'm quite carefree,

376
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,230
but you don't have to look at me like that.

377
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,230
Well,

378
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,710
you appear reckless and carefree,

379
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,680
but actually,

380
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,760
you're quite practical and shrewd.

381
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
You ungrateful child!

382
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,950
Let's go!

383
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,110
Just watch the fun.

384
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,950
You brute!

385
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,160
Here... Let's hide!

386
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
What's going on?

387
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,950
What's happening?

388
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,520
Isn't that the famous Mr. Yang?

389
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,310
Welcome!

390
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:44,230
Please, come inside.

391
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,430
Shisi,

392
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,560
others would entertain you before,

393
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,680
but now you're the one hosting others.

394
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,070
Your father's been dismissed?

395
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,230
Can you stop bringing up my father?

396
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,070
He gets a headache just hearing about you.

397
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,710
I'm the honorary president of the Bloom Society now.

398
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,710
If anything happens, I'll definitely help.

399
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,710
Besides,

400
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,760
with my abilities,

401
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I can easily host guests.

402
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,470
I just remembered.

403
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,070
Yingying said

404
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,070
you're the Brocade Officer,

405
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
you can't place a bid,

406
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,950
so she didn't leave you a private room.

407
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,830
So you mean

408
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,070
we should leave?

409
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,830
Mr. Bai, this way, please.

410
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,920
Does he have a private room?

411
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,680
He...

412
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:39,640
he does.

413
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,950
It seems Miss Ji doesn't welcome me.

414
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,950
Miss Ji, you're welcoming me personally.

415
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,710
I'm truly flattered.

416
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,880
You're wealthy. It suits you.

417
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:57,950
Mr. Yang.

418
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,280
This way, please.

419
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,920
I'll need a private room.

420
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,830
Mr. Yang, Mr. Zhuge, please have a seat.

421
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,310
This is the spot reserved for our people.

422
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,470
Say it again.

423
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,760
Are you going to sit or not?

424
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,520
I'll sit.

425
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,560
I'm one of your people.

426
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,590
Mr. Bai,

427
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:22,920
Let's sit.

428
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,310
This way.

429
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,000
- Sit. - After you.

430
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,190
I'm one of her people.

431
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,710
Feel yourself at home.

432
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,760
Mr. Yu.

433
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,110
You...

434
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,520
Mrs. Yang...

435
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,470
What's the matter?

436
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,310
I run this inn.

437
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,350
She's here for the feast.

438
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,310
Everyone's here to make money.

439
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,280
Is there something wrong with that?

440
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,470
I...

441
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,760
Have a seat.

442
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,310
Did you learn something new?

443
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,280
Women in Shu have different temperaments.

444
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,040
If you upset them,

445
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,950
it's hard to calm them down.

446
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,190
Miss Ji,

447
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,040
may your business thrive.

448
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,310
All colleagues from Yizhou,

449
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,680
greetings to all.

450
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,880
As you all know,

451
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,110
Our Bloom Society and the Yu family

452
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,640
will jointly research and weave a new brocade.

453
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,160
As we all know,

454
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,560
the new brocade

455
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,110
will certainly sell well.

456
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,040
Today, I invite all shopkeepers here.

457
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,640
What we are bidding on is not the new brocade itself

458
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,070
but the high profits

459
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,760
it represents.

460
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,880
The winning bidder

461
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,430
will receive a 20% share of the profits from this new brocade.

462
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
In other words,

463
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,950
if every roll of brocade sells for ten guan,

464
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,110
the winning bidder will receive two guan as their share.

465
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,470
The new brocade is still not finished,

466
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,430
so today I will show you

467
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,280
the design of this brocade.

468
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,830
Please take a look.

469
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,470
Outside Yizhou City,

470
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,640
there is a place called Gubei Village.

471
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,640
It has worshiped the God of Grain for generations.

472
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,880
The wheat pattern brocade is the village's belief.

473
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,310
The wheat is a gift from the God of Grain,

474
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,160
giving people food to fill their stomachs.

475
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,430
The silk is a blessing from Leizu,

476
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,880
giving people clothes to keep warm.

477
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,470
The flowing waves on this brocade

478
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,760
are light, water,

479
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,830
and wind,

480
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,310
the gifts bestowed upon us by heaven.

481
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,160
The starting bid is 20 guan.

482
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,040
The auction begins.

483
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,560
Why isn't anyone bidding?

484
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,950
They're probably worried it can't be made.

485
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,310
Mr. Zhuge,

486
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,160
our Bloom Society will never deceive others.

487
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,230
I...

488
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,520
I didn't mean it that way.

489
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,760
To these people, the money

490
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,950
is just a drop in the bucket.

491
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:03,110
They don't doubt us,

492
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,800
but no one wants

493
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,310
to be the first to speak up.

494
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,350
You won't want to bid, will you?

495
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,710
If the Brocade Officer places a bid,

496
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,520
who would dare to bid after that?

497
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,950
I don't have money.

498
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,560
I'm just supporting the event.

499
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,190
This brocade

500
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,110
has both ancient heritage

501
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,000
and fresh innovation.

502
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,350
I really like it.

503
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,710
How about I take care of it

504
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,280
and help you invite

505
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,350
the Military Commissioner to generously open his purse?

506
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,520
Mr. Yang,

507
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,310
why bother the Military Commissioner with such a small matter?

508
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,070
Once the brocade is made,

509
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,520
it won't be too late to present it to him.

510
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,710
If none of you

511
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,710
place a bid,

512
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,280
when

513
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,160
will this brocade be completed?

514
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,760
How about this, Miss Ji?

515
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,920
If the first person to bid

516
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,950
wins the auction for this brocade,

517
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,880
what benefit will they get?

518
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,310
They'll get one guan off the price.

519
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,110
If it doesn't sell,

520
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,280
the first bidder will get

521
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,710
a 10% discount on their first silk order

522
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,920
from Bloom Society in the future.

523
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,110
Even if it doesn't sell, there's still a benefit?

524
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:27,560
Then I bid...

525
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,520
Twenty-one guan!

526
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,000
I bid twenty-one guan.

527
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,800
Is anyone going to raise the price?

528
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,590
Sir,

529
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,920
if the Zhao family wins the bid,

530
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,070
this brocade may never be seen again.

531
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,310
Let's wait a little longer.

532
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,070
Miss Ji,

533
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,880
the highest bidder wins.

534
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,520
The hammer is about to fall.

535
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,520
I bid sixty guan!

536
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:31,830
Miss Ji,

537
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,590
my wife doesn't understand brocade

538
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,520
and doesn't know the value of this new brocade.

539
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,760
I'm willing to bid sixty guan.

540
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,160
You're discrediting your own wife

541
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,880
and raising the price for another woman.

542
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:51,110
My Dear really does things in such a unique way.

543
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,880
I can't compare to you.

544
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,520
Mr. Zhao, Mrs. Zhao,

545
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,110
I remember

546
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,800
I didn't invite you two.

547
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,710
Why are you here?

548
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,920
Because we've heard a lot about it.

549
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,070
What?

550
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,280
My husband bid on this brocade.

551
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,110
Do you intend to deny it?

552
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,280
You weren't here earlier,

553
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,800
so you didn't hear my introduction.

554
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,230
This brocade carries the belief of an ancient village.

555
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,110
The village has worshipped the God of Grain for generations.

556
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,280
Before the auction,

557
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,760
the village chief even had a divination done.

558
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,760
It's forbidden

559
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,110
for anyone who has dealt with military affairs.

560
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,520
That's why I didn't invite you two.
