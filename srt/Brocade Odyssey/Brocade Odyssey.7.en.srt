00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,990
[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,310
Isn't it beautiful?

4
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,550
My lady, you aren't admiring the velvet flower

5
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,760
but the person who made it, are you?

6
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,590
It's not easy for women to do business.

7
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,720
I am a woman,

8
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,750
so

9
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,470
I'm happy to help other women

10
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,880
if they know what's good for them.

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,880
What is Hua Rong up to?

12
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,750
She's pushing the Ji family to take on many orders for Flushed Rose.

13
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,390
She even sent people

14
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,110
to monitor the Brocade Bureau in charge of registration.

15
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,360
What do you think of her?

16
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,240
Smart,

17
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,720
ruthless,

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
but still not enough.

19
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,520
If there's a mistake

20
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,550
in the registration in Yizhou City,

21
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,470
it's close enough to be dealt with.

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,600
Since Miss Ji is so clever,

23
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
she must have a plan.

24
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,750
Rest assured, my lady.

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,000
I've already prepared

26
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,910
a backup plan for this matter.

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,630
Whether we should act or not

28
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,160
depends entirely on your decision.

29
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,670
It all depends on what she decides.

30
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,080
Shu's splendor

31
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,800
is for everyone to share.

32
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,960
Today's Splendor Showcase

33
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,600
celebrates the champion.

34
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,470
Let all trades rejoice!

35
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,470
Let's begin!

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,720
Bravo!

37
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,390
Wen... Wen Jun's Wine,

38
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,240
eight wen for a jar,

39
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,190
fifteen wen for two jars.

40
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,910
Wenjun...

41
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,600
Louder!

42
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,320
If you can help me sell ten jars of wine today,

43
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,630
I won't hold you accountable for the damage you caused

44
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
in my inn the other day.

45
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,960
It was truly disgraceful.

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,360
Please don't bring it up again.

47
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,960
What's the harm?

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,030
An elder brother standing up for his younger sister...

49
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,630
that's something I can only envy.

50
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,240
Really?

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,030
Of course.

52
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,240
This is livelier than just selling silk.

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,030
No one dares stop me from selling now.

54
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,720
What are you selling?

55
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,510
Selling...

56
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,270
selling my charm!

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,790
Oh, nothing.

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,640
Why isn't Zhao Xiuyuan here?

59
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,600
Isn't he coming today?

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,320
He's busy weaving brocade.

61
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,070
He'll come later.

62
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,000
Now even Mr. Zhao Senior

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,480
doesn't stop you from seeing him.

64
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,040
Is the marriage getting close?

65
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,390
Now that he's showing his talent,

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,230
Mr. Zhao Senior probably thinks he's a rare gem.

67
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,200
You don't seem worried at all.

68
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,110
Do you think I'm not good enough for him?

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,830
That's not what I meant.

70
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,640
I was joking with you.

71
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,320
As long as we're of one heart,

72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,670
nothing can stand between us.

73
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,920
Excuse me, my lady!

74
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,480
You dropped your handkerchief.

75
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,040
Thank you, Miss Ji.

76
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,480
Why is it her, the jinx?

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,920
Do you know her?

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,790
She's Niu Wuniang,

79
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,270
the youngest daughter

80
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,040
of Vice Commander Niu.

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
It's said she'll bring misfortune.

82
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,390
She's lost two husbands to death.

83
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,480
She's always wearing either a veil or a mask.

84
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,550
And she's extremely arrogant.

85
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,550
Even more arrogant than you?

86
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,200
Last time, I spoke to her, and she didn't even bother to reply.

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,880
If she looks down on you,

88
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,830
then we common folk

89
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,640
must be nothing but dust in her eyes.

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,040
She just called me Miss Ji.

91
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,000
She knows me?

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,480
Being recognized by her is not a good thing.

93
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,880
Wen Jun's Wine!

94
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
Eight wen for a jar!

95
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,480
Fifteen wen for two jars!

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,440
Wen Jun's Wine!

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,760
When did my brother start selling wine?

98
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,200
Fifteen wen for two jars!

99
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
I'll take ten jars,

100
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,600
as gifts.

101
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,110
What are you trying to do?

102
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,320
Are you doing this

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,720
to make it up to me,

104
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,000
or just to ease your own conscience?

105
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,270
I must have disturbed you.

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,510
I'll take my leave.

107
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,160
This money...

108
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,950
Why not take it?

109
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,270
And this pouch?

110
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,480
I bought it to give him as a gift.

111
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,720
Don't you want it anymore?

112
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,600
No, I don't.

113
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,230
Things or people from the past...

114
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,350
what's worth holding onto?

115
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,720
Wen Jun's Wine, eight wen for a jar!

116
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,480
Fifteen wen for two jars!

117
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,510
Wen Jun's Wine!

118
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,350
Tell me, compared to Mr. Yang, how is my brother?

119
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,510
Compare what aspects? Height?

120
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,720
Is Yang Jingshan tall?

121
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,390
Compare their talents.

122
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,000
Yang Jingshan is Yizhou's Brocade Master.

123
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,760
Then how about personal qualities and demeanor?

124
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,950
My brother surely wins, doesn't he?

125
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,350
In terms of personal qualities,

126
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
your brother surely wins.

127
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,480
Mr. Yang, please have a seat.

128
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
What are you doing here?

129
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,200
I haven't even settled accounts with you for last time.

130
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,670
I was bored yesterday

131
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,920
and caught this in the mountains.

132
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,600
I was planning to give it to my good buddy,

133
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,350
but...

134
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,000
We're good buddies!

135
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,160
You're the best!

136
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,110
Is this what you're selling today?

137
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,510
Mr. Yang, you want to know about it?

138
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,160
Tell me, what's the price I have to pay?

139
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,920
For today's Splendor Showcase,

140
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,720
brocade families are participating in full!

141
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,480
Of course,

142
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,830
we must compete for the top spot.

143
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,110
Excuse me...

144
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,320
Excuse me, please.

145
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,950
The Splendor Showcase's champion

146
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,670
is selected from legitimate dyehouses

147
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,040
with proper paperwork to sell here.

148
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,670
Those relying on shady tricks have no chance.

149
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,880
They don't qualify.

150
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,320
And yet, they have the nerve to join the fun!

151
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,070
The third-place winner of this Splendor Showcase

152
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,790
sold 170 guan worth.

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,670
It goes to Mr. Wang from Wang's Dyehouse!

154
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,510
Well done!

155
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,670
Mr. Wang,

156
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,710
you should thank Mr. Sun properly.

157
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,520
Your prize was thanks to him.

158
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

159
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,910
Thank you, Mr. Sun.

160
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,350
The second-place winner of the Splendor Showcase

161
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,960
sold 190 guan worth!

162
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,670
It goes to Sun's Dyehouse!

163
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,320
Well done!

164
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:52,960
Well done!

165
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,710
Well done!

166
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,910
What a coincidence.

167
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,590
Mr. Sun, your prize

168
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,110
was contributed by Mr. Wang.

169
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,110
If you're unhappy with it,

170
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,960
you can always swap it for your jade Kylin.

171
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,080
I like it.

172
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,880
I like it very much.

173
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,200
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

174
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

175
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

176
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,320
the top prize of this Splendor Showcase

177
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,760
sold 230 guan worth!

178
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,840
Well done!

179
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,400
It goes to Hua's Dyehouse!

180
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,670
Well done!

181
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,080
Amazing!

182
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,520
Well done!

183
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,840
Mrs. Hua,

184
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,110
I'm returning this to its original owner.

185
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,080
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

186
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,150
These peonies are too small.

187
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,320
Besides, I'm not a fan of flowers.

188
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,280
Next time, Mrs. Hua, put more thought into your gift.

189
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,080
And also,

190
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,470
to the other shopkeepers, rest assured.

191
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,230
The prizes you've added

192
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,280
will be returned to each of you shortly.

193
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,710
Oh, by the way,

194
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,670
just to mention,

195
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,280
Miss Ji's team from Bloom Society

196
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,000
didn't have the proper entry papers,

197
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,440
so they don't officially count.

198
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,470
But their Flushed Rose sold a total of...

199
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,760
How much was it again?

200
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,790
250 guan!

201
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,640
250 guan!

202
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,280
They sold 250 guan worth!

203
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
Thank you.

204
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,960
That's even more than the champion.

205
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,320
I know this Miss Ji,

206
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,710
but what... what exactly

207
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:32,710
is the Bloom Society?

208
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:33,910
Ladies and gentlemen...

209
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,110
Ladies and gentlemen!

210
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,880
Guys, come here!

211
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,960
Our Bloom Society was established jointly

212
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,030
by Huanhua Dyehouse, Luoxia Dyehouse,

213
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,080
Yingxi Dyehouse,

214
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,230
and Liuyue Dyehouse.

215
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,960
It's newly founded,

216
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,470
but we are ambitious.

217
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,840
We aim to become the best dyehouse group in Yizhou!

218
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,710
Your guidance is much appreciated!

219
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,110
Thank you for your guidance!

220
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,440
Thank you for your guidance!

221
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,150
These velvet flowers represent prosperity.

222
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,760
They are our Bloom Society's creation,

223
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,230
dyed with signature silk threads from various houses.

224
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,470
They symbolize wealth and honor,

225
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,910
peace and prosperity!

226
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,960
Today, we present them to all of you

227
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,350
as a token of our humble sincerity.

228
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,000
May Yizhou's silk industry

229
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
blossom like all sorts of flowers

230
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,910
and compete in splendor!

231
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,550
This is dyed with our Midnight Purple,

232
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,030
wishing everyone success in all endeavors!

233
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,910
This is our Red Azalea,

234
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,960
wishing you peace and happiness!

235
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,550
This is our Cambodian Indigo,

236
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,880
wishing everyone health and longevity!

237
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,230
These are our Pine Flower and Azure Waves,

238
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,080
offering elegance, dignity, and a slimming effect!

239
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
Though my house has no flowers,

240
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,880
I am the honorary president of Bloom Society.

241
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,910
Thank you for your support!

242
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,910
From now on, we're all friends!

243
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,320
If you like it,

244
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,790
please come to Bloom Society

245
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,150
to place silk orders!

246
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,400
Let's go!

247
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,880
Come on!

248
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:58,710
We're all friends here!

249
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,520
Welcome to place orders for silk!

250
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,670
Thank you, Mr. Yang, for adding this finishing touch.

251
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,790
Welcome to place silk orders!

252
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,440
Here!

253
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,280
Wishing everyone wealth and honor,

254
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
peace and prosperity!

255
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,230
Share them around!

256
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,320
Here!

257
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,550
Remember, we're Bloom Society!

258
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,520
For silk orders, come to us at Bloom Society.

259
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,470
Madam, what's wrong?

260
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,280
Here!

261
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,350
Wishing you peace and prosperity, wealth and honor!

262
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,840
Do you still need more?

263
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,550
Madam,

264
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
is the master here to see us?

265
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,880
You fool.

266
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,150
The master isn't here to see us.

267
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,080
She comes to see Ji Yingying.

268
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,910
Bloom Society!

269
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:47,280
Bloom Society!

270
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,150
Good luck!

271
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,760
Keeping Ji Yingying alive

272
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,670
is nothing but trouble.

273
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,880
Bloom Society!

274
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,320
Yingying.

275
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,320
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,590
I was late.

277
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,320
Apparently, I'm the one who was late.

278
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,710
I was late.

279
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,000
I missed seeing you hand out velvet flowers.

280
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:23,710
Since you were late,

281
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,590
would you accept a punishment?

282
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,440
I would.

283
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,400
Hit me,

284
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Let that be your vow:

285
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,000
For the decades to come,

286
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,590
you will make it up to me, little by little.

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,110
I will!

288
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,320
So it's the Brocade Master you're after.

289
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,080
Because...

290
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,350
my grandfather promised me

291
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,550
if I could win the title of Brocade Master this time,

292
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,550
he would allow me

293
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,000
to propose to you.

294
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,590
What?

295
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,890
[Zhao Xiuyuan and His Beloved: Together Forever]
It hasn't been launched yet, and it's already working its magic?

296
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,710
Yingying.

297
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,880
Let's set it off.

298
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,880
Set it off now!

299
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,960
Careful!

300
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,470
Are you okay?

301
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,910
I'm fine. Just a scratch.

302
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,840
It's just a scrape.

303
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,760
A little ointment will fix it.

304
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,030
Thank you, Mr. Yang, for saving us.

305
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,110
Thank you, Mr. Yang.

306
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,910
Don't mention it.

307
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
I did this

308
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,760
so that in the future, when I need help

309
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,080
with appraising silk or threads,

310
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,910
I'll feel comfortable asking for assistance.

311
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,470
Mr. Yang, how did you know we were here?

312
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,910
Who do you think would want to harm you?

313
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,910
Mrs. Hua.

314
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,520
Today at the Splendor Showcase,

315
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,230
I completely embarrassed her.

316
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
Other than her, I can't think of anyone else.

317
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,640
I was asking you.

318
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,110
How did it turn into you questioning me?

319
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,710
How did you know she wanted to harm me?

320
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,440
At the field, I noticed something was off about her demeanor,

321
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,470
so I stayed alert.

322
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,320
This place is quite remote.

323
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,150
Finding it took me considerable effort.

324
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,280
I've long heard of the bond between you two,

325
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,960
a perfect match, and childhood sweethearts.

326
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,520
Seeing it today,

327
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,400
it's just as they say.

328
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,760
Mr. Yang,

329
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,350
you have a keen eye.

330
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,030
When it's our wedding day,

331
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,670
the two of us should have a good drink together.

332
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,080
I'm fine.

333
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,840
All right.

334
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,110
Today's unexpected disaster

335
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,640
was entirely thanks to your casual mention

336
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,470
at the Splendor Showcase.

337
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,470
Mr. Yang, you won't leave it unattended, will you?

338
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,110
Miss Ji, that's not quite fair.

339
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,440
Don't forget who asked me to add that finishing touch.

340
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,910
But Mrs. Hua was ready to kill someone!

341
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,280
That's clearly a challenge to your authority,

342
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,550
a provocation to your dignity!

343
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,470
Life-and-death matters are handled

344
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,150
by the county magistrate.

345
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,440
If you didn't want to get involved,

346
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,910
why would you have saved me?

347
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,280
You're betting I'd help you?

348
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,880
Please, stand up for the people,

349
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,670
Mr. Yang.

350
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,910
If you help a humble girl like me,

351
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,960
then in the future,

352
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,080
I will serve you with all my heart.

353
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,520
I'm afraid in the future,

354
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,960
you will come up with plenty of excuses.

355
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,470
It's getting late.

356
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,150
Zhao Xiuyuan,

357
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,080
perhaps you should take Miss Ji home now.

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,880
Miss Ji, if you don't want Zhao Xiuyuan to escort,

359
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,520
then I can personally see you home.

360
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,320
No need!

361
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,520
We'll leave.

362
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,910
Yingying,

363
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,790
are you close

364
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,430
to Mr. Yang?

365
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:08,520
I know him because I need his help.

366
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,070
But I know you

367
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,880
because

368
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,520
I want to know you.

369
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,470
Mr. Yang!

370
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,830
Mr. Yang.

371
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,920
Did you track the assassin?

372
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,400
Our people are monitoring them in secret.

373
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,160
Look at this arrow.

374
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,830
It's a military arrow.

375
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,520
Is the person behind the Hua family

376
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,110
that powerful?

377
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,560
The Hua family is a breakthrough point.

378
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,350
We must investigate further.

379
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,280
No improvement in skills,

380
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,590
but your boldness keeps growing.

381
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,950
Please calm down, my lady.

382
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,310
I just wanted to help you

383
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,110
get rid of Ji Yingying, that troublemaker!

384
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,400
You bribed my people

385
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,350
to do something behind me.

386
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,280
Who are you doing all this for?

387
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,310
Do I really need to spell it out?

388
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:29,920
My lady...

389
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,190
Did you leave any evidence?

390
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,520
Rest assured, my lady.

391
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,000
I had instructed them beforehand:

392
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,640
Whether the assassination succeeded or not,

393
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,560
they would hide in a separate residence

394
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,110
and not show up for a few days.

395
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,190
For someone who doesn't even know

396
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,560
who their real master is,

397
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,350
what's the use of keeping them?

398
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,310
Our lady is merciful,

399
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,950
leaving him a whole body.

400
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,830
I'll serve you with all my might,

401
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,920
with no disloyalty at all!

402
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,350
Please do a fair judgment, my lady!

403
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,430
Our people report

404
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,760
that the assassin is dead.

405
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,280
He was suddenly killed by an arrow of his kind.

406
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,070
Where did he die?

407
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,760
In a separate residence of the Hua family.

408
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:32,830
My dear,

409
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,070
you're back!

410
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,560
Why so late?

411
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,110
What did the master say?

412
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,160
Why do you look so pale?

413
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,590
My dear,

414
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,640
say something.

415
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,160
Please, say something.

416
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
You're scaring me being like this.

417
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,070
Is the master

418
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,040
going to punish us?

419
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,950
She ordered me to turn in all private accounts

420
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,230
and commanded me

421
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,350
never to meddle

422
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,000
in Ji Yingying or the mountain affairs again.

423
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,920
If so, just tell her it was all my doing.

424
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,070
Punish me instead!

425
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,070
Hua Xiangrong,

426
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,430
don't you get it?

427
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,110
She's abandoned us.

428
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,000
I know so many of her secrets.

429
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,040
She'll never let me go.

430
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,160
Then let's leave now.

431
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:31,800
Run away immediately!

432
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,880
We can't escape.

433
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,830
She's capable of killing!

434
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,110
Who's reckless enough to smash my window?

435
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,760
Shh!

436
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Why are you sneaking into my house so late?

437
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,950
I'm testing you.

438
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,000
After just encountering an assassin, you're this careless.

439
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,950
If I were a villain, I'd have taken you away already.

440
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,800
Smashing my window

441
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,070
makes you no different from a villain.

442
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,640
Mr. Yang, this is truly impolite.

443
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,430
I've found out

444
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,680
that the person who tried to assassinate you is Mrs. Hua.

445
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,350
I knew it.

446
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,560
The imperial yellow silk is also from her family.

447
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,040
That's your business.

448
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,800
I'll leave it to you, Mr. Yang.

449
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,470
See you later.

450
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,110
Zhuge and I have reviewed

451
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,590
the Hua family's accounts for a long time,

452
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,880
but we still haven't found any clues.

453
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,760
I know

454
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,560
you're an expert in this area.

455
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,560
I'd like to ask for your help.

456
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,560
Now?

457
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,470
Yes.

458
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,070
Delays will bring complications.

459
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,830
The assassin who tried to kill you

460
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,230
is already dead.

461
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,590
Looks like it's really late.

462
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,110
Let's go.

463
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,400
Let's investigate her thoroughly.

464
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,560
Where will you go toward?

465
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:41,880
Let's go.

466
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,160
Yang Jinglan,

467
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,190
I'm going to kill you!

468
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,800
All right, it's bright enough.

469
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,920
Be careful.

470
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,590
Don't burn the accounts.

471
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,190
If you can't understand them,

472
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,680
just sit quietly to the side.

473
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,190
Not meddling

474
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,590
is also a way of helping.

475
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,070
You talk as if you can understand them.

476
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Of course I can.

477
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,040
Think about it...

478
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,560
If she really did something wrong,

479
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,040
she must have a private ledger.

480
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,710
How could it be recorded in the public accounts?

481
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,430
Do you know what a fake account is?

482
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,430
It's a mix of truth and lies.

483
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
It can't be entirely real,

484
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,950
but it also can't be entirely false.

485
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,430
Even if she has a private ledger,

486
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,830
her public accounts

487
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,230
couldn't possibly leave no traces at all.

488
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,280
Otherwise,

489
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,880
the accounts wouldn't balance.

490
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,430
It sounds like you're an expert in making fake accounts.

491
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,920
Why is it so hot

492
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,470
in the Brocade Bureau?

493
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,350
Zhuge, fan her.

494
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,400
Mr. Yang,

495
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
some things

496
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,920
are better done personally.

497
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,350
I'm suffocating here!

498
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,760
Understood.

499
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,950
Why can't I feel any breeze?

500
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,350
Is this better now?

501
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,800
Mr. Yang...

502
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,760
I'll cool your head first, then your feet.

503
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,350
There's something wrong with the accounts.

504
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,000
What did you find?

505
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,920
Look at this.

506
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,000
This account

507
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,800
seems fine,

508
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,590
but

509
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,800
its flaw is that it seems too perfect.

510
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,000
First,

511
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,160
normal accounts inevitably have errors,

512
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,800
with traces of corrections or modifications.

513
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,350
But this one is unusually neat.

514
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,560
Second,

515
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,400
the silk-dyeing business is tough.

516
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,070
Every household has

517
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,880
to play some tricks with the accounts.

518
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,470
Someone like Mrs. Hua,

519
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,640
who always takes advantage where she can,

520
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,070
shows no sign

521
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,110
of any scheming

522
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,830
in her accounts.

523
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,800
The entire account

524
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,590
looks pre-written.

525
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
The way she puts it

526
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,470
does make some sense.

527
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,590
Look here.

528
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,950
They purchased a large batch of raw silk,

529
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,280
hired the Shen family to reel and dye it,

530
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,830
but it turned into waste silk.

531
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,160
There's a deficit in the accounts.

532
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,000
From what I know,

533
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,430
in all their years of operation,

534
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,950
the Shen family has never made

535
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,560
such a mistake that ruins an entire batch of silk.

536
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,590
And based on what I know about Mrs. Hua,

537
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,040
if something like this happened,

538
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,470
even if she didn't demand compensation,

539
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,190
she would have found a way

540
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,830
to sell the waste silk out.

541
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,880
Take a look at the subsequent entries.

542
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,230
These subsequent entries in the accounts

543
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,190
show no compensation

544
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,280
nor any discounted sales.

545
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,640
So where did this batch of silk go?

546
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,350
Perhaps the Shen family

547
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,160
never received this batch of silk at all.

548
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,190
Exactly.

549
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,590
[The accounts]

550
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,160
Using fake transactions like this,

551
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,400
how much the Hua family

552
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,040
has exploited in a year?

553
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,590
It's not just fake transactions.

554
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,280
If we compare the ledgers thoroughly one by one,

555
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
we'll uncover even more issues.

556
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,800
That's enough. We've found a direction.

557
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,160
Leave the rest to him.

558
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,560
All right.

559
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,880
Can he handle all of these by himself?

560
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,040
Don't worry.

561
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:26,920
This single discovery alone

562
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,070
is enough to convict the Hua family.

563
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,160
You won't suffer injustice in vain.

564
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,760
I'm not doing this to target the Hua family.

565
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,880
If I told you

566
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,470
I truly love Shu brocade

567
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,070
and don't want anyone to spoil it,

568
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,640
would you believe me?

569
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,680
It doesn't matter if you don't.

570
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,400
Let's go.

571
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,830
No need.

572
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,470
I have another way in.

573
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,430
Besides,

574
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,950
if you disturb Guo Kui inside,

575
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,400
it might bite you to death.

576
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:29,190
Mr. Yang, just see me off here.

577
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,680
A young lady sneaking through a dog hole every day...

578
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,230
Ji Yingying!

579
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,470
Yang Jinglan!

580
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,230
Look how obedient it is.

581
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,070
Not barking or biting.

582
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,640
Guo Kui, Why are you siding with an outsider?

583
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,800
Guo Kui.

584
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,950
It's true:

585
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,040
An evil dog meets its match in a worse person.

586
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,760
In your eyes,

587
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,680
am I only fit to be called a villain?

588
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,680
If the accounts truly have issues,

589
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,560
would you really arrest the Hua family?

590
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,230
Why we investigate her if we don't plan to arrest her?

591
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,880
All right, good boy.

592
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,110
The Hua family's backer

593
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,470
might be in Chang'an.

594
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,800
So what?

595
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,800
Be cautious.

596
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,880
Miss Ji,

597
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,230
if I say

598
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,640
I sincerely wish to reform Yizhou's brocade industry

599
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,760
and clear the innocent of false charges,

600
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,190
would you believe me?

601
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,160
It doesn't matter if you don't.

602
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,040
I'm leaving.

603
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,830
He may not be a good man,

604
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,040
but he seems to be a good official.

605
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,070
You're right!

606
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,230
What are you doing?

607
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,640
How dare you trespass on my house?

608
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,680
Mrs. Hua,

609
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,640
how have you been?

610
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,350
Mr. Yang,

611
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,430
how have you been?

612
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:48,070
Very well.

613
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,520
I recall

614
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,190
that I used to pay my respects to you.

615
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,830
Even if it wasn't much,

616
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
it shouldn't warrant you raiding my home today.

617
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,230
[Hua's Dyehouse Ledger]
Your family falsified accounts

618
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
to evade taxes.

619
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,760
Do you really think I know nothing?

620
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,210
[Hua's Dyehouse Ledger]

621
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,310
Mr. Yang.

622
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:14,160
We didn't find Hua Xiangrong.

623
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,310
Mrs. Hua,

624
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,800
where is he?

625
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,520
How would I know?

626
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
He usually like

627
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,000
to mess around outside.

628
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,640
Last night,

629
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,950
I scolded him a bit,

630
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,110
and he ran off.

631
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,560
Why not

632
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,400
catch him for me?

633
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,470
Fine.

634
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,920
Then I'll trouble you

635
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,520
to come with me first.

636
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:43,710
Please.

637
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,110
Yang Jinglan

638
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,880
arrested Mrs. Hua without letting her explain.

639
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,560
Did he uncover something?

640
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,310
Or is he just endlessly greedy,

641
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,070
doing this

642
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,040
to gain more benefits?

643
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,710
It has nothing to do with us.

644
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,310
But what if Mrs. Hua

645
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,640
speaks everything she knows?

646
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,830
Should we...

647
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,230
Keep her alive for now.

648
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,800
Let's see

649
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,400
what Yang Jinglan's true motives are.

650
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,070
But Mrs. Hua

651
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,230
knows some details about the mountain.

652
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,000
What if Yang Jinglan investigates the mountain?

653
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,520
If he is as reckless as the previous brocade officer,

654
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,760
then let him go and never return.

655
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
What about Ji Yingying?

656
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,190
The general's letter mentioned

657
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,190
that the court is seeking Shu Red Silk.

658
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:51,830
If we can

659
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,070
make her reveal Shu Red Silk's secret,

660
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,470
wouldn't that be a great achievement?

661
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,160
After Ji Guinan's death,

662
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,640
all of Yizhou has been watching the Ji family.

663
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,880
Have they uncovered anything?

664
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,310
So, you mean...

665
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,400
If there's no real Shu Red Silk,

666
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,160
what we have

667
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,920
will be considered real.

668
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,710
Mr. Yang,

669
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,880
please spare me.

670
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,280
It's been three days,

671
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,350
and she still hasn't spoken?

672
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,950
I've heard it said

673
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,710
that if someone is deprived of sleep for too long,

674
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,560
they may go mad,

675
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,190
or even die.

676
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,560
Mrs. Hua,

677
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,910
I advise you to think carefully before answering.

678
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,280
I...

679
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,280
I confess.

680
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,760
I was greedy,

681
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
and I feared

682
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,150
Ji Yingying's talent.

683
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,120
So I deliberately used the Ji family's debts

684
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,280
to suppress them.

685
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,000
Framing Ji Yaoting

686
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,910
was also my plan.

687
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,950
It was to force Ji Yingying

688
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,000
to give up Mr. Zhao Senior's recommendation

689
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,910
so I could enslave the Ji family.

690
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,360
But then Ji Yingying created a new dye color,

691
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,910
and I...

692
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,760
in a moment of foolishness,

693
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,520
resorted to hiring an assassin.

694
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,390
I know I was wrong.

695
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,470
Please, Mr. Yang,

696
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,280
considering that Ji Yingying is unharmed,

697
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,120
spare my life.

698
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,430
If you want to accuse me

699
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,080
of only caring about profit and not people,

700
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,520
there's no need to be so indirect.

701
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,800
Isn't that true?

702
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,120
Have you ever lacked money?

703
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:33,710
A gentleman loves wealth

704
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,520
but acquires it through proper means.

705
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,910
Have you ever been driven to desperation?

706
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,000
Finding hope in despair,

707
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,360
breaking but not bending.

708
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,120
You're valiant enough.

709
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,390
But I can't do it.

710
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,120
I only care about profit,

711
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
petty and selfish.

712
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,800
So,

713
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,630
she truly had no choice.

714
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,710
Other than hiring an assassin,

715
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,390
are there any other crimes?

716
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,120
No.

717
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,910
Truly, no more.

718
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,760
You've done so many bad things at Huanhua Creek.

719
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,280
Who's backing you?

720
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,470
It's all me.

721
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,800
I had my own plans for business.

722
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,670
Then what were you planning

723
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,520
with this imperial yellow silk?

724
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,910
This silk...

725
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,000
Are you planning to weave a dragon robe

726
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,520
for yourself on the mountain?

727
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,910
I'm only responsible for delivering the silk thread

728
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,600
to the cave at Beiling Pass.

729
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,360
After that, I know nothing.

730
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,190
I was just forced to do business.

731
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,870
I don't know anything else...

732
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,630
Who's forcing you?

733
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:06,360
You won't tell me?

734
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,190
Do you think

735
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,910
the person forcing you will come save you,

736
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,280
or are you hoping

737
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,670
Hua Xiangrong will come save you?

738
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,910
Or is it because of Hua Xiangrong

739
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,000
that someone has to come save you?

740
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:26,710
Is there

741
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,120
really no way out?

742
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,080
There is.

743
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,800
Let's cut off the source.

744
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,000
Between us,

745
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,320
one must go.

746
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,190
If I leave

747
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,560
taking all the secrets with me,

748
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,950
and you stay behind,

749
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,910
you won't survive.

750
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,710
But if you take all the secrets with you,

751
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,600
she won't dare act rashly.

752
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,870
At least she'll spare my life,

753
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,360
maybe even get me out of there.

754
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,150
Hua Xiangrong,

755
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,520
out there,

756
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,710
you're my hope for survival.

757
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,910
Add two more fire pits for Mrs. Hua.

758
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,390
Make this place brighter!

759
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,320
Beat the gong more frequently!

760
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,950
Do you think what she says is credible?

761
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,910
Even if there's deceit, there must be some truth.

762
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,760
Otherwise, how could she deceive me?

763
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,120
You're playing with fire.

764
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,470
Don't worry. It won't burn you.

765
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:02,080
Right now, we have

766
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,320
no other leads.

767
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,710
Even if it's a trap,

768
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,560
we have to give it a try.

769
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,470
Send the secret guards

770
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,840
to search the area

771
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:10,910
she mentioned.

772
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
If anything seems off, don't act recklessly.

773
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,320
Wait for me to arrive.

774
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,910
Understood.

775
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,710
[Yuebuhuan Inn]

776
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:25,950
Keep your arm straight.

777
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,950
Bend your knees.

778
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,280
They're bent already...

779
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,080
Don't stick your butt out.

780
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,600
Shift your weight lower.

781
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,910
Not that low.

782
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:36,360
Stand up.

783
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,120
All right, stop.

784
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,120
Keep your back straight.

785
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,600
Yu,

786
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,150
I still have to dye silk.

787
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,910
I can't just be slacking off

788
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,800
while everyone else is working hard.

789
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,390
Don't you remember

790
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,120
who almost got hurt a few days ago?

791
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,950
I know you mean well,

792
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,280
but...

793
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,000
Squat down.

794
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,000
But if I face danger again,

795
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,950
I can't just squat there, can I?

796
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,950
Why don't you teach me something else...

797
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,150
Something more practical,

798
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,710
a one-move takedown kind of thing?

799
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,870
It's so quiet in the shop,

800
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,360
not a single customer.

801
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,150
Oh, you're practicing martial arts?

802
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,230
Come on,

803
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,760
I'll teach you some moves.

804
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,150
No...

805
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,000
If you're going to teach me

806
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,800
horse stance or striking wooden stakes again,

807
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,630
then forget it.

808
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,320
I'm really not cut out for this.

809
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,950
Don't worry.

810
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,710
Based on what I saw of you that day,

811
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,670
this move is perfect for you.

812
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,120
Watch carefully.

813
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,950
If you're in danger,

814
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,190
aim for the enemy's lower body

815
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,190
and kick with all your might.

816
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,390
One move to defeat them.

817
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:41,190
It's very effective.

818
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,120
That's not a bad idea.

819
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,840
Give it a try.

820
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
You're really going to try?

821
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,520
That looks painful.

822
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,910
Your foot will hurt more.

823
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Stop laughing.

824
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,910
Can't you teach her something proper?

825
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,710
All right.

826
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,560
I'll teach you something else.

827
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,630
What other move?

828
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,470
How about learning to ride a horse?

829
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,670
What's the use of that?

830
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,040
If you can't fight, you can run.

831
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,630
On horseback,

832
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,600
nobody can catch you.

833
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,630
Guaranteed success.

834
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,080
But...

835
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,630
If you're teaching, teach properly.

836
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,670
I'll go get you some snacks.

837
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,150
You didn't come here today

838
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,280
just to teach me self-defense, did you?

839
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,520
I came today

840
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,870
to clear your worries.

841
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,600
Right now, there's only one thing

842
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,870
on my mind:

843
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,280
registering Flushed Rose for the records.

844
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,150
The inspection in Yizhou

845
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,280
is complete.

846
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,430
As for the seal,

847
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,630
I've already stamped it.

848
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,950
Tomorrow, I'll send someone to deliver it.

849
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,840
Who's delivering it? Zhuge?

850
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
Him? That'd be more like delivering his life.

851
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,840
[Please approve Ji Yingying to sell Flushed Rose silk]

852
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,080
The person behind Mrs. Hua

853
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,470
is no ordinary figure.

854
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,430
She has confessed to me

855
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
everything she's done.

856
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:18,560
I used to think

857
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,040
you were solely focused on business,

858
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:20,950
uninterested in anything else.

859
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,760
But now I see

860
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,040
you really don't have that time.

861
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,710
Just managing the present

862
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,520
is already no small task.

863
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,870
I misspoke.
