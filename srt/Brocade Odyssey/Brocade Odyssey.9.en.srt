00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,820
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,360
On the victim's body,

4
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,510
aside from two small wounds on the back of the hand,

5
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,760
there were no other injuries.

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,830
Judging by the evidence, it might have been a venomous snake bite.

7
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,270
We had just been to the Niu family,

8
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,760
and upon returning, Mrs. Hua was found dead in this cell.

9
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,720
This case is far from simple.

10
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,630
But I fear that no matter how much we investigate,

11
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,830
we'll only end up with a scapegoat.

12
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,400
Tell me,

13
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,550
since she was just a discarded pawn,

14
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,750
why didn't they kill her right away?

15
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,520
You mean,

16
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,720
Hua Xiangrong had something they wanted?

17
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,550
And Mrs. Hua was certain

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,910
Niu Wuniang would come to rescue her?

19
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,600
Then why

20
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,270
did they kill her now?

21
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,080
We tracked the Niu family,

22
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,270
and she feared we might use this clue

23
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,720
to extract more information

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,240
from Mrs. Hua.

25
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,320
So,

26
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,080
they decided to gamble

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,520
that they could find Hua Xiangrong before us!

28
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,960
Spread the news of Mrs. Hua's death.

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,320
What are you planning to do?

30
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,830
I'll take a gamble too,

31
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,750
to see if there's still...

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,830
true sentiment in this world.

33
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,320
Yingying, don't be afraid.

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,720
We're back now.

35
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,030
This is the Brocade Bureau.

36
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,110
She wouldn't dare come here to take you.

37
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,470
I didn't expect this to happen.

38
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,270
I didn't want that maid to die.

39
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,880
I never thought she'd commit murder.

40
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:21,670
This isn't your fault.

41
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,000
Niu Wuniang

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,880
is ruthless

43
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,830
and takes human lives.

44
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,240
The maid's death

45
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,160
has nothing to do with you.

46
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,240
Yu,

47
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,750
I used to think

48
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,550
that all I had to deal with

49
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,270
was some competition between merchants,

50
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,630
that at most, it was about business success or failure,

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,750
profit or loss.

52
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,630
I never imagined that one day

53
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,630
I'd face an enemy like this.

54
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,440
To them, life is worthless.

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,800
Killing someone

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,270
is as effortless as stepping on an ant.

57
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,470
Just like with my father...

58
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,030
Wait,

59
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,070
you haven't told my brother and mother about this, right?

60
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,480
No, I haven't. Don't worry.

61
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,920
If they knew,

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,110
it would only cause more worry.

63
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,880
What are you planning to do next?

64
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
That's Niu Jin,

65
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,270
the daughter of Vice Commander Niu.

66
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,510
Yes,

67
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,230
the daughter of Vice Commander Niu.

68
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,270
So what?

69
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,950
She won't let me go just because I back down,

70
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,270
and I won't stop just because

71
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,270
of who her father is.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,760
Yu,

73
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,670
I can't retreat.

74
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,670
There's no way back for me.

75
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,390
No matter the challenges,

76
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,830
I must forge ahead.

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,270
Mr. Yang, since you saved me,

78
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,480
I won't go back on my word.

79
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,440
Ask what you want to ask.

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,720
You two talk.

81
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,550
No rush.

82
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,070
Maybe another day.

83
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,040
I'll probably be quite busy in the coming days.

84
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,830
If you don't ask today,

85
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,880
I might forget.

86
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,760
Have a seat first.

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,070
About your father,

88
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,640
I've heard the general story.

89
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,920
Upon closer inspection,

90
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,160
there are many suspicious points in the case.

91
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,720
As the Brocade Master,

92
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,270
he had plenty of ways to profit.

93
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,920
Why commit such an obvious crime against the emperor?

94
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,070
These things...

95
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,720
have you ever thought about them?

96
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,320
But even if I have, so what?

97
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,640
My family has fallen into ruin,

98
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,390
and my mother is gravely ill.

99
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,830
Just making a living

100
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,270
already takes everything I have.

101
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,790
Even if I know my father's death

102
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,880
has deeper truths behind it,

103
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,720
what can I possibly do?

104
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,270
I can't dye Shu Red Silk now,

105
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,510
but one day, I will.

106
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,350
When that day comes,

107
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,270
I'll repay the life you saved.

108
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,480
Well,

109
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,670
I look forward to it.

110
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,350
Mr. Yang,

111
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,880
my family business can't do without me.

112
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,070
I need to return as soon as possible.

113
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,920
Please help me arrange a place

114
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
to freshen up.

115
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,110
Sure.

116
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
I'll have someone prepare it for you.

117

Thank you.

118

119

Everything's prepared.

120

121
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,510
Take the side road out of the Brocade Bureau,

122
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,040
and stop a short distance

123

Thank you.

All right, stop staring.

even if it belongs to another family,

130
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,320
shouldn't be left to wither.

131
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,200
He's just a discarded son of the Yang family,

132
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,350

I'll make him pay in blood.

136
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,000
For now,

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,080
there was no better solution.

138
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,000
In front of him,

139
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,880
if you hadn't put on a good show,

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,470
this matter

141
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,350
would've been difficult to resolve.

142
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,030
It's just...

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
Just what?

144
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,030
Speak your mind.

145
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,200
You killed Mrs. Hua so hastily.

146
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,880
Wasn't it a bit rash?

147
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm worried

148
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,080
that Hua Xiangrong might...

149
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,080
What does "husband and wife" mean?

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You've seen it with me.

151

"Living and dying together"

152
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,840
only exists in storybooks.

153
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,470
Hua Xiangrong has always been timid and weak.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,440
Without Hua Rong to support him,

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,000
he's nothing.

156
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,790
While Hua Rong was alive,

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,320
he might have had

158
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,150
a chance to rise again.

159
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,280
Now that Hua Rong is dead,

160
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,440
he's likely already fled for his life.

how will she understand

I heard that Flushed Rose wasn't registered.

The delivery date hasn't passed,

567
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,230
Hand over the silk!

568
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,590
I'll hand over the silk.

569
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,230
Esteemed sirs, apologies for the wait.

570
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,040
You've been waiting at my doorstep for so long.

571
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,470
How about coming in for a cup of hot tea first?

572
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,470
I'll accept, then.

573
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,520
Let's go in!

574
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,590
Fine, we'll go in.

575
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:39,800
Still not handing over the silk?

576
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,000
Where's the silk?

577
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,880
Bring out the silk!

578
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,520
You can't hand it over, can you?

579
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,110
Where's the silk?

580
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,640
Bring out the silk!

581
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,800
Here's the silk!

582
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,160
Yaoting, bring out our family's silk too.

583
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,920
Got it.

584
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,190
Every piece here

585
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:40,310
is labeled with the name of the respective shop.

586
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,040
Everyone,

587
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,680
please inspect the goods.

588
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,070
How could you possibly have dyed this?

589
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,710
You don't even have safflower...

590
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,520
What don't I have?

591
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,070
Anyway, this Flushed Rose must be fake!

592
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,920
It's definitely fake!

593
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,560
Esteemed sirs,

594
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,470
you've been in business for decades.

595
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,680
Can't you tell

596
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,680
if this is real or fake?

597
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,070
How can you prove it's real?

598
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,640
Then how can you prove it's fake?

599
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,520
You need to prove first that it's real.

600
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,040
You prove it's fake first!

601
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,830
Go ahead, prove it!

602
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,680
How can it be real?

603
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,830
It's fake!

604
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,190
Whether it's real or fake...

605
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,640
isn't that for me to decide?

606
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:21,040
Inspector,

607
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,560
examine the goods.

608
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,280
Understood.

609
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,400
Report to Mr. Yang:

610
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,110
I've completed the inspection.

611
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,470
This is indeed Flushed Rose.

612
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,430
There's no doubt about it.

613
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,000
Make sure you've checked thoroughly.

614
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,640
This concerns the interests of all brocade merchants

615
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,880
and my reputation as well.

616
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,680
No room for error.

617
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,230
Be sure before you speak.

618
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,830
Absolutely sure.

619
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,590
Not only is this silk colorfast,

620
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,040
but its luster is stunning.

621
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,040
It's the finest of the fine.

622
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,400
Although I've seen countless silks,

623
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,040
this is the first time I've encountered silk this exquisite.

624
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,880
"The lovely girls are drunk with wine,

625
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,680
their faces are flushed."

626
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,830
It's truly perfect.

627
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,680
All right, enough.

628
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,590
I asked you to inspect the silk,

629
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,590
not recite poetry.

630
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,040
Everyone, if there are no objections,

631
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,230
then as the brocade officer, I bear witness here:

632
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,110
money in one hand,

633
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,520
and goods in the other.

634
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,640
Wait.

635
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:29,160
What now?

636
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,000
Mr. Yang,

637
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,400
you dare to publicly sell silk

638
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,070
that hasn't been officially registered?

639
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,830
Miss Ji, do you have no respect for the law?

640
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,920
All of you who take her silk,

641
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,430
aren't you afraid of getting involved in a lawsuit?

642
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,920
Mr. Yang, shouldn't you enforce the law impartially?

643
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,800
Yeah!

644
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,110
That's right, Mr. Yang!

645
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,680
That's right, Mr. Yang!

646
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,280
Zhuge Hong.

647
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,520
I've been a bit forgetful lately.

648
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,350
Do you recall whether this Flushed Rose

649
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,760
was officially registered or not?

650
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,040
Well...

651
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,430
um...

652
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,280
I'm not entirely sure.

653
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,680
We need to investigate.

654
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,430
Exactly.

655
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,000
Investigate thoroughly,

656
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,040
carefully

657
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,520
and methodically.

658
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,230
Understood.

659
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,310
Can that guy really make it back in time?

660
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,950
Almost, I'd say.

661
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,040
Please delay a bit longer.

662
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,880
Truly, you have foresight, madam.

663
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,230
Yang Jinglan has indeed arrived.

664
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,230
He seems to be intentionally stalling for time.

665
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,040
Since he dares to wield imperial authority against me,

666
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,040
then I'll show him

667
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,920
in Yizhou,

668
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,400
who really calls the shots.

669
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,640
Mr. Yang, it's obvious you're stalling for time.

670
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,070
Why are you in such a hurry?

671
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,430
I've only recently taken office,

672
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,400
so I must act cautiously.

673
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,400
Just hold on.

674
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,310
We're investigating.

675
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,230
Exactly.

676
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,390
They're investigating.

677
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:08,870
Why the rush?

678
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,910
Mr. Yang,

679
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,840
technically speaking,

680
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,600
this Flushed Rose

681
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,840
was registered by you personally.

682
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,430
How could you not remember?

683
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:17,910
Zhuge,

684
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,390
what should we have for lunch today?

685
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,280
What lunch?

686
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,190
There's still a pile of things to investigate.

687
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,280
As a brocade officer,

688
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,120
you openly abuse your power in broad daylight,

689
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,080
sheltering criminals!

690
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,670
Greetings, Chief Sang!

691
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,600
Chief Sang, what brings you here?

692
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,280
They're all gossiping about me,

693
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,630
claiming Flushed Rose wasn't registered.

694
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:47,040
Please, make a judgment call!

695
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,630
Has Sang Shisi returned yet?

696
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:50,950
Yes.

697
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,230
Chief Sang, you've come at the perfect time.

698
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,840
I'm currently handling this case,

699
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,470
but some unruly citizen is stirring up trouble.

700
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,230
Please help maintain order.

701
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,840
Sang Shisi went to Chang'an to visit his elder sister.

702
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,600
Why are you asking about him?

703
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,430
You didn't drag him

704
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,230
into this mess too, did you?

705
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,710
Her master summoned you here?

706
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,600
Huanhua Dyehouse is guilty of illicit dyeing

707
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,120
and illegal trading.

708
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,470
All personnel are to be detained,

709
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,040
and all illegal goods are to be seized

710
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,390
and destroyed!

711
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,230
No,

712
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:43,840
Chief Sang!

713
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,710
Chief Sang, please reconsider!

714
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,280
Nice! Burn it!

715
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,320
Chief Sang,

716
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,230
this case should be handled by me.

717
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,430
Why have you taken over?

718
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,600
Mr. Yang,

719
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,710
this case is serious

720
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,670
and of great significance.

721
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,320
The higher-ups

722
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:02,600
have already assigned it to me.

723
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,040
Do you have any objections?

724
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,430
Who are these "higher-ups"?

725
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,040
The higher-ups are the higher-ups.

726
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You're already a member of the imperial family.

727
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,040
Why fear the higher-ups?

728
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,040
I'm just a figurehead.

729
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,520
They are

730
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,600
the ones with real power.

731
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,280
Guards, take them away!

732
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,670
Yes, sir!

733
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,040
This all started because of me.

734
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,840
Take me instead!

735
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,670
"A child's fault reflects the father's failure."

736
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,630
I take on a father's role.

737
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,840
Direct it at me!

738
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,190
She didn't do it.

739
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,040
Arrest me instead!

740
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:32,760
Take me!

741
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,080
Why all the shouting?

742
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,430
None of you are getting away.

743
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,670
Take them all!

744
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,190
Chief Sang, hold on!

745
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,040
Yingying,

746
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,870
rest for a moment.

747
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,390
I will speak on your behalf.

748
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,800
Obstructing official duties

749
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,230
is a serious crime.

750
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,120
Even if they don't understand,

751
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,710
are you confused too?

752
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,150
Chief Sang,

753
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,000
I have a few words to say.

754
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,430
All of you,

755
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,430
I know that you didn't come here today

756
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,040
to harm the Ji family,

757
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,120
but to claim your silk.

758
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,710
The Flushed Rose silk is right here before you.

759
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,470
Now, with your investments at risk,

760
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,120
will you stand by and do nothing?

761
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
As for the registration process,

762
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,320
someone clearly targeted the Ji family deliberately.

763
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,430
The Ji family has brought glory to the brocade industry.

764
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,600
What crime have we committed?

765
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,670
If the Ji family is taken away today

766
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,000
and no one stands up for us,

767
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,190
when you face challenges in the future,

768
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,870
will there still be anyone willing to help you?

769
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,910
Enough!

770
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,840
Do not incite others intentionally.

771
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,320
Chief Sang,

772
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,040
public sentiment is hard to ignore.

773
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,430
If you insist on burning the silk today,

774
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,320
you may lose the trust of the people.

775
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,670
As their leader,

776
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,710
are you not afraid that the citizens of Yizhou

777
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,320
will criticize you behind your back?

778
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:21,950
That's right,

779
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,870
Chief Sang.

780
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,120
My mother is right!

781
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,670
Aunt Ji is right, isn't she?

782
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,040
Yes!

783
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,670
Isn't she right?

784
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,630
That's correct!

785

787
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,670

I will not burn it for now.

801
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,230
I can't predict this.

802

The registration process is lengthy,

803

and those with ill intentions will surely obstruct it.

804
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,190
Rather than guarding against every step,

805
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,630
we'll leave one copy in the open,
