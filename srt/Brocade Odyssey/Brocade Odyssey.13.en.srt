[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,310
I, Ji Yingying, representing the Ji family,

4
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,510
present our brocade,

5
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,590
"The Return of Phoenix"!

6
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,360
Please evaluate it, everyone.

7
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,230
Ji Yingying! The Return of Phoenix!

8
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,270
Ji Yingying! The Return of Phoenix!

9
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,190
Ji Yingying! The Return of Phoenix!

10
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,480
If I'm not mistaken,

11
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,590
the Ji family isn't allowed to compete.

12
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,680
How can the descendant of a criminal

13
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,000
participate in the Brocade Weaving Competition?

14
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,590
Ms. Ji doesn't qualify for the contest

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
and even disrupts the event.

16
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,800
Mr. Yang, don't you do something about it?

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Mrs. Zhao,

18
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,040
this matter

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,630
is truly beyond my jurisdiction.

20
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,670
If I'm not mistaken,

21
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,960
they were pardoned.

22
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,160
Even His Majesty has pardoned them.

23
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,960
But

24
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,190
Mrs. Zhao,

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,800
do you think the pardon is unwarranted?

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
I didn't say that.

27
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,110
However,

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,190
this competition is about brocade paintings,

29
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,080
and she's competing with a kite.

30
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,390
What a joke!

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,270
The art of Shu

32
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,470
is born of the heart.

33
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,390
This kite made of Shu Red Silk

34
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,030
is my inner vision.

35
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,600
It was woven by my brother's hands,

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,910
reflecting his thoughts.

37
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,880
The Brocade Bureau hasn't stipulated

38
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,360
what a brocade painting must look like.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,320
I weave it out of my thoughts.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,670
What's wrong with that?

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,080
Exactly!

42
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
What's wrong with that?

43
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,240
Mr. Yang,

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,600
Ji Yingying forged Shu Red Silk

45
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,750
right under everyone's noses.

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,630
What a shocking crime!

47
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,910
Tell me,

48
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,600
how should this be handled?

49
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,600
This Shu Red kite

50
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,160
is vivid and striking.

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,630
It doesn't seem fake to me.

52
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,630
Mr. Yang, have you forgotten

53
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,800
that the genuine Shu Red Silk

54
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,030
was already sent to Chang'an by you

55
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,670
and presented to His Majesty?

56
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,550
Ms. Ji,

57
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,080
Previously, the Zhao family claimed to have Shu Red Silk,

58
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,550
and now your Ji family is claiming the same.

59
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,670
It makes me confused.

60
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,000
How about

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,110
that you evaluate

62
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,190
which one

63
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,390
is real on behalf of me?

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,600
Come on!

65
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,470
Come on!

66
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,080
Yingying,

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,470
the brocade we conceived,

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,030
I've woven it.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Who says women can't brave the storm

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,390
or hold their heads high?

71
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,360
Soaring to the skies,

72
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,000
isn't this

73
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,600
your image in my heart?

74
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,160
Ji Yingying,

75
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,480
even if you have grievances with the Zhao family,

76
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,880
you shouldn't vent your anger by ruining the brocade painting!

77
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,390
Whether it's a masterpiece or a fraud

78
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,040
will soon be clear.

79
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,640
Mrs. Zhao,

80
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,670
stay calm.

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,670
It's fading!

82
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,390
The color is fading!

83
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,230
It's losing color!

84
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,320
It's fake!

85
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,550
It's truly fake!

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,950
As expected, Yingying!

87
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,040
It's fake!

88
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,640
It's fake!

89
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,480
It's fake!

90
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,320
It's fake!

91
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,880
It's truly fake!

92
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,200
I distinctly remember

93
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,790
it was a masterpiece that showcased soaring ambitions.

94
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,110
But now, how has it become

95
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,480
a fall from grace?

96
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,070
A fall from grace!

97
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,160
This brocade painting

98
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,000
is unrecognizable now

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
because it was woven with Zhao Red Silk.

100
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,390
Zhao Red Silk is not Shu Red Silk.

101
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
On that day,

102
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,760
someone coated the red silk with oil,

103
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,550
so it wouldn't completely fade in alkaline water.

104
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,160
But just now, I used soapberry water,

105
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
and the oil dissolved in contact with it.

106
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,320
The fake

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,160
naturally revealed its true form.

108
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Ji Yingying!

109
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,880
Ji Yingying! Shu Red Silk!

110
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,950
Ji Yingying! Shu Red Silk!

111
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,040
Ji Yingying! Shu Red Silk!

112
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,070
Ji Yingying! Shu Red Silk!

113
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,600
Ji Yingying! Shu Red Silk!

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
On that day,

115
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,200
all of you, in front of General Niu,

116
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,550
admitted with your own words

117
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,440
that the Zhao family's silk

118
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
was authentic Shu Red Silk.

119
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,230
So,

120
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,720
today,

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,390
are you trying to deny it?

122
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,270
Now that the results are out,

123
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,270
please announce

124
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,200
this year's Brocade Master.

125
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,670
This year,

126
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,480
the Brocade Master of the competition is...

127
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,070
Zhao Xiuyuan

128
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,600
from the Zhao family.

129
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,600
Ms. Ji didn't hear it clearly.

130
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,000
Please speak louder.

131
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,270
This year,

132
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,110
the Brocade Master of the competition

133
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,880
is Zhao Xiuyuan!

134
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,000
What?

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,950
Are you kidding?

136
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,160
Since Lady Niu has spoken

137
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,640
and the Brocade Master has been decided,

138
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,160
I'll take my leave.

139
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,270
Our Shu Red phoenix

140
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,640
will find another home!

141
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,440
Let's go.

142
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,200
This kind of competition is not worth it!

143
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,390
Exactly, let's leave!

144
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,070
What a waste of time!

145
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:00,640
Yaoting,

146
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,350
from today onward,

147
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,350
everyone will know

148
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,350
that our Ji family can make Shu Red Silk again.

149
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,550
You deliberately let Ji Yingying ruin Shu Red Silk.

150
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,440
Mr. Yang,

151
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,440
do you no longer value your life?

152
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,320
Madam, you're joking.

153
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,960
When the real Shu Red Silk appears,

154
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,440
the fake one will naturally be exposed.

155
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,000
Besides,

156
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,520
in front of so many people,

157
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,960
how could I

158
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,910
make anything up?

159
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,710
Don't forget

160
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,760
that the Zhao Red Silk was sent by you to Chang'an.

161
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,910
If this silk is fake,

162
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,790
you will be the first to be questioned.

163
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,280
I haven't forgotten.

164
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,280
Indeed,

165
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,440
the Zhao Red Silk was sent to Chang'an by me,

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,030
but it was never presented at the palace.

167
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,910
If you don't believe it,

168
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,150
you can go to Chang'an

169
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,150
and investigate yourself.

170
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,910
You've kept a backup plan.

171
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,590
As Brocade Officer,

172
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,350
the position is full of dangers,

173
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,760
so I must always leave a way out.

174
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,110
Regardless,

175
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,080
today's competition

176
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
still sees the Zhao family as the victor.

177
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,550
I've even prepared a gift

178
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,150
for you, madam.

179
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,550
Mr. Yang, bad news!

180
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,110
Mount Qingcheng is on fire!

181
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,150
Mount Qingcheng is on fire.

182
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,760
Madam,

183
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,080
would you like to join me

184
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,440
and head up the mountain together?

185
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,710
The Zhao family has already prepared

186
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,030
a celebration banquet at San Hua Pavilion.

187
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,440
They should be waiting for me now.

188
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,760
As for the trouble on Mount Qingcheng,

189
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,840
you will handle it on your own.

190
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,350
From earlier until now,

191
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,790
I haven't seen your maid, Yu Yuan.

192
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,110
I wonder where she could be at the moment.

193
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,790
If she's up on Mount Qingcheng,

194
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,350
she might be in danger.

195
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,910
Hurry, put out the fire!

196
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Water is here!

197
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,000
Water is here!

198
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,520
Quickly!

199
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,200
Who did this?

200
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,710
There's a cave over there!

201
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,320
Slow down!

202
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,760
You little rascal!

203
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,880
We can't go slower, father!

204
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,840
Yang Jinglan said

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,880
there's a big opportunity up there.

206
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,280
We can't let others beat us to it!

207
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,030
Yang Jinglan?

208
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,320
Hurry up, father!

209
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,000
Take a few extra steps!

210
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
Why not use a horse?

211
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,350
You'll have to tough it out for now...

212
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,080
Chief Sang is here!

213
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,960
The Imperial Uncle is here!

214
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,230
Why are you shouting that?

215
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,590
Chief Sang,

216
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,670
look at this!

217
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,350
Who could commit such an outrageous act?

218
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,230
What...

219
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,080
what is going on?

220
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,520
How could there be a brocade workshop here?

221
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,640
Does the fire here

222
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,200
have anything to do with you?

223
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Chief Sang,

224
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,640
these people have been poisoned mute.

225
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,280
They can't speak at all.

226
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,230
It's clear

227
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,550
that they were kept here

228
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,080
as forced labor.

229
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,440
Oh...

230
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,640
Rest assured.

231
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,520
If there's any suffering, any grievance,

232
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,150
write it down.

233
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,280
My father will ensure justice for everyone!

234
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,710
You...

235
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,150
So this is the big opportunity you mentioned?

236
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,230
Do you want me dead or something?

237
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,470
Don't you think this is serious?

238
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,200
Who would be dare

239
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,280
to kidnap civilians

240
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,880
to profit from brocade-making?

241
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,960
Chief Sang.

242
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,280
Yang Jinglan.

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,470
I've just discovered

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,760
this terrible operation as well.

245
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,590
I trust you will unearth

246
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,440
the culprit behind this

247
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
and show no mercy,

248
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,470
bringing justice to everyone!

249
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,150
Great!

250
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,790
Yes...

251
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,880
I will absolutely bring justice to all.

252
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,550
Guards,

253
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,230
search the brocade workshop and nearby caves.

254
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,550
Find the mastermind behind this!

255
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,470
- Search now! - Yes, sir!

256
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,840
This is fake Shu Red Silk!

257
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,440
This is called...

258
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,350
Zhao Red Silk!

259
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,350
Put it down!

260
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:36,960
This is...

261
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,520
imperial yellow silk!

262
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,030
They're planning a rebellion, father!

263
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,880
A rebellion!

264
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,910
Shut up!

265
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,470
I...

266
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,030
Mr. Yang,

267
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,000
we found a young woman in the cave,

268
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,080
along with these people.

269
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,790
They must be connected to this illegal brocade workshop.

270
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,110
Chief Sang,

271
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:02,640
come on.

272
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,670
Let me introduce someone to you.

273
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,280
This is

274
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,550
Yu Yuan, Niu Wuniang's maid.

275
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,280
Since she's here,

276
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,710
it proves that this matter

277
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,150
is deeply connected

278
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,590
to Niu Wuniang.

279
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,670
Exactly, that's a good point.

280
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,840
Nonsense!

281
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,760
Madam!

282
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,470
How could you be here?

283
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Didn't I send you to pray on the mountain?

284
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,710
Madam,

285
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,110
a group of bandits suddenly appeared

286
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,670
and captured me here.

287
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,280
I have no idea what happened.

288
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,280
Madam,

289
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,670
let's leave now.

290
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,320
I'm scared.

291
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,000
It seems this brocade workshop in the mountains

292
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,470
was indeed the work of bandits.

293
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,350
Thanks for finding my maid, Mr. Yang.

294
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,520
Yu Yuan, let's go.

295
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,960
Wait.

296
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,350
If they are bandits,

297
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,400
then how come your maid

298
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,910
was captured along with them?

299
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,440
You should ask them.

300
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,280
Why question me?

301
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,110
Perhaps they are fiercely loyal

302
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,200
or maybe

303
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,880
their loved ones' lives

304
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,080
are being held hostage,

305
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,670
leaving them unable to speak the truth.

306
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,640
If they cannot speak,

307
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,440
what does that have to do with me?

308
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,550
If they won't speak,

309
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,470
then I will.

310
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,320
Yingying!

311
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,350
Father...

312
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,230
I, Ji Yingying,

313
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,320
accuse Niu Wuniang

314
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,150
of producing fake Shu Red Silk, building an illegal brocade workshop,

315
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,280
causing chaos in the industry,

316
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,670
and stealing my family's honor.

317
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,280
Daring to frame the family of an official,

318
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,080
what crime does that warrant?

319
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Who gave you the right to speak?

320
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,910
Get up.

321
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,280
Thank you, Chief Sang.

322
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,280
Ms. Ji,

323
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,840
do you have any evidence?

324
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,470
At today's Brocade Competition,

325
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,080
everyone saw with their own eyes

326
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,840
that the fake Shu Red Silk faded in alkaline water.

327
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,880
Shu Red Silk is a designated royal request,

328
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,880
and Niu Wuniang dared to fake it publicly.

329
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,910
This is a grave act of disrespect!

330
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,440
Ms. Ji, you must be mistaken.

331
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,880
The Zhao Red Silk was dyed by my husband.

332
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,520
If you want to press charges,

333
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,440
you should accuse him instead.

334
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,880
You two are truly

335
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,960
the closest yet most distant couple.

336
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,550
Ms. Ji,

337
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:47,280
the Zhao Red Silk was dyed by Zhao Xiuyuan.

338
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,280
Are you accusing the wrong person?

339
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:50,960
No.

340
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,550
The person I am accusing is none other than her,

341
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,080
Niu Wuniang!

342
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,880
I have a witness.

343
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,150
Why is he here?

344
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,590
I'm Hua Xiangrong

345
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,030
from the Hua's Dyehouse.

346
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,760
Greetings, Chief Sang.

347
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,880
I can testify

348
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,150
that Niu Wuniang

349
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,880
is the mastermind behind the fake Shu Red Silk!

350
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,880
It was she

351
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,080
who ordered me

352
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,760
and my late wife

353
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,440
to produce fake Shu Red Silk.

354
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,760
Before the threads were even spun,

355
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,470
she urged us to pass it off as genuine.

356
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,670
As for these workers,

357
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,550
it was she who ordered me

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,280
to kidnap and deceive them here

359
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,350
using the guise of recruitment.

360
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,640
Even my wife...

361
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,470
was killed because of her!

362
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,350
Miss Ji,

363
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,470
if you intend to frame me,

364
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,470
you should at least find an upstanding citizen.

365
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,470
The Hua family has always been guilty of tax evasion.

366
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,710
How can his words

367
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,110
be trusted?

368
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,280
I have evidence!

369
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,830
Do you think

370
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,350
seizing all our account books

371
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,230
would make everything fine?

372
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,040
My wife foresaw

373
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,190
that she was dealing with

374
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,760
a cruel and ruthless person.

375
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,680
So, she made duplicates

376
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,070
of all the account books.

377
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,470
Hua Xiangrong!

378
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,040
I spent 20 years

379
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,350
with my wife.

380
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,830
Our bond is unbreakable!

381
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,880
I know I'm doomed,

382
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,070
and I fear death,

383
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,400
but what I fear more

384
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,000
is my wife

385
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,520
being unable to rest in peace!

386
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,920
I know

387
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,680
that we're both guilty as charged,

388
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,590
but still...

389
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,920
don't think you'll get away with it.

390
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,160
Even if I have to give my life,

391
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,920
I will avenge my wife!

392
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,680
I have contracts

393
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,160
and account books as evidence.

394
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,880
Please, Chief Sang, take a look!

395
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,040
Father!

396
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,110
Father!

397
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,770
Father!

398
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,160
[Silk Transport Ledger on Mountain]

399
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,470
Father, look!

400
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,040
Quick, look!

401
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,230
Oh...

402
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:57,830
um...

403
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,070
Mrs. Niu,

404
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,110
what do you expect me

405
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,430
to do now?

406
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,640
Chief Sang, you're the local magistrate.

407
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,470
It's natural for you to handle this fairly.

408
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,560
Moreover,

409
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,070
everyone is watching.

410
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Exactly, Father!

411
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,190
Everyone is watching!

412
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,760
I was involved

413
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,070
in Niu Wuniang's crimes.

414
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,070
I acknowledge my guilt!

415
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,280
But Niu Wuniang's crimes are far worse!

416
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,830
Please, Chief Sang, deliver justice!

417
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,400
Father!

418
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,280
Faking Shu Red Silk, taking lives,

419
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,920
kidnapping craftsmen...

420
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,880
these are grave crimes,

421
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,040
terrible beyond words.

422
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,680
Chief Sang,

423
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,230
why haven't you acted yet?

424
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,070
Of course, we'll act.

425
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:41,950
Father!

426
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,070
Chief Sang,

427
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,310
do you dare make an arrest?

428
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,160
Well...

429
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,520
To arrest or not to arrest, that is a question...

430
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,070
Arrest them, Father!

431
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,760
Or how will you face these craftsmen

432
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,920
and these common people?

433
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,880
Arrest them!

434
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,800
Arrest them!

435
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,430
Arrest them!

436
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,350
Arrest them!

437
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,070
Arrest them!

438
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,760
Arrest them!

439
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,280
Well...

440
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:08,710
Arrest them!

441
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,880
Then... we'll arrest them...

442
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,400
Let's see who dares to make the arrest!

443
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,280
Father.

444
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,070
General Niu,

445
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,880
Hua Xiangrong confessed the truth

446
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,920
and provided testimony,

447
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,640
yet you killed him.

448
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,920
Are you trying to shield Niu Wuniang?

449
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,640
Get rid of these onlookers.

450
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,350
Yes, sir.

451
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,760
General Niu, you may drive the people away,

452
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,040
but today's events

453
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,470
will spread throughout the city.

454
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,280
You can't silence public opinion!

455
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,950
Look this mess of yours...

456
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,280
I'll clean it up for you only this time.

457
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,230
Fire the arrows!

458
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,430
Niu Jin,

459
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,710
you abuse your power

460
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,800
and kill the innocent.

461
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,830
How could you ignore your morals and the law?

462
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,110
Oh...

463
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,590
General Niu, don't kid about that!

464
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,520
Yang Jinglan,

465
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,430
are we going to die here today?

466
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,680
I promised you

467
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,950
I'd protect you.

468
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,520
My elder sister... She's the Empress,

469
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,710
the Empress of this dynasty!

470
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,920
You... How dare you!

471
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,190
Blame those who dragged you into this.

472
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,520
Today, only your silence

473
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,800
will ensure that no one knows this secret

474
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,280
or questions morality or law.

475
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,710
The Governor is here!

476
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,190
He's here.

477
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,400
General Niu!

478
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,800
General Niu!

479
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,560
General Niu!

480
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,950
Let go of me.

481
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,830
General Niu,

482
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,400
hold on.

483
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,000
General Niu,

484
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:30,920
hold on.

485
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,310
An order from the Military Commissioner:

486
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,520
The Emperor's birthday is approaching.

487
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,230
With deep reverence for His Majesty,

488
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,040
the Military Commissioner commands the Brocade Officer

489
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,710
to oversee the creation of Shu Red Silk,

490
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,590
woven jointly by Ji Yingying, the inheritor of Shu Red,

491
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,040
and the new Brocade Master.

492
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,400
No one is permitted to interfere!

493
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,880
I accept the order!

494
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,760
General Niu,

495
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,710
perhaps it's time

496
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,830
to lower your bows.

497
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,280
A fire broke out in the mountains.

498
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,470
Mr. Yang and Chief Sang,

499
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,230
concerned for the people, went to extinguish it

500
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,430
but unfortunately perished.

501
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,590
Afterward, Governor Zhang heroically put out the fire,

502
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,520
earning the gratitude of the people.

503
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,430
However,

504
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,590
the Military Commissioner's order

505
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,640
remains unheard.

506
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,710
Doesn't that sound better?

507
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,350
General Niu,

508
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,470
I wished I could have arrived late today.

509
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,040
But think it over,

510
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,350
how did the Military Commissioner know the inheritor of Shu Red

511
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,310
was Ji Yingying

512
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,640
and not the Mr. Zhao?

513
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,590
Had I arrived late today,

514
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,040
my life would have ended.

515
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,590
But General Niu,

516
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,110
it would have been an even greater disaster

517
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,800
for you facing the Military Commissioner.

518
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,430
You prepared early

519
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,190
and acted covertly.

520
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,230
Well played, Mr. Yang.

521
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,430
Fine.

522
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,400
Since the Military Commissioner commands you to oversee the weaving,

523
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,520
make sure nothing goes wrong.

524
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,680
Otherwise, no one will be able to save you.

525
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,640
No need to trouble you, General Niu.

526
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,070
Let's hope so.

527
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,830
Let's go!

528
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,800
Father,

529
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,160
that was terrifying!

530
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,640
I thought we were done for!

531
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,920
Look at you,

532
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,280
you little rascal!

533
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,710
If you dare fool around with reckless people again,

534
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,230
I'll break your legs!

535
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,310
Today, I've seen it firsthand

536
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
how they twist truth

537
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,310
and wield unchecked power.

538
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,830
Does the Military Commissioner truly allow Niu Jin

539
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,230
to amass wealth

540
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,040
and disregard human life?

541
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,230
Niu Jin acted on his own without informing him.

542
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,710
He will surely face criticism.

543
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,110
But after all, Niu Jin is still his soldier.

544
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,590
As long as it's not rebellion,

545
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,000
he'll turn a blind eye to it.

546
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,070
What about Chang'an?

547
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,640
Will Chang'an intervene?

548
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,280
Some people want to do it,

549
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,400
but it's not easy.

550
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,350
The court and the border states

551
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,590
are intricately connected.

552
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,190
Rest assured.

553
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,640
With the Military Commissioner's order,

554
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,040
Niu Jin won't dare openly arrest you.

555
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,000
Even if he dares,

556
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,470
I won't let him succeed.

557
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,040
What about you?

558
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,230
Will they target you in secret?

559
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,430
That depends on them.

560
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,560
But whether I survive or not

561
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,710
depends on me.

562
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,040
Yang Jinglan,

563
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,400
are you afraid?

564
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,160
Are you afraid?

565
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,430
I won't regret it,

566
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,710
and I won't back down.

567
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,430
I am afraid,

568
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,430
but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

569
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,280
Fear can remind me

570
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,590
to run faster,

571
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,430
to avoid the same fate.

572
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm afraid too,

573
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,470
afraid of letting down the dead,

574
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
afraid of failing

575
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,000
to protect the living.

576
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,280
But if you stay afraid,

577
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,680
you won't run fast enough.

578
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,430
Do you want me to go inside with you

579
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,830
and explain everything to your mother?

580
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,830
My mother probably won't want anyone

581
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,110
to see her disciplining her child with a stick.

582
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,590
Miss.

583
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,640
Is she using the ruler or the bamboo cane?

584
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,040
[Beloved Husband, Ji Guinan's Memorial Tablet]

585
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:14,760
Mother,

586
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,800
it's my fault.

587
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,310
I told Yaoting to hide it from you.

588
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,070
No.

589
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,830
I wove that Shu Red Silk kite.

590
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,520
I told Yingying not to tell you.

591
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,040
Yaoting has always indulged and spoiled me.

592
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,710
No, it's my fault for failing as an elder brother.

593
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,160
What did your father

594
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,640
really die for?

595
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,880
Why was our family accused?

596
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
It was because

597
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,640
of Shu Red Silk.

598
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,880
But Father would never have forged it.

599
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,040
Father...

600
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,310
On the day you were pardoned and released,

601
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,430
what did you both promise me?

602
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,710
Ji Yingying,

603
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,800
say it.

604
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,280
That we would never bring up Father's case again,

605
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,830
and live our lives in peace.

606
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,470
But Mother,

607
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,430
even if we don't resist today,

608
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,190
can we really remain safe?

609
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,800
Yingying.

610
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:18,430
A tiger eats humans because it's hungry.

611
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,800
It won't spare someone

612
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,640
just because they're obedient.

613
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,230
Yingying!

614
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,830
Mother,

615
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,280
Yingying only wanted to prevent others

616
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,880
from misusing the Father's reputation and the Shu Red Silk.

617
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,640
She didn't mention the old case.

618
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,430
Ji Yingying,

619
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,560
didn't you?

620
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,710
Have you never thought about bringing it up?

621
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,070
All these years,

622
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,280
you've forced yourself to dye red.

623
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,640
Was it really just to support the dyehouse?

624
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:43,920
Mother,

625
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,680
can you bear to see Father carry the shame

626
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,590
and suffer injustice for life?

627
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,230
What is the first rule of our brocade workshop?

628
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,280
Recite it.

629
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,190
Recite it loudly!

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,040
[Beloved Husband, Ji Guinan's Memorial Tablet]

631
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,230
In the Ji family's brocade workshop,

632
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,230
brocade comes first, but human life is above brocade.

633
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,310
What does that mean?

634
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
In the Ji family's brocade workshop,

635
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,830
all things prioritize brocade weaving.

636
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,680
Right and wrong, grudges and fame...

637
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,920
all come after.

638
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,590
Only human life is above brocade.

639
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,230
In times of disaster,

640
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,830
save people first, then the brocade.

641
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,470
A person's life outweighs the workshop's gains and losses.

642
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,680
Good.

643
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,040
Very good.

644
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,310
What does it mean

645
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,000
that a person's life outweighs everything?

646
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,520
Tell your father,

647
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,830
what does it mean?

648
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,800
If your father were alive today,

649
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,110
what would he truly care about?

650
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,190
His reputation

651
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,000
or the safety of his children?

652
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,470
Father's love for us surpasses everything.

653
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,830
He would understand me.

654
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,920
He would allow me to do whatever I want.

655
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,000
It seems he really did spoil you

656
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,640
to the point where now,

657
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,430
you refuse to admit fault!

658
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,950
Mother,

659
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,280
I was wrong.

660
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,040
I shouldn't have hidden this from you.

661
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,880
I shouldn't have upset you.

662
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,920
But...

663
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,830
one can endure temporarily, bide their time,

664
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,800
but one cannot endure forever and lose their spirit.

665

The justice I seek,

666
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,520
I will claim for myself.

667

For everything I did today,

668
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,710
I have no regrets.

It's me, as your mother,

677
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,640
who failed to teach you well.

678

The one who needs to reflect

679

isn't you,

680
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,430
but me.

681
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,830
Mother must be utterly disappointed in me

682
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,000
to act this way, right?

683
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,830
Mother isn't heartless.

684
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,470
When Father passed away suddenly back then,

685
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,680
you were afraid of dyeing red,

686
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,400
and I was trapped in the brocade workshop.

[Beloved Husband, Ji Guinan's Memorial Tablet]

Mother has her own unresolved grief too.

00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,470
She's simply terrified

690
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,400
of losing either of us.

691
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
That's why I don't want to hide from her anymore.

693
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,800
only by facing the past

694
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,070
can we move beyond it.

I've always pitied your hardships.

698

You have a love for small gains,

699
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,520
and I've always turned a blind eye.

700
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,470
I never expected you to grow so bold,

701
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,320
daring to build an illegal brocade workshop.

702
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,390
Perhaps I've indulged you too much!

703

General,

704
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,040
there's no need for this.

705
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,120
She's just a young woman,

why make things worse for her?

707
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,520
Aren't you going to thank Governor Zhang?

708
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,040
Thank you, Governor.

709
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,430
This matter arises entirely from my foolish greed.

710
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,280
It has nothing to do with my father.

711
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,710
I beg you to discern the truth

712
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,430
and not ruin my father's name,

713
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,670
nor disgrace the Military Commissioner.

what I do is seen as what my father has done.

it reflects on the Military Commissioner.

would you believe it?

736

that you're not involved in this.

738
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,190

00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,320
believe it?

740
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,470
Will he think that you and I are complicit?

741
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,870
General, you must be joking.

742
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,430
The Military Commissioner,

743
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,230
though stationed with the army year-round,

744
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,390
is fully aware of the city's affairs.

745
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,080
He would not wrong you.

746
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,430
And what about the court?

747
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,320
How much does the court know about Yizhou

748
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,150
or the Military Commissioner?

749
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,360
If the Brocade Officer sends evidence of this matter

750
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,630
to the court,

751
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,040
it's inevitable that someone with ill intentions

752
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,910
will twist the facts

753
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,080
to slander the Military Commissioner.

754
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,080
To be honest,

00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,910
I value my reputation.

756
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,600
My forceful actions in the mountains today had personal motives,

757
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,120
but this is the root cause of it all.

758
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,120
You have deep foresight.

759
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,800
I trust the Military Commissioner will understand.

760
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,120
The Military Commissioner holds you in high regard.

761
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,470
Yizhou City is just as much yours.

762
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,190
We are all one family,

763
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,840
so it's fair for your daughter to want a share.

764
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,360
But, General,

765
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,630
why keep it from the Military Commissioner?

766
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,430
This is where you've drawn unnecessary lines.

767
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,840
I understand now.

768
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,430
From now on,

769
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,840
I will report everything to the Military Commissioner.

770
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,390
Thank you for your guidance.

771
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,190
You're too kind.

772
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,320
Guards.

773
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,230
General, you're too generous.

774
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,840
I am unworthy of such praise.

775
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,080
Rest assured, General.

776
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,870
Today's events will simply be recorded as a mountain fire,

777
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,040
nothing more.

778
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
I'll take my leave.

779
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,800
Since the Governor has spoken this way,

780
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,840
it seems the Military Commissioner still trusts you.

781
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,910
This time, I underestimated my opponent.

782
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,080
Father, please give me another chance.

783
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,000
I will definitely find evidence against Yang Jinglan.

784
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,000
You are now married into the Zhao family,

785
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,190
so focus on being a proper wife.

786
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,280
Fulfill your role as a household woman.

787
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,670
As for other matters,

788
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
don't meddle in them.

789
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,230
Father,

790
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:03,390
Yang Jinglan easily solved

791
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:05,040
the issue of the fake Shu Red Silk being sent to Chang'an.

792
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:07,120
The forces behind him must be extraordinary.

793
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,230
Don't you want to know?

794
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,630
Rather than using spies in Chang'an,

795
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,320
why not...

796
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,840
If my daughter,

797
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,190
overwhelmed by shame, were to take her own life,

798
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,840
do you think the Military Commissioner

799
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,910
would trust and sympathize with me even more?

800
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,910
Father,

801
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,470
there will always be those

802
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,950
who suspect you

803
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,760
of being ruthless

804
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,630
and silencing me.

805
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,230
Madam!

806
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,630
Madam, are you alright?

807
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,470
Just now,

808
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,000
he truly intended

809
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:04,840
to kill me...

810
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,800
Madam...

811
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,360
Please forgive me, General.

812
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,080
I arrived late.

813
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,040
How about this...

814
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,670
I'll first punish myself with a drink.

815
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,870
Do you know why I invited you here?

816
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,870
Today in the mountains,

817
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,120
you nearly took my life.

818
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,430
And now, tonight,

819
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,080
you've invited me here yourself.

820
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,150
Could it be

821
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,840
you weren't satisfied with the killings on the mountain

822
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,150
and set another trap?

823
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:03,230
You knew it was a trap and still came?

824
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,280
Mr. Yang,

825
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,670
you are bold indeed.

826
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,230
Do you know

827
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,870
why I chose to invite you here?

828
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,470
General, your rank is esteemed,

829
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,670
your experience vast.

830
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
It seems

831
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,800
this isn't merely

832
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,870
an invitation for fine wine and delicacies.

833
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,040
This restaurant's setting

834
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,760
is truly exceptional?

835
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,280
Mr. Yang, you're as sharp as ever.

836
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,800
Everyone else, leave now.

837
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
What I value

838
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,040
is the exquisite view here.

839
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,630
I've spent years fighting battles in the army,

840
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,560
always practicing force before courtesy.

841
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,670
Only when my enemies are cornered

842
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,430
can negotiations begin.

843
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,520
How generous is your courtesy?

844
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:15,120
It depends on what the people behind you

845
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,320
are aiming for.

846
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,670
I am but a lone man,

847
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,760
with no one behind me.

848
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,040
That incapable fool

849
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,320
threatened you to send Zhao Red Silk to the Crown Prince,

850
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,840
yet the Prince ultimately didn't present the silk to the Empress.

851
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,280
To influence the Crown Prince's decisions

852
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,080
without leaving a trace...

853
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,230
the people behind you are truly powerful.

854
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,840
Perhaps the Crown Prince himself felt

855
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,080
the item wasn't grand enough

856
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
and decided to replace it.
