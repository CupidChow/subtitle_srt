[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,610
[Episode 38]

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,880
The moon is finally out.

4
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's make mooncakes

5
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,080
and celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival.

6
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,040
Starting today,

7
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,920
let's all work hand in hand

8
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,120
for the brocade.

9
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,640
Whether we're in Yizhou

10
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
or Nanzhao,

11
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,080
we all look at the same moon.

12
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,720
Since we can't send our letters,

13
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,920
we shall let the moon carry our longing.

14
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,040
Let the moon carry our longing.

15
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,280
Let the moon carry our longing.

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,640
A... Alright then, let's celebrate!

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,920
If you know how to make mooncakes,

18
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,640
join me and Pin to make some.

19
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,560
If you love lanterns,

20
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,600
come to me to get one.

21
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,120
Here.

22
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,600
Alright.

23
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,440
Back home, mooncake-making

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,600
is a much more elaborate affair.

25
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,840
We have three pastry chefs just for the dough

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,120
and five chefs just for the filling.

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,480
Take the dough, for example.

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,640
It needs

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,880
to be folded 81 times.

30
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,440
Each fold

31
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,680
gets a layer of lard.

32
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,720
That is how we get that perfectly flaky and savory mooncake.

33
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,120
When we return,

34
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,040
the first thing I will do

35
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,120
is to take you home

36
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,400
to try our special mooncakes.

37
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,040
Go on.

38
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,040
A... Also the fillings...

39
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,240
The fillings

40
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,520
a... are quite generous too.

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,040
Let me say it then.

42
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,400
Shisi,

43
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,480
I like you.

44
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,600
I...

45
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,520
Can you be a little more gentle?

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,200
I...

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,760
You weren't exactly the man I would like to marry.

48
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I do not know when it all began,

49
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,720
but thoughts of you always make me smile.

50
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,400
When I feel scared,

51
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,240
I cannot help but think of your name.

52
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Sang Shisi,

53
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,040
I like you.

54
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,240
No matter what the future holds,

55
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,400
I just want to be with you.

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
Kiss me!

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,840
I can kiss you now?

58
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,680
I want you

59
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
to keep being yourself.

60
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,280
I want our encounter to be

61
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,840
like a bird finding its kin in the sky,

62
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,480
like one breeze merging with another.

63
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,640
It should make you feel happier,

64
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,080
freer,

65
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
more unrestrained,

66
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
and more vibrant.

67
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,680
But you are not just a bird,

68
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,040
nor just a breeze to me.

69
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,640
You are the moon.

70
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,800
My night has been a long one.

71
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,160
I thought I would walk it alone.

72
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,760
But at some point,

73
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,520
every time I looked up,

74
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,120
the moon was there.

75
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,880
Through the harsh storms and biting frost,

76
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,280
through its ever-changing phases,

77
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,280
it has always been there.

78
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,960
He once told me that

79
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,600
he would always have my back.

80
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
You are so sly.

81
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,120
Because I want to live.

82
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,000
Can I buy

83
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,120
one mooncake?

84
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,280
We don't sell the ones we make ourselves.

85
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,320
They are for family and friends.

86
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,560
What is this?

87
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,320
Is it for me?

88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,680
Thank you.

89
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,120
It is pretty good!

90
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,400
My master once said that Mid-Autumn Festival

91
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,200
is the perfect time to appreciate the moon

92
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,960
and think of our families.

93
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,720
What else did your master say?

94
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,880
Share it with me.

95
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,920
Well, he never said

96
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,000
that the women of Yizhou are this cunning.

97
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,760
Let me ask you. How do you find Yizhou?

98
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
To me, it is the best place.

99
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,080
I grew up there.

100
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,680
My family and friends are there.

101
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,320
If you are so curious, why don't you go see it for yourself?

102
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Who said I was curious?

103
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,760
I am not curious.

104
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,280
You wear Nanzhao's clothes,

105
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
but you study Yizhou's silk.

106
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,360
That is because you like it, and you are curious.

107
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,040
Wait! How do you know everything?

108
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,480
You...

109
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,520
Do you have some kind of Yizhou voodoo?

110
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,800
Only someone with a clear mind

111
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,120
can create such vibrant color.

112
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,800
I was raised by the people of Yizhou,

113
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,160
but in the end,

114
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
I am still the child of Nanzhao.

115
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,800
Even if I wanted to visit Yizhou, I couldn't.

116
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,160
Your clothes

117
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,720
are different from everyone else's

118
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,200
because you combined the weaving and dyeing technique

119
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,240
from Nanzhao and Yizhou.

120
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,680
Yizhou and Nanzhao do not need to always be at odds

121
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,520
or live in battle.

122
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,520
Like your clothes,

123
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,600
we can communicate, blend,

124
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,800
and become friends.

125
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,280
This is a sachet I made myself.

126
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
It repels mosquitoes.

127
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,800
It is a gift for a friend.

128
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,800
It is a gift from Yang Jinglan.

129
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
Have you seen him?

130
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,120
Where is he?

131
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
How is he doing?

132
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,160
He is still alive.

133
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,040
He asked me to pass on a message

134
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,440
to you.

135
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,720
I am safe.

136
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:50,960
Don't worry.

137
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,360
These are the mooncakes we just made.

138
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,120
All from Yizhou

139
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
will get one.

140
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,400
It's okay.

141
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,960
My entire family

142
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,480
was killed by Niu Jin.

143
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,080
There may never

144
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
be a reunion for me

145
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,600
in this lifetime.

146
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,440
Yaoting,

147
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,400
Mother,

148
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,120
please be safe.

149
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,360
Wait for me.

150
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Wait for us.

151
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,440
Yang Jinglan and I

152
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,360
will definitely return.

153
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,240
Yingying,

154
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,560
don't think it's ugly.

155
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,800
The one I gave you

156
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,200
is already the finest of the lot.

157
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
I want to tell my moon this.

158
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,960
After everything is over,

159
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,200
if he still longs to see the world,

160
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,400
then I will join him to explore its wonders.

161
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,960
Mr. Yang,

162
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,040
how is it?

163
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,840
How do you feel?

164
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,960
Who would have thought

165
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,800
Prince Bai

166
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,960
would resort to using drugs?

167
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,360
Well,

168
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,120
I know

169
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,960
torture

170
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,000
would not work on someone like you,

171
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,720
so

172
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,040
I have no choice

173
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,320
but to take a more unconventional approach

174
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
to get you to talk.

175
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
What do you want to know?

176
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,200
My plans?

177
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,000
Would you believe it

178
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,720
even if I tell you?

179
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,120
My plan...

180
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,760
...is for you...

181
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,840
...to send me away...

182
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
...by yourself...

183
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,920
Yang Jinglan,

184
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
do not forget

185
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,440
that you are now in Nanzhao.

186
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,720
No matter how you scheme,

187
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,600
you will not be able

188
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,120
to escape from my grasp.

189
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,840
Her eyes

190
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,400
should carry a hint of a smile.

191
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,520
Her wrists

192
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
should be slender

193
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,360
and delicate.

194
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,160
Let go.

195
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,600
It does not look like her at all!

196
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,200
Let go!

197
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,320
Do you feel like

198
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,360
there are millions of ants crawling all over you?

199
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,520
As if they are eating into you? Biting you?

200
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,000
There will come a day

201
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,560
when you are not able to bear the pain

202
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,760
and drink that cup of drug.

203
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,640
By then,

204
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,160
you will let go of your dignity

205
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,760
and beg me!

206
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,240
Do you think that I am

207
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,840
Zhao Xiuyuan?

208
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,360
Yes!

209
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,840
So what if I do?

210
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,600
Inside this dark, hopeless room,

211
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,200
you will only be accompanied by the drugs!

212
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,360
No matter how steely your resolve,

213
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,320
it will still shatter

214
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,440
under its own weight!

215
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,240
Mr. Yang,

216
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,200
you...

217
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,520
Take care of yourself.

218
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,520
I will

219
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,400
come and visit you in a few days.

220
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,600
Yingying,

221
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,440
do not be afraid.

222
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,720
I will think of a way out.

223
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,280
I will take you away from this place

224
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,870
and see us back to Yizhou.

225
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,360
Wait for me.

226
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,840
Ting,

227
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,120
must it be you?

228
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,400
You have always been poor with words,

229
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
never one to argue with others.

230
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
Does it truly have to be you

231
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,800
who goes to stop Niu Jin this time?

232
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,160
Mother,

233
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,800
the craftsmen have been taken,

234
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,320
and the brocade industry is in shambles.

235
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,520
Niu Jin has turned a blind eye to our suffering,

236
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,680
imposing harsh taxes to exploit us further

237
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,920
and demanding even more Shu brocade as tribute.

238
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,600
If this goes on,

239
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,720
the brocade industry will collapse entirely.

240
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,120
Someone must stand up

241
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,920
and tell him that this cannot continue.

242
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
I understand. I understand all of this!

243
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,840
But...

244
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,480
Yingying is in Nanzhao.

245
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,520
We do not know if she is safe.

246
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,720
If something happens to you tomorrow,

247
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,480
I...

248
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,320
I will protect him from the shadows.

249
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,240
No. Yuniang,

250
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,560
you must not go.

251
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
If they capture you,

252
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,760
I will lose all will

253
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,120
to do anything else.

254
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,800
Do not worry.

255
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,720
Niu Jin may be ruthless,

256
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,880
but he knows that

257
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
killing us all

258
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,760
will bring him no gain.

259
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,280
Ting,

260
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,880
you must be careful.

261
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,120
Do not worry, Mother.

262
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,520
I will wait for your return.

263
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,240
Then...

264
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,160
Let us drink to the moon, a toast for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

265
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,200
May all families be reunited

266
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,360
and safe.

267
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,200
[The Niu Residence]

268
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,000
Mr. Zhuge,

269
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,000
the Ji family's brocade has been sent in.

270
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,800
Thank you for your hard work.

271
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,480
Though we have all worked tirelessly,

272
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,800
these brocades will still fall short

273
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,280
for the tribute.

274
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,480
May I accompany Mr. Zhuge

275
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,880
to meet General Niu?

276
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
We need someone to speak out,

277
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,760
to show that trading the future of Yizhou's brocade industry

278
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,920
for short-term gains is a grave mistake.

279
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,080
To be honest,

280
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,520
Mr. Zhuge and I share the same thoughts.

281
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,400
However, before we could enter,

282
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,320
Mr. Yu Shu stopped us.

283
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,000
Mr. Yu went in alone?

284
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,840
Yes.

285
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,720
He said that as long as he is still alive,

286
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,560
this matter

287
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,480
should not be handled by us young ones.

288
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,800
Gentlemen,

289
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,320
the commander has requested your presence inside.

290
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
So Mr. Yu is implying

291
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,840
that I have demanded too much as tribute?

292
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,120
It is not that you have asked for too much,

293
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,360
but Yizhou has lost too many craftsmen,

294
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,920
and the brocade industry has been severely impacted.

295
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,080
We are unable to meet your demands at this time.

296
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,360
Good day, Commander.

297
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,080
Mr. Yu

298
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,880
was just telling me

299
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,120
that you are all facing great difficulty now.

300
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,720
You have lost craftsmen

301
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,120
and the silk prices have increased.

302
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,560
In short,

303
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,720
he suggests that

304
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,120
I have demanded too much tribute.

305
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,560
Commander,

306
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,160
they are still young

307
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,720
and lack much life experience.

308
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,480
That is why

309
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,520
they cannot foresee that

310
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,760
if this situation continues,

311
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,920
it will be like

312
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,480
killing the goose for its golden eggs.

313
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,360
It is not that we do not want to pay tribute to you.

314
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,560
In fact, we wish to offer our tribute for the long-term.

315
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,920
That is why we hope you can show mercy and grant us some respite.

316
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,720
A gentle stream never runs dry.

317
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,200
I did not ask you.

318
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,160
I was asking them.

319
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,000
What do you think?

320
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
I have checked the records.

321
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,760
Throughout history,

322
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,920
Yizhou's brocade industry has been forced to end five times.

323
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,520
Twice, it was due to war.

324
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,920
As for the other three times...

325
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
What about you two?

326
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,320
Please forgive me, Commander.

327
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,680
Even after my family gave it our all,

328
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,720
working day and night,

329
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
we were unable to meet your request.

330
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
Had it been when the industry was at its peak,

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
we might have been able to fulfill it.

332
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,440
However...

333
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
...the industry has been severely impacted,

334
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,880
and we simply cannot do it now.

335
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,040
To be honest,

336
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,680
you should all know that

337
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,160
I have many ways to make money.

338
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,680
Why would I

339
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,720
focus on Shu brocade?

340
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
It is because

341
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
when I was younger,

342
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,960
my family was very poor.

343
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,680
My parents died young,

344
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,680
and my brother and I were left to survive on our own.

345
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,960
We worked for a wealthy family together.

346
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,200
One day,

347
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,960
my brother accidentally dirtied the madam's brocade dress,

348
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,520
and he was beaten to death.

349
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,160
From that moment on,

350
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,120
I swore that

351
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,200
if I ever became rich,

352
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,520
I would clothe myself in fine brocade

353
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,560
and make the brocade industry

354
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,080
my source of entertainment.

355
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,520
Haha, alright, enough of that.

356
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,480
I was just reminiscing about the past.

357
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,720
Fine.

358
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,680
Since you all think I have asked for too much,

359
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,360
I am not an unreasonable man.

360
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,880
This will be the full tribute for this year.

361
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,080
Thank you, Commander.

362
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,720
Mr. Yu!

363
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,520
Mr. Yu!

364
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,520
I was not done speaking earlier.

365
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,000
The reason

366
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,720
I want to be dressed in fine brocade

367
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,720
is because

368
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,800
I do not tolerate those who speak against me

369
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,960
regarding it.

370
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,280
Next time, it must be no less than today's tribute.

371
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,320
And you should speak less as well.

372
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,560
Mr. Yu...

373
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,320
My family...

374
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,080
Xi...

375
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,200
Do not worry, Mr. Yu.

376
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,280
As long as we are here,

377
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,960
we will watch over the Yu family.

378
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,920
Do not be afraid.

379
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,360
There is still a long road ahead.

380
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,720
Mr. Yu!

381
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,000
This is not over.

382
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,120
We must be prepared for what's to come.

383
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,080
These are the reports

384
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,400
from the Qingping Officer.

385
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,740
[Prince Bai murdered Yizhou's Commander, Mu Hui]

386
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,200
You should have a look.

387
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,920
I did not kill Commander Mu!

388
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,800
I am being framed by Niu Jin!

389
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,880
I implore you to investigate this thoroughly.

390
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,960
Regardless of whether the accusation is true or not,

391
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,480
Mu Hui's old troops invading our borders

392
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,000
under the guise of revenge is real.

393
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,560
The whispers of the commoners

394
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,680
and their fear are real!

395
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,880
Please allow me some time

396
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,920
to get to the bottom of this

397
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,800
and uncover the truth.

398
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Your Majesty,

399
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
this cannot be delayed any longer!

400
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,160
The Tang army is directly challenging our forces,

401
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,200
claiming they will invade

402
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,160
Nanzhao's city.

403
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,120
They will treat our people

404
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,000
the same way Prince Bai treated Nanzhao's people.

405
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,520
If we wait any longer,

406
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,320
the people will begin to flee.

407
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,640
By then,

408
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
Nanzhao will descend into utter chaos.

409
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,080
The Tang army

410
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
is stirring trouble under the pretext of revenge.

411
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,760
I fear that

412
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,600
you are now in the greatest danger.

413
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,120
How about this?

414
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,000
You will move into my palace.

415
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,920
It is nestled between the mountains and the sea,

416
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,160
far from many people.

417
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,880
It is easy to defend but hard to attack.

418
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,640
I will also send troops ahead

419
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,600
to keep watch

420
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,080
day and night

421
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,160
to ensure your safety.

422
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,920
I have one more person

423
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,520
who can prove my innocence.

424
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Mu Hui's old troops!

425
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,360
There are no such people!

426
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,800
You were behind all of this!

427
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,560
Given Niu Jin's character,

428
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,080
those people are either his men now

429
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,320
or dead.

430
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,280
There cannot be so many who would come to Nanzhao

431
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,920
for revenge.

432
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,400
Indeed.

433
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,960
Why did you not tell your emperor that?

434
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,520
Because he does not see it as important.

435
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,560
He does not want

436
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,320
the truth.

437
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
He wants results.

438
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,400
What will you offer me

439
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,160
if I can stop the chaos at the borders?

440
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,600
I have two questions.

441
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,840
First,

442
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,640
how do you plan to achieve that?

443
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,560
Second,

444
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,960
who are the ones stirring up trouble

445
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,280
at the borders?

446
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,040
Give me a bowl of clean water.

447
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,640
They are just

448
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,000
some of my old friends.

449
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,160
I will tell them that

450
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,320
Niu Jin is the true mastermind behind Yizhou's situation.

451
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,400
Then, I will ask them to head to Chang'an

452
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,760
and urge the government

453
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,800
to deal with Niu Jin.

454
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,760
At this point,

455
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,760
you can only trust me.

456
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,760
Fine!

457
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,320
Tell me, then.

458
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,320
What...

459
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,560
...do you want?

460
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,200
I want to bring one person with me.

461
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,040
She has not completed her brocade.

462
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,560
She will not leave with you.

463
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,360
The root cause of this incident

464
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,360
will be decided by Chang'an.

465
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,080
Shang Shisi is the Imperial Uncle,

466
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,840
and within Chang'an,

467
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,360
his claims carry more weight than mine.

468
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,360
The things the crown prince cannot do,

469
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,360
his sister

470
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,400
and brothers can accomplish.

471
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,600
Fine.

472
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,040
I will agree to that.

473
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,960
Second.

474
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,960
I need you to write a letter

475
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,200
admitting to working with Niu Jin.

476
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,840
You can write whatever you need

477
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,960
to protect yourself,

478
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,400
but I want the government to know

479
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,760
that you had a private relationship with him.

480
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,200
Fine.

481
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,800
I can do that.

482
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,640
Third.

483
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Before I leave,

484
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,320
I want to see my wife.

485
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,000
Fourth.

486
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:02,960
Fourth?

487
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,680
Mr. Yang,

488
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,960
do you not reckon you are asking for a bit too much?

489
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,760
Fourth.

490
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,960
You are not to lay a finger on Ji Yingying for the span of one year.

491
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,880
This is not a deal between Yizhou's brocade officer

492
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,000
and Nanzhao's Prince Bai.

493
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,320
This is a deal between men.

494
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,760
Have you the courage to strike it?

495
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,360
I...

496
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,200
...promise you.

497
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,560
Uh...

498
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,160
How many times have I told you?

499
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,800
You are only supposed to put the silk in when the water is boiling.

500
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,400
Why did you put it in early again?

501
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,520
Just look at that! Does that color look right to you?

502
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,360
Are you a blockhead?

503
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,320
This is not Yizhou silk.

504
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,160
It has to be dyed using the Nanzhao method.

505
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,160
Do you not understand that? Or are you hard of hearing

506
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,200
or are you just a moron?

507
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,520
I am not a moron! And I am not hard of hearing!

508
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,640
Shu brocade! It's Shu brocade!

509
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,800
Of course you have to dye it using the Shu method!

510
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,400
You are making Nanzhao brocade

511
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,360
with Nanzhao silk!

512
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,400
You must follow Nanzhao's methods!

513
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,440
Does Nanzhao even have any decent silk or brocade?

514
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,400
- Use the Nanzhao method? - Of course, there is! I dyed it myself!

515
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,720
I make fine silk!

516
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,960
I take excellent care of those silkworms!

517
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,440
Please do not argue.

518
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,200
I have just designed a new pattern.

519
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,400
It will need

520
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,120
both Shu and Nanzhao colors.

521
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,160
Perhaps you both can give it a try

522
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,280
and let the results speak for themselves.

523
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,030
Deal!

524
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,200
Just you wait!

525
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,080
I will show you the difference

526
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,560
between true craftsmen and blockheads.

527
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:14,950
Blockhead!

528
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,920
Hey!

529
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,160
Yingying, look at that despicable Nanzhao woman!

530
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:21,920
I tried so hard to be polite

531
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,720
and chivalrous!

532
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,240
Look!

533
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,360
This is an exchange of techniques.

534
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,160
A few arguments are to be expected.

535
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,600
Fine.

536
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,560
I will engage in a constructive exchange with her.

537
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,160
Yingying,

538
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,950
can we work together on the brocade?

539
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,560
Sure.

540
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,680
We can leave the past behind for now.

541
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,990
Let's focus on the brocade so we can return home.

542
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,960
I will get back to designing the new pattern.

543
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,520
Thank you.

544
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,720
Ms. Ji,

545
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,240
someone is asking for you.

546
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,560
This way, please.

547
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,760
I said I would let you see her,

548
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,840
but I never said

549
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,800
how you would go about it.

550
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,600
