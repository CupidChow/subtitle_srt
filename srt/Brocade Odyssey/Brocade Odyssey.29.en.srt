[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 29]

3
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,480
But there are pros and cons.

4
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,200
The clan system of the Yang family

5
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,440
has lasted so long

6
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,480
that it has begun to slow down and corrupt.

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,440
Now, compared to taking money from outsiders,

8
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,360
the uncles seem more willing

9
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,880
to take money from their relatives.

10
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,960
How dare you tell me all this?

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,440
Aren't you afraid I'll punish you?

12
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,160
Isn't this exactly what you wanted me to see?

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,360
When did you find out?

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,470
You knew there would be a dispute with the elders

15
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,120
if I attended the banquet,

16
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,080
but you still let me go.

17
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,880
You blamed me for opposing Second Uncle,

18
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
yet gave me the shop

19
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,280
and gave me the foundation to confront him.

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,800
And through the sample brocade incident,

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,720
you made me see the flaws in the Yang family's system.

22
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,160
Even Jin Xiu,

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,360
that particularly well-mannered maid,

24
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,080
was deliberately arranged by you, wasn't it?

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,640
So,

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,760
what do you think

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,920
I arranged all of this for?

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,040
You need me,

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,280
like a knife,

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,120
to cut through the corruption

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,040
and rebuild the Yang family.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,640
Since you invited me,

33
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,560
you must have a plan.

34
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,320
To change the Yang family,

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,080
we first need to understand

36
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,960
what is trapping the Yang family.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,120
Uncles! You have arrived early.

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,840
I came late.

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,960
Well then,

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,920
I'll start by punishing myself with a drink.

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,240
Good!

42
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,720
See?

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,960
What did I say?

44
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,360
He wouldn't be wearing official attire!

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,720
So, the one who comes today

46
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,560
is our nephew, Yang Jinglan,

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
not Inspector Yang.

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
Jinglan,

49
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
you've been away for years,

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,040
and you've forgotten the rules.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,440
How could you send someone

52
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,800
to inspect our Yang family's accounts?

53
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,000
But,

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,800
considering you've been away for so many years,

55
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,400
we won't hold it against you

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,240
or question you at the ancestral hall.

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,560
Let's clear the air here

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,680
at the dinner table.

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,680
Oh,

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,680
what rule of our family

61
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,240
have I broken by inspecting the accounts?

62
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,040
The Yang family rule, Article 34:

63
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,070
No in-fighting within the family.

64
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,880
No mixing of insiders and outsiders.

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,760
No short-sighted actions

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,390
that harm long-term interests.

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,000
The Yang family rule, Article 41:

68
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,600
All Yang family shops,

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,280
all products, personnel, and accounts

70
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,040
are under the management of the steward.

71
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,080
No private circulation

72
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,880
or probing into secrets.

73
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
Fifth Uncle, you really have a good memory,

74
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,880
but I didn't understand a word of it.

75
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,960
Perhaps Second Uncle, you can help me clarify?

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,400
Yang Jinglan!

77
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,120
Stop pretending to be confused.

78
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,280
Today, we uncles invited you here

79
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,800
to give you face.

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080
If you don't want this face,

81
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,640
we'll question you at the ancestral hall!

82
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,200
I'll ask my good brother and sister-in-law

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,080
how they plan to punish you,

84
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,720
this ungrateful child.

85
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,120
I'll let them teach you

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,040
what the Yang family's rules really mean!

87
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Clan members aren't scary,

88
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
but what's tricky

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,400
is the knife in their hands,

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,920
the Yang family's rules.

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,560
So, to change the Yang family,

92
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,680
the best method

93
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,320
is to establish new rules and regulations

94
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,200
and return power to proper and reasonable rules

95
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,200
rather than relying on seniority and bloodlines.

96
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,560
Since you uncles

97
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,360
have already said this much,

98
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,600
I'll also share my thoughts with everyone.

99
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,520
I inspected the accounts

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,400
because I have a personal interest.

101
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,760
The Crown Prince

102
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,960
wants to secretly buy some Shu brocade.

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,760
When the Crown Prince buys things,

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,320
even in private,

105
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,000
he still needs to investigate the source thoroughly.

106
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,520
I just happen to be in Yizhou,

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,320
so the Crown Prince entrusted me

108
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,040
with this inspection task.

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,800
Now, which family should I choose?

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,960
Jinglan, if you really have this intention,

111
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,680
why not just say it directly?

112
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,880
How should I say it?

113
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,920
What should I say?

114
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,040
Should I say,

115
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,880
I'm a member of the Yang family,

116
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,680
so they should just buy Yang Brocade?

117
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,720
That doesn't seem appropriate.

118
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,880
Actually,

119
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,560
I've already thought of an excuse.

120
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,280
I'll tell the Crown Prince

121
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,960
that I'm not on good terms with the Yang family,

122
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,840
that the inspection is just to vent my personal grievances.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
But once we check,

124
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,360
we find everything seems fine,

125
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,480
and the brocade is good.

126
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,880
Then, since I value family ties,

127
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,760
I'll naturally recommend our Yang Brocade.

128
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
If that's the case,

129
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,480
then continue with your plan.

130
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,760
No, that's not possible.

131
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,360
The Yang family has its rules.

132
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,960
I'm not qualified to inspect.

133
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,280
Jinglan,

134
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,200
the Crown Prince doesn't know the Yang family's rules after all.

135
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,280
He's your Eleventh Uncle.

136
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,920
Eleventh Uncle,

137
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,360
you've never been in office,

138
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,920
so naturally, you don't understand.

139
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,520
This matter

140
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,720
will need to be reviewed.

141
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,080
When the time comes,

142
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,440
someone from Chang'an will come down to cross-check,

143
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,280
and once they know about this rule of the Yang family,

144
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,720
they'll ask

145
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,560
and say...

146
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,240
You...

147
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,120
"You say you've inspected the Yang family's shop,

148
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,840
but did the Yang family's rules allow you to inspect?"

149
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,720
I...

150
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,840
"You didn't check at all, yet falsely reported that you did,

151
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,480
or did the Yang family's rules change?"

152
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,560
Jinglan,

153
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,120
as long as the rules change,

154
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,000
it will...

155
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
Just kidding.

156
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
How could the Yang family's rules change?

157
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,040
If you're sure

158
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,440
that the Crown Prince

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,600
will definitely buy Yang Brocade...

160
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,800
As long as no family has any issues.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,880
Fine.

162
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,280
Fifth Brother, what do you mean by that?

163
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Everyone,

164
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
I think since Jinglan is doing this

165
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
for the Yang family's good,

166
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,560
then we must do our part

167
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,040
to protect the Yang family's reputation.

168
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,440
I suggest

169
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,560
we add another clause

170
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,040
to the forty-first rule:

171
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,280
If mutual investigation benefits the Yang family,

172
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,400
then we can discuss it as needed.

173
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,760
What do you think?

174
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
It's not possible!

175
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,840
That's a rule passed down from our ancestors,

176
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,800
and it cannot be changed!

177
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,200
Fifth Uncle,

178
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,080
I seem to recall

179
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,200
that our family has a rule,

180
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,440
something like

181
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,160
"If opinions differ,

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,800
the minority must follow the majority."

183
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,080
Yes, there is such a rule!

184
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,240
Here,

185
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,760
if you agree to add one more clause,

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
let's all drink to this.

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,400
All right.

188
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Second Uncle.

189
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,640
Second Brother!

190
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,520
See?

191
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,600
Doesn't it seem like the Yang family is united?

192
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,640
Then let's

193
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,480
change

194
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,120
the rule.

195
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,800
Let's change it!

196
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,360
You see,

197
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,640
the rules can be changed eventually.

198
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,200
But how can you be sure

199
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,160
that your new rules will be better than the old ones?

200
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm not sure,

201
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,600
that's why we need to try.

202
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,280
I've already organized the Yang family's

203
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,560
brocade-related rules,

204
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,360
and I'll go through them with everyone.

205
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,000
We will prioritize revising and improving

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
the three most important ones.

207
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,160
These will be implemented first in the Bloom Society and Ji's Brocade Workshop.

208
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,080
I want you to witness this with us, Madam.

209
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,000
So, you're not trying to change the Yang family,

210
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,360
but the brocade industry.

211
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,680
What I want to reform

212
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
are all the unreasonable rules.

213
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,200
If this attempt is successful,

214
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,440
would you allow me to try it in the Yang family as well?

215
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,480
Or perhaps,

216
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,400
would you dare to take a gamble?

217
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,040
Jin Xin.

218
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,120
Madam.

219
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,200
Bring the wine.

220
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,560
I want to have a good drink

221
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,800
with my business partner.

222
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:29,640
[Ji's Brocade Workshop is Hiring Weavers]

223
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,440
Everyone,

224
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
you needn't worry about us faking anything.

225
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,160
These terms will all be written into the contract.

226
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,160
Those who wish to work at Ji's Brocade Workshop,

227
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,040
please come inside to sign the contract.

228
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,840
There's been a lot of talk lately about your new rules.

229
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
They say they want to teach you a lesson.

230
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,040
But no one has dared to come forward yet.

231
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,960
They're waiting.

232
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,600
In their eyes,

233
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,160
I have always been rebellious,

234
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,800
but only after profit.

235
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,000
Some people are just waiting to see

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,080
if this really has any benefits.

237
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,880
If it does,

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,360
they'll use it sooner or later.

239
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,280
For businessmen,

240
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,440
profit is always the top priority.

241
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,000
And then, some people

242
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,360
are probably waiting for the Yang family clan

243
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,400
to teach me a lesson.

244
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,440
You look really good.

245
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,680
But who are you dressing up for?

246
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,400
Women dress up to please those who love them.

247
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
This makeup

248
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,000
is naturally for you to see.

249
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,400
What if I didn't come today?

250
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,760
So, I wait here every day,

251
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,680
thinking that one day,

252
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,160
you will need me.

253
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
For example, during festivals.

254
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,160
Sometimes it's necessary

255
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,880
for me, the Lady Zhao, to make an appearance.

256
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,280
Or, for example,

257
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,560
when my father suddenly remembers me

258
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
and wants to see me.

259
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,800
You Niu family members,

260
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,440
truly have strong willpower.

261
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,600
Even in such adversity,

262
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
you can endure and bide your time.

263
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,160
Now that you have finally agreed to meet me,

264
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,360
it must be for something important.

265
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,160
I've heard that you stayed in Chang'an for a while

266
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,000
and made many influential friends.

267
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,120
Are you planning to bring the Zhao family's business

268
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,640
to Chang'an?

269
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,040
Chang'an is actually a place that brings me sorrow.

270
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,760
My second husband

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,480
died there.

272
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,200
Naturally,

273
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,680
I'm willing to serve faithfully,

274
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,760
but...

275
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,960
I know what you're thinking.

276
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,000
Yu Yuan is not dead.

277
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,000
If I could sell her,

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,480
I can definitely buy her back.

279
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,880
If you continue to be stubborn,

280
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,600
you will eventually learn her fate.

281
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,840
Yu Yuan,

282
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,200
I will definitely save you.

283
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,040
Since you left home,

284
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,440
your father has been drawing your portrait every year

285
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,040
based on his imagination,

286
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,760
and sending people to look for you.

287
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,440
Later, when the Yang family went on trade journeys,

288
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,840
it was always your father leading the team.

289
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,960
He hoped to encounter you.

290
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,440
Every year, he copied scriptures and prayed for your safety.

291
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,160
Even if you didn't return,

292
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,960
he still wanted you to be safe.

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,120
Madam is not showing you this to persuade you.

294
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,360
She just wants to tell you

295
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,360
that those who have passed are gone,

296
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,960
and the living

297
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,760
should cherish those in front of them,

298
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,520
so they won't regret it later.

299
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm just here to deliver a message.

300
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,080
Whatever decision you make, I'll support you.

301
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,840
Thank you, dear.

302
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,600
No matter what decision I make, you'd support me?

303
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,600
Good.

304
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,040
Come on.

305
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,760
Yang Jinglan,

306
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,360
what are you doing?

307
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,440
Put me down!

308
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,960
I still have things to do!

309
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,040
I have things to do too.

310
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,800
I have important matters.

311
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,040
I have important matters too.

312
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,040
This road is hard to travel.

313
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
Watch your step.

314
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,080
Yang Jinglan, let me tell you,

315
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,320
although only three rules have been changed so far,

316
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,480
my brother and Mr. Yu said

317
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,040
the workers are indeed more motivated,

318
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,520
and things are getting done faster.

319
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,240
But the reward and punishment system

320
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,120
has also caused some jealousy

321
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,080
among the workers,

322
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,480
and it still needs improvement.

323
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,280
No rush, we'll take it slow.

324
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,480
By the way,

325
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
last time you told the clan

326
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,680
that the Crown Prince wanted to buy Yang Brocade.

327
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,320
If the Crown Prince finds out,

328
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,640
won't he punish you?

329
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,800
No, he won't.

330
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,920
As long as I don't break the law or the public's trust,

331
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,240
he'll let me use his name.

332
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,480
But this method can't be used too often.

333
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,760
We must rely

334
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,200
on our own rules soon.

335
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,640
Are you tired?

336
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,640
I'll carry you.

337
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,400
Okay.

338
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,600
Come on.

339
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,400
No need.

340
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,920
This is my first time coming to see Ta Xue.

341
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,120
I need to show sincerity.

342
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,440
And I also need to get used to it,

343
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,600
because I'll come here with you often.

344
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,000
Fine.

345
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,000
Let's go.

346
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,520
Take care.

347
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:21,400
Ta Xue,

348
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,920
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,200
[Ta Xue's Grave]
I finally had time to come see you today.

350
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,440
Thank you for traveling thousands of miles

351
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,320
to bring him back and save me.

352
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,440
I heard this is the kind of leaf

353
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,120
you liked to eat the most.

354
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,520
This time, please make do with these.

355
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
When I come again,

356
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,960
I'll plant a tree

357
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,720
like this nearby for you,

358
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,240
so that you can eat fresh leaves every day.

359
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,600
How is it, buddy?

360
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,600
She's a good person, isn't she?

361
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,080
Not to mention thousands of miles,

362
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,040
even if it's millions of miles,

363
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,520
it's worth coming back to marry her.

364
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,520
The picture I promised to draw for you

365
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,800
has already been done.

366
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,040
Now, take a good look at it.

367
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,360
See

368
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
if I missed anything.

369
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,560
These are all the places you and Ta Xue

370
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,840
have been together?

371
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,840
That's right.

372
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,240
Chang'an, Jiangnan,

373
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,840
the Northern Desert,

374
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,280
and the coastline...

375
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,240
No wonder you are so calm and composed now.

376
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,760
The path you've walked

377
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,800
has become a part of you.

378
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,600
In the future, I'll take you along.

379
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
I also want to bring my Shu brocade with me.

380
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,880
I want the whole world to know its beauty.

381
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,680
I want to sell it to Jiangnan,

382
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
sell it to the Northern Desert,

383
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,840
sell it to Tubo,

384
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
sell it to India,

385
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,920
sell it to Nanzhao,

386
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
sell it everywhere I can reach!

387
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,080
Dear,

388
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,920
you even want to sell it to Nanzhao?

389
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,120
Sure.

390
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,040
I've seen foreign merchants in Fan City.

391
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,880
They really love Shu brocade,

392
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,240
and they love everything

393
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
from Tang, from Yizhou.

394
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,240
I feel honored by that.

395
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,600
If trade routes are opened in the future,

396
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,240
and formal and mature trade relations are established,

397
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,440
private transactions will decrease.

398
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,040
No one

399
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,920
will be innocently harmed anymore.

400
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,600
And also,

401
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,320
the beauty of Shu brocade

402
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,320
should not be confined to a small place.

403
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,920
Yang Jinglan,

404
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,840
once I help Madam reform the Yang family,

405
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,680
I will take the Shu brocade out with me.

406
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,840
I want to see the world,

407
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,800
and let the world see me.

408
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,720
Alright, then when the time comes,

409
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,200
I'll accompany you

410
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,720
to see the world,

411
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,640
and let the world see you.

412
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,110
[Chang'an]

413
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,680
Long time no see,

414
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,080
yet you still remember me

415
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,640
and are willing to grace me

416
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,760
with your presence.

417
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,640
I'll raise a glass to all of you.

418
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,080
Especially you, Mrs. Zheng,

419
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,600
I'm grateful for the care

420
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,480
you showed me back then.

421
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
The one sitting in the center is Mrs. Zheng.

422
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,800
Her mother is close to several princesses,

423
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,120
and the princesses trust her judgment.

424
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,400
She and her mother take pride

425
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,640
in influencing the fashion of Chang'an's women.

426
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,640
Apart from her,

427
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,840
all the ladies invited to this banquet

428
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,080
are the prominent and respectable women

429
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,160
in Chang'an.

430
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,680
You're also a woman of misfortune.

431
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,480
You didn't have a good life in Chang'an.

432
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,720
Look at these women,

433
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,520
they seem warm,

434
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,400
but in reality, they're here to watch her downfall.

435
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,680
They all want to see

436
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,560
how fallen Niu Wuniang is now.

437
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
If I'd known earlier, I would've stopped you.

438
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,640
What's a merchant compared to you?

439
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,680
Even if this is your third marriage,

440
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,040
he doesn't deserve

441
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,600
a noble lady like you.

442
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,000
Indeed.

443
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,840
He didn't hit you, did he?

444
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,720
What are you saying?

445
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,240
I told you not to bring up her sad past.

446
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,920
It's fine.

447
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,520
You are just concerned about me.

448
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,840
My current husband treats me very well.

449
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,440
He is the Brocade Master of Yizhou,

450
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,040
and his Zhao family is a prominent brocade-dyeing family.

451
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,240
Shu brocade? The Zhao family?

452
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
My dear,

453
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,240
were you fooled?

454
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,680
The fine clothes and goods of the nobles in Chang'an

455
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,400
are all made from Yang Brocade.

456
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,440
When have you ever heard of Zhao Brocade?

457
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,120
Indeed.

458
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,200
Our family's matriarch

459
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,480
has always bought Yang Brocade.

460
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,240
Mrs. Zheng's outfit today is made

461
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,600
from Yang Brocade.

462
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,480
That's truly worth its weight in gold.

463
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,240
Well,

464
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,640
this was a gift from my husband.

465
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,240
I couldn't bear to buy it myself.

466
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,200
Why are you bringing up this in front of Wuniang?

467
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,480
Wuniang,

468
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,840
don't be too upset.

469
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,600
Although my outfit

470
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
is more valuable than yours,

471
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,440
that doesn't mean your husband doesn't love you.

472
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,520
It's just that the Yang Brocade

473
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
really has no equal.

474
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,280
No,

475
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,680
what I meant was, the Zhao Brocade is also fine.

476
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,360
Stop!

477
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,120
How dare you!

478
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,920
Dancers like you

479
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,240
dares to wear the same clothes

480
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,520
as the noble ladies?

481
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,920
Since we're performing dances for you ladies today,

482
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,520
we've specially changed into new dance outfits.

483
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,000
We didn't mean to offend you, Madam.

484
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Please forgive us!

485
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,520
It seems not only does Mrs. Zheng love the Yang Brocade,

486
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,800
but even the songstress and dancers in Chang'an

487
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,480
really love it too.

488
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,720
You've deliberately set this up

489
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,880
to embarrass me!

490
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
That's ridiculous.

491
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Yang Brocade is everywhere in the streets now.

492
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,080
How could I have deliberately done this?

493
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,240
That's true.

494
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,840
Mrs. Zheng, this Yang Brocade with the phoenix pattern

495
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,120
is only ten wen per inch

496
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,160
on the market now.

497
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,280
Only ten wen?

498
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,000
Isn't that the price of regular fabric?

499
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,920
Sir,

500
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,440
that's Shu brocade, which is worth its weight in gold!

501
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,480
Should we

502
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
really do this?

503
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,960
The Yang family's reputation in Chang'an

504
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,440
has been built up over time.

505
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
It wasn't achieved overnight.

506
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,040
Let me ask you,

507
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,080
would you trade fifty rolls of brocade

508
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,840
for the Yang family's years of foundation

509
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,840
and reputation?

510
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,240
Do you think it's worth it or not?

511
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,800
I have a narrow view.

512
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,880
You have deeper foresight, sir.

513
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,960
You may not know,

514
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,240
but ever since the Yang family lost the title of Brocade Master,

515
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,280
to recover from the losses,

516
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,120
they had to sell at low prices

517
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,640
and mass-produce.

518
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,080
If you

519
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,240
still take pride in Yang Brocade,

520
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,400
you'll find yourself

521
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,240
facing

522
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,520
many troublesome issues in the future.

523
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,880
You...

524
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,240
But Zhao Brocade is different.

525
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
The Zhao family is the Brocade Master of Yizhou.

526
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,120
We focus on excellence,

527
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,880
tailoring each piece for the nobles of Chang'an.

528
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,280
Each batch of brocade

529
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,240
is woven by the best artisans

530
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,680
in the Zhao family.

531
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,120
From raw silk to the finished brocade,

532
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,320
all overseen by my husband personally.

533
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,440
Most importantly,

534
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,080
Zhao Brocade

535
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,680
can only be worn by those worthy of it.

536
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,280
In my view,

537
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,880
Zhao Brocade is superior to Yang Brocade.

538
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,280
What do you think?

539
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,600
I think

540
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,040
it's really quite good.

541
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,760
Since Wuniang has brought us

542
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
such beautiful Shu brocade,

543
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,520
let's all raise a toast to Wuniang.

544
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,320
Come on!

545
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,440
Let's raise a toast to Wuniang.

546
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,920
Mrs. Zheng knew I'd been scheming against her.

547
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,720
She was willing to cooperate

548
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,320
because every time I use her,

549
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,360
she gets great benefits.

550
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,800
So,

551
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,560
you must bring her a heavy gift.

552
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,000
If she accepts it,

553
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,040
then it's settled.

554
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,280
If she can get her mother

555
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,320
to say a few words in front of the princess,

556
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,160
the Yang family is finished.

557
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,160
Stop drinking.

558
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,840
Take Madam back to rest.

559
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,480
Yes.

560
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,520
No need.

561
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,720
I want to sit for a while longer.

562
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,600
Back then, Yu Yuan and I

563
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,360
loved visiting this inn.

564
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,160
Every time my beast of a husband

565
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,640
beat me,

566
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,960
the two of us

567
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,520
would run here for a big feast.

568
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,680
We'd eat

569
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,160
and laugh.

570
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,080
No one was allowed to cry.

571
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,600
Since the day I was born,

572
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I've never felt a shred of love.

573
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,320
My mother doesn't acknowledge me.

574
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,960
My father despises me because I'm a girl.

575
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,360
He only wanted to marry me off

576
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,240
to gain benefits for himself.

577
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,960
My husband doesn't even treat me like a human.

578
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,560
Only Yu Yuan's presence

579
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,840
made me feel warmth and love.

580
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,000
Now that Yu Yuan is no longer by my side,

581
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,720
my life feels

582
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,240
like it's fallen into an abyss again.

583
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,680
Zhao Xiuyuan,

584
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,200
I'm tired.

585
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,840
Once this matter is over,

586
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,960
return Yu Yuan to me,

587
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,920
and we'll be square.

588
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,560
Fine.

589
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,210
[Yizhou]

590
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,000
Didn't I send word

591
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,600
asking you to stay a few more days at Ji's house

592
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,880
and come back later?

593
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,240
Mr. Jingshan,

594
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,000
we are also part of the Yang family.

595
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,960
We want to solve the problems in Chang'an too.

596
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,960
They're not aiming to solve the problems in Chang'an.

597
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,440
They're aiming to deal with you.

598
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,200
Then we need to come back and take a look.

599
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,800
Yang Jinglan,

600
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,200
do you want to repeat the mistakes I made back then?

601
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,960
Yang Jingshan,

602
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,680
my wife came here today

603
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,200
to help the Yang family out of trouble.

604
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,480
Besides, when has the Yang family ever controlled me?

605
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,000
Dear,

606
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,160
let's go.

607
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,840
Dear,

608
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,400
stay calm.

609
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,120
Ji Yingying,

610
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,480
before the family discipline, kneel down!

611
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,600
Second Uncle, if you want to enforce family discipline,

612
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,160
there needs to be a reason.

613
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,600
A reason?

614
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,360
You provoked the Zhao family,

615
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,400
and now Zhao Xiuyuan has ruined

616
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,280
our reputation in Chang'an,

617
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,120
causing so much of our goods

618
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,280
to pile up unsold,

619
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,400
and our connections to be damaged.

620
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,080
Isn't this crime enough

621
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,200
to expel you from the Yang family?

622
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,640
You couldn't sell your goods,

623
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,080
but you blamed others for it.

624
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,000
Is this how the Yang family's discipline

625
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,760
has turned you all into?

626
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,000
In my view,

627
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,000
the Yang family's discipline is worthless!

628
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Yang Jinglan!

629
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,280
Don't talk nonsense here.

630
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,800
If you look down on the family discipline,

631
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,200
I'll expel you from the Yang family too,

632
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,800
and also remove your mother's ancestral tablet

633
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,640
from the ancestral hall!

634
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,560
Master,

635
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,000
stay calm.

636
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Since it's come to this,

637
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,200
I can't do anything about it.

638
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,600
Yang Juli,

639
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,280
the thing I hate most is when someone

640
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,800
uses my mother to threaten me.

641
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,840
Today,

642
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,680
I'm making it clear here:

643
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,400
if anyone dares to touch my mother's tablet,

644
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,920
I'll make them

645
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,000
apologize to my mother face to face!

646
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,600
Dear,

647
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,680
do you think this will work?

648
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,680
Yes.

649
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,240
You unfilial descendant!

650
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,680
How dare you threaten your elders?

651
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,400
Someone,

652
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,600
punish this troublemaker, Ji Yingying,

653
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,480
according to the family discipline!

654
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,360
Who dares!

655
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,240
You...

656
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,840
Juxian!

657
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,640
Stop!

658
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,360
Stop it!

659
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,840
What position do you hold in the Yang family?

660
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,200
Second.

661
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,600
I'm still here!

662
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,840
Don't interfere. Go stand aside.

663
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,760
I failed to protect you and your mother back then,

664
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,640
that was my incompetence.

665
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,800
If I can't even protect a tablet today,

666
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,000
then what kind of family head am I?

667
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,600
I might as well die!

668
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,720
All the relatives,

669
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,680
I've gathered you here today

670
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,880
to solve the problem,

671
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,880
not to shirk responsibility!

672
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,040
If you have something to say, speak.

673
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,200
If not,

674
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,480
please leave.

675
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,800
Did you all hear that?

676
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,960
- Yes. - Did you hear that?

677
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,560
Our eldest brother has a bad temper!

678
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,400
But he's the family head.

679
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,040
As the second brother,

680
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,560
I have no right to say anything.

681
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,160
I just feel sorry.

682
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,440
What are we going to do

683
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,600
with our family's reputation

684
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,240
and all this unsold stock?

685
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,960
Right!

686
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,560
Yang family rule, Article 81:

687
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,520
If the family head cannot

688
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,080
shoulder the responsibility,

689
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,150
then a resolution may be made to relieve him.

690
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:10,760
Right.

691
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,040
Seems like there is such a rule.

692
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,440
Nonsense!

693
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,630
Master.

694
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,920
The family head hasn't said

695
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,760
he won't handle the troubles in Chang'an.

696
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,400
And now, you're just taking advantage of the situation.

697
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,280
Will this sound good if it spreads?

698
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,840
My own brothers probably won't

699
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,670
want to have any dealings

700
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,440
with a family like this.

701
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,600
Family head,

702
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,600
how do you plan to manage this?

703
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,560
Didn't Jinglin already go to Chang'an to mediate?

704
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,230
Tomorrow, I'll go there with Jingshan too.

705
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,800
As long as the connections are there,

706
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,000
the reputation will be restored eventually.

707
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,080
It's easy to ruin a reputation,

708
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,400
but it's hard to rebuild it!

709
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,560
Exactly.

710
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,400
Right now, the most urgent matter is,

711
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,600
what to do with this batch of goods

712
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,760
we just finished?

713
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,280
What should we do?

714
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,960
I owe money outside.

715
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm counting on selling this batch to clear the debts!

716
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,080
I see, the family head

717
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,440
can no longer manage this.

718
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,240
That's right.

719
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,080
Who said that?

720
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,520
The family head has ordered me

721
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,800
to sell this brocade without losing a single coin.

722
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,200
What? Sell it?

723
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,440
Sell it?

724
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,000
Sell it where?

725
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,840
There's no need for you to worry.

726
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,240
According to the rules, we'll first take a deposit,

727
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,880
and the remaining amount will be paid in two months.

728
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,400
Jingshan,

729
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,960
take the relatives

730
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,640
to collect the deposit.

731
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,240
Yes.

732
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,080
Everyone, this way please.

733
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,440
No,

734
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,680
wait!

735
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,800
This is clearly just a stalling tactic!

736
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
Ji Yingying

737
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,880
is full of tricks

738
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,600
and poison behind the scenes.

739
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,760
You still believe her?

740
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,960
Yang Juli!

741
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,160
Her words are my words.

742
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,040
If you're selling,

743
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,600
go collect the deposit.

744
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,400
If not, get out!

745
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,160
I don't have time for your nonsense.

746
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,640
Fine!

747
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,400
You're the eldest brother.

748
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,560
I'll listen to you.

749
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,160
But if the remaining payment isn't received in two months,

750
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,600
who will take responsibility?

751
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,360
Right.

752
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,720
Naturally, the family head will be responsible!

753
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,040
Did you all hear that?

754
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,880
Heard it.

755
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,800
Did you hear that?

756
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,440
Those who contribute to the Yang family

757
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,760
are never treated unfairly.

758
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,120
Yingying,

759
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,360
if this succeeds,

760
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,000
you'll have a seat

761
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,880
in the council hall.

762
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,160
It's settled!

763
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,760
Fine.

764
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Jingshan, take me to collect the deposit.

765
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,880
- Let's go get the money! - This way.

766
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,560
Let's go!

767
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,240
Yingying,

768
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,760
you've always planned carefully before taking action.

769
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,840
Since you've spoken up today,

770
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,600
do you really have a solution?

771
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,360
Thank you, Sir, Madam, for trusting

772
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,640
and supporting me.

773
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,560
I do indeed have an idea.

774
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,360
I want to leverage Yizhou's geographic advantage

775
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,800
to open foreign trade routes

776
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,200
and truly break the stalemate.

777
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
Open trade routes?

778
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,720
Since the nobles of Chang'an

779
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,440
are temporarily blinded,

780
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,280
we might as well sell the brocade elsewhere.

781
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
Let them see,

782
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,240
no matter how much they slander us,

783
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,680
our Yang family's brocade

784
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,280
will always be worth its weight in gold.

785
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,200
Moreover,

786
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,080
if the trade routes are opened,

787
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,000
not only can this batch of brocade be sold,

788
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,880
but more orders will come in,

789
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,200
truly opening up Yang family's market.

790
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,000
It's true that foreigners also love Shu brocade,

791
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,800
but the foreign business we know

792
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,200
has already been divided up.

793
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,520
That's why

794
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,600
we need to take a path no one has taken before.

795
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,840
Starting from Yizhou,

796
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,400
heading southwest to Tubo,

797
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,080
sacred lands and hidden realms are everywhere.

798
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,800
All are business opportunities.

799
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,000
No.

800
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,240
You can't go.

801
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,680
That route is extremely dangerous,

802
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,360
plagued by natural disasters and human threats.

803
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,880
You can't go.

804
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,560
It's fine. I'll go with her.

805
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,760
I'll make sure she's safe.

806
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,880
So it'll be safe just because you're going?

807
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,000
Are you a deity?

808
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,920
Or can you carve out roads from mountains?

809
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,280
Don't you know people in Chang'an?

810
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,040
Sell the goods to them.

811
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,360
Bring the brocade

812
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,080
and go to Chang'an with me.

813
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,080
Sir,

814
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,080
the brocade can be sold

815
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,480
no matter what,

816
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,000
but restoring the Yang family's reputation

817
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,560
cannot be achieved overnight.

818
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,080
By opening trade routes

819
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,520
from the outside,

820
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,480
the Yang family's reputation will also be restored.

821
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,240
This is the best,

822
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,120
and the only way for our family.

823
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,080
Whether it works or not,

824
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,600
we must give it a try.

825
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,400
In your eyes,

826
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,520
is business more important than life?

827
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,600
I have no other talents.

828
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,600
Only by succeeding in business

829
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,720
can I protect the people I care about,

830
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,480
so they can live long and worry-free.

831
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,200
Yingying has always dared to lead the way.

832
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,560
I trust her,

833
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,320
and I trust Jinglan to protect her.

834
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,320
This isn't as simple as you make it sound.

835
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,320
Don't worry, Father.

836
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,480
How can I not worry...

837
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,200
What did you just call me?

838
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,680
What did you call me?

839
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,120
If you didn't hear, forget it.

840
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,360
No,

841
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,560
I heard!

842
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
Can't you say it again?

843
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,520
You'd better

844
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,720
bring her back in one piece.

845
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,720
Otherwise,

846
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,480
I'll break your legs.

847
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,200
You're rambling.

848
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,120
Don't worry.

849
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,040
Fine.

850
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,800
Then let's each prepare.

851
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,240
I'll go to Chang'an with Jingshan.

852
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,240
I'll stay in Yizhou to mediate.

853
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,680
I'll prepare the map and documents with Jinglan.

854
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,040
Alright.

855
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,120
Remember,

856
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,240
safety comes first.

857
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,870
[Yuebuhuan Inn]

858
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,040
How come you're so exhausted?

859
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,320
Did the Yang family force you into labor?

860
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,640
I've been gathering information about the trade routes,

861
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,720
my mouth is almost worn out,

862
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,000
and my legs are nearly broken.

863
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,640
Gathering information about trade routes?

864
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,520
Where are you planning to go?

865
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,880
I want to sell the Yang Brocade to foreign lands.

866
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,320
But the southwestern frontier is thinly populated,

867
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,640
and detailed maps are even rarer.

868
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,960
I've searched for days,

869
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,240
and the most detailed one I found

870
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,800
is this map.

871
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,080
Here, take a look.

872
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,600
Starting from Yizhou,

873
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,080
follow the official road,

874
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,400
pass through this dense forest,

875
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,640
and keep going,

876
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,000
but there's no road ahead.

877
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,920
I've asked every caravan,

878
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,080
and no one

879
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,960
can tell me exactly

880
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,280
how to proceed.

881
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,920
Never mind going forward,

882
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,880
the road through this forest is tricky,

883
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,840
full of marshes,

884
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,040
very hard to travel.

885
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,480
That doesn't mean impossible.

886
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,240
If the road has been mapped out,

887
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,840
it means it can be traveled.

888
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,520
The key right now

889
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,240
is this place with no road.

890
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,400
Your family used to lead caravans.

891
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,320
Can you help me figure out

892
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,920
which way we should take?

893
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,120
Should we go by mountain road

894
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,440
or by waterway?

895
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,560
The water is swift, and the mountain path is perilous.

896
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,400
Both are bad.

897
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,880
What if we go around this way?

898
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,640
This area is flat,

899
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,640
but full of bandits.

900
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
One slip,

901
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,640
and you lose both people and goods.

902
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,720
You really are an expert.

903
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,840
You know everything.

904
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,280
Now help me figure out a way,

905
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,000
expert,

906
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,600
Opening trade routes

907
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,640
can be very profitable.

908
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,440
But if it were easy,

909
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,720
people would rush in.

910
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,080
You wouldn't get a chance.

911
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,000
This route is so difficult,

912
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,800
even experienced traders wouldn't dare try it.

913
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,240
Yingying,

914
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,200
if you really want to help the Yang family,

915
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,520
you can think of another way.

916
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,600
This route is really hard.

917
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,440
What other way could I possibly have?

918
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,520
I know this route is hard,

919
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,880
but the Yang family's situation is also critical.

920
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,240
I can't ignore it.
