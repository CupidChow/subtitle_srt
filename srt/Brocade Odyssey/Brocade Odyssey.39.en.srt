[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,610
[Episode 39]

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
Why did it turn out like this?

4
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,200
I've been feeding these silkworms

5
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,480
for seven years.

6
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,760
Is it because of insufficient light,

7
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,440
or the wrong food?

8
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
Did your master

9
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
really use silkworms from Nanzhao?

10
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,360
Nanzhao hasn't produced brocade in a hundred years.

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,320
Can we really weave it

12
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,280
within a year?

13
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,400
There are less than four months left.

14
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,640
If

15
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,240
we want to leave this place,

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,200
we need another plan.

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,160
We're skilled artisans.

18
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,480
We can distinguish between Nanzhao silk

19
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,280
and Yizhou silk.

20
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
But do you think

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
the King of Nanzhao can tell the difference?

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Even Sheng Fengze,

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,000
who claims to be a brocade expert,

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,160
can he really tell?

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
Are you suggesting we use fake brocade?

26
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,960
It can't be completely fake.

27
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,000
The blending ratio of the threads

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,560
depends on your judgment.

29
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,240
I remember you hate people who fake things the most.

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
Back then, they used fake brocade

31
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,800
to frame my father.

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,000
Now, I'm using fake brocade to save everyone's lives.

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
Can you do it?

34
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,120
All right.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,960
This will stay between heaven, earth, you, and me.

36
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,400
If something goes wrong,

37
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,320
just say

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,760
I picked the wrong thread.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,040
It has nothing to do with you.

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,600
[Chang'an]

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,440
This guilty servant, Yang Jinglan,

42
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480
greets Your Highness.

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,600
If you're a guilty servant,

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then who else on this court

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,200
can be called loyal?

46
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,880
Junior, you risked your life for our master

47
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,440
in Yizhou.

48
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
Please accept my bow.

49
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,320
And I must thank you, senior,

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,160
for trusting me

51
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,600
and helping me.

52
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,000
I should also thank all of you

53
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,680
for not abandoning Yizhou City

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,480
or my family.

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,160
That is the land of Tang

56
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,640
and its people.

57
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,880
How could we forsake it?

58
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,160
The Emperor has decided to deal with Niu Jin

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,160
and restore peace to Yizhou.

60
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,120
On behalf of the people of Yizhou,

61
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,600
I thank His Majesty!

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,480
The path of righteousness,

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
though millions stand against me...

64
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
I will go forward.

65
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,870
[Prince Bai's Residence]

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,840
This Nanzhao brocade is entirely made

67
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,480
from Nanzhao silk,

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,400
the true Nanzhao brocade.

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,480
I ask Your Highness to present it to the King.

70
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,480
I didn't expect you'd actually succeed,

71
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,240
but even as I watch you weave the Nanzhao brocade,

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,440
I feel no joy at all.

73
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,400
Maybe it's because

74
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,200
the moment you finished the Nanzhao brocade,

75
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
it meant

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,880
you'd leave me.

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,560
There are two months left in the year.

78
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,600
If we fail to deliver the brocade again,

79
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,680
neither of us nor Your Highness

80
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,800
will remain safe.

81
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,800
None of us will remain safe?

82
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,680
The Tang army has already marched against Niu Jin.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
That's good news

84
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,880
for you and Yang Jinglan.

85
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,880
For me...

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
it's also good news.

87
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,480
With Chang'an's forces dealing with Niu Jin,

88
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,400
they won't have the capacity

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,960
to confront Nanzhao.

90
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,880
Once the flames of war subside,

91
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
my brother might

92
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,800
show me some mercy.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
Then, congratulations, Your Highness.

94
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,560
Congratulations...

95
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,440
Are you congratulating me?

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,040
I think you're congratulating yourself!

97
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,360
Congratulations on being able to leave Nanzhao soon,

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,200
and leave me behind as well!

99
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,680
You're leaving.

100
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,280
What should I do now?

101
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,440
I've thought of a great idea,

102
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,040
an extraordinary idea!

103
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,800
I could burn down the weaving workshop!

104
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,280
The Nanzhao brocade that could've been woven

105
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,240
would instantly

106
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,480
turn into nothing,

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,960
reduced to ashes!

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,480
Rebuilding the weaving workshop

109
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,040
would take at least six months.

110
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,240
Six months!

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,880
Sheng Fengze,

112
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,000
have you forgotten your original goal?

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,360
Wasn't everything you did for the sake

114
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,280
of weaving Nanzhao brocade?

115
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
I don't care!

116
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,480
So what?

117
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,320
Qingping Officer never wanted me

118
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,000
to complete the Nanzhao brocade.

119
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,360
I can claim he set the fire!

120
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Madman.

121
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,920
Didn't you tell me

122
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,440
that people can change?

123
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,880
You're right.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,480
I've changed my mind.

125
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,240
Starting today,

126
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,960
whether it's the brocade or the person,

127
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,280
I

128
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,600
want them both!

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,720
Your Highness,

130
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
Qingping Officer has taken His Majesty

131
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
to the weaving workshop.

132
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,040
I've heard

133
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
the Nanzhao brocade has already been completed.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
To answer Your Majesty,

135
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,440
a sample brocade has indeed been made,

136
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,800
but the quality is poor.

137
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,080
It cannot be considered Nanzhao brocade.

138
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,040
Therefore,

139
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,400
I didn't report it to Your Majesty.

140
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,590
However, these Tang people confidently claim

141
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,950
that they've woven the Nanzhao brocade.

142
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,280
Ji Yingying,

143
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,040
why don't you tell His Majesty yourself?

144
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,320
Did you succeed in weaving the brocade

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
or not?

146
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,000
To answer Your Majesty,

147
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,400
this humble woman

148
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,640
has indeed woven the Nanzhao brocade.

149
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Your Highness,

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,560
regardless of its quality,

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,400
since His Majesty is here,

152
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,200
why not present the sample brocade

153
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
to him for examination?

154
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,800
This is the Nanzhao brocade woven by Ji Yingying.

155
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,880
Its toughness is lacking.

156
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,400
It tears too easily.

157
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,800
So you're saying

158
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,840
after all this time, there's no result?

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,840
That's because

160
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,880
these Tang people never put their hearts into weaving.

161
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,160
Instead, they focused entirely on faking it!

162
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,960
Your Majesty,

163
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,440
what you're seeing isn't Nanzhao brocade.

164
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
It's evidence of deception.

165
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,560
And Prince Bai destroyed the brocade

166
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,360
to cover this up.

167
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,920
Your Majesty,

168
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,320
I personally overheard

169
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,840
Ji Yingying conspiring with others

170
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,200
to use Yizhou silk

171
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,760
to pass off as Nanzhao silk,

172
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,160
weaving fake brocade

173
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
to deceive you.

174
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,760
As for

175
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,000
whether Prince Bai knew about it,

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,960
I'm not sure.

177
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
To inform Your Majesty,

178
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
I've brought Nanzhao artisans specifically.

179
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,240
Whether this is our Nanzhao silk,

180
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,840
a single test will reveal the truth.

181
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,000
No need for tests.

182
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,880
Your Majesty,

183
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,320
I am fully aware

184
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
of this matter.

185
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,200
Not only am I aware,

186
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,160
I was the one

187
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,400
who ordered them to do it.

188
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,560
I was thinking,

189
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,640
if we couldn't weave the Nanzhao brocade,

190
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,400
we could use this as a backup plan.

191
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,400
Please punish me.

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,800
Your Majesty,

193
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,680
this was entirely Ji Yingying's decision,

194
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,840
driven by personal motives to deceive you.

195
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,640
His Highness truly had no knowledge of it.

196
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,000
If he had known,

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,040
he wouldn't have destroyed the brocade.

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,880
He was merely

199
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,360
temporarily blinded by his feelings,

200
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,680
trying to protect Ji Yingying.

201
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,000
This is none of your business.

202
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,800
Be quiet!

203
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,800
What I said is completely true.

204
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,920
Whether for emotions

205
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
or for personal gain,

206
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,160
neither should

207
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,640
concern a subject.

208
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,000
As subjects,

209
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,200
our primary duty

210
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,200
is to serve Your Majesty and the people.

211
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,480
You don't

212
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,600
seem afraid at all.

213
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,960
That's because we did weave the Nanzhao brocade.

214
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,400
Our conscience is clear.

215
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,240
But it's not the one presented by Prince Bai.

216
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,880
With 9,600 warp and weft threads,

217
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,040
every strand was woven from Nanzhao silk.

218
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,440
The dyeing process

219
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,280
also incorporated local Nanzhao techniques.

220
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,480
I ask Your Majesty to have it tested.

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
Ms. Ji,

222
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,400
if you've already woven the Nanzhao brocade,

223
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,680
why go through such complex schemes

224
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,680
and involve everyone else?

225
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,640
Everything I've done

226
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,800
was to meet His Majesty in person

227
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,800
and present

228
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,200
the genuine Nanzhao brocade.

229
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,720
It's done. It's truly done!

230
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,000
The Nanzhao brocade has finally...

231
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,880
Shh.

232
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,200
Is there anything wrong with this brocade?

233
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,360
Sit.

234
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,200
The brocade is fine,

235
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,960
but how can we personally hand it to the King of Nanzhao?

236
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
That's the problem.

237
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,560
Exactly.

238
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,200
We're just ordinary people.

239
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,560
It's not like we can easily meet the King.

240
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,880
Do we

241
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,000
have to deliver it personally to the King?

242
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,560
Neither Sheng Fengze nor Du Yan

243
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,240
would ever let the real brocade

244
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,440
reach the King.

245
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,760
That's right.

246
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,760
As soon as they find out the brocade is finished,

247
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,240
there will be trouble.

248
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,640
What should we do?

249
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,000
I need you to act with me in a play.

250
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,400
Let's use their mutual distrust to set a trap

251
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,840
with the fake brocade,

252
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,240
luring the King here.

253
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,600
The real brocade

254
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
is our final trump card

255
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,800
to turn the tables.

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,360
The Nanzhao brocade...

257
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,960
Nanzhao finally has its own brocade!

258
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,280
As King,

259
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,200
I am not unworthy of my ancestors.

260
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,640
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

261
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,960
We've fulfilled our mission

262
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,200
and can finally go home.

263
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,240
Ms. Ji,

264
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,360
I'm willing to grant you wealth and high status.

265
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,040
Would you be willing

266
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,080
to stay and continue serving Nanzhao?

267
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,160
Thank you for your kind offer, Your Majesty,

268
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,880
but my family and friends are all in Yizhou.

269
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,840
My mother is still waiting for me to fulfill my filial duties.

270
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,640
Please forgive me for declining your gracious offer.

271
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,680
However, I believe

272
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,440
one doesn't have to stay in Nanzhao

273
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,160
to contribute to its prosperity.

274
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,880
I have some influence in Yizhou,

275
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,160
and once I return,

276
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,360
I will actively work

277
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,640
to promote brocade trade between Yizhou and Nanzhao,

278
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,800
ensuring mutual benefit.

279
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,200
This brocade's completion

280
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,760
was thanks to the help of Nanzhao artisans.

281
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,160
I believe

282
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,320
that isolation and secret theft

283
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,840
are not the best solutions.

284
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,800
Only through voluntary communication

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,160
and mutual exchange

286
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,800
can we achieve lasting benefits.

287
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,200
Right now, Yizhou

288
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,400
is under Niu Jin's control.

289
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,480
Even if I let you return,

290
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,760
you might have nowhere to settle.

291
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,200
The Tang Empire is vast.

292
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,840
Even if we can't return to Yizhou,

293
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,160
as long as we stand on our homeland,

294
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,200
our hearts will be at peace.

295
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,160
It seems you're determined to leave.

296
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,200
[Nanzhao brocade complete, craftsmen return]

297
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,160
This is the contract

298
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,600
that Your Majesty signed with me that day.

299
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,040
Why did you tear it up?

300
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,760
When I first arrived in Nanzhao,

301
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I was uneasy.

302
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,640
So, I requested this contract from Your Majesty.

303
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,880
But later, I thought about it.

304
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,840
Perhaps I had been worrying too much.

305
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,600
Your Majesty is the ruler of a nation.

306
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,880
Your word is as good as gold.

307
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,680
How could you possibly break your promise to us commoners?

308
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,200
If word got out,

309
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,600
wouldn't it make the people

310
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,360
and other rulers laugh at you?

311
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,960
Since Your Majesty's word is absolute,

312
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,960
why would I still need

313
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,440
this trivial piece of paper?

314
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,040
Although the brocade sample is complete now,

315
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,600
if everyone leaves,

316
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,480
who will stay to continue weaving?

317
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,600
Yizhou is in chaos right now.

318
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,160
Here's a better option:

319
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,600
Those willing to stay

320
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,760
could remain

321
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,480
to teach Nanzhao's craftsmen their skills.

322
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,880
Oh...

323
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,680
Your Majesty,

324
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,680
this humble servant

325
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,240
is willing to serve you.

326
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,280
Who are you?

327
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,440
This humble servant is Zhao Xiuyuan, the Brocade Master of Yizhou.

328
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,720
I started weaving at the age of eight.

329
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
If nothing else,

330
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,640
weaving brocade

331
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,600
is what I excel at.

332
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,000
Besides,

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,400
Nanzhao's patterns

334
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,520
were also created by me.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,960
These brocade samples

336
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,240
were all my collaborative work.

337
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,240
You're willing to stay in Nanzhao to weave brocade?

338
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,720
Good.

339
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,480
What do you want in return?

340
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,600
This humble servant asks for nothing else,

341
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,520
but only that my fellow townspeople

342
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,520
can return to their homeland soon.

343
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Issue the decree:

344
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,640
From today onward,

345
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,200
except for those staying to teach,

346
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,520
allow all Yizhou craftsmen to return home.

347
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,600
No one leaving shall be obstructed.

348
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,840
As for those willing to stay,

349
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,640
they will receive double their monthly wages

350
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,280
and be treated well.

351
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,120
Understood, Your Majesty.

352
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

353
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,600
Thank you, Your Majesty!

354
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,640
The two of you,

355
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,680
who claim to be Nanzhao's greatest strategists,

356
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
allowed your selfish motives

357
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,440
to be exploited by a mere woman

358
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,080
and played right into her hands.

359
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,240
You're fined a year's salary

360
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,040
and prohibited from court discussions for the next three months.

361
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,320
Reflect on your mistakes.

362
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,640
Your servant is guilty.

363
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,480
Since the age of nineteen,

364
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,640
I have served the court.

365
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,880
There hasn't been a single day

366
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,880
that I didn't attend court discussions.

367
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,560
In nearly half a lifetime,

368
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,600
I have never suffered such humiliation.

369
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Ms. Ji, you're quite capable.

370
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,520
I've learned my lesson.

371
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,840
And congratulations to Prince Bai

372
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,120
for winning such a deadly beauty.

373
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
Take care.

374
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,720
Ji Yingying, stay.

375
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,960
I

376
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,520
have something to say to you.

377
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,840
Everyone else,

378
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,520
leave now.

379
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,440
Get out, all of you!

380
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,840
Do I look like a fool today?

381
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,440
I was ready to take the blame for you,

382
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,600
but instead,

383
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,440
you played me like a puppet.

384
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
I predicted Du Yan would use fake brocade to frame you.

385
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,240
I predicted you would destroy my brocade.

386
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,320
But I truly didn't expect

387
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,120
you'd stand up to take the blame for me.

388
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,640
Sheng Fengze,

389
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,400
you've saved me many times,

390
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,280
like the time my house caught fire,

391
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,240
or when we were traveling on trade routes,

392
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
or when we were chased by Niu Jin.

393
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,920
Even though you always had your own motives,

394
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,000
you still protected me.

395
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,800
I'm not heartless.

396
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,440
I know everything

397
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,240
you've done for me.

398
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,680
But one person's kindness

399
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,640
can't outweigh their wrongs.

400
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,640
Then how can I make up for it?

401
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,920
Are you saying

402
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,040
you want me to die?

403
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't know.

404
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,640
I can't forgive you on behalf of others.

405
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Bai Sheng!

406
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Zhao Xiuyuan!

407
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,600
You begged like a dog

408
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,240
just to let Ji Yingying go.

409
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,640
You schemed against everyone,

410
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,600
only to be outsmarted by someone else in the end.

411
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,200
How does that feel?

412
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
You leaked the information

413
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,880
about the border chaos to Yang Jinglan.

414
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,280
You're the real mole!

415
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,120
Initially, Bai Sheng

416
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,360
sent me to uncover your purpose here.

417
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,600
And now, look what's happened.

418
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,640
There's nothing left

419
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,080
in this world

420
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,440
for me to care about.

421
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,440
Let's not talk about the past.

422
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Everything that happened before was my fault.

423
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,920
I have one request.

424
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,040
Will you help me

425
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,880
kill Niu Jin?

426
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,960
If you agree, I, Zhao Xiuyuan,

427
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,240
will ensure your return

428
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,560
to Yizhou!

429
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,320
The name of this bracelet

430
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,280
is called "Never Lost."

431
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,800
Yang Jinglan told me about it.

432
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,840
He said if I mentioned this,

433
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,360
you'd believe

434
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,880
that he and I have already joined forces.

435
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,600
So, you can trust me.

436
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,800
You're not like Yang Jinglan.

437
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,080
When he says he'll kill Niu Jin,

438
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,800
he actually means it.

439
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,800
But you... you're always weighing your options.

440
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,400
Just like now,

441
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,040
with your blade at my neck.

442
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,160
Do you dare kill me?

443
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,080
You keep saying you love Ji Yingying,

444
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,000
acting all crazed,

445
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,680
claiming you'd do anything to have her.

446
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,880
But that's not love.

447
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,920
True love

448
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,080
doesn't mean possession.

449
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,240
True love

450
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
is thinking about her every day.

451
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,680
Wondering if she's eaten enough,

452
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,840
if she's warm,

453
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,960
and if she's happy each day.

454
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,160
Let me tell you, Bai Sheng...

455
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,560
that's not love.

456
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,080
Right now,

457
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,240
you only love yourself.

458
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,230
♪The waves rise and fall as you lead♪

459
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,790
♪My heart, a candle's flame♪

460
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,150
♪Burns bright for a promised name♪

461
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,770
♪Love long locked in a hidden place♪

462
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,110
♪Bound by ties too much to erase♪

463
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,730
♪Rising and falling together amidst the waves♪

464
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,900
♪Why fear loneliness in the end?♪

465
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,470
♪Unforgotten♪

466
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,050
♪Memories entwined, stronger than love's song♪

467
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,680
♪A lifetime unfolds, a solitary bloom♪

468
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:13,670
♪Even if we part, I will hold on long♪

469
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,960
Now,

470
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,240
I've rallied all of Commissioner Mu's old troops.

471
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,720
Once we defeat the rebel army in the northwest,

472
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
I will lead the entire army

473
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,920
to Yizhou's gates.

474
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,560
General Xue, you're planning to attack Yizhou City?

475
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,320
Niu Jin is hiding like a coward.

476
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,040
The court will never negotiate or compromise

477
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,160
with such a traitor.

478
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,360
We have no choice but to attack.

479
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,680
But... the civilians in Yizhou City

480
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,600
are all in Niu Jin's hands!

481
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,240
My parents, my wife, and children

482
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,320
are also in the city.

483
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,800
If the day comes

484
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,200
when the army surrounds the city,

485
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,200
Niu Jin

486
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,520
will surely use my family as sacrifices.

487
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,760
What should we do?

488
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,000
Ten days.

489
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,720
Give me ten days.

490
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,560
Take down the leader to capture the bandits.

491
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,400
I'll sneak into the city and give it a try.

492
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,200
Are you confident?

493
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,040
Even without confidence,

494
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,240
I have to try.

495
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,160
How will you do it?

496
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,560
Yang Jinglan!

497
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,360
Niu Jin

498
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,440
has hung Zhuge's body

499
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,000
at the city gate!

500
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,120
What?

501
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,200
Yang Jinglan,

502
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
this must be a trap set by Niu Jin

503
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,760
to lure you out.

504
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,160
It's I

505
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,840
who brought Zhuge from Chang'an to Yizhou.

506
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,720
Even if I must brave hell and high water,

507
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
I'll bring him back!

508
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,960
Are you out of your mind?

509
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:32,800
Yang Jinglan!

510
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,520
General Xue, my son may be reckless,

511
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,560
but his loyalty and honor are priceless.

512
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,840
Please, lend your support.

513
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,400
Deploy troops to protect them!

514
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,440
Understood!

515
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,600
[Yizhou]

516
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,400
Stay alert!

517
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
Kill!

518
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,720
Bro,

519
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm taking you home!

520
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,160
Let's change his clothes.

521
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,240
I'll do it.

522
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,360
There's writing here.

523
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,400
"Even in death, the bones of a hero remain fragrant,

524
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,320
unashamed before the world's finest."

525
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,040
Is this

526
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,760
what he left for you?

527
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,760
It's what my master left for me.

528
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
Back when Yizhou City

529
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,120
was surrounded on all sides,

530
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,600
my master left me clues

531
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,720
by carving them

532
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,960
into his own bones.

533
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,840
Yizhou City today

534
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,840
is the same.

535
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,360
Could it be

536
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,760
he also used bone carving to send a message?

537
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,440
Aside from the marks on his wrists,

538
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,720
there are no other injuries on his body.

539
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,240
Are you overthinking it?

540
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,320
No, I'm not.

541
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,240
This writing is old.

542
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,800
It wasn't written recently.

543
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,840
It was prepared in advance,

544
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,960
as if

545
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,960
he knew he might die at any moment

546
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,200
and made arrangements ahead of time.

547
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,400
Gao Fang,

548
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,520
go fetch a coroner.

549
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,960
Are you sure?

550
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,720
I'm sure.

551
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,800
I'll go.

552
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,160
Mr. Yang,

553
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,840
I found this

554
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,840
inside Mr. Zhuge's stomach.

555
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:09,960
This pattern

556
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
looks like a map.

557
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,720
"On the thirteenth, the brocade exchange day,

558
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,960
enter the dark path and chase the light."

559
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,160
The thirteenth...

560
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,160
Father, what do you think?

561
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,600
In our brocade family,

562
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,760
we pay tribute to the military commissioner

563
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,760
twice a year,

564
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,720
at the beginning and middle of the year.

565
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,400
If I'm not mistaken,

566
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,440
the fourteenth of this month is Niu Jin's birthday.

567
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,280
So,

568
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,600
the brocade must be delivered on the thirteenth.

569
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,000
Isn't birthday tributes usually delivered on the day itself?

570
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,160
Usually, yes.

571
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,640
But

572
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,800
there's an exception.

573
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,520
If the tribute isn't just brocade,

574
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,720
but brocade garments

575
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,760
meant to be worn on the birthday,

576
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,600
they have to be delivered early.

577
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,360
That's to ensure a proper fitting.

578
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,160
No matter where Niu Jin is hiding,

579
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,360
they'll see him then.

580
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
Exactly!

581
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,720
So, what he's trying to tell us is

582
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,200
to follow the brocade delivery cart

583
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,030
through the secret path.

584
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,840
And he's also telling me

585
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,120
to follow the firelight

586
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,950
to find Niu Jin.

587
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,160
This child really went to great lengths.

588
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,950
Let him have a moment to himself.

589
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,960
Zhuge,

590
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,040
even in death,

591
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,160
you still have so much to say.

592
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,640
Yang Jinglan,

593
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
if it were you,

594
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,960
how would you pass this message along?

595
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,120
So it can't be carved into bones.

596
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,440
With so much to say,

597
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,760
if I carved it all into bones,

598
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,760
I'd end up looking like a sieve.

599
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,720
Your favorite drink.

600
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,760
Hurry, take it!

601
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,480
What's wrong?

602
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,600
Didn't you tell me

603
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,200
that heroes should be carefree

604
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,320
and humorous,

605
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,640
so people will remember them?

606
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,960
Who told you to be a hero?

607
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,800
Did I tell you to be a hero?

608
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,120
Or are you trying

609
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,320
to steal my thunder?

610
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,400
Let me just say this,

611
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,840
all this time, it's been you and Ji Yingying

612
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,720
helping everyone.

613
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,200
But Yizhou City

614
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,360
belongs to all of us.

615
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,840
It's my turn, Zhuge Hong,

616
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,000
to do something for everyone.

617
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,520
Besides,

618
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,840
you don't know how much effort it took

619
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,440
for me to provoke Niu Jin

620
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,040
and pass this message along.

621
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,920
How were you so sure I'd return

622
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,240
to retrieve your body from the city walls?

623
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,120
If I hadn't returned,

624
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,400
wouldn't you have died in vain?

625
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,800
Because you're Yang Jinglan.

626
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,600
Even if it's just to come back and scold me for being stupid,

627
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,600
I know you'll come back.

628
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,120
Don't look at me like that.

629
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,920
I know I'm quite dashing.

630
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,040
The wine really is that good.

631
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,920
So...

632
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,360
when you chose to stay in Yizhou,

633
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,040
you've already made this decision,

634
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,760
didn't you?

635
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,840
You've given up on the imperial exams?

636
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,760
Let's focus on this lifetime's responsibilities first.

637
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,120
I've done everything I should.

638
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:03,880
The rest

639
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,800
is up to you.

640
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,240
All right.

641
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:13,600
I'm off.

642
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,160
As for becoming the top scholar,

643
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,400
let's leave that for the next life.

644
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,680
Sang Shisi and the others are here.

645
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,360
They've come

646
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,120
to take the craftsmen back home.

647
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,320
But the craftsmen refuse to leave,

648
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,720
saying they'll wait to leave with you.

649
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,960
So I told them

650
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
you're sick,

651
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,320
unable to leave right now.

652
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,320
You're recovering.

653
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,520
Once you're better,

654
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,640
I'll personally escort you back.

655
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,880
He will come to take me back.

656
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,480
This place is so remote.

657
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,880
He won't be able to find it.

658
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,600
After some time,

659
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,240
I'll announce

660
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,960
that you've fallen gravely ill from overwork

661
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,680
and passed away suddenly.

662
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,280
You know he won't believe that.

663
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,880
So why bother with the pretense?

664
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,040
In my life, I've done many business deals.

665
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,800
The one I've lost the most in

666
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,680
is you.

667
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,400
What I've lost

668
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,440
is my principles,

669
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,560
my control.

670
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,640
Deep down,

671
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,680
I know clearly

672
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,760
there's no good ending for us.

673
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,960
But

674
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,640
I still can't let go.

675
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,880
Go ahead and eat.

676
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,920
It won't taste good once it's cold.

677
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,640
Your Highness,

678
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,680
His Majesty has summoned you to the palace.

679
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,880
Another meal was left unfinished.

680
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,320
I'll come back early

681
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,360
to have dinner with you.

682
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,240
Report!

683
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,440
Your Highness,

684
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,080
His Majesty has summoned you to the palace.

685
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Why are you panicking?

686
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,160
Aren't I already on my way to invite him?

687
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,960
Understood.

688
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,640
Yes.

689
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,360
