[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 26]

3
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,720
But based on his age,

4
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,160
he would have been just a child

5
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,160
the year my father had his incident.

6
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,840
That doesn't add up.

7
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,360
However, if he's only involved in smuggling,

8
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,800
why would he personally travel such great distances to Yizhou?

9
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,440
And later, when he approached me,

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,360
what was he after?

11
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,920
No need to rush.

12
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,760
Leave these matters

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,960
to me to investigate.

14
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Let me handle it.

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,320
You have more pressing concerns.

16
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,910
What concerns?

17
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,920
The strange forces within the Yang family

18
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,720
aren't easy to deal with.

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,640
Dear,

20
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,800
you must be cautious.

21
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,040
Why is everyone looking at me like that?

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,360
Because you're so good-looking.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,880
Jinglan,

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
this is a family banquet!

25
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,520
Ever since you became the inspector,

26
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,360
you've been throwing your weight around.

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,160
Did you even forget the old rule

28
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,560
that women aren't allowed

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,360
to join a family banquet?

30
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,720
Is this

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,920
how you speak to an inspector?

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,680
This is a family banquet,

33
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,080
not the Brocade Bureau.

34
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Is that how you talk to your elders?

35
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Yang Jinglin,

36
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,920
did you forget

37
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
how I used to discipline you as a kid?

38
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,280
Hey,

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,520
chopsticks are for eating.

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,880
Stop pointing them at me.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,480
All right, enough.

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,800
We're family.

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,440
Can't we have one peaceful meal together?

44
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Jinglan's wife just joined the family,

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,440
and our dinner table

46
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
can certainly accommodate her.

47
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,960
The main point is to use this opportunity

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,160
to introduce her to the family elders.

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,120
But no other family's daughters-in-law

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,320
have such privileges.

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,240
Besides,

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,640
Jinglan's wife

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,680
didn't come here honorably.

54
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,720
She's not qualified for this grand occasion.

55
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,520
Dear,

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,560
look at these chopsticks.

57
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,560
What kind of old, outworn wood are they made from?

58
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,840
How could they break so easily?

59
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,510
Are you all right?

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,070
I'll go get another pair of chopsticks.

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,280
Jinglan says he's done eating.

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,480
Sir, Madam,

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,080
uncles,

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,760
we'll take our leave now.

65
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,720
Yingying,

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,640
sit down first.

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,240
I allowed Yingying

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,240
to join this banquet.

69
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm also a woman.

70
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,200
I can attend this banquet

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,320
and manage our Yang family's business

72
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,880
thanks to the trust of all you elders.

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,120
I invited Yingying

74
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,840
because she's no ordinary woman.

75
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,720
She's not only the president of the Bloom Society,

76
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,560
but in the future,

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,360
she'll also help manage our Yang family's business.

78
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Attending a family banquet is only a matter of time.

79
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,120
There's no reason to make a fuss about it.

80
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,960
Now that you've explained,

81
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,160
I understand.

82
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
The president of the Bloom Society

83
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
is now a daughter-in-law of our Yang family.

84
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,880
So the Bloom Society

85
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,720
will eventually come under our Yang family's name.

86
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,120
Exactly.

87
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,280
Sir.

88
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,200
Now I see

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,880
why this meal was called together.

90
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,520
It was a trap all along!

91
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,880
Jinglan.

92
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,080
I'm not done yet.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,080
No matter how much the Yang family has helped my wife,

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,520
it doesn't justify taking her guild

95
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,680
as part of her dowry.

96
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
Who does that kind of thing?

97
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,680
Who are you talking about?

98
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,080
Watch your tone!

99
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,880
Don't worry, dear.

100
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,240
Anyone who dares upset you,

101
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,480
I'll make sure they're even more upset.

102
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm curious to see

103
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,560
whose head my first flames

104
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,880
as a new official will burn.

105
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,240
This is boring.

106
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,880
Even the food looks unappetizing.

107
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:25,920
Dear,

108
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,480
why don't we leave?

109
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,080
Sir, Madam,

110
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,880
uncles,

111
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,440
we're truly leaving now.

112
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,280
Such a mess!

113
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:39,960
What did you say?

114
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,760
Yang Jinglan!

115
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,040
Juxian,

116
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,120
look at his attitude!

117
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,200
Exactly. Who does he mean by "such a mess"?

118
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,400
This meal

119
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,280
is truly meaningless!

120
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,880
I'm not eating anymore!

121
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,360
Jingshan, escort Father back to rest.

122
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,320
Okay.

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
As expected, they're not easy to deal with.

124
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,520
They're even eyeing your guild.

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,040
If Madam really wanted my Bloom Society,

126
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,320
she would've come to negotiate directly.

127
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,280
This only proves she wants more,

128
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,760
and her plans run deeper.

129
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,560
This matriarch is not a bad person,

130
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,920
but her focus is entirely on business.

131
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,680
Frankly,

132
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,120
she's more of a Yang family member than anyone else.

133
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,720
That's why she's the head lady of the house.

134
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,720
In business, credibility is paramount.

135
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,360
Even if she has her own agenda,

136
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,000
I trust she'll deal with me fairly.

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,520
But this Yang family

138
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,880
is a large clan.

139
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,960
Surviving in a family like this

140
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,960
is no different from doing business.

141
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,920
If you start by showing your worst side,

142
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,120
any small concession later

143
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,800
will make them think you're considerate.

144
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,920
If you start by showing your best side,

145
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,400
any tiny misstep

146
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,120
will make them think

147
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,720
you're ungrateful and rebellious.

148
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,920
Did you suffer a lot before?

149
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,320
Some lessons can only be learned

150
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,520
through hardship.

151
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,960
Of course not.

152
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,670
I understand this because...

153
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,200
I'm smart.

154
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
You know this too.

155
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,160
You're just too concerned about appearances,

156
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
worried our family ties will grow even more strained.

157
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,880
No, that's not it.

158
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I'm just...

159
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
showing courtesy before resorting to force.

160
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,240
I believe you.

161
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,360
We didn't even get to eat.

162
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,120
I'm actually quite hungry.

163
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,000
Me too.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,400
How about I cook something for you?

165
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,680
You can try my cooking.

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,760
I'll cook for you.

167
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,520
Dear,

168
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,640
Jinglan has finally returned home,

169
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,040
and he's now married to the woman he loves.

170
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,840
Can't you just let them be

171
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
and stop causing trouble for them?

172
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,360
Master,

173
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,000
are you worried I'll harm Jinglan?

174
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,240
No, not harm, but use.

175
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,040
Why did you let Jinglan's wife

176
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,640
attend the family banquet?

177
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,520
And at the table,

178
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,320
why did you bring up the Bloom Society?

179
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,480
Honestly,

180
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
aren't you leveraging Yingying's courage

181
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
and Jinglan's position

182
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,640
to deal with those relatives?

183
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,120
Yingying married into our family without a ceremony.

184
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,400
Today, with the family elders present,

185
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,120
it's reasonable to introduce her.

186
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,040
Yingying is talented and beautiful.

187
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,840
You may not know her abilities now,

188
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,040
but you'll see in time.

189
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,240
Others may not know,

190
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,880
but Jinglan stole his brother's fiancée.

191
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,560
Still, now that she's part of our family,

192
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,240
I hope

193
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,880
they can live a good life together.

194
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,840
I've always acted for the good of the Yang family,

195
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,880
with a clear conscience.

196
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,840
No one questions your loyalty to the Yang family.

197
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,920
But

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,440
have you considered

199
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,200
what would happen if this fails?

200
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
Look at Jingshan.

201
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,840
He still refuses to marry.

202
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,040
Isn't that lesson enough?

203
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,200
Jinglan isn't the same as Jingshan,

204
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
and Yingying isn't the same as Yuniang.

205
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,560
Whether two people who love each other can be together

206
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,280
depends not on outside forces

207
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,080
but on themselves.

208
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,080
If two people love each other,

209
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,440
what obstacles could stand between them?

210
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,280
Loving someone and marrying them are two different things.

211
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,520
Those who love each other may not end up together.

212
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,760
But couples like us,

213
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,120
from compatible families,

214
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
respectful to each other,

215
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,720
perhaps

216
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
can stay together for a lifetime.

217
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,760
Try it.

218
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,680
How is it?

219
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,840
Since my mother and master passed away,

220
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
you're the first person

221
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,880
to cook for me.

222
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,360
This noodle

223
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,720
tastes like home.

224
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,640
If you like it,

225
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,280
I'll make it for you often.

226
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,120
There's no need.

227
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,120
From now on, I'll cook for you.

228
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,000
Just wait.

229
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,760
Aren't you thinking about drinking?

230
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,880
How did you know?

231
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,080
You can't drink,

232
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,880
but you can watch me drink.

233
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,000
Fine,

234
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,360
I'll watch you drink.

235
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,320
What a fine wine.

236
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
I'm envious.

237
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,080
It smells amazing.

238
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,200
Keep dreaming.

239
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,480
Yang Jinglan,

240
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,080
is life in the martial world as carefree

241
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,440
and joyful as it seems?

242
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,480
Do you dislike being here that much?

243
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,920
Then why stay here?

244
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,320
For you.

245
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,960
Why?

246
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,280
Because we're allies?

247
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,760
Ji Yingying,

248
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,200
do you think

249
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,200
we're just allies?

250
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,920
Do you think everything I've done

251
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,600
is merely

252
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,360
because you're my ally?

253
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,280
I don't know.

254
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,960
I like you.

255
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,320
What about you?

256
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,080
What about you?

257
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,040
Let me take you somewhere.

258
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,570
[Memorial tablet of the late Lady Yang, née Liu]

259
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,360
I'm married,

260
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,960
and I have a home now.

261
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,280
This is Yingying,

262
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,680
my wife.

263
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
She is, and always will be,

264
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,680
my one and only wife.

265
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,240
Madam,

266
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,160
I am Ji Yingying,

267
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,280
your daughter-in-law.

268
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,640
I know Jinglan has endured a lot in the past.

269
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,480
From now on,

270
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,960
I'll ensure he takes care of his health

271
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,640
and stays happy every day.

272
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,000
With your spirit watching over us,

273
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,560
rest assured.

274
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,600
In the Yang family,

275
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,120
sons have their own courtyard from the age of five.

276
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,120
But every day,

277
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,760
I'd still come back here.

278
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,080
This is the only place

279
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,880
I've ever missed when I was away.

280
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Is that a birdcage?

281
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,960
Yes.

282
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,320
It's so huge.

283
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,600
My mother loved birds.

284
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,200
She loved watching them

285
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,320
chirp and hop around

286
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,720
in their cage.

287
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,080
So, my father

288
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,120
traveled far and wide,

289
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,360
collecting all kinds of exotic species.

290
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,360
He even had this massive birdcage custom-made

291
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,360
just to make her happy.

292
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,880
My mother

293
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,000
loved my father dearly.

294
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,320
But bound by the rules of the Yang family,

295
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,200
she became overly cautious,

296
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,600
fearing she might trouble him.

297
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Gradually, she lost her freedom,

298
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,800
lost herself,

299
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,120
just like the birds in this cage,

300
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,760
trapped within this courtyard.

301
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
The day before she passed,

302
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
she told me to open the cage

303
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,760
and release all the birds.

304
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
She said to me,

305
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,240
"Give them back

306
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,360
the freedom they deserve."

307
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,960
Yingying,

308
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,360
I won't be like my father.

309
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,120
I want you

310
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,960
to continue being yourself.

311
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,720
I want us to meet and stay together

312
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,280
like a bird finding another bird,

313
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,920
like a breeze meeting another breeze.

314
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,080
To be happier,

315
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
freer,

316
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,800
more unrestrained,

317
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,360
and more alive.

318
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,800
But to me, you're not just a bird

319
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,360
or a breeze.

320
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,040

I thought I'd keep walking it by myself.

But at some point,

326
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,720
whenever I look up,

327
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,320
I see the moon.

This is my first time seeing you after the wedding.

367
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,520
The Yang family acted so hastily.

368
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,760
I didn't even get to make a scene in your bridal chamber!

369
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,360
Yang Jinglan was injured so badly.

370
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,920
He didn't suffer any lasting damage, did he?

of an unmarried lady?

374
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,120
Right.

375
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,080
But is he up to the task?

376
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
Shut up!

377
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,760
All right, that's enough joking around.

378
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,520
I'm here today to discuss serious matters.

379
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,360
Pin, call everyone over.

380
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,280
All right.

381
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,880
- Stop laughing. - Is he up to the task?

382
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,280
- Stop laughing. - Stop.

383
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,680
I'll kick you to death!

384
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,880
Rules!

385
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,160
You're still wet behind the ears.

386
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,440
What do you know about rules?

387
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,920
What brings Second Uncle to our Bloom Society?

388
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,080
The Yang family.

389
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,680
Ms. Ji,

390
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,080
this Bloom Society is under your name, right?

391
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,480
And now that you've married into the Yang family,

392
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,120
from today on,

393
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,960
Bloom Society will merge with the Yang family!

394
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,680
Bloom Society was jointly established by many families.

395
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,200
How can the Yang family

396
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,480
include the other families in this?

397
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,160
The other families?

398
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,960
Fine.

399
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,520
I'll follow what you say.

400
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,800
From now on, the other families will co-manage with the Yang family.

401
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,120
The Yang family runs things properly,

402
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,680
so they'll take the larger share,

403
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
and the other families will take the smaller share.

404
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,240
That's settled then.

405
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,320
Based on what?

406
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,240
Because Ji Yingying is your president.

407
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,560
Because she married into the Yang family.

408
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,120
The Yang family's rules

409
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,440
must outweigh Bloom Society's. Got it?

410
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,520
Second Uncle, you really know how to play your cards.

411
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,480
But Bloom Society has nothing to do with me anymore.

412
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,280
He's the new president.

413
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,280
You can discuss this with him.

414
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,960
Greetings, Sir Yang.

415
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,960
I'm doing this

416
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,960
to help Bloom Society go further.

417
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,400
Now that I'm a daughter-in-law of the Yang family,

418
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,000
if I continue as president of Bloom Society,

419
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,760
then Bloom Society

420
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,120
will inevitably become part of the Yang family.

421
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,760
What it can do

422
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,600
and what it cannot do

423
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,440
will all follow the Yang family's rules.

424
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,080
This will greatly limit

425
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,360
Bloom Society's growth.

426
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,400
So, for the long-term,

427
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,600
I must step down as president.

428
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,800
Yingying's concerns are valid.

429
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
Just like today,

430
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,920
you wouldn't want Bloom Society

431
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,840
to be controlled by the Yang family in the future, would you?

432
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,160
Fine. Even if you're gone,

433
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,560
this Bloom Society will still have my protection.

434
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,280
All right. What's most important now

435
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,400
is choosing a new president

436
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,480
for Bloom Society.

437
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,480
What? A new president?

438
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,920
The new president

439
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,560
must be talented

440
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,960
and able to earn everyone's respect.

441
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,680
Not just talented,

442
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
but also responsible.

443
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,960
Ideally, they'd come from a scholarly family

444
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,680
and have charm and charisma.

445
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,280
All right, everyone, if you trust me,

446
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,360
this position of president...

447
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,680
According to you,

448
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,760
must the new president also be someone

449
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,480
named Sang?

450
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,840
All right.

451
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Here at Bloom Society,

452
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,920
we do everything out in the open.

453
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,240
We've always been transparent.

454
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,840
Anyone who wants to take on the role of president

455
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,280
can raise their hand to vote. Go ahead, raise your hands!

456
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,360
Come on, raise your hands!

457
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,960
All right.

458
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,640
Those in favor of my elder brother becoming president,

459
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,360
please raise your hand.

460
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,080
Those in favor of Mr. Chen becoming president,

461
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,960
please raise your hand.

462
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,720
Currently, Mr. Chen has the most votes.

463
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,560
So,

464
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,480
the position of president

465
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,160
will go to Mr. Chen.

466
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,560
My elder brother and Pin are tied.

467
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,960
They'll both serve as vice presidents.

468
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,840
For the new president's decisions,

469
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,560
if the vice presidents disagree,

470
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,840
the decisions will be void.

471
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,880
Ms. Ji,

472
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,080
this isn't appropriate.

473
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,840
Now that you've married into the Yang family,

474
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,760
how your assets are handled

475
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,040
should be decided by the Yang family.

476
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,880
This...

477
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
this isn't appropriate.

478
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,600
Madam hasn't told me about this.

479
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,440
Jinglan hasn't mentioned it either.

480
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,200
Why are you teaching me the rules, Second Uncle?

481
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,400
Is the Yang family's rules up to you to decide?

482
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,160
Don't use Madam to pressure me.

483
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,040
Let me tell you,

484
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,680
now we're in front of outsiders,

485
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,360
and I'm the elder.

486
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,560
If you oppose me,

487
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,080
you're damaging the Yang family's reputation.

488
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,480
And that's a serious matter.

489
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,160
Pardon my interruption.

490
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,640
Is your intention

491
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,400
about

492
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,480
the ownership of Bloom Society?

493
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,800
Exactly.

494
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,880
You're quite perceptive.

495
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,560
I know you all

496
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,080
have a good relationship with Ms. Ji.

497
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,520
If you don't want to see her bullied in the Yang family

498
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,000
in the future,

499
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,520
you'd better align yourselves with me.

500
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,800
Of course,

501
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,640
in business,

502
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,560
I'll be generous to everyone.

503
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,640
What do you say?

504
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,320
Sir Yang, you're truly generous.

505
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,000
Now that I'm the new president,

506
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
it's only right to make some changes.

507
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,120
So, Sir Yang,

508
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,080
you can leave

509
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,840
the same way you came.

510
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,880
Say that again.

511
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Oh, I nearly forgot.

512
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,880
I can't decide

513
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,240
this matter on my own.

514
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,000
I'll need to consult with my two vice presidents

515
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,400
and the members of Bloom Society.

516
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,360
Do you agree with my decision?

517
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,360
We agree!

518
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,200
Leave the same way you came!

519
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,080
All of Yizhou City knows

520
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,360
it's Mrs. Yang who calls the shots in the Yang family.

521
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,880
I have no idea about your standing

522
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,000
in the Yang family.

523
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,680
Don't think that invoking the Yang family

524
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
gives you the right

525
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,800
to act recklessly here.

526
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,400
This is our first meeting,

527
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,400
so I won't hit you

528
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,880
for causing trouble here.

529
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,800
No, I won't hit you.

530
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,760
But if you continue spouting nonsense,

531
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,040
I'll show you

532
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,600
what the men of Huanhua Creek are capable of!

533
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,000
Ms. Ji,

534
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,760
just you wait!

535
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,200
You've humiliated your second uncle outside.

536
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
The Yang family won't let this slide!

537
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,920
President,

538
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,360
am I fit to be the new president?

539
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,240
You have to believe in yourself.

540
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
From now on,

541
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,440
Bloom Society will have only Mr. Chen as president,

542
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
not Ji Yingying.

543
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,200
We both came out of Bloom Society.

544
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,280
You carried the banner,

545
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
while I led the fights.

546
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,840
Reaching this point,

547
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,560
I should step up.

548
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,560
But I still feel

549
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,480
there's quite a gap between us.

550
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,320
Get the banner. Let's head to Huanhua Creek

551
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,160
to hold the ceremony for the new president!

552
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,280
Got it. I'll get it!

553
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,600
Let's go.

554
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,920
Let's go.

555
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,800
Let's go, new president.

556
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,640
Stop teasing me.

557
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:17,760
Shisi,

558
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,160
don't be jealous.

559
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,960
Next time, it's your turn.

560
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
What are you writing?

561
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,960
"Yang Jinglan, male,

562
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,440
from Yizhou.

563
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,240
In his youth, he loved horseback riding and swordplay..."

564
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:46,800
What?

565
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,600
Are you writing your own confession?

566
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,000
She wants to understand me more deeply,

567
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,080
and I want to tell her.

568
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,800
Right now, the two of us

569
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,040
are growing closer.

570
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,360
How much closer do you want to be

571
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,960
now that you're already married?

572
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,360
Marriage

573
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,800
makes some things harder to say.

574
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,800
No matter what,

575
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,080
I wish you both

576
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,040
harmony and happiness.

577
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,560
May you grow old together.

578
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,800
Marriage is just a stopgap measure.

579
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
A stopgap measure?

580
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,600
What, are you planning to break it off?

581
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,600
Don't you want to marry her anymore?

582
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,840
What are you saying?

583
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,360
Is that what I meant?

584
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,400
I mean,

585
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,080
even if I married her,

586
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,240
I can't disregard her feelings.

587
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,080
For us, marriage

588
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,200
is the beginning of our relationship,

589
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,280
not the end.

590
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,440
What's wrong?

591
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,880
Not drinking anymore?

592
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,640
Ms. Yu told me

593
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,960
this is your favorite wine.

594
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,280
It is.

595
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,400
It's my favorite wine.

596
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,960
But Yingying told me

597
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,360
I shouldn't drink.

598
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,000
The foreign merchants are still under investigation.

599
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,920
Both openly and secretly,

600
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,680
many merchants head to Nanzhao.

601
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,160
It'll take some time to sort it all out.

602
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,200
Bai Sheng's place is also under surveillance.

603
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,160
But there are guards outside his residence,

604
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
so our people can't get too close.

605
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,160
Zhuge, send someone to Nanzhao again

606
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,560
and ask Gao to bring me something.

607
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,000
What thing?

608
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,040
Something that exposes

609
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,040
someone's true self.

610
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,360
The banner is here!

611
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,400
Back then, we came together

612
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,670
because the big dyehouses forced us into a corner.

613
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
We were just trying to survive.

614
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,440
Eventually, we found a path to success.

615
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,960
Bloom Society thrived,

616
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,630
giving every small dyehouse

617
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,190
a way to prosper.

618
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,960
Mr. Chen,

619
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,760
today, I'm handing over the presidency of Bloom Society

620
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,670
to you.

621
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,190
Let me ask you,

622
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,720
do you still remember

623
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,040
the oath we swore when we founded Bloom Society?

624
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,600
We would never judge a person by their background,

625
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,000
never remain stagnant,

626
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,440
and never exclude outsiders.

627
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,840
Together, we would move forward,

628
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,640
making a name for ourselves in Yizhou!

629
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,280
What I achieved,

630
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,160
you have also achieved.

631
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,200
From now on,

632
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,440
you can establish the rules you see fit.

633
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,000
From this day forward,

634
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,200
Bloom Society will always have a place for you.

635
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,960
If Ji Yingying ever needs help,

636
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,040
Bloom Society will provide full support!

637
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,440
I told you to establish rules for Bloom Society,

638
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,240
not to pledge loyalty to me.

639
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,440
If Ji Yingying ever needs help,

640
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,440
Bloom Society will provide full support!

641
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,240
Pin!

642
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,320
If Ji Yingying ever needs help,

643
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,960
Bloom Society will provide full support!

644
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,080
If Ji Yingying ever needs help,

645
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,800
Bloom Society will provide full support!

646
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,680
If Ji Yingying ever needs help,

647
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,400
Bloom Society will provide full support!

648
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,240
If Ji Yingying ever needs help,

649
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,960
Bloom Society will provide full support!

650
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,720
Enough...

651
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,600
If Ji Yingying ever needs help,

652
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,320
Bloom Society will provide full support!

653
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,920
If Ji Yingying ever needs help,

654
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,000
Bloom Society will provide full support!

655
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,450
♪I walk these miles alone, through sleepless nights♪

656
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:41,020
♪Love in the wind, alive, it's everywhere we've been♪

657
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,600
♪Red blooms bright, but it dies all alone♪

658
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,720
All right.

659
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,800
Enough...

660
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,760
Isn't this Mr. Bai?

661
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,240
Long time no see.

662
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,320
What brings you here?

663
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,080
I'm here to see Ms. Ji.

664
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,800
You want to see Ms. Ji?

665
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,080
Why?

666
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,080
You can just talk to me.

667
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,720
Last time, I failed to offer help in your time of need.

668
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,640
Today,

669
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,240
I've come specifically to apologize.

670
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,440
Well,

671
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,400
hold on.

672
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,000
President...

673
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,880
No,

674
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,960
former president, I think there's a problem.

675
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,880
He didn't show up when we were in trouble.

676
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,800
I think you should be cautious.

677
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,040
I understand.

678
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,560
You all can go back now.

679
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,480
I'll hear

680
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,440
what Mr. Bai has to say.

681
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,040
Go ahead, Mr. Bai.

682
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,840
If it were to happen again,

683
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,040
I might still say the same thing.

684
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,320
That I should serve as a servant?

685
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,600
Serve as a servant?

686
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,840
Ms. Ji, have you misunderstood?

687
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,640
That was never my intention.

688
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,320
So you didn't come to apologize today after all.

689
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,360
Well,

690
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,760
I'm just a simple merchant.

691
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,640
Business is business.

692
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,680
Ruining things

693
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,240
with such a great business partner

694
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,480
is the last thing I want.

695
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,680
Besides,

696
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,800
in Yizhou's brocade industry,

697
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,800
I can't avoid you,

698
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,400
and you can't avoid me.

699
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,560
So why don't we shake hands and make peace?

700
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,200
Sheng Fengze...

701
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,280
Bai Sheng...

702
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,840
Could they be the same person?

703
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,200
It's possible.

704
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,040
I agree with your perspective.

705
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,200
We're in the same city,

706
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,000
why be at odds?

707
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,040
But a business partner who takes advantage of others' crises

708
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,120
is something I cannot accept.

709
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,640
Well,

710
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,320
Ms. Ji, your words

711
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,480
are quite disheartening to me.

712
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,760
All I did was name a price,

713
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,440
and you refused to accept it.

714
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,120
How is that taking advantage of someone in distress?

715
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,760
Besides,

716
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,440
I do have

717
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,560
genuine feelings for you.

718
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,440
I see now.

719
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,040
You didn't come to apologize today.

720
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,760
You came to confess your feelings.

721
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,360
Very well.

722
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,560
Thank you for your genuine feelings.

723
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,160
If there's nothing else,

724
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,480
I'll take my leave now.

725
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,880
Ms. Ji,

726
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,560
it's raining.

727
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,520
How about

728
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,320
I escort you home?

729
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,480
A light rain like this

730
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,000
is nothing to worry about.

731
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

732
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,720
Since you've already accepted

733
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,040
my genuine feelings,

734
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,400
then

735
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,720
holding an umbrella for you

736
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
and shielding you from the rain

737
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,320
shouldn't be surprising, right?

738
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,560
Dear!

739
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,200
It's raining.

740
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,840
I've come to take you home!

741
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,960
My husband is here to escort me home.

742
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,000
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

743
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,320
Thank you, Mr. Bai, for escorting my wife!

744
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,600
Mr. Yang, did your legs get injured like this

745
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,000
because you've walked too many dark paths at night?

746
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,960
Otherwise, it wouldn't be this serious.

747
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,760
So let me offer you some advice:

748
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
avoid walking dark paths at night.

749
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,280
Your fall might be even worse next time.

750
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,080
Dear,

751
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,040
let's go home.

752
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,080
Bai Sheng is very dangerous.

753
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,480
You shouldn't meet him alone.

754
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,320
And even more so,

755
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,120
you shouldn't get any closer to him.

756
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,840
I know what I'm doing.

757
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,200
On the surface,

758
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,680
Bai Sheng is still just a merchant.

759
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,960
His appearance in Yizhou as a businessman

760
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,720
is certainly no coincidence.

761
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,200
Since that's the case,

762
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,760
I still have a role to play in this matter.

763
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,680
You're planning to continue doing business with him?

764
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,560
That Bai Sheng...

765
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,840
if you ask me,

766
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
he's more interested in you

767
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,320
than in business.
