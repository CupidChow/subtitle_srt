[Episode 3]

3
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,360
The land of Shu always regards red silk as precious.

4
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,550
Mr. Ji's Shu Red Silk is even more renowned.

5
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,680
Ms. Ji, you dyed a lot of silks.

6
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,870
Why aren't any silks dyed red?

7
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,160
I'll dye any color I want.

8
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,550
Mr. Yang, it's none of your concern.

9
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,760
That's the main gate.

10
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,160
Please.

11
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,160
We have quite a number of guests today.

12
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,830
What is she doing here?

13
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,230
I don't know, either.

14
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,160
Yingying, come and greet Mrs. Zhao now.

15
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,670
Good morrow, Mrs. Zhao.

16
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,470
Although your family is not a noble household,

17
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,000
there's no reason for your daughter

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,630
to be running around every day.

19
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,720
It's one thing when she spends all her time outside.

20
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,960
However, she even brings men to the house.

21
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,080
It's a minor matter

22
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,630
if Ms. Ji's reputation is tarnished when this spreads,

23
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,630
but what of your family's honor?

24
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,190
You misunderstood me.

25
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,270
He's here to meet Yaoting for business.

26
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,720
I just happened to chance upon him.

27
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:37,470
Yes.

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,600
It's just a friendly reminder.

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,670
Pay no mind to me

30
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,830
if you think it is no trouble.

31
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,030
I fear that should something disgraceful

32
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,670
happen one day,

33
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,270
it will be too late for regrets by then.

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,670
You're right, Mrs. Zhao.

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,880
Even a misunderstanding

36
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,630
could make those who are clueless tattle.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,030
I'll make sure to discipline her so as to avert

38
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,630
even the smallest mistake.

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,080
However, I believe

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,960
a sharp person like you

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,520
would not misunderstand.

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,080
Come, Mrs. Zhao. This way.

43
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,390
It turns out that even you

44
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,320
have moments of meekness and grace.

45
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,270
You have visited my home.

46
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,960
I have kept my end of the bargain.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,320
You can get your drink from another house now.

48
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,910
Mrs. Ji, I will take my leave now.

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,600
Ting.

50
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,320
Stop right there!

51
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,670
Mother, I'm wrong.

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,630
Mother, stay away!

53
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,080
- Mother! - Ji Yingying!

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,000
Get here now.

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,000

58
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,670
Don't hit me!

59
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,240
Ji Yingying.

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,520
Don't...!

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,550
Get here now!

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,550
- Mother! - Who was that man?

63
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,960
Mother...

64
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,270
That was Mr. Yang.

65
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,110
He's doing business with our family.

66
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,790
Business?

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,480
Is that true?

68
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,320
Do you think you can fool me

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,230
just because I'm no longer in charge?

70
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,510
His clothing alone made it clear

71
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,070
that he is no ordinary folk.

72
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,040
Why would he do business with us?

73
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,110
He came to inquire about Shu Red Silk.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,670
Shu Red Silk?

75
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,670
Shu Red Silk again?

76
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,950
It has been so many years.

77
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,270
These people won't stop.

[Brocade Bureau]
You're here early.

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,480
Did Chief Sang truly agree to post the notice

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
to stop the monopolization of the creek?

82
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,880
It's all thanks to me.

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,480
You should

84
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,320
have done it earlier.

85
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,440
Is your father as unreliable

86
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,880
as you too?

87
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,230
My father is a dignified

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,720
and respected government officer

89
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,230
of the country.

90
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,600
You think he's unreliable?

91
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,350
What did you mean?

92
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,350
Did you just call me unreliable?

93
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,720
Listen. Show some respect to the honorary president.

94
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,160
Now listen to me.

95
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,510
If you succeed this time,

96
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,640
I'll give you a deep bow

Chief Sang.

101
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,720
Hurry up and put up the notice.

102

103
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,390
What trouble are you causing?

104
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,550
Go home now!

105
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,550
Chief Sang,

106
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,070
Huanhua Creek is in constant turmoil.

107
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,070
Do you have a solution?

108
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,720
This is no longer

109

under my control.

110
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,070
Not under your control?

111
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,510
Funnily enough,

112
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,480
I'm only temporarily filling the spot of a brocade officer.

113
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,160
The newly transferred brocade officer has arrived.

114
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,510
It has been over a month.

115
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,070
And yet, he is nowhere to be seen.

116
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,000
Perhaps he

117
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,160
is afraid to come.

118
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,640
All of you know Mr. Shen,

119
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,270
the previous brocade officer who died

120
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,720
two years upon his arrival.

121
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,110
Mr. Zhang, the one before him, fell off a horse and died.

122
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,760
The previous one...

123
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,830
Chief Sang,

124
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,720
we rely on this to make ends meet.

125
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
This is important.

126
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,670
Do you know who is in charge

127
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,000
of this matter now?

128
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes, Father.

129
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,040
Get to the point...!

130
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,670
Hold your tongue!

131
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,950
Yesterday

132
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,440
was the deadline for the new brocade officer to take office.

133
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,320
We all thought he was not coming.

134
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,350
Who would have thought that the new brocade officer

135
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,550
took office just as the deadline was about to pass?

136
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,480
Naturally, I stepped down.

137
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
From henceforth,

138
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,230
I will continue my duties,

139
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,670
while the brocade officer will continue his.

140
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,880
You will have to look

141
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,270
for him for this matter.

142
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,480
Why did he have

143
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,270
to take office

144
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,670
yesterday?

145
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,480
Exactly.

146
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,640
What is the new brocade officer like?

00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,390

Hold your tongue!

155
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,480
Stop him!

156
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,720
Don't worry, I got this.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,760
Enough...

158
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,320
Chief Sang,

159
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,880
your attitude has changed.

160
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,040
I don't think it's just because of the new officer, right?

161
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,070
This is the army's arrow.

Who have we crossed?

163
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,640

I have

202
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,640
made up my mind not to see

203
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,150
anyone in the days to come.

204
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
Appearing at the most crucial moment

205
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
is how you leave a great impression.

Yes.

212
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,080
It concerns life and death! I humbly ask for permission!

213
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,640
Stop it.

He won't open the door.

He does not want to see us.

217

Do not fret.

218
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,080
Since all the orders

219
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,280
are from families with large dyeing business,

220
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,470
they must have places to wash silk.

221
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,350
I'll discuss with them

222
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,080
and see if they can lend their place to us.

223
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,760

She has not sent

229
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,350
a single servant to inquire us as of today.

232
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,760
Right. What does it mean?

233
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,520
She already knows the outcome of today.

234
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,000
She has probably cut off

all our means of survival.

Is Mrs. Hua that impressive?

She didn't dominate Huanhua Creek for more than a decade

238
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,910
by just being rude and overbearing.

239

Now I cannot be bothered with such charity.

If all your money is used for compensation,

Before you do,

379
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,880
I can charge interest according to the contract,

380
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,910
can I not?

381
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,790
Can you afford that?

382
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,910
Take their things.

383
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,880
Stop!

384
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,960
Leave it alone!

385
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,880
Put it down!

386
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:34,760
Put it back!

387
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,760
Hands off!

388
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,030
What are you doing?

389
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,760
Are you making a scene

390
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,030
because you outnumber us?

391
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,110
I am not like your old debtors

392
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,960
whom you can send away without a thought!

393
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,320
I have the right to decide

394
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,670
what to use

395
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,670
to offset the debt.

396
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,150
Gui,

397
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,280
give Mrs. Hua all the raw silk and dye from the dyehouse

398
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,470
to offset the debt.

399
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,110
Ms. Ji,

400
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,910
if we gave them all the silk,

401
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,080
what would we work with?

402
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,150
If we fail to submit...

403
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,080
That loom belongs to my brother. We can't give it to them!

404
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,470
There is nothing they cannot have.

405
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,520
Give it to them.

406
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,520
Yaoting...

407
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,110
I believe that one day,

408
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,910
we will be able to redeem it.

409
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,880
Alright.

410
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,910
I hereby accept

411
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,320
the interest for this month.

412
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,470
When I come knocking next month, I expect you

413
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,910
to have gathered the funds by then, Ms. Ji.

414
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,150
If not,

415
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,200
all of you will be working for me.

416
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,670
Rest assured, Mrs. Hua.

417
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,350
You will not have your way.

418
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,790
Step aside!

419
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,400
Shoo!

420
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:39,960
Get off!

421
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,220
Go away!

422
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:41,350
Hey!

423
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,670
Go away!

424
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,760
Take it away!

425
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,280
Mother!

426
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,280
I sent Mother to our aunt's house this morning.

427
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,960
She will be in Ba County for a while.

428
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,070
You said it yourself. If everything is fine, nothing happens.

429
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,920
If something crops up,

430
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,040
send Mother out for a walk.

431
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,830
You are opposing Mrs. Hua, so I know

432
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,070
something will arise for sure.

433
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:16,880
I already expected her

434
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,880
to come knocking to collect the debt.

435
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,110
I did not expect her to take advantage of the situation

436
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,470
to make us work for her!

437
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,520
We still have things at home,

438
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,280
which should be enough

439
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,430
to offset the debt.

440
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,520
We will not have to work for her.

441
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,350
If we give them any more things,

442
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,040
we will end up with nothing again.

443
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,110
No. That must not happen.

444
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,920
Pin, come with me.

445
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,950
What is our mission here?

446
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,160
Tell me again.

447
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,590
Reproduce the Shu Red Silk,

448
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,430
get to the bottom of the murder,

449
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,070
and reform the brocade industry in Yizhou.

450
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,760
So...

451
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,680
The duck in San Hua Pavilion should be ready now.

452
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,400
Prepare the sedan chair. We are going out the back door.

453
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,280
It is the second watch of the Hai hour.

454
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,520
Shut your doors and windows

455
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,040
in case of burglars.

456
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,070
So? Do I look like someone from the Sang family?

457
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,830
Yes.

458
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,190
You just look a little...

459
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,680
A little what?

460
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,430
A little...

461
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,350
A little fun.

462
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
Excellent.

463
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,110
Have you never thought of getting help from Mr. Zhao?

464
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,070
I like him

465
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,520
because he understands and respects me.

466
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,310
He makes me happy,

467
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,590
but that is not because he can help me.

468
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,760
When my father was alive,

469
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,310
everyone was nice to me.

470
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,310
However, when something happened to my family,

471
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,310
only a few of them helped us out.

472
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Hence, I learned that

473
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,520
it is fine to seek and accept help,

474
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,310
but I cannot depend on others' help alone.

475
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,160
Only I will never let myself down.

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,190
However, Pin, you are certainly different.

477
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,710
I am sure you will find

478
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,710
a dependable young man you like.

479
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,640
How pleasant it must be to be able to trust

480
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,950
and rely on someone.

481
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,680
Sadly, I probably cannot experience that anymore.

482
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,950
I only trust myself and my own hands.

483
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,680
Come along.

484
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,870
[Brocade Bureau]

485
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,710
Wait for me here.

486
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,350
Alright.

487
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,190
What is it?

488
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,950
Chief Sang forgot something at the bureau.

489
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,520
He has asked me to retrieve it for him.

490
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,110
What is it?

491
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,310
We will deliver it to him.

492
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,760
Since Chief Sang has sent me here in the middle of the night,

493
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,520
the item certainly should not be known to outsiders.

494
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,710
If you don't have a say on this,

495
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,520
perhaps you should

496
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,070
report to the new brocade officer for a decision on this matter.

497
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,350
He is not around.

498
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
Is that not even better?

499
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,230
You two will be

500
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,070
the ones doing Chief Sang a favor.

501
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,950
When I get back, I will tell Chief Sang

502
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,470
that it was all thanks to your leniency.

503
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,800
Are you out of your mind?

504
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,110
Please return and tell Chief Sang that

505
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:30,710
we would love to help,

506
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,190
but the new officer has given orders.

507
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,280
No one is allowed to enter.

508
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Try again tomorrow.

509
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,590
Please!

510
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,520
Chief Sang needs it urgently.

511
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,110
Please make an exception!

512
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,310
Hello?

513
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,040
Hey!

514
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,400
I never expected to get in today, anyway.

515
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,710
I was just testing the waters.

516
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,920
It was not entirely fruitless, either.

517
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,110
Those guards have always been greedy and tend to avoid trouble.

518
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,590
Just now, I tried to get past them in Chief Sang's name,

519
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,680
and I even gave them money,

520
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,000
but it was useless.

521
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,000
In other words, this new brocade officer

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,920
either promised them huge rewards

523
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,310
or terrible punishments.

524
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,680
He is not to be trifled with.

525
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,470
Isn't that bad?

526
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,430
He may be a tricky one,

527
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,400
but if he has something he wants, we can negotiate a deal.

528
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,160
However,

529
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,160
will he dare to order those great families around?

530
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,760
With the right price,

531
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,350
we can still strike a deal.

532
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,950
Let us wait at the back door. Come on.

533
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,310
You should change your clothes first.

534
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,110
Alright. I shall get changed.

535
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,280
We will get him this time!

536
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,160
The smoke will drive him out!

537
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,400
Sang Shisi!

538
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,880
- They are on our side. - Jiang Liu?

539
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,800
Ji Yingying,

540
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,920
you gave me a fright!

541
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,950
You are here, too?

542
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:01,950
What are you doing?

543
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,680
As you have predicted,

544
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,110
the other families refused to let us

545
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,110
wash silk at their place.

546
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,920
I went to your house to inform you,

547
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,710
but you were not home.

548
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,710
When I came out, I bumped into him.

549
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,070
He said he knew a way

550
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,560
to get us to meet the brocade officer.

551
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,920
I sneaked out to help you.

552
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,310
Well? Nice of me, right?

553
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,310
So, this is your idea?

554
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,110
He refused to come out,

555
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,110
so I will smoke him out.

556
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,710
Well? Smart, am I not?

557
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,680
Listen here.

558
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,760
This officer is a tricky one.

559
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,880
Do not do anything rash. We should go.

560
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,350
No matter how tricky he is, what can he do?

561
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,110
Beat me up?

562
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,190
What if he tells your father about it?

563
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,520
If he tells my father, then...

564
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:34,800
Then...

565
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,040
This really is not the way.

566
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:36,920
Oh, no!

567
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,400
Run!

568
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Put out the fire!

569
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,190
The fire!

570
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,710
Oh, yes! The fire!

571
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,430
Put it out.

572
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,040
There!

573
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,310
Who's there?

574
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,230
How dare you start a fire outside the Brocade Bureau?

575
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,830
We did not start a fire.

576
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,160
We were putting it out.

577
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,760
Yes, we just happened to pass by.

578
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,040
Just passing by!

579
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:02,800
Passing by...

580
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,310
Is anyone hurt?

581
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,560
Thank you for your concern, sir.

582
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,590
We are all in one piece.

583
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,430
I am glad to hear that.

584
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:13,830
You may leave now.

585

Great.

586

I told you it works!

587
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,680
Does that mean

588
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,680
you came here for me?

589
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,350
No!

590
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,190
He means to say that

591
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,640
it was fortunate you were on patrol, so you were not affected by the fire.

592
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,310
That's right.

593
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,040
Does that mean

594
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,680
I should be thanking you?

595
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,950
No...

596
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,760
This is our duty.

597
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,310

601
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,160

602
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,760

603

604
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,000
What is the cost of raw silk production this year?

605
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,880
How many dyes are needed to create indigo?

606
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,950
How much is a bolt...?

607
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,830
Why did you stop?

608
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,470
Not all brocade officers know about brocades, right?

609
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,160
They die quickly, after all.

610
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,040
Mr. Yang, you are a noble man.

611
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,350
I am sure you will live a good, long life.

612
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,350
Go on.

613
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,880
Are you not here to flatter me?

614
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,040
Surely you jest, Mr. Yang.

615
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,830
I was being sincere.

616
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,520
After all, you are handsome

617
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,640
and charming.

618
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,280
You are keen, needlessly harsh,

619
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,110

621
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,190
but soon to be crushed.

622
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,590
You did not mean that, did you, Ms. Ji?

623
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,350
You have even started

624
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,190
a fire in front of my bureau.

625
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,950
So, you are not here

626
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,470
just to flatter me, are you?

627
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,880
I am sure you know very well

628
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,880
what I want, Mr. Yang.

629
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,000
What do I get out of this?

630
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,000
You are a brocade officer,

631
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,230
but you hide your real appearance.

632
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
You must have your reasons.

633
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,110
However, I am not good with secrets.

634
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,590
Please forgive me

635
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,000
if I let anything slip.

636
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,800
Are you threatening me?

637
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,640
Oh, I would not dare to. Farewell.

638
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,950
Mr. Yang, do you want me

639
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,190
to scream right now?

640
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,160
Go ahead, then.

641
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,280
If something undesirable happens to me,

642
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,230
I cannot do anything

643
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,560
about Huanhua Creek.

644
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,110
You...!

645
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,430
If this drags on,

646
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,190
they will start suspecting.

647
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,280
Those three out there

648
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,190
seem quite fond of burning things.

649
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,760
Take them to the creek

650
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,590
and tell them to burn up that pile of branches.

651
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,800
They are not allowed to leave before then.

652
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,400
I...

653
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,430
I meant the one inside.

654
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,350
I did not drink soup today,

655
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,190
so I would like to make some myself.

656
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,800
Since you love playing with fire,

657
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,800
shall I take you to the kitchen?

658
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,070
You can boil water, add firewood, and make soup for me.

659
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,710
I will cut you in half!

660
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:43,160
I will split you, you vile officer!

661
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,560
You!

662
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,640
I will chop you up, vile officer!

663
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,560
Who are you cursing?

664
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,350
A vile officer.

665
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,280
I was not cursing you.

666
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,350
Are you a vile officer?

667
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,470
Look at you.

668
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,640
Look what a mess you made

669
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,000
of the Brocade Bureau.

670
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,800
The Shu brocade industry is in a mess, too.

671
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,190
You did not seem to care, though.

672
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,000
Greedy people always flock to places

673
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,000
where money can be earned.

674
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,190
When too many of them gather in one place,

675
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,190
they are bound to make a mess.

676
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,470
This is not something

677
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,920
you can settle overnight.

678
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,640
You are rushing just to add firewood,

679
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,640
so of course, you would make a mess of yourself.

680
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,830
Mr. Yang, do you know you are supposed to keep quiet

681
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,950
if you have never lived someone else's life?

682
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,160
To get out of a sticky situation,

683
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,470
do you add fuel to the fire,

684
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,760
or do you focus on the heart of the matter?

685
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,950
Shu red outshines all reds.

686
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,110
The Shu Red Silk was buried along with my father.

687
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,800
The empress has a garment made of Shu Red Silk,

688
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,280
but it was accidentally ruined.

689
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,040
If Shu red is reproduced

690
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,470
and the silk is made into a garment,

691
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,280
perhaps any injustice will be granted

692
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,760
a chance to be made right.

693
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,880
I do not know what you are talking about, Mr. Yang.

694
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,400
If you are asking about Shu red,

695
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
our family can no longer produce Shu Red Silk.

696
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,040
Shu red...

697
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,000
The Shu Red Silk may be missing,

698
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,190
but justice has to prevail.

699
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,040
That sounds familiar.

700
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,070
Do you know what the previous brocade officer

701
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,640
said to me?

702
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,520
What did he say?

703
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,160
I apologize.

704
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,190
What did he say?

705
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,590
He said that

706
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,000
I should only focus on my peaceful life

707
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,000
and that the officers will take care of justice.

708
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,800
You should do your part, too.

709
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,350
If you depend on him alone,

710
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,190
what can he do?

711
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,560
You will have to pick up where he left off, then.

712
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,190
Mr. Yang, will you not help me think of ways

713
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,280
to resolve my current predicament?

714
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,590
Ms. Ji, do you

715
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:24,280
only care about gains and losses at the moment?

716
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,430
How do you start a fire with that much firewood?

717
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,520
Enough. Stop this.

718
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,760
You may go home now.

00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,430
until you see her.

753
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,070
Also, many people

754
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,710
have gathered around the entrance of the bureau.

755
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,230
She was sobbing and wailing.

756
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,640
If outsiders

757
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,280
spread rumors of this matter,

758
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,520
you may be at a disadvantage.

759
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:03,640
You said

760
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,430
she was crying?

761
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,640
Yes.

762
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,040
Let her in, then.

763
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,000
After considering the stakes,

764
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,070
I took matters into my own hands

765
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,230
and brought her in.

766
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,190
You brought her in?

767
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:23,680
Where is she?

768
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
She is waiting at the entrance.

769
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,070
Why did you not tell me that sooner?

770
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,430
Come here and help me get dressed!

771
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,950
Where are my shoes?

772
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,830
Mr. Yang.

773
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,800
I shall take my leave now.

774
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,520
Greetings, Mr. Yang.

775
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,830
What brings you here?

776
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,830
I am here to apologize to you, Mr. Yang.

777
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,310
What did you do?

778
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,520
Did you think that crying

779
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,000
would soften my heart?

780
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,920
I do not fall for such tricks!

781
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,000
Huanhua Creek is where the people of Sandaoyan wash their silk.

782
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,160
In the past, the various families would wash their silk accordingly

783
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,190
and keep to themselves.

784
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
But now, a great family has taken over the place

785
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,310
and forbidden us from washing silk overnight.

786
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,280
I do not know what to do.

787
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,800
Please be the judge of this matter, Mr. Yang.

788
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,350
Even Chief Sang could not do anything about this.

789
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,710
Do you think I, a mere brocade officer, can resolve this?

790
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,070
Mr. Yang, you have achieved much despite your young age.

791
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,590
I am sure you are a brave man.

792
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,310
Do you mean that

793
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,560
Chief Sang is advanced in years and afraid

794
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,590
to offend those in power?

795
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,560
You said it, not me.

796
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,920
I can only see your courage

797
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,160
and no one else.

798
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,430
That was music to my ears.

799
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,280
We last met only recently,

800
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,150
but your speaking skills have vastly improved, Ms. Ji.

801
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,560
By the way, it has been quite hot these days.

802
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,320
It would be nice if someone could fan me.

803
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,120
Let me do it.

804
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,150
Are you doing it properly? I do not feel the wind.

805
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,670
My head is getting too cold.

806
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,390
My feet are getting cold.

807
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,950
Why did you stop?

808
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,390
Yang Jinglan!

809
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,520
Mr. Yang, please bring me justice.

810
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,280
Are you begging me?

811
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,520
Do you think I would help you

812
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,670
just because you begged me?

813
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,150
That day, by the creek,

814
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,560
you teased me,

815
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,150
but you also subdued the frightened horse.

816
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,840
At the entrance of my house,

817
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,760
thanks to your cooperation,

818
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,430
we managed to send Sang Shisi away.

819
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,560
Mr. Yang, even though you do not like me,

820
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,670
you are a kind man.

821
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,560
I will remain kneeling

822
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,080
and wager that you will have mercy on me.

823
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,040
Why did you not wager from the start?

824
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,150
I pity my bones.

825
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,430
Now, that is rare.

826
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,910
You finally spoke a word of truth.

827
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,000
However,

828
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,120
you have misjudged my character.

829
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,710
I do not have a heart.

830
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,630
I only care about my gains.

831
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,840
Do you know what the previous brocade officer

832
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,390
said to me?

833
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:14,870
What did he say?

834
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,800
True.

835
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,230
So, other than offering sincerity,

836
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,320
I have a deal to propose.

837
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,710
The previous brocade officer, Mr. Shen, told me that

838
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,040
if the next officer is a good person,

839
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,470
I should tell them the words

840
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,430
he left behind.

841
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,190
Ms. Ji,

842
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:36,080
would you trade anything at all?

843
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,280
I wanted to plead with our connection,

844
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,840
but you were not swayed.

845
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,740
[Notice: Huanhua Creek is now shared property for washing silk.

846
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,230
No one may claim it as their own. Offenders will be severely punished.]

847
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,840
You already had a plan!

848
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,800
I apologize for misunderstanding you.

849
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,280
Ms. Ji, you should put more trust in the bureau.

850
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,280
No matter my objectives,

851
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,230
I am now an officer.

852
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,000
So, of course, I will do what is expected of me.

853
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,630
[Notice]
Huanhua Creek

854
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,470
is now shared property

855
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,120
for washing silk.

856
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,230
No one may claim it as their own.

857
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,320
Offenders will be severely punished!

858
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,470
Great!

859
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,320
Good!

860
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,430
Mr. Yang, you have spoken up for the people.

861
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:29,080
The people of Yizhou will definitely remember your kindness.

862
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,000
However, you may not know this.

863
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,040
The brocade families of Yizhou are powerful.

864
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,190
Every one of them is quite influential.

865
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,630
You have only recently arrived,

866
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,840
so you may run into problems

867
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,430
that hinder the enforcement of laws.

868
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,230
I worry that your authority may be challenged.

869
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,190
Why did you not tell me before the notice was put up?

870
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,430
I only thought of it just now.

871
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,150
The brocade officer is here!

872
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,710
So, he is the brocade officer?

873
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,000
No wonder.

874
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,710
My name is Yang Jinglan.

875
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,000
I am the newly appointed brocade officer in Yizhou.

876
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:21,670
What?

877
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,190
Do you not believe me?

878
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,000
I did not expect you

879
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,800
to be the new brocade officer, Mr. Yang.

880
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,470
Mr. Hua, are you on an outing?

881
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,040
Surely you jest, Mr. Yang.

882
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,910
Come here!

883
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,280
Prepare another seat for Mr. Yang.

884
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,150
No need.

885
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,190
I clearly remember

886
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,760
the notice I put up

887
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,430
stating that other than those washing silk,

888
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,520
no one is to remain on the banks of Huanhua Creek.

889
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,670
What is this?

890
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,390
Have I remembered wrongly?

891
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,430
Or do you fancy yourself powerful enough that

892
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:59,000
you need not heed my orders, Mr. Hua?

893
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,390
Mr. Yang,

894
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,470
that is not the case.

895
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,470
I dare not even dream

896
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,320
of opposing the bureau.

897
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,950
Here.

898
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,040
Take a look.

899
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,430
Am I...

900
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,840
Am I not washing silk now?

901
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,190
This may not be a lot of silk,

902
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,360
but I did not disobey your laws.

903
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,150
You were washing silk, indeed.

904
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,520
But if you ask me,

905
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,150
since you have gathered your men here,

906
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,040
you must be waiting for me, right?

907
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,150
Mr. Yang, you have not been here for long,

908
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,280
so you must not know a lot about matters in Yizhou.

909
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,910
But please rest assured.

910
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,430
Our family is known

911
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,600
for being kind in this.

912
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,560
We can help you learn all about Yizhou as soon as possible.

913
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,950
"He can bark all he wants,

914
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,840
but I shall remain calm.

915
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,390
He can be stubborn all he wants,

916
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,560
but I shall remain unaffected."

917
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,710
Mr. Hua, you may not know this,

918
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,390
but I have been impatient since I was young.

919
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,910
To curb that impatience, my teacher

920
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,600
taught me those words.

921
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,190
He said that if I lose my patience,

922
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,120
I am to recite those words.

923
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,280
Mr. Yang, your teacher must have been quite enlightened.

924
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,950
There must be great wisdom in his words.

925
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:24,840
I think so, too.

926
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,630
However,

927
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,320
do you know

928
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,870
what the last sentence is?

929
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,360
I am but an ignorant fool.

930
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,190
Please enlighten me, Mr. Yang.

931
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,710
"If he does not stop barking,

932
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,760
I shall send him to hell."

933
00:40:59,280 --> 00:40:59,840
Yes!

934
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,470
Good one!

935
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,710
All hail Mr. Yang!

936
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,800
Get him!

937
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:25,000
What a show!

938
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,840
Everyone!

939
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:29,150
This is my first time being an officer,

940
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,520
so I do not know much about the position.

941
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,360
Even so, I know that orders must be followed

942
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,710
and promises must be kept.

943
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,360
From now on,

944
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,600
I will not tolerate anyone

945
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,320
going against the rules I have established.

946
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,430
If anyone disobeys the rules,

947
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,630
we shall see if his arguments

948
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,000
can win against my fists.

949
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,710
Is that clear?

950
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,040
Yes, sir! We'll do as you say, Mr. Yang!

951
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,840
Mr. Yang,

952
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I heard it loud and clear as well.

953
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,950
Can... Can I go up now?

954
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,760
I am freezing.

955
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,800
Mr. Hua, since you like this place so much,

956
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,360
I shall fulfill your wishes.

957
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,040
Stay in the water until nightfall,

958
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,560
not even two hours less.

959
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,390
They are dirtying the waters of Huanhua Creek.

960
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,670
Ms. Ji,

961
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,800
I have kept

962
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,600
my promise to you.

963
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,670
It is your turn now.

964
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,150
Mr. Shen's words are all written here.

965
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,560
Read it as you please, Mr. Yang.

966
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,840
I shall be off now.

967
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,800
Go!

968
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,360
Be a good officer

969
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,190
who speaks up for the people.
