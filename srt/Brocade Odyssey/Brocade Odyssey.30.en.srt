[Episode 30]

3
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,080
My mother has agreed to let me try,

4
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,480
but now I need a path for us to go through.

5
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,280
It's impossible to do it!

6
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,720
I have told you it's impossible to do it!

7
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,280
Why will you not listen to me?

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,120
Countless veterans didn't succeed in passing this path.

9
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,960
What makes you think you will succeed?

10
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,760
Do you think you are Zhang Qian?

11
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
Even Zhang Qian and his group

12
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,560
took many years

13
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,440
and many lives were lost to pass the path.

14
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,720
Don't you know that?

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,120
Yu, why are you getting so worked up?

16
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,720
I only want to warn you

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,480
that this path is truly perilous.

18
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,320
I know it is dangerous,

19
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,880
but isn't every new road in this world

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,470
forged through risk?

21
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,680
This road is different!

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
It is called the Valley of Death.

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
My father died there long ago.

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,760
Just like you, he was full of ambition,

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,680
hoping to carve a new path for the merchants.

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,880
But what's the result?

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,280
My mother and I kept waiting,

28
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
and he never returned

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,360
from that road.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,080
Yu.

31
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,920
Most wrong paths allow you to turn back,

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
but a road of life and death

33
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
offers

34
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,840
no second chances.

[San Hua Pavilion]

36
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
Ms. Ji, I have heard

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,120
that you are seeking

38
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,480
a trade route from Yizhou to Tubo.

39
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,040
I brought a map for you today,

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,840
hoping it might help resolve your dilemma.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,800
Why do you always appear and offer to help

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
whenever I venture into business, Mr. Bai?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,160
Tell me, are you truly my benefactor,

44
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,280
or...

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,560
Or what?

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,320
Or do you have

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,800
some other motives?

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,840
You have guessed correctly, Ms. Ji.

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
I do have ulterior motives

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
for my visit here today.

51
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,080
I wish to accompany you on your journey.

52
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,000
Forging a new trade route

53
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,400
is fraught with danger.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,600
Why would a man of your status

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,680
risk such peril?

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,280
What do you seek?

57
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,680
It is nothing extraordinary.

58
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,040
Just two simple things.

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,830
Fame and fortune.

60
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,200
Let's start with fortune.

61
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,400
The greater the risk

62
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,760
in establishing a new trade route,

63
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,840
the greater the reward.

64
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,480
There are swamps, bandits...

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,440
Many

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,400
are blinded

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,560
by the dangers on the surface

68
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
and fail to see this.

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,240
If a new route

70
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,360
is successfully forged,

71
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,200
it will not just carry Shu brocade.

72
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,200
There will be carpets, spices,

73
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,360
herbs, and silk.

74
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,280
Each is worth a fortune.

75
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,840
And as for fame?

76
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
To be the one who forges such a path,

77
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,000
my name will be remembered by all.

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,880
It will be etched into history

79
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,120
and immortalized for generations.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,760
Is it not an enticing prospect?

81
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,280
It is rather tempting.

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
But I still do not understand.

83
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,640
With your wealth,

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,800
ambition,

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,600
and this map in hand,

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,840
why not simply hire others to pave the way?

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,600
When it comes to it,

88
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,640
Shu brocade originates from Yizhou

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,760
and from the Tang Empire itself.

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,600
In the eyes of foreign merchants,

91
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,200
only the Tang Empire can truly be called a majestic empire.

92
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,400
Only the Tang Empire could produce

93
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,160
such rare treasures.

94
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,240
Every piece is indeed a masterpiece.

95
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,280
As for me,

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,360
I am merely a merchant from Nanzhao.

97
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,040
My origins are far from remarkable.

98
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,680
What is more, the road ahead

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,280
is filled with checkpoints.

100
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
The documents of the Tang Empire

101
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,040
will be quite useful.

102
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,840
It is rare to hear you speak with such humility, Mr. Bai.

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Ms. Ji,

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,760
would you like to hear the truth?

105
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
Why? Were you not honest earlier?

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,600
I was honest earlier,

107
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,760
but it was not the most important truth.

108
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,720
The most important reason

109
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,280
is that I wish to travel alongside you.

110
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
If it were anyone else,

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,200
I might not have agreed to go.

112
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,480
What do you mean by that, Mr. Bai?

113
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,120
I mean, Ms. Ji,

114
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,480
you have a way of surprising me,

115
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,040
and

116
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
I happen to enjoy surprises.

117
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
I will take that as a compliment, Mr. Bai.

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,240
But this map is incomplete.

119
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,880
Indeed, there are parts of the route

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,160
that even I do not know how to go.

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,840
But again,

122
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
if the path was such one

123
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,200
that we both knew,

124
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,480
how could it truly be called an exploration?

[The Yang Residence]

126
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,840
Bai Sheng doesn't tend

127
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,640
to act without purpose.

128
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,520
But this time he volunteered for this journey,

129
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,400
I think something must be wrong here.

130
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,640
The trade route is already perilous.

131
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,040
Adding a dangerous man like him

132
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,640
will only double the risk.

133
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,240
Yingying,

134
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,720
accusing a foreign prince

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,640
over a single piece of tribute brocade

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
might seem like making a big deal out of nothing

137
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,120
to the court.

138
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,720
This is why I must gather more evidence

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,960
to prove

140
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,440
Prince Bai and Niu Jin's collusion.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,880
Only then will my senior in Chang'an

142
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,080
have the leverage he needs to negotiate.

143
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,480
But for now, here in Yizhou,

144
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,680
he will not make a move unless I do,

145
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,640
and I will not act unless he does.

146
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,240
We are at a stalemate.

147

the worse it is for us.

149
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,240
If he is taking action now,

150
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,040
it is certainly with a plan in mind.

151
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,080
But I have come up with a plan myself.

152
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
What is your plan?

153
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,920
Do you want to know?

154
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,760
Who says

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,080
evidence must always be written on paper?

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,880
Yang Jinglan,

157
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,400
during the years you wandered around,

158
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,480
there must have been many people who hated you.

159
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,000
Back then, I did not have the wisdom I do now.

160
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,640
It is all thanks to your guidance, Yingying.

161
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,240
Since there is no clear path,

162
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
why not give it a try?

163
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
Your idea

164
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,920
is indeed risky.

165
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,720
But what if...

166
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,840
What's this...?

167
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,200
When I was in the north,

168
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
someone told me this.

169
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Hunters there often go deep into the mountains

170
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,320
to cut a specific type of wood.

171
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,280
They carve it into beads

172
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,240
and string them together as bracelets

173
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,840
to give to their wives.

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,800
It is called Never Lost.

175
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,840
Never Lost?

176
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,920
Never abandon each other

177
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,320
and never stray from one's heart.

you and I

181
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,920
will never lose each other.

teach me a few more moves.

Something easy to learn yet effective.

187
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,960
That way,

188
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,320
if we ever face danger

189
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,880
and you are not by my side,

190
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,200
I will be able to protect myself.

191
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,080
Just like last time.

192
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,920
Something like this.

193
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
A deadly move!

194
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,080
All right.

195
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,440
Face me.

196
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,240
Use your right hand and strike here.

197
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,640
On your face?

198
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,920
- Yang Jinglan! - This is the ultimate move.

199
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,680
It is called "When all else fails, seek your husband".

200
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,240
I did not mean to hide this from you all.

201
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,640
It is just that this journey will be fraught with challenges,

202
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,640
and I did not want you to worry.

203
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,840
We are not worried.

204
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,240
Bloom Society is also working to cut a new trade route.

205
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,600
We simply happen to be heading in the same direction as you.

206
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,240
What trade route will you cut?

207
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,080
Are you traveling thousands of miles just to sell silk?

208
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,560
Mr. Yu has entrusted us

209
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,920
to sell his brocade.

210
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,920
Besides, the first batch of brocade from Ji's Brocade Workshop

211
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,480
is ready

212
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,920
to see the world although the quantity is small.

213
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,800
Yaoting,

214
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,400
why are you indulging in their nonsense too?

215
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
Let us do it this way.

216
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,440
You wait until I secure the new trade route.

217
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
It will not be too late for you to start.

218
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,480
Enough.

219
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,800
I, Jiang Liu, and Pin

220
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,600
will stay behind to manage the business.

221
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
Sheng Dalang, Sang Shisi, and your brother

222
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,320
will take a few men and travel with you.

223
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,040
Let me make one thing clear.

224
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,840
I am not scared.

225
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,440
We decided by a game of dice,

226
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,600
and I lost.

227
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,480
It is just bad luck on my part.

228
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,840
When it comes to martial arts,

229
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,560
I may not be

230
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,640
as skilled as Mr. Yang.

231
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
But with me among us,

232
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
with my noble appetite...

233
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,640
You mean noble lineage!

234
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,040
Oh, who cares!

235
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,640
Who would dare to trouble us?

236
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
As for me,

237
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,120
I have packed all the medicine we will need.

238
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,920
Medicine for men

239
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
and women,

240
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
colds

241
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,640
and rashes,

242
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,760
calming the nerves,

243
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
protecting the hearts,

244
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,280
and even for pregnancy.

245
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,480
Everything we could possibly need is ready.

246
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,360
Bringing me along

247
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,240
is like having a physician at your side!

248
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,040
Wait a moment.

249
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,440
Medicine for pregnancy?

250
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,600
Just in case...

251
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,680
It is always better to be prepared!

252
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,560
Yingying,

253
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,720
here's a protective charm I prayed for.

254
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,760
Take it with you and be extra careful on the road.

255
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,680
I originally wanted to join you,

256
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,240
but my mother is sick.

257
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
She's sick?

258
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,600
When did she fall ill? Is it serious?

259
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,440
Apparently, she became ill as soon as she heard I planned to leave.

260
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,240
It is just a heartache. Nothing major.

261
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,640
I am sure once you have departed,

262
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,440
she will recover.

263
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,240
I will make a bet with you.

264
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,480
When you return safely,

265
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,720
I will have convinced her

266
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,200
to let me live the life I want.

267
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,400
You all stay here and help Pin.

268
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,400
No way!

269
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,920
Don't you want to help her?

270
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,440
What if you and Mr. Yang end up dead?

271
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,200
That is not what I mean!

272
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,720
What I mean is that

273
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,760
I am not the type to abandon my friends for a woman.

274
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,280
Right?

275
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,240
A true hero might have his heart set on a fair maiden,

276
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,880
but his ambition must span the world.

277
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,320
After traveling thousands of miles,

278
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,840
only then should he return in glory

279
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,800
to share his heart with his beloved.

280
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,440
Will your father approve of it?

281
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,040
My father has no say over me.

282
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,920
As long as he does not tie me down,

283
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,840
I will go!

284
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,440
All right...!

285
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,400
It is settled.

286
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,280
If you agree,

287
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,240
we will go together.

288
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
If you do not agree,

289
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,840
we will simply follow you from behind.

290
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,640
Even Mother said

291
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,320
if you agreed, we would go together.

292
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,280
If you did not agree,

293
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,840
we would simply follow you from behind.

294
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Yingying,

295
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,840
Bloom Society will always have a place for you.

296
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,640
If Ji Yingying ever needs assistance,

297
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,280
Bloom Society will do everything to help!

298
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,640
Very well, let's go together.

299
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,080
Shoulder to shoulder,

300
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,120
through storms and strife.

301
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,800
The father and son from the Yang family have arrived in Chang'an.

302
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,760
Who among the nobles does not know it is all a setup?

303
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,360
But Yang Brocade's reputation is already ruined.

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
No amount of explanation will sway the nobles.

305
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,480
If you are still worried,

306
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,560
I can meet with the Zheng family again.

307
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,240
What does it matter if they know?

308
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,680
As long as tomorrow's order is signed,

309
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,920
they can scheme all they want,

310
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,440
but it will not change a thing.

311
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,400
Very well.

312
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,680
I will take my leave.

313
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,960
Sir,

314
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,560
we have news from Yizhou.

315
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,840
Ms. Ji plans to explore a trade route with foreign merchants.

316
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
She will be departing in a few days.

317
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,040
What about Bai Sheng?

318
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,840
Why has he not stopped her?

319
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,840
Bai Sheng

320
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,800
is going with her.

321
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,160
What?

322
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Pack our things immediately.

323
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,760
We are leaving at once!

324
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,480
What about the merchants waiting to sign the orders?

325
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,360
Should we just ignore them?

326
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,400
Zhao Ping,

327
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,080
after all these years of working for me,

328
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,760
have you still not learned what matters most?

329
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,240
Understood.

330
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,390
[Yuebuhuan Inn]

331
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,830
Finely embroidered pouches made with the best silk threads.

332
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,040
Take a look!

333
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,880
Finely embroidered pouches and handkerchiefs made with the best silk threads.

334
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,280
No, I do not need them.

335
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:41,160
Finely embroidered pouches and handkerchiefs made with the best silk threads.

336
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,320
Come and see!

337
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,760
Eat this.

338
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,920
I am not hungry.

339
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,320
I did not sell a single handkerchief today.

340
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,240
Here, take this.

341
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,920
Is my embroidery skill really that bad?

342
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,600
They are pretty bad.

343
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,360
But at least the stitches are sturdy.

344
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,600
The pouch

345
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,550
is just used to hold money.

346
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,240
All right. I will take this as payment for your food.

347
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,600
Eat slowly.

348
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,030
Thank you, miss!

349
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,720
Whenever you come to the city to sell your goods,

350
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
you will always have food waiting for you.

351
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,280
It is not easy for a woman to do business.

352
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,560
Do your best.

353
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,320
Thank you.

354
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,360
It is nothing.

355
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,440
It is not easy for a woman to do business.

356
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,560
Do your best.

357
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
Tell me,

358
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,840
do you think a woman can really succeed in doing business?

359
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,040
Who cares? Just keep doing it.

360
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,520
After all, aren't all the new roads in this world

361
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,840
forged through determination?

362
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,320
Do you bring only one companion, Mr. Bai?

363
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,600
With Mr. Yang here,

364
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,520
my safety is guaranteed.

365
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,000
That is fine.

366
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,760
But a caravan has its rules.

367
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
We must agree on the terms.

368
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,760
First,

369
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,360
the caravan is large and complex.

370
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,800
Everyone must follow the orders of the leader,

371
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,960
who is me.

372
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,040
Otherwise, the penalty is death.

373
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,120
Second,

374
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,360
no one may act independently.

375
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,360
Otherwise, the penalty is death.

376
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,200
Third,

377
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,160
my wife

378
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,120
is the core of this caravan.

379
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,440
No one is allowed to approach her without permission.

380
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,040
Otherwise, the penalty is death.

381
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
Three death penalties.

382
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,160
Fine.

383
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,040
You are very bold, Mr. Yang.

384
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,720
It may not apply to everyone,

385
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,560
but when it comes to you, Mr. Bai,

386
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,160
I will enforce it strictly.

387
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,800
I understand.

388
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,200
Thank you for the reminder, Mr. Yang.

389
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,760
All right. Everyone is here.

390
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,800
The day is getting late. Let's set out.

00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,360
Wait a moment!

393
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,120
I am coming with you!

Did you not...

395
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,680
You are right.

396

All roads are made by people brave enough.

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,080
I must

398
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
give this one a try.

399
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,920
What about your inn?

400
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
My inn can always reopen,

401
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
but meeting kindred spirits like this

402
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,160
is very rare.

403
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,960
Besides, I need to protect her.

404
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,720
Very well.

There is a cliff beside us!

Sang Shisi,

414
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,640
you must believe in yourself.

415
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,640
You can do this!

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,480

Sir,

421
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,880
Ms. Ji left three days ago.

422
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,880
The Yang family gathered

423
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,320
the best caravan in the city,

424
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,480
with Yang Jinglan as the leader.

425
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,080
It is said the map was provided by Bai Sheng,

426
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,080
but Yang Jinglan does not trust him,

427
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
so he insisted Bai Sheng accompany them.

428
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,280
What exactly is Bai Sheng planning?

429
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,640
With Yang Jinglan and a group of skilled guards along,

430
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,760
at least

431
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,320
you do not have to worry about Ms. Ji's safety.

432
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,520
The more prepared they are,

433
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,080
the more dangerous the journey must be.

434
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,640
As for Bai Sheng...

435
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Whatever their intentions,

436
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,680
Ji Yingying is not one to sit idly by.

If she dared to go,

438
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,720
she must be confident in her safe return.

but they also offer annual leave.

00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600

468
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,840
It means he understands

469
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,040
the gravity of the situation there.

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,200

It is likely he is doing the same.

481
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,960
is nothing but danger.

482
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,800

483
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,200

hasn't every road we have taken been perilous?

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,000

Mr. Bai said

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,000
you would come looking for me.

491
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,240

492
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,400
for you.

493
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,440
What is it?

494
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,760
He said

495
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,440
the Yang family

496
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,960
is currently in dire straits,

497
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,040
and you must help me become the patriarch of the Yang family.

498
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,080
That way, he can take what he wants,

499
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,480
and you will get what you desire.

500
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,960
Is that all?

501
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,000
Yes.

502
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,720
Then you are of no further use to me.

503
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,400
Wait...!

504
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:20,840
Mr. Zhao!

505
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,000
What are you doing,

506
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,960
Mr. Zhao?

507
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,800
Mr. Bai said

508
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,600
you were here to help me!

509
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,480
You...!

510
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,040
If you have any questions, just ask!

511
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,120
Just ask me!

512
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,800
I will tell you everything I know!

513
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,000
Have they mentioned when they will return?

514
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,480
No...!

515
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,360
But I assume he will return.

516
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,200
He said that once I became the patriarch of the Yang family,

517
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,560
he would take something from the Yang family.

518
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,600
But I am not the patriarch yet,

519
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,280
and he has not taken anything,

520
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,360
and yet he has left.

521
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,480
So I guess

522
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,400
he must come back.

523
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,160
When he does, Ji Yingying will likely return too.

524
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,800
What about

525
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,800
the brocade workshop in Mianzhou that spent extravagantly to recruit workers?

526
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,280
Was that his doing?

527
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,960
That I do not know.

528
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,440
I only heard about it today.

529
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,040
But I do not think

530
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,800
it has anything to do with Mr. Bai.

531
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,000
If he wanted to open a brocade workshop,

532
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,040
he could have done it in Yizhou.

533
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,000
Why go all the way to Mianzhou?

534
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,480
Tell me about the current situation in the Yang family.

535
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,040
All right...!

536
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,240
Currently,

537
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,800
Juxian and my two nephews

538
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,160
are negotiating in Chang'an,

539
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,000
as you are likely aware.

540
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,400
My sister-in-law is managing the affairs at home.

541
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,400
The Yang family has not treated you poorly.

542
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,000
And yet, for double the wages,

543
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
you are ready to leave?

544
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,080
Madam.

545
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,080
Send someone to deliver a letter to Chang'an.

546
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,160
Have Jingshan return as soon as possible.

547
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,800
From today forward,

548
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,880
whatever wages

549
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,160
the brocade workshop in Mianzhou offers,

550
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,480
we will match them.

551
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,200
Everyone, think carefully.

552
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,400
Do you wish to leave your home,

553
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,800
or continue to stay here?

554
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,720
The brocade workshop in Mianzhou has now recruited

555
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
50 first-class weavers

556
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,480
and 107 second-class weavers.

557
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,880
There have not been any suspicions, have there?

558
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,440
Using high wages to poach talent

559
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,640
may not be the most honorable tactic,

560
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,840
but it is common enough in business.

561
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,920
Besides, we are spending real money here.

562
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,920
Even when officers from Brocade Bureau came to inspect,

563
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,640
they found no faults.

564
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,720
Instead, their visit confirmed the benefits we are offering

565
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,520
to be real,

566
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,560
attracting even more craftsmen.

567
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,480
However...

568
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,040
What is it?

569
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,280
Some of the craftsmen on the prince's list

570
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,640
are key figures in their respective workshops.

571
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,440
They are well-treated

572
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,840
and have strong ties to their current employers.

573
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,880
I am afraid

574
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,720
no matter how much we increase their wages,

575
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,480
they are unlikely to come here.

576
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
As for them,

577
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,720
we will infiltrate quietly

578
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,080
and take them directly when the time comes.

579
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:18,920
Understood.

580
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,040
When will we act

581
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,720
against the workshop?

582
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,360
Come in.

583
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,720
Ms. Ning!

584
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,120
Why are you anxious?

585
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,280
Quick, deliver this letter to His Highness!

586
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,440
Understood.

587
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,240
According to the map,

588
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,280
there is no path ahead.

589
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,680
The cartographer said this forest is called the Valley of Death.

590
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,080
It is the shortest route to Tubo

591
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,160
but also the most dangerous.

592
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,560
If we take a detour,

593
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,640
it will add five to six times the travel time.

594
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
And whether new dangers arise on the alternative route

595
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,120
is anyone's guess.

596
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,680
The Valley of Death?

597
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
It is getting late.

598
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,680
We will rest here for the night.

599
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,480
The night is cold.

600
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,320
Have some hot soup.

601
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,680
Thank you.

602
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,840
I have also lost loved ones,

603
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,440
so I understand how it feels.

604
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,480
No matter what others say, it does not help.

605
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,520
It is because you will not listen.

606
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,760
Your heart

607
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,440
is filled with the one you will never see again.

608
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,320
You replay your memories,

609
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,880
wishing it was all a dream.

610
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,920
But when you open your eyes...

611
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,360
I realize at least Yingying is still here,

612
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,760
my mother is still here,

613
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,480
and I am not alone.

614
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,280
Thankfully, this world still holds affection,

615
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,440
family,

616
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,440
and friends.

617
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,120
My father

618
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,280
would have wanted us

619
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,840
to protect those around us

620
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,680
and embrace new journeys.

621
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,080
They said

622
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,920
my father

623
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,440
remained in this forest all those years ago,

624
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,720
but no one has ever told me

625
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480
how he died.

626
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,760
It's said that he died

627
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,080
protecting the cargo.

628
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,280
His body was never recovered.

629
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,880
I am here now.

630
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,840
But what is the point?

631
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,560
I lost him long ago.

632
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,110
He has always been here.

633
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,880
I can weave brocade,

634
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,280
and Yingying can dye silk.

635
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,150
These were all things our father taught us.

636
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,880
A part of him lives on in our memories and skills,

637
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,760
staying with us forever,

638
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,920
and protecting us.

639
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,110
It is the same for you.

640
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,240
Your father

641
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,280
gave you the skills and wisdom.

642
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,080
He instilled in you a broad perspective and a strong heart.

643
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,920
He has always been by your side.

644
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,110
I

645
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,150
will always stand

646
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,480
where you can see me with just one glance.

647
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,960
If you feel like talking, call me.

648
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,120
If not, that is fine too.

649
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,640
Father,

650
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,280
are you truly here?

651
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,280
If you are,

652
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,480
then watch over me closely.

653
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,120
I will use the skills you taught me

654
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,320
to protect my friends

655
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,360
and

656
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,160
forge the path

657
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,360
you could not complete.

658
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,360
Sheng Dalang,

659
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,880
have you been through a forest like this before?

660
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,040
Never. This is my first time.

661
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,320
What a coincidence! It is the same as me!

662
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,040
Can you take this seriously

663
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
for once?

664
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,520
What is there to be afraid of?

665
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,640
Can you at least try to match my mood?

666
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,280
No.

667
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:46,960
Stop!

668
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,840
Are they wolves?

669
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,520
No, they are bandits.

670
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,720
Bandits?

671
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,440
Bandits!

672
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,640
Surround the wagons!

673
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,440
You stay in the inner circle.

674
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,240
Those who can fight, stay with me on the outer side!

675
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,880
You are smart.

676
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,960
Since you have stopped running,

677
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,800
I will come and see you myself.

678
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,120
You even have a beauty hiding among you.

679
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,560
Brothers,

680
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,040
be careful.

681
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,200
Do not hurt her.

682
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,480
Save her for me!

683
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:44,960
Charge!

684
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,000
Run!

685
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,600
Hurry and run!

686
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,840
I cannot, Shisi!

687
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,640
I cannot run anymore!

688
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,520
Run! The bandits are near!

689
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,600
Help!

690
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,760
Are we going the wrong way?

691
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,560
It does not matter!

692
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,280
We must save our lives first!

693
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,240
You scoundrel!

694
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,440
Why are you here?

695
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,240
I...

696
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,080
Run!

697
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,600
Stop right there!

698
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,240
Yingying...!

699
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,240
Hurry!

700
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,600
Yingying!

701
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
Yingying, hurry!

702
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,000
Go save Sheng Dalang!

703
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,400
Go! Save Sheng Dalang!

704
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,440
Sheng Dalang!

705
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,040
He was right here.

706
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,440
Just here!

707
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,120
Sheng Dalang was just right here!

708
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,080
Sheng Dalang?

709
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,480
Sheng Dalang!

710
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,560
Sheng Dalang?

711
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,360
You go find Yingying.

712
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,120
Sheng Dalang was just here.

713
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,560
- Save him! - Shisi!

714
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,040
Sheng Dalang!

715
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,560
Shisi!

716
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,040
Sheng Dalang!

717
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,640
Get up!

718
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,400
Sheng Dalang!

719
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,920
Get up!

720
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,720
Shisi!

721
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
Get up, Shisi!

722
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,560
Do not stop me!

723
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,440
Shisi!

724
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,040
He gave his life to save you!

725
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,160
Was it so you could throw it away again?

726
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,640
Think about it.

727
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,400
If he is watching over you,

728
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,880
what do you think he would want you to do?

729
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,040
He died saving me.

730
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,600
Yingying...

731
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,720
Sheng Dalang...

732
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,320
It is fine.

733
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,640
Dalang is gone.

734
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,880
He is really gone.

735
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,800
I knew this journey would not be smooth.

736
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,560
I expected illness

737
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,720
and injuries.

738
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,720
But I thought that if we were careful enough

739
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
and prepared enough,

740
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,800
we could protect everyone.

741
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
But...

742
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,680
I never imagined

743
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,160
it would happen so suddenly.

744
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,760
His body was never found.

745
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,160
That was Sheng Dalang!

746
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,200
Don't cry...

747
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,400
Yang Jinglan,

748
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,680
I am scared.

749
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,400
Should we turn back?

750
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,400
I do not want

751
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,520
to lose anyone else.

752
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,320
Yingying,

753
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,200
everyone here made their own choice

754
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,560
to come this far.

755
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,280
No one knows the ending of the story

756
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,920
