[Huanhua Dyehouse]

205
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,590
Let's talk outside.

206
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,640
Okay.

207
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,800
Sir, how is my mother?

208
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Mrs. Ji's illness is

209
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,000
due to excessive

210
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,350
worry and stress.

211
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,310
After taking the medicine I prescribed,

212
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,640
she will feel much better.

213
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,950
Thank you, sir.

214
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,190
Mr. Zhao,

215
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,590
what a surprise to see you here.

216
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,830
I heard the county magistrate

217
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,000
had Mrs. Ji released from prison

218
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,560
and even called a physician to check on her.

219
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,470
I came to see how she is doing.

220
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,920
How is she?

221
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,920
Well...

222
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,520
the thing is,

223
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,880
a couple of days ago,

224
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
Mrs. Yang visited with a physician,

225
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,160
and I could not turn them away out of respect for the family.

226
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,830
Why did the Yang family get involved in this?

227
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,040
Do you not know about it, Mr. Zhao?

228
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,950
Ms. Ji will be marrying Mr. Yang Jinglin as his concubine.

229
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,070
She will soon be part of the Yang family.

230
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:45,800
Mr. Zhao.

231
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,760
Mr. Yang Jinglan has returned.

232
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,950
He has announced his wish to marry Ji Yingying.

233
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,760
Yang Jinglan?

234
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,310
It has been so long since we last saw each other,

235
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,000
you should spare me a smile instead.

236
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,520
If

237
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,400
Gao Fang hadn't arrived with his troops in time,

238
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,160
I would have died on the way here.

239
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,160
Why did you rush back?

240
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,560
You were seriously injured.

241
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,070
You almost…

242
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,680
I need to come back to cover for you.

243
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,950
I am merely getting married.

244
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,470
I can take care of myself.

245
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,830
I do not need you...

246
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
I can save my mother on my own.

247
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,430
Yes, I know.

248
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,430
You are

249
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
an amazing woman, Ms. Ji.

250
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,640
Strong and

251
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,520
unstoppable.

252
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,640
You can

253
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,470
take care of yourself perfectly fine without me.

254
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,880
But me?

255
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,280
Without you,

256
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,470
I…

257
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,110
would not even have someone to pour me water.

258
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,520
I have already owe you so much.

259
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,230
I do not know how I will ever repay you.

260
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,830
Repay me?

261
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,070
Helping each other

262
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,230
is what allies

263
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,230
are supposed to do.

264
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,680
There is no need to talk about repayment.

265
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,350
Mr. Yang,

266
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,830
we do not have enough time

267
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,110
to prepare wedding attire for you two.

268
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,950
Do you and Ms. Ji

269
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,000
mind wearing your parents' wedding attire?

270
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,560
I do not mind using them.

271
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,880
But…

272
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,040
I will take care of her outfit.

273
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,680
Okay.

274
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
If you marry my brother,

275
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,760
you will be trapped here forever.

276
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,920
But if you marry me,

277
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,880
you will still have a way out.

278
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,830
After

279
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,350
you have repaid my family's kindness,

280
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,110
I will hand you the divorce papers

281
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,310
so you can leave freely.

282
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,470
Let’s treat this

283
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,430
as a partnership.

284
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,830
No debts, no obligations.

285
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,190
Okay.

286
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,160
As long as my mother can be saved.

287
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,110
Can...

288
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
you bring over my bundle, please?

289
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,230
Okay.

290
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,880
Shu Red wedding attire.

291
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,590
I found a Red Shu brocade robe.

292
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,920
It must be a reward from the palace!

293
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,470
That is mine!

294
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,070
Father gave it to me!

295
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:03,880
Let go!

296
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Give me that!

297
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,350
Yingying!

298
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,230
- Let go now! - Let go!

299
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,710
Yingying!

300
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,280
Let go, Yingying!

301
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,950
Is this my father's Red Shu brocade?

302
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,230
Where did you find it?

303
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,230
At Prince Bai's residence in Nanzhao.

304
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,430
There are plenty of old tribute brocades

305
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,760
to be found there as well.

306
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,230
Nanzhao? Prince Bai?

307
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,430
So the person Niu Jin is colluding with is Prince Bai?

308
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,880
We will talk about this in the future.

309
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,280
It is not something we can deal with now.

310
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,230
At least,

311
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,950
the Red Shu wedding attire

312
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,560
has returned to its rightful owner.

313
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,430
Dear all,

314
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,470
today marks the joyous occasion

315
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,000
of Mr. Yang Jinglan’s marriage

316
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,070
to Ms. Ji from the Sandaoyan Huanhua Dyehouse!

317
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,680
If you have the time,

318
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,880
do come and celebrate with us!

319
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,110
Wasn't it Mr. Yang Jinglin who was supposed to take

320
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,830
Ms. Ji as a concubine?

321
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,920
How has it become Mr. Yang Jinglan's marriage now?

322
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:45,830
Maybe

323
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,110
Ms. Ji is

324
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,830
already pregnant with Mr. Yang Jinglan's child.

325
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,800
Talking behind someone's back shows a lack of integrity.

326
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,280
Yingxi Dyehouse of Bloom Society

327
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,230
is here to congratulate Ms. Ji on her wedding!

328
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,760
Sir, please come in!

329
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,160
Cailuan Dyehouse of Bloom Society

330
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,000
is here to congratulate Ms. Ji on her wedding!

331
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,350
Liuyue Dyehouse of Bloom Society

332
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,880
is here to congratulate Ms. Ji on her wedding!

333
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,350
Sir, please come in!

334
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,230
Luoxia Dyehouse of Bloom Society

335
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,310
is here to congratulate Ms. Ji on her wedding!

336
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,560
Miss, please!

337
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,520
I, Sang Shisi, the Imperial Uncle and

338
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,920
honorary president of Bloom Society,

339
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,920
am here to congratulate Ms. Ji on her wedding!

340
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,680
Sir, please come in!

341
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,070
Please. Head inside.

342
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,430
I heard Mr. Yang is seriously injured.

343
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,880
Will he be able to go through with the wedding ceremony?

344
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,800
A serious injury means nothing.

345
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,430
In fact, even if he is barely holding on,

346
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,560
he will go through with the ceremony.

347
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,880
It is my youngest son's wedding today.

348
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,680
May I know the purpose of your visit, Deputy General Niu?

349
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,310
Yang Jinglan, the brocade officer,

350
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,110
has slaughtered the city's soldiers for no reason.

351
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,640
His actions were outrageous!

352
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,230
Under General Niu's orders,

353
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,040
I have come to arrest him!

354
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,310
- That is impossible. Absolutely impossible! - Ha! Look at him.

355
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,190
I told you, that idiot has always been arrogant

356
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,680
and sooner or later, he will bring harm to our family.

357
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,110
- Stop talking already. - Father!

358
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,880
Father! Father!

359
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,830
Deputy General Niu,

360
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,830
how inconsiderate!

361
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,800
It is

362
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,430
my wedding today.

363
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,230
And yet

364
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,830
you didn't even bring a gift to congratulate me?

365
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,000
Yang Jinglan,

366
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,830
surrender yourself now!

367
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,680
Let’s avoid hurting the innocents!

368
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,470
Do you recognize

369
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,830
what this is?

370
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,190
The crown prince's fish tally?

371
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,920
The fish tally represents the crown prince himself.

372
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,680
So kneel!

373
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,470
The crown prince's fish tally!

374
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,680
Kneel now!

375
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,040
You are just a low-ranking official.

376
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,430
How am I supposed to trust you

377
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,190
when you pull out the fish tally out of nowhere?

378
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,680
The brocade industry of Yizhou

379
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,230
is of paramount importance,

380
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,520
yet plagued by villainous scheming.

381
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,920
Yang Jinglan, acting under the crown prince's orders,

382
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,880
has been overseeing Yizhou's brocade industry

383
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:26,040
as the brocade officer,

384
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,830
achieving remarkable results.

385
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,560
He is promoted to

386
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,710
supervising commissioner,

387
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,830
granted full authority to investigate in secret,

388
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,880
execute justice on the spot, and report afterward!

389
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,040
Qianniu Guards are here

390
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,230
under the Crown Prince's orders

391
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,920
to safeguard Commissioner Yang.

392
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,400
You saw the Crown Prince's fish tally and failed to kneel.

393
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,830
Do you intend rebellion?

394
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,590
Today is my wedding day.

395
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,190
Yet you barge in with soldiers,

396
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,640
frightening my wife

397
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,430
and disturbing my guests.

398
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,590
What punishment should befit such insolence?

399
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,230
I was rash.

400
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,830
I apologize for disturbing the honored guests

401
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,680
and Mrs. Yang.

402
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,110
I kindly ask for your understanding, Commissioner Yang.

403
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,590
Get lost!

404
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,040
We will leave now!

405
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,950
That was satisfying!

406
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,830
Well done!

407
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,040
Get lost!

408
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,350
Let's have a look at that fish tally.

409
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,400
Careful now.

410
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,950
It seems we will need to address you differently from now on.

411
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,640
No more calling you the brocade officer.

412
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,430
From today onward, it is Commissioner Yang.

413
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,640
Commissioner Yang!

414
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,680
Enough...!

415
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,070
Let me help you back to rest.

416
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:19,920
That will not do.

417
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,110
We have not completed the ceremony yet.

418
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,640
Exactly. He is still fine.

419
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,430
It must be done.

420
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,520
Complete it...?

421
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,590
Look at you!

422
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,160
You are injured.

423
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,190
Let's postpone it!

424
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,110
No postponing.

425
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:31,110
It must be done today.

426
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,560
You are barely standing.

427
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,280
Stop the ceremony. Let's go.

428
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,430
No more?

429
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,800
Then straight to the bridal chamber?

430
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,520
What nonsense are you all spouting?

431
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,040
I...

432
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,520
That is right! Straight to the bridal chamber!

433
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,590
What are you waiting for?

434
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,640
Straight to the bridal chamber! Let's go!

435
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,070
To the bridal chamber!

436
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,800
Let's go...!

437
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,880
Let's go! To the bridal chamber!

438
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,830
We do not have to use the sedan chair!

439
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,400
Let's go!

440
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,110
Take it slow...!

441
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,000
Everyone!

442
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,640
Take it slow.

443
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,430
Enjoy the feast!

444
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,920
Come here!

445
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,160
What is this?

446
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,560
I am staying here

447
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,470
tonight.

448
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,040
You are injured,

449
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,950
and I need to check your bandages through the night.

450
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,590
I cannot be too far.

451
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,350
Let's do this.

452
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,400
You sleep on the bed. I will sleep on the floor.

453
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

454
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,000
I take the bed and the patient sleeps on the floor?

455
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,350
Absolutely not.

456
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,160
They have prepared all these festive treats.

457
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,590
It meant to symbolize early...

458
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,430
I know.

459
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,000
But why so many?

460
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,800
I will move them to the side.

461
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,710
I do not want them pressing on your wounds.

462
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,040
Okay.

463
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,950
Let me grab a pillow.

464
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,680
Did I touch your wound?

465
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,830
It is fine.

466
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,230
All done.

467
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,670
Lie down.

468
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,910
You embarrassed Niu Jin today.

469
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,390
Do you think he will retaliate even harder?

470
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,120
Now that he knows my true identity,

471
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,840
he will understand that

472
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,840
it is futile to target me directly.

473
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,800
What matters most

474
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,230
is how Chang'an and the military commissioner handle him.

475
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,120
For now,

476
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,280
he will not act recklessly.

477
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,280
Rest assured.

478
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,870
Get some rest.

479
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,320
No matter what,

480
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,390
thank you for coming back.

481
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,190
It is comforting.

482
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,670
Instead of drowning yourself in wine,

483
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,280
why not think about

484
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,710
what to do next?

485
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,630
What else can I do?

486
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,840
She is

487
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,800
someone else's wife now.

488
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,600
I have lost.

489
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,430
Lost completely.

490
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,710
Even if she is married,

491
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,630
you can still take her back.

492
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,870
Bring her to your side.

493
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Are you saying this

494
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,430
for me,

495
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,430
or are you speaking for yourself?

496
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,120
What is that supposed to mean?

497
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,040
You want Ji Yingying too, don't you?

498
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,630
Mr. Zhao, you misunderstand me.

499
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,760
I am

500
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,230
just a businessman, nothing more.

501
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,870
When she was trapped in the fire,

502
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,430
you risked everything to save her.

503
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,000
That

504
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,630
did not look like the actions of an ordinary businessman.

505
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,190
I saved her

506
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,630
because I know you care about her.

507
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,230
If Ji Yingying had died in that fire,

508
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,630
we would not have been able to work together,

509
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,870
and I would have no way to achieve my own goals.

510
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,600
Our plan has already fallen apart.

511
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,190
What else could you possibly want?

512
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,520
The brocade industry of Yizhou.

513
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,600
That goal has never changed.

514
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,470
But what about you, Mr. Zhao?

515
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:39,630
Have you changed?

516
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,630
Have you moved on?

517
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,840
Can you give up on her?

518
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
Do not test me.

519
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,040
I cannot give up on her.

520
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,630
Then take her back.

521
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,080
But the first thing we need to do

522
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,280
is to destroy Ji Yingying's

523
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:23,230
relationship with the Yang family.

524
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,840
You win Ji Yingying,

525
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,630
and I will take the Yang family.

526
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,080
But what will you use to do it?

527
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,390
This wine?

528
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,840
Or these women?

529
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,000
I can still wait

530
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,710
for my father-in-law

531
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,080
to kill Yang Jinglan

532
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,230
and reap the rewards without effort. But what about you?

533
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,470
If you wish to collaborate,

534
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,470
what is your offer?

535
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,040
Sir,

536
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,870
Mr. Zhao despises me.

537
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,150
Sir,

538
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,390
you must stand up for me!

539
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,600
Master,

540
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,600
this is Yizhou.

541
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:00,800
Everyone, leave.

542
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,840
Go.

543
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:32,760
Investigate the Yang family thoroughly.

544
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:33,520
Yes, sir!

545
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,710
As long as the rot starts from within,

546
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,870
even the mightiest tree

547
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,710
will eventually fall.

You said you would marry me.

But now,

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,320
you have gone back on your word.

you were forced.

The Yang family forced you.
