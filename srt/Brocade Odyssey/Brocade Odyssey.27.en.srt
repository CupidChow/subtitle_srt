[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,360
On the surface,

4
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,830
Bai Sheng is just a merchant.

5
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,120
His appearance in Yizhou as a businessman

6
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,870
is certainly no coincidence.

7
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,360
Since that's the case,

8
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,910
I still have a role to play in this matter.

9
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,830
Are you planning to continue doing business with him?

10
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,720
This Bai Sheng...

11
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,000
As far as I am concerned,

12
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
he's more interested in you

13
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,480
than in business.

14
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
You really get jealous of everyone, huh?

15
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,230
But I'm already married to you.

16
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,080
I trust you, of course,

17
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,630
but I don't trust him.

18
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,160
Neither do I.

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,630
But I trust you.

20
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,030
Then promise me,

21
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,720
you won't act impulsively

22
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,320
or put yourself in danger.

23
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,270
I'll just focus on business.

24
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,360
If I find any clues, it'll be great.

25
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,240
If not,

26
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,360
I won't force it.

27
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,470
I absolutely won't take any risks.

28
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,910
Does that put your mind at ease?

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,630
Madam, did you call me over

30
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,440
because I offended Second Uncle today?

31
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,270
I'm aware of what happened.

32
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
It wasn't an offense.

33
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,240
Your Second Uncle

34
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,360
has his own faults.

35
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,470
The reason I called you

36
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,670
has nothing to do with him.

37
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,270
Then what is it about?

38
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:55,880
It's about the reputation of the Yang family.

39
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,520
The relatives have complaints about today's events.

40
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,630
I know you feel wronged,

41
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,910
and I know you're talented.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,910
But contributing to Yizhou

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,720
doesn't necessarily mean contributing to the Yang family.

44
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,070
Madam,

45
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,200
I also want to contribute to the Yang family,

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,510
but I am not empowered.

47
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,790
Now,

48
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,160
I'm no longer the president of the Bloom Society.

49
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,320
As I wanna help the Yang family to grow,

50
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,600
what other ways

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,230
can be used?

52
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,830
Please guide me.

53
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,950
Jinglan has a few shops under his name.

54
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,760
Since he's often away,

55
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
the family has been managing them on his behalf.

56
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,510
If you have time to spare,

57
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,790
perhaps

58
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,830
you could take over.

59
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,230
Would you be willing to do that?

60
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,830
I'd be happy to.

61
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,510
Thank you, Madam.

62
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:04,920
Very well.

63
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,200
I'll start arranging

64
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,390
the handover.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,790
Yingying,

66
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,510
doing business in the Yang family is different from outside.

67
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,350
You need to know not only business

68
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,510
but also the rules

69
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,110
and social etiquette.

70
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,040
I understand.

71
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,760
Ji Yingying,

72
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,200
how dare you disrespect me like that?

73
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,000
Just you wait!

74
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,640
Who are you?

75
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,830
What do you want?

76
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,200
Let me tell you,

77
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,640
my nephew is a registered official of the Tang Empire.

78
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,720
You'd better not act recklessly!

79
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,110
My people acted inappropriately.

80
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,440
Apologies for the offense, Sir Yang.

81
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,950
Please, have a seat.

82
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,600
I know who you are.

83
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,160
Aren't you

84
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,350
that foreign merchant, Bai Sheng?

85
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,440
Why did you kidnap me?

86
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,550
Actually,

87
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,320
in my opinion,

88
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,640
you're far more capable

89
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,110
than Master Yang.

90
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,160
Unfortunately,

91
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,440
right now in the Yang family,

92
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,550
you not only can't take charge,

93
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,070
but you also have to obey

94
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
the orders of a woman like Mrs. Yang.

95
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,790
And now with Ji Yingying joining in,

96
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,440
your status

97
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,350
in the Yang family has sunk even lower.

98
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,670
Well,

99
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,350
what do you mean by that?

100
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,830
I mean nothing.

101
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,350
I'm just thinking...

102
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
I want

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,000
to give you the position

104
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,600
of head of the Yang family.

105
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,920
What did you say?

106
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,550
Head of the family?

107
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,550
Give it to me?

108
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,350
Stop spouting nonsense.

109
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,110
Do you think the position of family head

110
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,350
is like one of your

111
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,550
backyard potted plants and you can

112
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,320
give it away as you like?

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,790
It's just a collaboration.

114
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,350
Now that you're here,

115
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,200
why not hear me out?

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,920
Never.

117
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,110
The matters of the Yang family

118
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,440
are for the Yang family alone.

119
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,200
I'll never conspire with an outsider!

120
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,070
Aren't you worried the Yang family will be taken over by Ms. Ji?

121
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,230
It seems

122
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,760
you do care about this opportunity.

123
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,550
What exactly do you want?

124
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,950
No rush. Have a seat.

125
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,950
Let's

126
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,160
discuss this in detail.

127
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,560
[Zhao Residence]

128
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,350
You openly entered my residence.

129
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Are you afraid outsiders won't know

130
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,280
about our relationship?

131
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,640
These days, many people already know

132
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,520
that I am captivated by Shu brocade.

133
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,790
In Yizhou City,

134
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,470
I've met

135
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,350
with the Yu family and the Yang family.

136
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,200
If I deliberately avoid your Zhao family,

137
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
the Brocade Master,

138
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,840
wouldn't that raise

139
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,760
even more suspicion

140
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,400
from an outsider's perspective?

141
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,110
So,

142
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,320
why have you come to me this time?

143
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,150
Since I'm here,

144
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,110
there must be reasons.

145
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,110
All the Yang family's merchants in Chang'an

146
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,000
are listed in this booklet.

147
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,150
Where did this come from?

148
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,960
Once you return from Chang'an,

149
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,760
you'll know that.

150
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,350
You want me to go to Chang'an?

151
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,790
You need to rally all the merchants there

152
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,150
and have them exclusively buy the Zhao family's brocade from now on

153
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,000
to ruin the Yang family's business

154
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,640
and throw them into chaos,

155
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,960
which will cause Ji Yingying to have nowhere

156
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,550
left to hide.

157
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,150
But the Yang family has been in business for years

158
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
with a wide and deep network.

159
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,760
How could it collapse so easily?

160
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,200
That depends

161
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,760
on your capabilities.

162
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,910
I want you to finance

163
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,910
a batch of the trendiest Yang family's brocade

164
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,350
and send it to Chang'an.

165
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,960
So,

166
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,790
how much are we talking about?

167
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,150
At least fifty bolts.

168
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
Well,

169
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,150
fifty bolts...

170
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,710
Do you know how much fifty bolts

171
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,200
of brocade are worth?

172
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,760
It should be enough

173
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,150
to buy me a governor secretary position, right?

174
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,710
But I'm quite curious

175
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,960
what you can offer me in return

176
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,440
if I give you the money?

177
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,910
After taking down the Yang family,

178
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,790
I'll leverage the situation to acquire it.

179
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,640
By then,

180
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,760
the entire Yang family

181
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,710
will be handed over to you.

182
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,000
Will that suffice?

183
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,110
Mr. Zhao,

184
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,520
that's not how the math works.

185
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,030
I'll give you Ji Yingying,

186
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
and you'll give me the Yang family.

187
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,110
That's one deal.

188
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,080
And those fifty bolts of brocade

189
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,760
are another deal entirely.

190
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,710
But fortunately,

191
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,760
there's something on you

192
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,760
that I really want.

193
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,000
What might that be?

194
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,440
The Zhao family's pattern book.

195
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,400
The pattern book

196
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,760
is the foundation of any brocade household.

197
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,150
If I give it to you,

198
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,670
I might as well hand over

199
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,320
the entire Zhao family to you!

200
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,760
Mr. Zhao,

201
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,150
have you ever cared about the Zhao family?

202
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,230
Forget the Zhao family,

203
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,110
you've never even cared

204
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,550
about the entire brocade industry in Yizhou City.

205
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,590
All you care about

206
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,440
is one person.

207
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,880
And her name is Ji Yingying.

208
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,150
Isn't that right?

209
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,590
The Bloom Society,

210
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,400
the Zhao family,

211
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,790
the Yang family, and the Yu family...

212
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,150
What you're after

213
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,110
is the entire brocade industry of Yizhou!

214
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,760
Who exactly are you?

215
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I am the one

216
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,030
who knows what you want

217
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,110
and

218
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,760
can help you achieve it.

219
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,960
Can you manage it?

220
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,760
Dear,

221
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,470
am I not capable?

222
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,710
Greetings to Mr. Zhao and Ms. Ji.

223
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,110
My surname is Sun,

224
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,550
and I manage two shops under Mr. Zhao's name.

225
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,760
The shops are just ahead.

226
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,080
This way, please.

227
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,760
As you can see, those two over there

228
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,470
belong to Mr. Yang Jingshan.

229
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,790
Behind them are Mr. Yang Jinglin's embroidery shop

230
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,670
and clothing store.

231
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,520
Farther back are Mr. Yang Jinglin's tea house

232
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,350
and embroidery building.

233
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,030
That's Mr. Yang Jinglan's dyehouse.

234
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,000
The Yang family has many shops

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,280
on this street alone.

236
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,840
There are five or six streets like this.

237
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,880
The Yang family is truly prosperous.

238
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,880
No wonder they say marrying into the Yang family

239
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,230
is your good fortune.

240
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,280
Marrying my wife is the Yang family's

241
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,280
good fortune.

242
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,230
Oh, yes.

243
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,230
It's good fortune

244
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,840
for both sides.

245
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:36,960
Here we are.

246
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,760
This is your shop.

247
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,880
Mr. Sun,

248
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,440
why are these brocades

249
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,080
displayed outside?

250
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,840
Well...

251
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,200
Mr. Yang, Ms. Ji,

252
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,840
my capabilities are limited

253
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,760
and it isn't managed well.

254
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,760
The shop space is too small,

255
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,670
so I have to display some outside.

256
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,840
I hope you both understand.

257
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,350
After you, my dear.

258
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,470
Mr. Sun,

259
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,840
could you bring me the account book?

260
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,960
Of course. One moment.

261
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,110
The craftsmanship is fine,

262
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,470
but the designs are outdated.

263
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,710
Are you planning to do business here,

264
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,280
or shall we go back and demand an explanation?

265
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,880
Look at this.

266
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,760
The Yang family has a big business,

267
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,150
yet they gave you

268
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,470
such a rundown shop.

269
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,470
Besides,

270
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,550
Madam Yang must have known

271
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,150
I'd come with you.

272
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,790
I bet they're already prepared

273
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,910
for us to make a scene.

274
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,840
Let me think it over.

275
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,350
Mr. Liu,

276
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,110
how many times have I told you?

277
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,280
Our brocade...

278
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,790
Mr. Liu?

279
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,440
It can't be sold in small quantities.

280
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,670
For the sake of us all working

281
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,080
for the Yang family,

282
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,470
please sell it to me.

283
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,080
What's going on here?

284
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,280
Mr. Yang,

285
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,150
Ms. Ji,

286
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,550
this is Mr. Liu, a weaver from my household.

287
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,520
His daughter is getting married next month,

288
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,550
and he wanted to buy some brocade to make a wedding fan.

289
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,150
But...

290
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,760
Mr. Liu, I'm not trying to make things difficult,

291
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,230
but it's just not feasible to sell it in small quantities.

292
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,080
I understand. I've been asking around all day.

293
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,710
None of the shops

294
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,030
are willing to make

295
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,280
such a small sale.

296
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I'd buy more if I could,

297
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,030
but I just can't afford it.

298
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,350
How shameful.

299
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,760
After weaving brocade for so many years,

300
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,840
when my daughter is getting married,

301
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,350
I, her father,

302
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,880
can't even afford a Shu brocade wedding fan for her.

303
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,470
Go and pick out a suitable piece of brocade for Mr. Liu.

304
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,470
Mr. Yang,

305
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,350
I can't use your money.

306
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,040
How could I possibly accept your kindness?

307
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,070
Go on.

308
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,350
I wouldn't dare take your money.

309
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,920
I'll fetch the brocade.

310
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,470
Mr. Liu, back then,

311
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,440
the Yang family's illegitimate child

312
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,680
wasn't allowed to enter the brocade workshop.

313
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,430
I was curious and insisted on sneaking in,

314
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,880
and you helped shelter me.

315
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,680
Do you remember?

316
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,430
It's really nothing worth mentioning.

317
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,280
Mr. Yang, you still remember it?

318
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,520
Of course I do.

319
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,040
Mr. Liu,

320
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,470
this is a kind gesture from Mr. Yang and Ms. Ji.

321
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,160
You should accept it.

322
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,680
Thank you.

323
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,310
There's no need.

324
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,640
May Mr. Yang and Ms. Ji be blessed

325
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,280
with children soon

326
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,560
and enjoy long lives together.

327
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:27,830
What's on your mind, dear?

328
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,680
I just reviewed the shop's accounts

329
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,950
and noticed some issues.

330
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,560
The revenue is pitifully low.

331
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,470
The inventory is filled with damaged,

332
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,760
outdated brocades

333
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,680
that no one is interested in buying.

334
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,160
So, you weren't thinking about me?

335
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,350
Why would I think about you?

336
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,470
You're well, right?

337
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,040
I...

338
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,680
Actually...

339
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,350
I haven't recovered yet.

340
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,070
I hope my dear will take pity on me.

341
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,520
Look, my dear.

342
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
My hand

343
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,110
still can't lift anything heavy.

344
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,710
Dear,

345
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,070
to tease someone with such injuries,

346
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,110
isn't that a bit much?

347
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,710
Open your mouth.

348
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,070
That's enough.

349
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,470
Keep this up, and I'll kick you out.

350
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:40,950
I got injured.

351
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,950
Forgive me.

352
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,950
Help me, dear.

353
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Sorry for the trouble.

354
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,470
It's only Yingying

355
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,070
who would believe your nonsense.

356
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,040
With that sweet mouth of yours,

357
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,830
how many young ladies have you sweet-talked?

358
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,110
Yuniang,

359
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,470
you've got it wrong.

360
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:56,040
You've watched me grow up.

361
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
When have I ever sweet-talked anyone?

362
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,350
Shut up.

363
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,520
Who watched you grow up?

364
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,680
He hasn't fully recovered yet,

365
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
so no drinking.

366
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,470
It's fine.

367
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,520
I can drink a little.

368
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,110
Just a little.

369
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,000
One...

370
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,160
Not even a drop?

371
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,520
What do you think?

372
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,040
Oh, he's not allowed to drink?

373
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,560
Then why did Zhuge Hong

374
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,280
take two jars of wine from me the other day?

375
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,950
You didn't drink them?

376
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,350
You gave them away?

377
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,470
I see. You gave them away.

378
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,070
Yuniang...

379
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,800
Hey...

380
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,430
Yang Jinglan!

381
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,280
I was wrong.

382
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,110
Whether your injuries are better

383
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,350
is up to you.

384
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,880
That's your decision.

385
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,760
But whether you can drink or not is up to me.

386
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,230
That's my temperament!

387
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,110
Understand?

388
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,880
Got it.

389
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,280
No more drinking.

390
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,950
No more at all.

391
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,520
Not even a little.

392
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,310
How about this, dear,

393
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,520
let's discuss business now.

394
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,590
You've been pondering

395
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,950
over the shop for quite some time.

396
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,000
Are you planning to take it over?

397
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,470
I've never managed a shop officially before.

398
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,070
Starting with a rundown shop

399
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,280
might be a good way to learn.

400
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,950
Adding the finishing touch

401
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,680
isn't as impactful as saving the day.

402
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,280
Do you have any ideas, dear?

403
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,590
Shu brocade is as precious as gold

404
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,760
and is never sold in small quantities.

405
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,800
Many people like Mr. Liu

406
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,640
have spent half their lives weaving Shu brocade,

407
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,760
yet they probably can't afford

408
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,680
even a foot of decent brocade.

409
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,760
But to them

410
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,760
and even to the people of Shu,

411
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,040
Shu brocade carries extraordinary significance.

412
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,520
The brocades in our shop

413
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,560
might not appeal to wealthy nobles,

414
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,640
but they're still high-quality brocades.

415
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,070
Why don't we...?

416
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,230
Why don't we turn

417
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,680
the unsold fragments

418
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,950
into small items,

419
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,070
like jewelry packaging,

420
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,310
sachets, or round fans?

421
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,070
Though they'd cost more than ordinary pouches,

422
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,070
they'd still be affordable for commoners.

423
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,560
This way, we clear out old stock and make money,

424
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,520
while letting ordinary people enjoy the beauty of Shu brocade.

425
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,070
Brilliant idea, my dear.

426
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,680
But relying solely on our shop's brocades

427
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,640
won't be enough.

428
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,470
We need more designs,

429
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,110
new or old, big or small,

430
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,830
as long as they're visually appealing

431
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,110
and reasonably priced.

432
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,680
You seem to have made up your mind, dear.

433
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,430
The fifty bolts of Yang family brocade you requested,

434
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,760
along with the cart,

435
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,470
are twenty miles outside the city.

436
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,590
This jade pendant is your token. Take it with you.

437
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,640
Let it accompany you to Chang'an.

438
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,350
Being able to mobilize such a sum

439
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,400
in such a short time...

440
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,640
It seems you're as rich as a kingdom.

441
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,110
Are you really just a simple merchant?

442
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,230
Mr. Zhao, you're betting everything

443
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,070
for the one you love,

444
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,070
risking it all.

445
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,830
Actually, we are the same type of person.

446
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,710
The only difference is

447
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,350
I want much more than you do.

448
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,230
So,

449
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,160
my stakes are naturally higher.

450
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,470
Half of the Zhao family's secret pattern book

451
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,160
is in this box.

452
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,230
The other half

453
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,160
will be handed over once the matter is settled.

454
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,710
Good.

455
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,310
Then I wish you

456
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,070
a smooth journey.

457
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,280
The Chang'an matter won't be resolved in a day or two.

458
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,640
What do you plan to do

459
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,760
in Yizhou in the meantime?

460
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,430
Though the Yang family is currently managed by Madam Yang,

461
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,880
even she has to answer to the Yang family elders.

462
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,920
Yang Jinglan

463
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,710
has refused their goodwill.

464
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,880
As for Ji Yingying,

465
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,710
she's gathered old and scrap brocades from various households.

466
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,470
You know her personality well.

467
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,920
She's not one to act without a plan.

468
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,470
She must have a backup move.

469
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,350
As soon as she makes the slightest move,

470
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,680
the Yang family elders will use family rules against her.

471
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,680
These elders...

472
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,920
their interests and preferences rarely align,

473
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,710
but

474
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,310
when it comes to disliking someone,

475
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,920
they are surprisingly united.

476
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,680
To them, there's only one truth:

477
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,190
The enemy of my enemy

478
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,040
is my friend.

479
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,310
You bribed Yang Jinglan's Send Uncle, didn't you?

480
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,110
No wonder they call you the Zhao family head.

481
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,110
You certainly have your sources.

482
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,070
As the head of the Zhao family, my abilities are limited.

483
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:51,230
However, I've asked my father-in-law for a favor.

484
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,880
Even if he's not in Yizhou,

485
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,070
he can still ensure your safety here.

486
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,470
Very well.

487
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,160
Then,

488
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,710
I wish you all the best.

489
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,110
All the best.

490
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,560
Farewell.

491
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,350
I won't see you out.

492
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,110
Sir,

493
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,110
Zhao Xiuyuan seems

494
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,470
to be doubting your identity.

495
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,470
He doesn't care about my identity.

496
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,070
What he cares about

497
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,520
is how to restrain his allies.

498
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,680
Let him be.

499
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,470
Oh,

500
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:56,040
do you know

501
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,280
where the other half of the Zhao family's pattern book is?

502
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,880
Our men have been keeping watch day and night.

503
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,710
Last night, when Zhao Xiuyuan retrieved the pattern book,

504
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,070
they pinpointed its location.

505
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,070
Once Zhao Xiuyuan leaves for Chang'an,

506
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,640
we'll infiltrate

507
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
and make a copy as soon as possible.

508
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,880
If you have something to say, speak freely.

509
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,830
You won't be punished.

510
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:21,880
Understood.

511
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,350
Sir,

512
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,280
your trip this time

513
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,070
was to strengthen our Nanzhao brocade industry.

514
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,280
The craftsmen and the pattern books

515
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,190
we've secured

516
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,920
are already more than sufficient.

517
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,280
Do we really need to acquire the Yang family's patterns?

518
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,560
Now that Yang Jinglan is watching us,

519
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,640
and even Niu Jin is avoiding confrontation,

520
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,400
why not

521
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,110
withdraw early

522
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,470
and return to Nanzhao?

523
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:52,040
Forgive my crossing the lines.

524
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,760
Enough. Stand up.

525
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,520
You're right.

526
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,160
At this point, we do have enough.

527
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,280
But before I set out,

528
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I said

529
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,560
I wanted it all.

530
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,430
So,

531
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,680
I must have it all.

532
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,070
That's human nature.

533
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,880
Once you get used to compromise and retreat,

534
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,520
you'll never reach the summit.

535
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,310
Understood.

536
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,280
Delicate and compact,

537
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,430
both beautiful and practical.

538
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,110
Not bad at all.

539
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,470
Yingying,

540
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,000
you're certainly not the first

541
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,110
to have this idea.

542
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,560
But do you know

543
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,470
why no one has done it before?

544
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,800
Is it because

545
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,160
the profit margin for scrap brocade is so small

546
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,830
that they don't think it's worth it?

547
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,710
No.

548
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,070
It's because of mindset.

549
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,350
Just like

550
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,560
peddlers and laborers

551
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,160
don't dare dream of owning Shu brocade.

552
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,590
But mindsets are created from nothing.

553
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,710
As long as it doesn't violate morals or ethics,

554
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,350
it has its reason to exist.

555
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,110
By turning scrap brocade into small items,

556
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,350
we avoid waste

557
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,920
and let the common people enjoy the beauty of Shu brocade.

558
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,040
Why not do it?

559
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,430
Having ideas in business is a good thing,

560
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:42,950
but any new path comes with controversy.

561
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,920
You must think it through.

562
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,350
I've thought it through.

563
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,760
I want to give it a try.

564
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,800
With what resources?

565
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:55,520
Just the outdated brocade samples in your shop?

566
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,800
My two brothers-in-law have already agreed

567
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,350
to sell me unsellable brocades

568
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,800
and scraps from the clothing shop

569
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,110
at a low price.

570
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,920
It's no surprise Yang Jinshan agreed,

571
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,920
but how did you convince Yang Jinglin?

572
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,310
I convinced his wife.

573
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,640
You sure know how to target the key person.

574
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,040
You didn't even cover yourself before coming out.

575
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,470
You might catch a cold again.

576
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,520
Sit down.

577
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,680
You're serious about this, aren't you?

578
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,590
Ms. Ji never lies.

579
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,590
Now that you're a boss,

580
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,590
you're still doing all this yourself?

581
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,280
I wanted to try doing some of it myself first.

582
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,070
If I can make a name for it,

583
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,520
I'll ask Mr. Liu for help

584
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,950
and then share the profits with him.

585
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,310
He's a weaver,

586
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,400
so he'd definitely be good at this.

587
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,920
Don't underestimate these scrap brocades.

588
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,800
How to cut them to preserve the patterns better,

589
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,310
how to prevent loose threads,

590
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,110
and how to make them stick more securely...

591
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,520
these are all skills to learn.

592
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,520
Then let me help you.

593
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,110
You know how to do it?

594
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,800
I can wield a sword,

595
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,710
but I can't even handle scissors?

596
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,520
It's not the same thing.

597
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,710
How is it not the same thing?

598
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,680
All right...

599
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,160
Mr. Yang, Ms. Ji, it's time to rest.

600
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,520
My helper has arrived.

601
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,070
Come in!

602
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,520
Greetings, Mr. Yang, Ms. Ji.

603
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,800
Mr. Yang, Ms. Ji,

604
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:15,920
it's getting late.

605
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,110
Please rest early.

606
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,920
But I still have so much left to do.

607
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,000
The Yang family rules

608
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,710
forbid unnecessary overwork.

609
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,880
You must take care of your health.

610
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,520
You should leave it for tomorrow.

611
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,560
I remember one of the Yang family's rules is

612
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,950
to share the master's burdens

613
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,710
and endure hardships together.

614
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,760
Did you forget it?

615
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,310
Then let me help you.

616
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,160
All right.

617
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,110
Yes.

618
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,800
For those who follow the rules,

619
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,310
their cuts must be precise and square.

620
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,520
Dear, you truly know how to utilize people well.

621
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,520
All right, I have a helper now.

622
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,800
You should go rest.

623
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,310
No,

624
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,230
I'm not going back.

625
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,920
Tomorrow,

626
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,000
your husband

627
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,800
will return to the Brocade Bureau,

628
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,710
rising early, working late,

629
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,950
and not coming home at night.

630
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,710
So tonight, let me stay here

631
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,520
and look at you properly.

632
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,710
Let me help you instead.

633
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,560
Didn't you say you wanted to look at me?

634
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,190
Fine,

635
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,880
then I'll

636
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,800
just look at you.

637
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,470
Sir!

638
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,710
It's so late.

639
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:58,800
Why are you here?

640
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,280
I was just passing by

641
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,920
and saw the lights were on,

642
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,110
and the door was left open,

643
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,040
so I thought...

644
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,310
This is the Yang family's new venture.

645
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,590
As the head of the family,

646
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,520
don't I have to come take a look?

647
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,560
Yes, of course. Please, come in.

648
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,280
Learn from her!

649
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,560
Let's go.

650
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,830
Are you sticking brocade boxes?

651
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,400
Now this is something I'm good at!

652
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,160
Come, let me stick one for you.

653
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,400
Thank you, Sir.

654
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,830
- Well... - Sit down.

655
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,560
You've really made something of yourself.

656
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,880
This is a good thing.

657
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,190
Don't worry about Niu Jin.

658
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,000
Our family offers tribute to the military commissioner every year.

659
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,800
No matter how arrogant Niu Jin is,

660
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,560
he won't destroy the commissioner's

661
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,280
cash cow.

662
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,950
Indeed. Thank you, Sir.

663
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,600
The Yang family elders

664
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,600
are still the same as ever,

665
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,710
greedy and obsessed with appearances.

666
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,470
Right now,

667
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,600
they both need you and fear you.

668
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,190
No matter how high your rank is outside,

669
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,760
once you return to the Yang family,

670
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,120
they'll use all kinds of family ethics

671
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,710
and clan rules to suppress you.

672
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,800
Just seeing these people annoys me.

673
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,080
That's why I stay far away from them.

674
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,320
But if you ever run into trouble,

675
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,560
just push it onto me.

676
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,150
After all, I'm still the head of the family.

677
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,360
All right, we understand.

678
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,910
Sir,

679
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
the sticker is crooked.

680
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,560
Crooked?

681
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,630
Useless.

682
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm useless here,

683
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,870
but I do have my uses elsewhere.

684
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Look at this brocade box,

685
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,040
if the sticker is crooked,

686
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,360
you can peel it off and stick it again.

687
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,150
But a person...

688
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:21,080
when they make a mistake,

689
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,230
can't they

690
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,040
get a second chance?

691
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,470
In this lifetime,

692
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,560
what I regret most,

693
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,470
what I feel most sorry about,

694
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,840
is not understanding

695
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,710
what your mother truly needed.

696
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,360
Now that you're back,

697
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:48,950
can't you...

698
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
can't you give me a chance

699
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,080
to get to know my own son?

700
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,470
Sir, don't rush.

701
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,670
We've just returned to the Yang family.

702
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,670
Take everything slowly.

703
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,870
How can I not be anxious?

704
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,280
Whenever there's even

705
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,120
a slight opportunity,

706
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,840
I rush over excitedly.

707
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,080
And yet, someone doesn't appreciate it.

708
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,040
I haven't even eaten yet.

709
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,080
You must be cold.

710
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,670
Here's what we'll do:

711
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,230
I'll make you some wontons

712
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,150
to warm you both up.

713
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,840
Did he just say

714
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,670
"you both"?

715
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,120
Yes, "you both."

716
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,520
It's "you both"!

717
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,910
Take it slow.

718
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,760
Take it slow.

719
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:14,780
[Yizhou]

720
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,000
Shu brocade pouches! Brocade boxes!

721
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,800
Come take a look, everyone!

722
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,080
All made from Shu brocade!

723
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:23,600
Come and see!

724
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,430
Look how beautiful these pouches are!

725
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,280
Come on.

726
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:31,950
Mr. Bai.

727
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,430
How much are these Shu brocade pouches?

728
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,560
Twenty wen each.

729
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,230
Which one did you embroider?

730
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,190
There's no distinction.

731
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Whichever one you pick is the one.

732
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,190
If I'm not mistaken,

733
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,360
these must be made by you

734
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,950
using scrap brocade

735
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,120
from the clothing shop.

736
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,520
You truly have a talent

737
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,390
for business.

738
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,600
That pouch's embroidery isn't very good.

739
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,470
Pick another.

740
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,040
No need.

741
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,710
I've heard

742
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,520
your embroidery skills

743
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,840
have never been particularly good.

744
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,000
Thank you.

745
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,630
Hello there.

746
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,390
What a delicate brocade box!

747
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,390
How much is it?

748
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,560
Thirty wen each.

749
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,600
That's so expensive!

750
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,190
Is it made of gold?

751
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,910
It's made from the brocade of the former Brocade Master,

752
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:42,670
the Yang family, in Yizhou City.

753
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,840
Miss, do you still think it's expensive?

754
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,600
Is this really made from the Yang family brocade?

755
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,950
No tricks or deception here.

756
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,190
When did the Yang family start selling these things?

757
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,800
Madam Yang is compassionate towards the people of Yizhou.

758
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,390
People admire the beauty of Shu brocade,

759
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,870
but few can afford to use it.

760
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,950
So, we crafted these items from scrap brocade.

761
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,950
Though the price is a bit high,

762
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,280
it's still affordable for everyone.

763
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,080
This way, more or less,

764
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,230
everyone can experience Shu brocade.

765
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,430
The Yang family is truly a renowned brocade household,

766
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,800
kind-hearted and generous.

767
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,600
I'll take this brocade box.

768
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Now I can say I own some Shu brocade too.

769
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,520
Exactly.

770
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,430
This pouch here is made from the Yang family brocade.

771
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,470
Yeah. It's made from Yang family brocade.

772
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,120
How much is it?

773
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,040
All right.

774
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,080
Come again!

775
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,600
Want to check out the brocade boxes as well?

776
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,800
This brocade box is no longer for sale.

777
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,800
Each brocade box is 30 wen.

778
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,280
This brocade box

779
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,800
is not for sale!

780
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:43,950
Second Uncle, if you want a brocade box,

781
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,390
you can pick another.

782
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,390
This one was already chosen by this young lady.

783
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,000
Not only is this one not for sale,

784
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,910
but all the ones sold already.

785
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:54,080
I want them bought back at double the price.

786
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,040
Understood.

787
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:56,560
Second Uncle, what do you mean by this?

788
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
What do I mean?

789
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,470
Yang family brocade

790
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,190
is not sold piecemeal!

791
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,390
I cannot just stand by and watch this,

792
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,560
Ms. Ji.

793
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,360
You'll make a grave mistake!

794
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:13,430
So,

795
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,870
I'm here to mend the situation.

796
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,600
Sir,

797
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,470
could this be a misunderstanding?

798
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,040
Who gives you the right to speak?

799
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,950
Pack everything up.

800
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,000
Hold on!

801
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,390
My scrap brocade business

802
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,190
was approved by both Sir and Madam.

803
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,080
Does Second Uncle's authority

804
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,470
surpass that of the family head and the steward?

805
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,320
Listen to me.

806
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,190
My sister-in-law manages household affairs

807
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,630
with great effort.

808
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,430
She is bound to make occasional mistakes.

809
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,470
My eldest brother...

810
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,600
was deceived by this pretentious act

811
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,800
of yours!

812
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,120
I,

813
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,080
as a Yang family elder,

814
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,000
have the right to supervise!

815
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,630
I absolutely cannot allow a mere junior like you

816
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:10,560
to disgrace

817
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,470
the Yang family.

818
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,190
What if I refuse to comply?

819
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,430
Pack it up.

820
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,000
Thank you, Second Uncle, for supporting my business.

821
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,360
That'll be 300 wen.

822
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,800
Please pay in cash.

823
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,190
- Pay up! - What?

824
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,870
Pay up!

825
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,870
Ji Yingying!

826
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,470
My Second Uncle is wealthy.

827
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,600
He wouldn't lower himself to taking from a nephew's wife.

828
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,430
That would disgrace the Yang family.

829
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,280
Exactly. Pay up!

830
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,360
Pay up!

831
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,320
Pay up!

832
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,430
Did I say I wouldn't pay?

833
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,520
I'll pay.

834
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,630
I'll pay you.

835
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,950
Just you wait.

836
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,390
This isn't over.

837
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,230
Thank you, Second Uncle.

838
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,120
He is always domineering at home.

839
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,230
Ms. Ji,

840
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,430
you must be careful.

841
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,800
I am not easily bullied.

842
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,190
Sold out for the day.

843
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:20,630
Pack up.

844
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:21,950
Take the money.

845
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,430
All right.

846
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,470
Let's go.

847
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,390
Although today's matter isn't a big deal,

848
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,600
with a little instigation,

849
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,190
it could become

850
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,840
the start of a conflict between Ji Yingying

851
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,360
and the Yang family elders.

852
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:48,760
That pouch wasn't part of your plan, was it?

853
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,000
You and I may be cooperating,

854
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,630
but some things are yours,

855
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,000
while some things

856
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,950
don't belong to you.
