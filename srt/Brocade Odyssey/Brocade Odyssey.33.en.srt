[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 33]

3
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,320
That is the essence of Shu brocade.

4
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,040
As the head of the Zhao family and the Brocade Master of Yizhou,

5
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,000
how could you use such an important item

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,920
to trade with him?

7
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,040
For me,

8
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,080
there are more important people to protect.

9
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,360
Yang Juli,

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,680
under both family discipline and state law,

11
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,520
your crimes are unforgivable.

12
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,560
Deal with him under family discipline first!

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,120
Yes.

14
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,760
Then hand him over to the authorities!

15
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,040
Ms. Ji,

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,200
you went back on your word!

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
I... I already confessed.

18
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,880
Why are you still hitting me?

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,320
Stop!

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,120
A traitor like you,

21
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,560
worse than an animal!

22
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,240
Are you even human?

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,720
Are you worthy of the Yang family ancestors?

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,440
Hit him!

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,120
Hit him hard!

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,840
Hit him!

27
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,120
When did this all

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,640
begin to change?

29
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,320
Sir.

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,600
Everything related to Bai Sheng,

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,480
except for what was taken by the Brocade Bureau,

32
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,040
has disappeared without a trace.

33
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,600
Perhaps,

34
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,400
we should inquire with General Niu.

35
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,720
He didn't tell me anything.

36
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
That means

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
he doesn't want me to interfere.

38
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,800
Notify everyone:

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,800
make sure to closely guard the weavers and the patterns,

40
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,200
and be extra cautious these days.

41
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,440
Yes, sir.

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
Anything else?

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
Ms. Niu hasn't eaten for five days.

44
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,920
She insists on seeing you.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm afraid

46
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,680
that if anything happens to her,

47
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,320
you won't be able to explain it to the Niu family.

48
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:55,680
[yuan]

49
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,480
Yu Yuan,

50
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,840
look,

51
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,040
isn't this version written better?

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,040
Father had a famous teacher instruct me in calligraphy,

53
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,720
but he said my writing

54
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,960
is only fit for ledgers or letters,

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,320
not for public view.

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
Isn't that odd?

57
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Why are you looking for me?

58
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,070
Yu Yuan,

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,880
go brew a good pot of tea for Mr. Zhao.

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,920
What do you want from me?

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,680
Just say it.

62
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,840
In a few days, it's my mother's birthday.

63
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,480
Can I take Yu Yuan back to see her?

64
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,280
I won't go to the front yard.

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
I'll just watch from the attic.

66
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,080
You can tie me up if you must.

67
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,840
I beg you to allow it.

68
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,760
Fine.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,680
See?

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,480
I told you he would agree.

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,280
In me,

72
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,320
he sees another version of himself,

73
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,280
one who has nothing.

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,240
How could one not feel sorry for themselves?

75
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,240
Yu Yuan,

76
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,080
I will make them all pay.

77
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,760
I already know

78
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,960
Yang Juli's matter.

79
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,240
I have also made a decision

80
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
according to the family rules.

81
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,880
He is to be expelled

82
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,320
from the Yang family genealogy

83
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,320
and handed over to the authorities.

84
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,760
In addition to colluding with outsiders to harm me,

85
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,440
he confessed

86
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,360
how he corrupted family members

87
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,640
to line his own pockets.

88
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,760
But Yingying persuaded me,

89
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,480
saying this isn't the fault of the family members.

90
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
It's because Yang Juli

91
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,640
used family rules to manipulate everyone.

92
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,920
Yingying,

93
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,880
repeat what you told me

94
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,880
to everyone here.

95
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,120
Yes.

96
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,920
Setting rules is meant to ensure

97
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,760
that we act within bounds.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,240
The family rules established a century ago

99
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,960
did indeed bring prosperity to the Yang family.

100
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,480
But a century has passed,

101
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,080
and some rules are no longer suitable.

102
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,600
Instead,

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,200
they have become obstacles hindering the Yang family's progress.

104
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
I believe that today,

105
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,440
instead of pursuing blame or punishment,

106
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,680
it's better to address the root cause

107
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,280
and implement new rules.

108
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,480
What do you all think?

109
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
Should we seek accountability

110
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,040
or should we reform?

111
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Reform.

112
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,160
Of course, reform is the better choice.

113
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,920
Reform.

114
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,720
Reform.

115
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,560
Good.

116
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,680
Then let's proceed with reform.

117
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,840
I have just recovered from a serious illness,

118
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,480
and though I am willing,

119
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
I lack the strength to lead the reforms.

120
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,520
Thus, I ask Yingying

121
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,640
to manage the Yang family's affairs,

122
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,360
assisting Jingshan in reforming the family's outdated rules

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,480
to restore the family's integrity.

124
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
Does anyone object?

125
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,760
We'll follow Ms. Ji's lead.

126
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,040
Yingying.

127
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,760
From today onwards,

128
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
the Yang family entrusts you with managing its affairs,

129
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,680
rectifying its values,

130
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,560
and reforming its trade practices

131
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
to smooth the path of the family business.

132
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,160
Act with caution,

133
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,680
and take the Yang family's rise and fall as your responsibility.

134
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,680
Do not fail the expectations of the Yang family members.

135
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,040
I will follow your teachings.

136
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,440
This is the Yang family's

137
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,120
business seal.

138
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,680
Take good care of it.

139
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
Understood.

140
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,280
Greetings to Ms. Ji!

141
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,480
Do you still remember this place?

142
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,080
Back then,

143
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,160
I thought I had grasped your entire life in my hands.

144
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,680
Little did I know

145
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,200
that I had also buried

146
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,360
my own life here.

147
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,040
I thought you were my pawn,

148
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,000
but in the end,

149
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,680
we're both at the mercy of this unpredictable world.

150
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,920
Do you know why I chose you?

151
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,520
Because you were suitable,

152
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,720
and because Ji Yingying valued you.

153
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,000
Someone she values

154
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,120
could not be wrong.

155
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,640
Though Yingying and I are different,

156
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
we share

157
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,720
the same heart:

158
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,960
the desire to achieve something great.

159
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,560
She is far luckier than I am.

160
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,680
She has so many genuine friends

161
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,640
willing to help her.

162
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,760
And she is deeply loved by her...

163
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,440
father

164
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,280
and mother.

165
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,160
Why do I have nothing?

166
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
She is not like you.

167
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,360
She is sincere and upright,

168
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,480
acting with integrity.

169
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,080
History favors the victor.

170
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,680
If today's success had been mine,

171
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,880
the story would have been written for me.

172
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,040
Niu Wuniang,

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,480
unlucky in youth,

174
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,280
enduring humiliation,

175
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,520
yet unmatched in strategy,

176
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,440
decisive and resolute,

177
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,440
ultimately achieving greatness.

178
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,040
They say this celebration is for my mother's birthday,

179
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,640
but it has never truly been about her.

180
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
Her heart has long died,

181
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,400
and she no longer wishes to awaken.

182
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
But I am different.

183
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,160
If my heart dies,

184
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,160
you shall all be buried with me!

185
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
What are you trying to do?

186
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,360
Dear,

187
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,240
we signed our marriage contract right here.

188
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,920
You promised to treat me well,

189
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,800
but your heart is only for Ji Yingying.

190
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
She refused to marry you,

191
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,040
so why do you torment me,

192
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,560
imprison me?

193
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,280
What did I do wrong?

194
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,760
My heart has always been yours!

195
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,440
We've come to this point,

196
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,800
and yet you're still putting on an act.

197
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,000
What's the point?

198
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,120
Niu Wuniang jumped from the building!

199
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,800
Niu Wuniang!

200
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,910
How did I end up with such a daughter?

201
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,240
She used her own life to set a trap!

202
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,120
She hasn't made any progress after all these years!

203
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,830
If Zhao Xiuyuan was wronged,

204
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,320
then...

205
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,630
He's even more useless!

206
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,040
To be so easily manipulated by a woman,

207
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,270
what great things could he possibly accomplish?

208
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,910
Then we'll have to...

209
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,040
Wait a little longer.

210
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,790
First, deal with what's at hand.

211
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,880
Once the Zhao family gathers,

212
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,710
we'll send them all off together.

213
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,830
That way, Wuniang won't be alone on her journey.

214
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,910
Don't say I never cared for her

215
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,240
even as her father.

216
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,800
Zhao Xiuyuan murdered Niu Wuniang,

217
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,240
and has been imprisoned by the Niu family guards.

218
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,720
Now the Zhao family

219
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,080
barely holds together

220
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,320
under Mr. Zhao Senior.

221
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,240
But sacrificing her own life to drag someone down with her,

222
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,440
that's something only Niu Wuniang could do.

223
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,280
Are you saying

224
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,680
Zhao Xiuyuan was wronged?

225
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,440
Killing Niu Wuniang at this time

226
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,200
wouldn't benefit him at all.

227
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,640
Why would he do it?

228
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,080
And in broad daylight, no less.

229
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,280
I just can't understand

230
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
why Niu Wuniang would go

231
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,480
to such lengths.

232
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,440
If you can't figure it out, don't try.

233
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,400
You're not the same kind of person as her.

234
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,120
You'll never understand her motives.

235
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,040
I've already written about Jinglan's matter,

236
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,240
asking my family to help mediate.

237
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,320
Father and Jinglin wrote back saying

238
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,400
they will not only mediate the orders

239
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,200
but also try to find someone in Chang'an

240
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,440
to plead for Jinglan.

241
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,800
The court currently states this is a suspicious case,

242
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,080
and they want to question Jinglan,

243
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,520
but it doesn't mean he's been convicted.

244
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,520
Thank you, Madam.

245
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,480
Thank you, Mr. Jingshan.

246
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,800
We're all family now.

247
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,520
Do you still need to call me Madam?

248
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,240
Does this mean

249
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,280
you're truly willing to divorce Jinglan?

250
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,080
Mother,

251
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,480
the loss of weavers is growing worse by the day.

252
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,400
If this continues,

253
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,840
it will have a significant impact

254
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,440
on the brocade industry in Yizhou.

255
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
I want to personally go to Mianzhou.

256
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
To know the enemy and ourselves

257
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,280
is the only way to find the right solution.

258
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,960
No.

259
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,200
In this situation, you cannot leave.

260
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,320
Stay in Yizhou City.

261
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,040
As for Mianzhou...

262
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,720
Jingshan will go.

263
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,240
Understood. I'll get to the bottom of this.

264
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,840
Thank you, Mr. Jingshan.

265
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,200
Jingshan,

266
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,400
as for the others, it's fine to wait.

267
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,440
But as for Master Chen and Master Li,

268
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,240
bring them back immediately

269
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,440
as they requested.

270
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,440
We've taken many orders from Tubo,

271
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,080
and now we need manpower more than ever.

272
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:02,640
Yes.

273
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,920
Ms. Ji,

274
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
someone at the door asked me to give this to you.

275
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,240
Ms. Ji, if it's something you want,

276
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,640
you should take it yourself.

277
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,160
Ms. Ji, if you want something,

278
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,560
it's best you take it yourself.

279
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,640
Let's go!

280
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,680
Whose letter is this?

281
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
It's from Mr. Chen,

282
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,840
saying it's the right season.

283
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,360
If we want to dye Shu Red Silk,

284
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,720
we should go harvest the dye now.

285
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,480
Chen, slow down!

286
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,760
Pin,

287
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,800
why are you wearing...

288
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,160
Aren't those Yingying's clothes?

289
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,520
Shh.

290
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,200
Why did you suddenly call us

291
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,080
up the mountain to gather dye?

292
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,800
Exactly.

293
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,720
Because Yingying wants to meet someone

294
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,120
who could be in danger.

295
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,120
Yingying is afraid someone might capture that person,

296
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
or someone might capture her to threaten that person.

297
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,680
So she asked us

298
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,080
to help her with something.

299
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,000
She wants us to distract the enemy.

300
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,600
Distract the enemy?

301
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,080
What enemy?

302
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,240
Where are they?

303
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:50,920
Yingying!

304
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,400
Shh.

305
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,200
Alright.

306
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
I never thought the day would come

307
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,800
when you'd cover my mouth.

308
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,200
The reason Yingying told us

309
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,080
about this

310
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
is because she trusts us.

311
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,800
Not just that,

312
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,280
I think if anyone asks,

313
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,800
we can explain the Imperial Uncle is here enjoying himself.

314
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,720
If anyone disturbs his mood,

315
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,880
the Imperial Uncle certainly won't be polite!

316
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,080
Are you sure

317
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,360
your father won't hit you?

318
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,680
He used to hit me.

319
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,760
But not anymore.

320
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,960
He trusts me.

321
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
He believes in everything I do.

322
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,320
He trusts

323
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,960
that I know

324
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,120
when to use this identity.

325
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,080
Alright, let's go.

326
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,320
Time to gather the dye.

327
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,120
Wait a moment.

328
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,080
Let's discuss a plan first.

329
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,320
Come on.

330
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,040
In a moment,

331
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
half of us will...

332
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,520
This mountain is opened by me!

333
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,960
These trees are planted by me!

334
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,120
If you want to pass,

335
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,160
then we'll break your legs!

336
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,320
That doesn't rhyme at all.

337
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,480
It lacks any vigor.

338
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,520
It doesn't rhyme?

339
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,520
Break...

340
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,880
Break...

341
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,120
Break their legs crooked.

342
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,000
That's better.

343
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,080
Stop! Run quickly!

344
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,960
We'll break your legs crooked!

345
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
The other half

346
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,480
will quietly move forward.

347
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,280
The more we act like this,

348
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,560
the more suspicious it'll make them.

349
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,150
The tree still stands,

350
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,960
but where have the people gone?

351
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,230
Heaven and earth bear witness.

352
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,870
Though we part today,

353
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,320
I'll marry you in glory someday.

354
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,040
Once sworn allies,

355
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,150
there's always a long road ahead.

356
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,840
Yang Jinglan,

357
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,510

As you expected,

420
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,360
Yang Jinglan deliberately appeared in Yizhou City

421
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,280
to draw our forces away

422
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,640
from the city.

423
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,000
After he left,

424
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,560
his associate from the martial world

425
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,160
showed up near the Brocade Bureau.

426
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,200
That person must be the one who took the item.

427
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
I asked where he is!

428
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,600
Our people are still pursuing him.

429
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,160
What about his friend?

430
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,400
Also being pursued.

431
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,360
But their escape route

432
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,760
is already under our control.

433
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:19,840
They won't get away.

434
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,800
I have been killing and conquering my whole life,

435
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,400
and yet I've raised a bunch of useless fools like you!

436
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,920
Within three days,

437
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,760
I either want the item in my hands

438
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,040
or their heads!

439
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,000
Niu Jin deceived Your Excellency,

440
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,400
secretly colluding with Nanzhao

441
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,520
to smuggle tribute brocade.

442
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,680
He's been in secret contact with Qingping Officer of Nanzhao

443
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:40,320
and Sheng Fengze, the Prince Bai of Nanzhao.

444
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,000
The evidence is all here.

445
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,520
I ask Your Excellency to investigate thoroughly!

446
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:56,450
[Written confession; Niu]

447
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,840
Yingying!

448
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,480
Yingying!

449
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Jingshan.

450
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,560
How is it? Was there any issue with the brocade workshop in Mianzhou?

451
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,520
The brocade workshop in Mianzhou is completely abandoned.

452
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Don't rush.

453
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,960
Take your time explaining.

454
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,840
What happened?

455
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,920
When I arrived in Mianzhou, I learned

456
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,120
that recently,

457
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,920
all the craftsmen stayed

458
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,120
in the brocade workshop to speed up production.

459
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,200
At first, neighbors could hear some activity,

460
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,440
but gradually,

461
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,000
they rarely saw anyone coming or going.

462
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,720
Then one day,

463
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,200
everyone disappeared.

464
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,560
The once vast brocade workshop was left completely empty,

465
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,760
no looms,

466
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,800
no weavers.

467
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,600
Based on the size of the brocade workshop,

468
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,600
I estimated that the number of craftsmen it could house

469
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,400
is far less than the current number

470
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,920
of missing craftsmen in Yizhou.

471
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,840
So this means,

472
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,320
the brocade workshop in Mianzhou is just a diversion.

473
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,600
Those craftsmen were likely kidnapped,

474
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,040
perhaps even taken

475
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,520
while still in Yizhou.

476
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,200
They created the illusion that they went to the brocade workshop in Mianzhou,

477
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,600
thus evading government investigation.

478
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Do you remember

479
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,200
the illegal brocade workshop

480
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,360
Niu Wuniang had in the mountains?

481
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,040
Do you think

482
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,600
the Niu family is behind this?

483
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,400
No.

484
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,600
Niu Jin wouldn't repeat the same mistake.

485
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,240
But I'm thinking of someone else...

486
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,320
someone who spent lavishly,

487
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
to build a reputation,

488
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,000
bought off the Yu family and attempted to win over me,

489
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,680
the Zhao family, and Yang Juli,

490
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,000
and stole patterns.

491
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,120
Such ambition...

492
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,720
there's no one else I can think of.

493
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,680
Sheng Fengze,

494
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,960
the Prince Bai of Nanzhao.

495
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,080
Sheng Fengze...

496
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,160
What should we do?

497
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,600
Let me gather the family members

498
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,960
and hold a meeting to discuss it.

499
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,520
No.

500
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,920
This isn't just a Yang family matter.

501
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,440
This concerns the entire Shu brocade industry.

502
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,000
I need to see someone first.

503
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Rumors outside say

504
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,760
that Niu Wuniang's death was a misunderstanding.

505
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,800
You're still the head of the Zhao family.

506
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,160
Of course I'm the head of the Zhao family.

507
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,880
General Niu

508
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,160
just wanted someone to oversee the brocade business.

509
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,520
But as for who that person is,

510
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,360
and how they oversee it,

511
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,040
he doesn't care,

512
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,080
even if they're leashed

513
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,600
like a dog.

514
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,600
But General Niu doesn't understand me.

515
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,720
From the moment I married Niu Wuniang,

516
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,120
reputation and dignity

517
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,720
no longer mattered to me.

518
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,360
What do you want from me?

519
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,560
A few days ago, the brocade workshop in Mianzhou heavily recruited workers,

520
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,150
but recently it's suddenly been abandoned,

521
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,400
and the weavers have also disappeared.

522
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,360
I suspect this is Bai Sheng's scheme.

523
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,960
I hope the brocade merchants can set aside their past grudges,

524
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,150
unite together,

525
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,920
and discuss a countermeasure.

526
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,560
But looking at my current state,

527
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,440
what can I possibly do?

528
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,520
How I wish to return to those days

529
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,960
when we flew kites together.

530
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,920
Brocade Master Zhao,

531
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,520
head of the Zhao family,

532
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,600
I came today

533
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,630
because the Zhao family is a leading household.

534
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,760
The craftsmen of the Zhao family

535
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
are also part of Yizhou's brocade industry.

536
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,600
This concerns the survival of the entire brocade trade.

537
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,640
One suffers,

538
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,720
all suffer.

539
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,760
You were once the president of the Bloom Society.

540
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,920
Now you're the steward of the Yang family

541
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,640
and an ally of the Yu family.

542
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,360
If the Zhao family lends you a hand,

543
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,960
the three major families of the brocade industry

544
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,320
will stand by your side.

545
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,000
Even without me as the Brocade Master,

546
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,160
the future brocade trade in Yizhou

547
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,760
will be under your control.

548
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,360
When do you plan to gather them?

549
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,640
The sooner, the better.

550
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,160
Tomorrow would be best.

551
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,360
Alright.

552
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,160
The Zhao family will be there for sure.

553
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,840
On behalf of the brocade merchants in Yizhou,

554
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,440
thank you, Mr. Zhao.

555
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,720
Since fate won't let us journey together,

556
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,280
let me help you soar to the highest heights.

557
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,920
That way, I can still see you when I look up.

558
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,760
Call for my grandfather.

559
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,200
There's an important matter to discuss.

560
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,840
General Niu said before

561
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,120
that when it comes to the brocade trade,

562
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,160
I'm the one in charge!

563
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,960
How many craftsmen have arrived in Nanzhao?

564
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,560
Four hundred and eight have already arrived in Nanzhao.

565
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Another one hundred and twenty-five are still on the way.

566
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,160
Thirteen refused to yield and would rather die.

567
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,600
To prevent them from taking their own lives,

568
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,560
they have not yet departed.

569
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,240
According to Your Highness's standards,

570
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,200
there are seventy-five first-class craftsmen,

571
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,360
and the rest are second-class craftsmen.

572
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,000
That's enough.

573
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,960
Yang Jinglan and the officials of the Troop Six

574
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,760
are searching everywhere for news about you.

575
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,200
Why not return earlier?

576
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,760
Today,

577
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,960
Niu Jin rejected your offer to collaborate again.

578
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,760
He'll agree eventually. No rush.

579
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
For now, let's borrow his base

580
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,640
to recover.

581
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,360
Now that the Prince Bai has also arrived.

582
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,880
What should we do?

583
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,960
They're already here.

584
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,440
Let's meet them.

585
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,240
The Zhao family

586
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,640
might not show up.

587
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,800
How about

588
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,600
we start first?

589
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,280
Sirs,

590
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,920
Governor Zhang is investigating

591
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,240
the missing craftsmen.

592
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,080
But even now,

593
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,760
craftsmen continue to disappear in the city.

594
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,360
The government is understaffed

595
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,600
to handle everything.

596
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,440
So,

597
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
it requires mutual assistance among us

598
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,440
to overcome this difficulty.

599
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,600
Since you took the lead

600
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,280
and called us together,

601
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,080
you must

602
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,640
have a plan, right?

603
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,480
I suggest that in the coming days,

604
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,800
we gather all the weavers together.

605
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,000
Keep them in each household's brocade workshop.

606
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,080
No one is allowed to leave.

607
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,880
Governor Zhang has also agreed

608
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,480
to assign soldiers to guard each household.

609
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,280
By gathering the weavers together,

610
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,280
and with the protection of the government,

611
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,720
the wrongdoers

612
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
won't dare to act recklessly.

613
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,680
That's a good idea,

614
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,800
but what about business?

615
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,040
Collecting silk, buying materials,

616
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,200
trading, transporting goods...

617
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,600
these still require people to go out.

618
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,800
Mr. Yu has a point.

619
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,200
Other than that,

620
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,960
if we forbid weavers from leaving,

621
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,360
that will mean

622
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,400
we're responsible for all their necessities.

623
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,280
That costs money.

624
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Regarding purchases,

625
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,360
I propose selecting personnel from each household

626
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,280
to form a unified team.

627
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,840
Under government protection,

628
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,680
they will handle the buying and selling.

629
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,600
As for the money spent on this matter,

630
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,440
I truly have no solution.

631
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,520
But we spend money

632
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,360
on silk,

633
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,800
on patterns...

634
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,160
Why can't we spend a bit on people?

635
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,440
With craftsmen,

636
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,880
we can have true Shu brocade.

637
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,680
In this time of crisis,

638
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,600
only by joining hands

639
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,880
and working together

640
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,880
can we overcome this challenge.

641
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,360
The Yang family will lead by example.

642
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,480
The Yu family is willing to follow Ms. Ji's arrangements.

643
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,880
The Zhao family is willing to follow Ms. Ji's arrangements.

644
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,240
Mr. Zhao Senior.

645
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,200
Let's set aside other grievances for now.

646
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,600
On this matter,

647
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,720
the Zhao family

648
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,200
is united with all of you.

649
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,800
We are willing to follow Mr. Ji's arrangements.

650
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,080
Thank you, sirs.

651
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,320
Thank you, General Xue.

652
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,920
Apologies,

653
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,320
I'm late.

654
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,080
No,

655
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,320
you arrived at just the right time.

656
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,600
Zhuge,

657
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,400
why don't you come with us?

658
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,880
The Brocade Bureau cannot be left unattended.

659
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,040
We agreed:

660
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:23,960
you handle the living,

661
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,040
and I'll handle the dead.

662
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,360
Alright,

663
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,280
but make sure you stay safe.

664
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,520
You still need to stay alive

665
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,880
to take the imperial exam in Chang'an.

666
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,360
By then, Gao and I

667
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,280
will be counting on you, Zhuge the Top Scholar,

668
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,480
to take care of us.

669
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,560
If you're really found guilty,

670
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,360
it'll stain my life forever,

671
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,720
and I won't be able to become a Top Scholar.

672
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,400
Got it.

673
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,280
I'll return with a clean record.

674
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,760
And safe and sound.

675
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Understood.

676
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,640
You're still as nagging as ever.

677
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,080
General Xue, let's go!

678
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,840
- Let's go. - Move out!

679
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,320
We're leaving.

680
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,120
The road ahead is uncertain.

681
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,720
Take care.

682
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,560
Perhaps the story can go like this...

683
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,360
Yang Jinglan attempts to assassinate the Prince Bai,

684
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,240
causing outrage in Nanzhao.

685
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,960
They raid Yizhou City

686
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,880
to demand justice.

687
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,240
And General Niu,

688
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,480
rushing to Yizhou's aid,

689
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,840
defeats Nanzhao's attack,

690
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,480
protects the people,

691
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,560
and

692
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,120
persuades Nanzhao to maintain good relations with Tang.

693
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,680
Such a major achievement,

694
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,480
who would dare question you?

695
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,880
Not even the Military Commissioner

696
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,920
would.

697
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,200
As for

698
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,520
your previous

699
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,480
minor mistakes...

700
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,240
well,

701
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,280
they'll be a drop in the ocean.

702
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,200
Your suggestion is

703
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,480
to have my soldiers disguise themselves as Nanzhao troops,

704
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,880
and then fight each other?

705
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,320
I'm merely a leisure-loving prince

706
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,520
without troops.

707
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,640
So I'd rather hope

708
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,040
you can be self-sufficient

709
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
and rely on your own efforts.

710
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,520
