[Episode 21]

3
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,000
Are you really willing

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,760
to let the flower you nurtured

5
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,190
be taken by someone else?

6
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,760
I'm not willing!

7
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,550
Mother, you don't understand.

8
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,160
That guy is unreliable.

9
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,590
I worry every day

10
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,440
that Yingying will suffer if she stays with him.

11
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,950
Then take her back.

12
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,510
She was yours to begin with.

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,760
She's offended the Niu family now.

14
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,720
Only by marrying her

15
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,910
can you truly protect her.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,160
As long as she faces struggles like yours,

17
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,360
she'll come to understand you,

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,520
to relate to you,

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,910
and one day, she'll fall in love with you again.

[Yu Residence]

21
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,750
Is Ms. Ji not here?

22
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,360
She's inside discussing business.

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
A big deal!

24
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,390
A big deal?

25
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,670
Mr. Qian from Tubo

26
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,320
ordered 30 bolts of Rippling Grain Brocade

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,520
for their horse racing festival.

28
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,520
He's paying 30% above market price.

29
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,240
Isn't that a big deal?

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,240
If this order goes through,

31
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,520
we'll live worry-free for a year.

32
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,830
Mr. Jiang.

33
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,800
See Mr. Qian out.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,720
Ms. Ji, Mr. Yu, please stay.

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,030
Take care.

36
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,720
This way, please.

37
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,960
Mr. Bai, what brings you here?

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,910
Is there an issue with the profit share from the first batch

39
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,960
of Rippling Grain Brocade?

40
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,550
The deal isn't over yet,

41
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,270
so why

42
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,160
should the relationship end?

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,960
Today, I'm here as a guest.

44
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,190
Mr. Bai, as a foreigner,

45
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,320
you might not know

46
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,240
that in our country, when visiting or doing business,

47
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,000
you must first knock and present a calling card.

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,320
Only with the host's consent can you enter.

49
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,830
Mr. Yu.

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,750
He's already presented one.

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,630
Mr. Bai, you adapt to local customs quickly.

52
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,520
Let's get down to business.

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
How's it going?

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,830
Yingying,

55
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,320
did you sign the order?

56
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,360
Isn't this deal going to make us rich?

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,960
What do you all think of this order?

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Should we sign it?

59
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,790
Sign it, of course.

60
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,320
Why not make money?

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,920
What do you think, Mr. Bai?

62
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,320
I'm just an outsider

63
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,350
and don't understand brocade weaving.

64
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,350
I wouldn't dare make a decision lightly.

65
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,550
It's still up to you and Mr. Yu to decide.

66
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,390
As for this order,

67
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,950
we've already declined it.

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,160
Such a great deal,

69
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,950
why not take it?

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,160
Mr. Yu,

71
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,510
you should've stopped her.

72
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,920
Such a great deal

73
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,760
comes with conditions.

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,510
Mr. Qian offered

75
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,230
such a high price

76
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,760
because the timeline he set was too tight

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,760
too rigid,

78
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,320
and non-negotiable.

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,920
Of course,

80
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,270
if we push ourselves, work harder,

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,640
it's not impossible to fulfill.

82
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,920
But what if something goes wrong?

83
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,350
If we fail

84
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,230
to deliver on time,

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,160
we'll be left

86
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,440
with a huge penalty to pay.

87
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,040
Right now, our Bloom Society is growing steadily.

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,350
There's no need to take such a risk.

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,830
All right.

90
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,760
Let's go with Ms. Ji's decision.

91
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,720
It's just one order.

92
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,000
Earning a little less is no big deal.

93
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,350
Five days from now is a good day.

94
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,350
I'll treat everyone to a big feast at San Hua Pavilion.

95
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,510
Business is so good now,

96
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,390
and we have so many orders.

97
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,830
Where will we find the time for that?

98
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,720
Oh...

99
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,350
Why are you all standing around? Get to work!

100
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's get to work.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,550
Mr. Yu,

102
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,350
this batch of silk is ready.

103
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,160
Good. Let's go take a look.

104
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:54,950
Wait...

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,160
Aren't you all going to ask me

106
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,550
what's special about five days from now?

107
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:00,160
Did you win a cockfight or a cricket match?

108
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,760
If your father doesn't scold you, consider it a blessing.

109
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,640
Hey...

110
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,000
Why are you giving me such a hard time?

111
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,320
What's so special about five days from now?

112
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,950
Let me tell you,

113
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,760
five days from now...

114
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,070
Forget it. I won't tell you.

115
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,480
Um...

116
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,350
Ms. Ji's friends

117
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,200
can't also be friends of mine?

118
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,040
That's beyond me.

119
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,350
It's up to you to win them over.

Who is it? Who came?

127

It's your aunt.

Auntie!

134
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,640
Auntie, why are you here?

135
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,510
Why are you yelling?

[Mrs. Li, Ji Yingying's Aunt]
Why are you running?

137
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
How improper!

138
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,350
Greetings, Auntie.

139
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,230
Now, this is how a proper young lady should behave.

140

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,440
teach her proper manners.

Come on, let's eat.

143
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,950
One must be graceful while eating.

144
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,830
How can you just grab food with your hands?

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,040
Chew your food slowly and thoroughly.

146
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,920
Look at you,

Auntie, how have you been feeling lately?

149
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,150
Have you forgotten the rule of no talking during meals or sleep?

150
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,590
It was Li Feng who told me

151
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,640
that my brother-in-law's case has been overturned.

152
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,590
If it weren't for my daughter's upcoming wedding,

153
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,350
I should've come sooner.

154
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,640
After all these years,

155
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,230
my brother-in-law has finally cleared his name.

156
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,000
You've waited so long for this day.

157
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,350
I'm truly happy for you.

158
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,320
Yes,

159
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,350
I've finally waited for this day.

160
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,000
Come, have some tea.

161
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,000
Why do I find it hard to believe?

162
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,470
When our family faced trouble

163
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,110
and we sought their help,

164
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,110
do you remember how Uncle insulted us?

165
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,200
Uncle may be mean,

166
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,840
but two years ago,

167
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,640
thanks to Auntie's secret help,

168
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,000
we managed to get through it.

169
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,550
I'm grateful to Auntie, of course.

170
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,840
But as for Uncle,

171
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,840
he must see that we've prospered

172
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,200
and now wants to reconnect.

173
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Shh.

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,640
Look at your daughter,

175
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,150
she's already settled and married.

176
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,550
Yet in our family,

177
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,200
the two of them haven't made a move.

178
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,200
You know what?

179
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,760
I've actually been preparing for this.

180
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,350
Yaoting, Yingying,

00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,440

This time,

00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,110
I've brought you gifts.

185
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,710
Come and see if you like them.

186
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,150
This one's for Yaoting,

Thank you, Auntie.

189
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,110
But Auntie,

190
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,350
did you mix up mine and my brother's gifts?

191
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,400
No, I didn't.

192
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,320
This hairpin

193
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,590
is for his future wife.

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,150
And this golden sash

195
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,840
is naturally for your future husband.

196
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,960
You two

197
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,350
shouldn't delay your future plans.

198
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,550
Don't make your mother worry.

199
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,590
Yaoting,

200
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,400
do you like this jade hairpin?

201
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,550
"Thinking of my gentleman,

202
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,440
gentle as jade."

203
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,640
I certainly like

204
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,230
Auntie's gift.

205
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
As long as you like it.

206
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Over the next few days,

207
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,350
I will find a few fine matches for you

208
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,840
so you can take a good look.

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Your matters are also on my mind.

210
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,400
But you're not like your brother.

211
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,320
If you want to marry,

212
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,350
you must first properly learn etiquette.

213
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,550
Exactly.

214
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,760
Understood.

215
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,370
[Yuebuhuan Inn]

216
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,550
Madam, Ji Yaoting needs you for something.

217
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,590
He's asking you to head over.

218
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,760
Help me handle this.

219
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,280
Understood.

220
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,230
Yaoting,

221
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,200
you need something from me?

222
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,000
Please, take a seat.

223
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
These past few days,

224
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,320
my aunt

225
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,550
has been arranging a match for me.

226
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,550
That's great news.

227
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,790
Congratulations!

228
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
She kept asking

229
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,000
what kind of woman I like.

230
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,520
In my mind,

231
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,640
a certain someone's image surfaced naturally.

232
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,110
That's when I realized

233
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,710
I could no longer deceive myself.

234
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,470
I always felt

235
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,030
she's seen all the sights,

236
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,520
while I'm just an ordinary man.

237
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,150
How could I possibly catch her eye?

238
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,200
But I thought it over for a long time.

239
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,520
All my life, I've played it safe.

240
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,230
This time,

241
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,760
no matter what,

242
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,960
I want to try.

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,110
No matter the outcome.

244
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,640
Yuniang,

245
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,640
the first time we met

246
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,590
was on May 10th, three years ago.

247
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,150
Yingying had run away from home

248
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,110
and she stayed here with you.

249
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,200
Back then,

250
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,910
you were practicing swordsmanship in the courtyard.

251
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,550
[From Cao Zhi's "Ode to the Goddess of Luo River"]
"Light as a startled flying swan goose,

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,030
and graceful as a swimming dragon."

253
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,550
It was the first time I saw a woman

254
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,760
so free and unrestrained.

255
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,400
For some reason,

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
from that moment,

257
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,110
I knew

258
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,760
I'd never forget you.

259
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,400
But my family was struggling

260
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,470
and I couldn't act on my selfish desires.

261
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,790
I didn't even have the confidence

262
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,230
to stand before you and express my feelings,

263
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,030
until these past few days,

264
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,790
when fate brought us together

265
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,150
several times.

266
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,280
No matter what you think of me,

267
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,640
I want to openly,

268
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,030
clearly confess my feelings to you.

269
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,590
I don't want to approach you sneakily

270
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,080
under the guise of friendship,

271
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,280
nor do I want others to think

272
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,910
I'm too close to you

273
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,000
and tarnish your reputation.

274
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,550
Yuniang,

275
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,200
I admire you deeply.

276
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,760
I want to marry you.

My father ran a merchant caravan.

284
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,440
From a young age, I traveled with him across lands far and wide.

285
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,840
I'm like a gust of wind,

286
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
neither rivers could stop me,

287
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,590

That wind

289
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,910
once stopped for someone.

290
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:52,400
As for what happened afterward,

291
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,520
I'm sure you've heard of it.

292
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,790
I've thought long and hard.

293
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,200
Am I truly incapable

294
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,760
of being a dignified woman?

295
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,640
It's not that I can't.

296
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,350
It's that I don't want to.

297
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,710
I'm a selfish person.

298
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,430
Compared to loving him,

299
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,430
I love myself more.

300
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,560
The baggage I carry is light.

301
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,230
Once it holds freedom,

302
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,110
it can no longer hold him.

303
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,190
But the part of you I love

304
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,230
is your unrestrained self.

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,160
I've never wanted you

306
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,710
to change anything for me.

307
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,760
He said these words too.

308
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,190
Do you think Yang Jingshan

309
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,760
is someone who goes back on his word?

310
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,310
But who isn't helpless

311
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,590
when faced with difficult choices?

312
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,950
I don't want to go through

313
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,520
the same thing again.

314
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,350
Shh.

315
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,470
Yaoting, did you forget

316
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,950
what Auntie said?

317
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,710
No one in our family, whether master or servant,

318
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:53,160
is allowed to stay out past dark.

319
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,640
I did forget.

320
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,640
But it's okay.

321
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,560
I already told them you were asleep.

322
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,760
That's rare indeed,

323
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,950
like when I sneaked out to open the door for you.

324
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,590
Yaoting,

325
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,230
you...

326
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,230
Yu...

327
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,190
turned me down.

328
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,160
She said she's afraid of repeating the same mistakes.

329
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,520
Yu...

330
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,590
appears carefree and unrestrained,

331
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,560
but deep down,

332
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,000
she has a soft side.

333
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,110
She once told me,

334
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,640
in the martial world,

335
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,800
the most skilled fighter

336
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,560
doesn't engage in combat.

337
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,190
Because as long as they don't fight,

338
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,520
they won't lose.

339
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,950
She's protecting herself.

340
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,230
It's because I haven't done enough.

341
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,520
I spent a long time thinking below her window.

342
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,950
All I told her was that I like her,

343
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,350
but what can my feelings

344
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,110
actually give her?

345
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,800
If I can make her like me enough,

346
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,760
make her feel safe enough,

347
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,800
make her trust me enough,

348
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,400
how could she still be afraid of repeating past mistakes?

349
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,880
So words aren't enough.

350
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,950
I'll show her with actions.

351
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,160
That's my brother for you.

352
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,430
But Yu

353
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:47,430
has a strong will.

354
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,310
Once she makes a decision,

355
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,110
it's hard for her to change her mind.

356
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,830
This path

357
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,830
might be a long one for you.

358
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,350
I have never been a clever man,

359
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,760
but as long as I'm certain of something,

360
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,230
I'll stick to it.

361
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,040
Why are you calling for me?

362
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,760
No one's paid attention to me all day.

363
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,520
Do you even know what day it is today?

364
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:22,710
I've been busy!

365
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,560
If you all ignore me,

366
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,710
there are plenty of others who won't.

367
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,190
What...

368
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,640
What does this mean?

369
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,430
Who said no one cares about you?

370
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,280
This sachet under the lantern

371
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,760
is woven from silk I personally dyed.

372
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,520
My wife and mother made it by hand.

373
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,950
I wish you a lifetime of success,

374
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,640
prosperity and glory!

375
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,310
I wish you good health,

376
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,520
peace, and joy.

377
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,760
May you sail through life smoothly

378
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
and make the most of your youth!

379
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,950
May you always win your bets,

380
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,950
except in backgammon!

381
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,950
So, you all knew!

382
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,350
On this fine day,

383
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,430
I send my best wishes.

384
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,640
Sang Shisi, happy birthday!

385
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,560
Happy birthday!

386
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,230
I knew it.

387
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,800
You wouldn't forget about me!

388
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,590
I've prepared something too.

389
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,070
Sang An, serve the dishes!

390
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,160
Right away.

391
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,190
Serve the dishes!

392
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,110
Everything looks great.

393
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,950
This one's the best!

394
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,800
Let me wear this one first.

395
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,760
Why is Miss Zhu's

396
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,800
always the best?

397
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,310
Why?

398
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:31,880
Well...

399
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,160
How could anything else

400
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,920
compare to hers?

401
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,800
All right.

402
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,280
Let's eat!

403
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,110
Stop teasing him.

404
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,430
Set the dishes on!

405
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,880
After hanging the lanterns, come and eat!

406
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,760
Got it!

407
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,560
Ms. Ji,

408
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,230
here's my calling card.

409
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
This is the Yu residence.

410
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,110
Shouldn't you

411
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,560
see Mr. Yu first?

412
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,830
A few days ago,

413
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,040
Mr. Sang said

414
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,590
"five days from now is a good day."

415
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,590
I get curious

416
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,520
and come to see for myself.

417
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,640
Sorry to intrude.

418
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,430
A guest is always welcome. Please, go ahead.

419
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,710
If I'm not mistaken,

420
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,190
all of this

421
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,400
must have been your idea.

422
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,070
Ms. Ji,

423
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,040
do you put such thought

424
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,920
into all your friends?

425
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,760
That depends on the friend.

426
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,950
I don't mind if my friends are clever

427
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,190
or have their own agendas,

428
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,350
but to be my friend,

429
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,190
there's only one condition:

430
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,230
sincerity.

431
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,040
So, what about us?

432
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
Can we be considered friends now?

433
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,190
For now...

434
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,950
we're half-friends.

435
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,940
[Bai Residence]

436
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,000
Mr. Zhao, why have you

437
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,350
come here today?

438
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,310
The waters of Yizhou run deep.

439
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,190
You don't know their depth,

440
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,310
yet you've stepped right in.

441
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,350
As the Brocade Master of Yizhou,

442
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,430
I feel compelled to warn you.

443
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,590
What do you mean by that?

444
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,040
Abandon your collaboration with the Bloom Society and the Yu family,

445
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,680
and our Zhao family

446
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,400
is willing to befriend you.

447
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,830
Whatever they offer,

448
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,950
we'll double it.

449
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,760
What do you think

450
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,560
I value most?

451
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,350
In business,

452
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,760
profit is the obvious answer.

453
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,230
But I've never said

454
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,950
I'm just a businessman.

455
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,760
If you don't value profit,

456
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,560
then what is it you want?

457
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,000
A stake in your Zhao family's brocade business.

458
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,430
What price would you be willing to pay for that?

459
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,640
Who exactly are you?

460
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,190
You don't need to know who I am.

461
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,000
All you need to know

462
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,920
is that

463
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,000
I can help you win Ji Yingying.

464
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,340
[Huanhua Dyehouse]

465
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,400
Mr. Chen,

466
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,560
move all of this over there.

467
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,560
Got it!

468
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:25,920
Yingying,

469
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,760
is that Mr. Chen?

470
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,000
Auntie, you know him?

471
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,350
He may look strong and sturdy,

472
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
but I've heard he has a bad temper.

473
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,800
If he gets upset in the future,

474
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,950
he might even hit you.

475
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,800
That's unacceptable.

476
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,190
Mr. Sheng,

477
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,950
is everything moved?

478
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,040
It's done.

479
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,070
As for Mr. Sheng,

480
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,520
he looks steady and dependable,

481
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,800
but he's been frail since childhood,

482
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,760
always carrying medicine on his back.

483
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,590
He might have trouble having children in the future.

484
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,950
Yingying, this won't do either.

485
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,310
Yingying,

486
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,880
where should these go?

487
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,760
Put them inside.

488
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,800
Got it.

489
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,110
Good day, Auntie.

490
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:23,950
Who's this?

491
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,760
Jiang Liu. He's already married.

492
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,190
Auntie, they're all my friends.

493
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,350
Please don't overthink it.

494
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,520
What do you mean overthink it?

495
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,040
I'm doing this for your own good.

496
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,800
Auntie,

497
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,310
you are my aunt,

498
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,350
and I'll accept any guidance you give me at home.

499
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,950
But they're my friends,

500
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,760
and you can't talk about them like that in front of me.

501
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,110
I don't need you to find me a husband either.

502
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,190
You don't need it?

503
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,560
Could it be

504
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,310
you already have someone in mind?

505
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:51,590
Which young man is it?

506
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,430
Tell me,

507
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,560
and I'll check him out for you.

508
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,160
No,

509
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,950
No one.

00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,280
Do I have

511
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,760
no other choice but to marry?

512
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,160
If you don't marry, then what will you do?

513
00:27:59,310 --> 00:27:59,880
If you don't marry,

514
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,430
are you planning to become a nun?

515
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,000
I want to do my own thing.

516
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,920
I want to restore the Ji family's honor.

517
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,000
I want to make a name for myself as a woman.

518
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,350
I want to clean up the brocade industry.

519
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,350
I don't want to be a woman

520
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,230
whose life revolves around her husband and children,

521
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,000
confined to the inner chambers!

522
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,040
Auntie, I didn't mean it like that.

523
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,410
I...

00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,830
Auntie...

525
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,230
All right.

526
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,760
You have grand ambitions.

I will pack up and go home now.

- Auntie, no... - I don't want to trouble you anymore.

531

Why are you barging into my home?

534
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,190
Mrs. Li,

535
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,190
your husband owes our gambling house a thousand guan.

536
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,520
He hasn't paid it back for months.

537
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,760
We've already detained him.

538
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,950
If you can't gather the money to pay,

539
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,920
then be prepared to collect his body.

540
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,350
Li Feng has never entered a gambling house.

541
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,000
How could he owe you money?

542
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,830
[Li Feng's Debt Note]

543
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,800
Believe it now?

544
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,350
Your husband has been

545
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,920
to the gambling house countless times this year.

546
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,520
He's already gambled away everything you own.

547
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,190
Our boss said,

548
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,710
if you truly can't pay,

549
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,590
then you and your daughter will pay the debt instead.

550
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,560
Detaining citizens,

kidnapping women,

552
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,950
do you have any regard for the law?

553
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,560
Paying debts

554
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,710
is a natural obligation.

555
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,430
Even if you go to the magistrate,

556
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,430
we're not afraid.

557
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,590
Our boss said,

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,350
if you pay back the money in three days,

559
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,560
there will be no trouble.

560
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,350
If not,

00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,560
prepare to see what happens

00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,640
only three days.

565
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,710
Where am I supposed to find a thousand guan?

566
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,800
Dear...

567
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:57,560
Don't panic.

568
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,680
Let's not panic just yet.

569
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,800
We still have some money at home,

570
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,950
but a thousand guan...

571
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,760
there's no way we can gather that much.

572
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,520
How about

573
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,350
we report this to the authorities

574
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,950
to at least save Li Feng's life?

575
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,590
No! We can't go to the authorities.

576
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,950
Absolutely not!

577
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,800
If word of this disgrace gets out,

578
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,760
it'll ruin my daughter's marriage prospects.

579
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,350
Yingying,

580
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,400
does Bloom Society still have money in its accounts?

581
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,000
Yingying,

582
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,160
if there's any money left in the accounts,

583
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,760
please, no matter what,

584
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,230
use it to save your uncle.

585
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,350
No, you'll be saving your aunt.

586
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,110
You'll be saving your cousin.

587
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,560
You and her are like real sisters.

588
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Yingying...

589
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,190
Auntie,

590
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,350
don't worry just yet.

591
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,560
When our family faced hardships,

592
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,520
out of all our relatives,

593
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,920
you were the only one who helped us.

594
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,350
Now that you're in trouble,

595
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,950
we won't stand idly by.

596
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,760
But a thousand guan is no small amount.

597
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,950
Let me figure out a way, all right?

598
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,350
All right.

599
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,310
I won't push you.

600
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,950
Think of a way for me.

601
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,190
I have no one else to rely on but you.

602
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
What's going on?

603
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,640
- Why call all of us here? - Yingying.

604
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,310
What happened?

605
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,350
There's trouble at home,

606
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,710
and I need money.

607
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,430
I'm thinking of revisiting

608
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,280
Mr. Qian's order.

609
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,590
I'll go out to investigate

610
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,160
whether Mr. Qian has signed with someone else.

611
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,560
I'll contact the silk suppliers.

612
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,160
If we can secure the deal with Mr. Qian,

613
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,400
I'll quickly place an order for silk.

614
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,400
The dyes we bought last time might not be enough.

615
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,000
I'll check with the shopkeepers.

616
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,470
You're not asking me

617
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,160
what happened specifically?

618
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,310
It doesn't matter what it is.

619
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,830
If there's money to make, we'll make it together.

620
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,400
If there's trouble, we'll face it together.

621
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,160
Hey,

622
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,000
what can I do?

623
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,430
Actually, there's one thing

624
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,920
only you can handle.

625
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:14,350
Then it's settled.

626
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,110
I've found out

627
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,430
that every June,

628
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,280
there's a grand horse racing festival in Tubo.

629
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,880
Everyone participates,

630
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,110
from officials and nobles to commoners.

631
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,400
[San Hua Pavilion]

632
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:29,950
Welcome, honored guests.

633
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,760
Please, come inside.

634
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,950
It seems fine.

635
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,160
Nothing to worry about.

636
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,190
Deals that seem too good

637
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,880
always make people uneasy.

638
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,310
Let's investigate a bit later

639
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,640
to see if this Mr. Qian

640
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,430
is truly from Tubo.

641
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,400
No problem, leave it to me.

642
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,280
Ms. Ji,

643
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,680
what a coincidence!

644
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,350
Mr. Bai, you're here too.

645
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,520
To be honest,

646
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,350
I came here specifically to wait for you today.

647
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,710
How did you know I'd be here?

648
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,680
May I have a word with you in private?

649
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:01,310
Shisi, go warm the wine.

650
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,280
All right.

651
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,710
All this secrecy...

652
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,920
I'm not interested in listening anyway!

653
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:08,760
Move aside.

654
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,070
I heard you're urgently in need

655
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,470
of a sum of money lately.

656
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,590
This deal with Mr. Qian...

657
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,470
tight deadlines, heavy tasks,

658
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,950
the risks aren't small.

659
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,830
If you trust me,

660
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,800
I could

661
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,470
lend you some money to tide you over.

662
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,230
Thank you for your kind offer, Mr. Bai.

663
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,880
But I think

664
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,110
business calculations are straightforward,

665
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,160
while personal favors are not.

666
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,950
Personal favors often carry risks

667
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,680
greater than business deals.

668
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,830
In the end,

669
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,520
you still don't trust me.

670
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,160
But it's fine.

671
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,680
After all, the two of us

672
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,520
are only half-friends.

673
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:01,710
I have other matters to attend to,

674
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,680
so I'll take my leave.

675
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,560
Mr. Qian, sorry to keep you waiting.

676
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,600
Ms. Ji, please sit.

677
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,910
Last time, you made it clear

678
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,630
that you wouldn't work with me.

679
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,430
So why

680
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,840
have you changed your mind now?

681
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,320
We didn't consider everything thoroughly before.

682
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,630
Today, we've brought a gift

683
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,560
to apologize to you personally.

684
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,390
This gift

685
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,040
is much simpler than the one I gave you last time.

686
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,600
But it’s filled with heartfelt sincerity.

687
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,950
To show our sincerity,

688
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:48,000
let me put it on you personally.

689
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,560
What are you doing?

690
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,600
How dare you touch the head

691
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,430
of a Tubo person so casually!

692
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,710
Apologies.

693
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,910
It was disrespectful of us. Please don't be angry.

694
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,390
Here, this is the finest wine from Yizhou.

695
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,040
Mr. Qian, please try it.

696
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,150
Excellent wine!

697
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,120
Ms. Ji,

698
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,760
if you want to work with us,

699
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,800
let's have a proper discussion.

700
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,520
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

701
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,280
That's great!

702
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,320
Please.

703
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,000
Thank you for your efforts.

704
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,390
Yingying,

705
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,470
we're buying so much raw silk.

706
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,120
Doesn't that leave Bloom Society's account

707
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,600
nearly empty?

708
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,950
For now, there isn't much money left.

709
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,950
But in six months, once we settle accounts with Mr. Qian,

710
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,600
we'll make a huge profit.

711
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,520
But...

712
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,120
what if we don't complete the delivery on time?

713
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,120
I still feel uneasy.

714
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,230
For Auntie and my cousin,

715
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,840
there's no other choice.

716
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,120
We'll have to take a gamble.

717
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,600
There really was no other way this time,

718
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,840
but in the future, we should take fewer risks.

719
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,430
No more all-or-nothing gambles.

720
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,950
Be more cautious.

721
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,870
In the future, don't take risks,

722
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,390
and definitely don't place everything on the line.

723
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,190
Yingying.

724
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,120
It's nothing. I just thought of

725
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,040
an ally.

726
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,390
An ally?

727
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,800
This way.

728
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,340
[Nanzhao]

729
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,080
Throughout all of Nanzhao,

730
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,800
Prince Bai loves Shu brocade the most.

731
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,190
In his Brocade Vault,

732
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,670
he has collected the most precious silks and brocades in the world.

733
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,390
But Prince Bai

734
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,840
has been ill for quite some time,

735
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,560
resting and not making public appearances.

736
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,760
Currently, the entire palace

737
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,840
is managed by Ning Dai,

738
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,670
the daughter of the former Qingping Officer (Senior Minister),

739
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,870
Prince Bai's mentor.

740
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,230
Prince Bai has a mortal enemy:

741
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,800
the current Qingping Officer, Du Yan.

742
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,040
Ning Dai fears that Du Yan will seize the chance to stir up trouble,

743
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,520
so she has secured the palace

744
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,150
as tightly as an iron barrel.

745
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,870
It's not easy to get in.

746
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:51,430
Not easy

747
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,390
doesn't mean impossible.

748
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,390
Someone's trying to assassinate the Prince!

749
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,560
Protect the Prince!

750
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:04,600
Hurry!

751
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,150
Quickly!

752
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,870
Rippling Grain Brocade!

753
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,360
Even Yizhou doesn't have many bolts of it.

754
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,040
How does Nanzhao have this?

755
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,320
Shu Red Brocade!

756
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,560
No wonder this Brocade Vault is off-limits.

757
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,670
Turns out they're smuggling tribute brocade!

758
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,230
All right...

759
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,840
I can't win against you.

760
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,000
I'm not competing anymore.

761
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,760
But...

762
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,670
if I call out,

763
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,800
the guards outside will hear me.

764
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,360
By then,

765
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,390
we'll both perish together.

766
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,280
What do you want?

767
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,190
I'll help you sell this.

768
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,190
As for the money...

769
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
we'll split it fifty-fifty.

770
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,470
This piece is mine.

771
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,360
Take whatever else you want.

772
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,430
No way.

773
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,150
Shu Red Brocade is the most valuable.

774
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,630
But...

775
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,840
how did you know there was Shu Red Brocade here?

776
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,800
I had to dig for a long time to find this out.

777
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,630
Do you want to know?

778
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Of course I do.

779
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,600
For us thieves,

780
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,280
information is everything.

781
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,800
Here's a deal:

782
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,800
tell me your informant,

783
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,150
and I'll consider working with you.

784
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,080
You've been waiting for me a long time,

785
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,710
Ning Dai.

786
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,150
What are you talking about?

787
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,520
I don't understand.

788
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,390
The scent on you

789
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,600
matches the smell of this garden.

790
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,280
You pretended to be a thief to extract information from me,

791
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,000
set up an inescapable trap,

792
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
and then caught me.

793
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,870
I know I can't escape.

794
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,870
But if I shout now,

795
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,950
my companions will inform all of Nanzhao

796
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,390
that your Prince Bai

797
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,040
has secretly kept a Shu Red Brocade robe

798
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,040
and not presented it to the Emperor.

799
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,950
Is this mutually destructive outcome

800
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,360
what you want?

801
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:36,760
Yingying,

802
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,870
thanks to you this time.

803
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,670
Thank you.

804
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,670
Auntie, back when my family faced hardship,

805
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,710
you helped us too.

806
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,710
We're family.

807
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,560
