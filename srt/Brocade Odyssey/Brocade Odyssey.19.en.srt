[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 19]

3
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,560
Fellow citizens of Yizhou,

4
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,480
tribute brocade is a rare treasure favored by the Emperor,

5
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,800
the hard work of all the silk weavers,

6
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,600
and the pride of Yizhou.

7
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,800
Now it has been tarnished by villainous men,

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,400
bringing shame to all of Yizhou.

9
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,000
Shouldn't he

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,400
give us an explanation?

11
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,520
Yes!

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,960
We deserve an explanation!

13
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,240
General Niu, please investigate this and stand for the people!

14
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,080
No matter how high General Niu's military law is,

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,640
it cannot surpass that of His Majesty,

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,160
nor the will of the people.

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,720
General Niu, please investigate this and stand for the people!

18
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,520
Father,

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,720
the family of the Logistics Officer is in my hands.

20
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,400
He wouldn't dare to speak recklessly.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,160
You scoundrel,

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,000
as a soldier of the Tang Empire,

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,880
you don't think about how to protect the people of Yizhou,

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,800
instead, you spend your days on petty, disgraceful schemes!

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,200
Ending up in such a fate

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
is well-deserved.

27
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,120
Rest assured,

28
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,000
as long as you confess the truth,

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,400
your family will be taken care of by the army.

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,560
Go in peace!

31
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,680
Live a clean life in your next life.

32
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,840
Yang Jinglan won't come to harm, right?

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,280
He's always been strategic,

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,600
quick-witted in action,

35
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,200
He should be fine.

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,400
Then please, Mr. Zhuge,

37
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,000
take him to the Brocade Bureau.

38
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,120
And you?

39
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,920
I'll wait for him.

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,160
Alright.

41
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Take him back to the Brocade Bureau!

You were worried

59
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,880
that Niu Jin's soldiers might disturb Yizhou,

60
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,000
so you came back late?

61
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,600
The person who knows me best

62
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,200
is you, Ms. Ji.

63
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,240
Congratulations.

64
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
Your father is finally cleared of guilt.

65
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,960
From now on,

66
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
you will no longer be the daughter of a criminal.

67
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,320
Your father

68
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,800
is still the righteous Brocade Master.

69
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
What about you?

70
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,600
Me?

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,600
Did I handle this well?

72
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,040
Were you hurt?

73
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,760
Not at all.

74
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,760
That's good.

75
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,440
That's good.

76
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,160
It's all thanks to you

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,720
that I have a home to return to.

78
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Everyone sees the world in their own way.

79
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,160
You can watch it through a kite.

80
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,600
The further you want to see,

81
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,000
the farther it will fly!

82
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,000
You look nice when you smile.

83
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,800
You should smile more often.

84
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,120
You always used to say,

85
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,240
"The person who knows me best is Mr. Zhao."

86
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,880
But now,

87
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,480
you and he have become one in mind, life and death together.

88
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,200
But is he really a good person?

89
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,910
I helped him with all my heart,

90
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,840
without fearing for my life.

91
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,080
I entered Chang'an with him,

92
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
yet he deceived me.

93
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,040
I only wanted you.

94
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,480
Is that too greedy?

95
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,360
Too much to ask?

96
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,440
Did you already know

97
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,800
Yang Jinglan's scheme?

98
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,880
Traveling thousands of miles to Chang'an with him,

99
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,120
don't you care about

100
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,800
the lives of the Zhao family?

101
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,680
Who is Yang Jinglan, really?

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,360
You can't even handle him.

103
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,200
He forced me to go to Chang'an,

104
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,960
What could I do?

105
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,400
If my father abandons me,

106
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,480
you won't escape either.

107
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,200
Clearly, it was your hasty actions

108
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,600
that led to things being exposed,

109
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
tying yourself in knots.

110
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,040
I am just a pawn in your Niu family.

111
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,240
How could I change the overall situation?

112
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,160
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

113
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,880
You're trying to use this situation

114
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,400
to assist Yang Jinglan and please Ji Yingying.

115
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,080
Your calculations are probably wrong.

116
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
Look at the state they're in now,

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,800
do you think there's room for anyone else?

118
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,840
I'm afraid,

119
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,640
you'll be the one

120
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,840
who ends up caught in the middle.

121
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
Instead of arguing here,

122
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,480
why not think about

123
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,840
how to calm your father's anger?

124
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,560
Although I don't mind being a widower.

125
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,800
You may be happy too early.

126
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,840
You think capturing the Logistics Officer

127
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,800
will bring my father down?

128
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,720
Do you think

129
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,800
I will just sit back and die?

130
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,680
Today, in the Long Street,

131
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,760
dare he speak recklessly

132
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,880
about a word between me and my father?

133
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,600
What have you done?

134
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,400
Between the all-powerful General Niu

135
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,000
and a mere Brocade Officer of Yizhou,

136
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,400
how should one choose?

137
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,920
Isn't it obvious?

138
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,600
She's so certain that the Logistics Officer won't speak.

139
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,640
There's only one reason...

140
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,080
As you expected,

141
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,160
there's no real evidence at his home.

142
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,560
But in these stolen goods,

143
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,680
there are a few special items

144
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,800
hidden among the others.

145
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,240
These...

146
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,320
What's wrong with them?

147
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,160
They're all from Nanzhao?

148
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
Yes.

149
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,360
Looking at the design,

150
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,320
they must be for the royal family or nobles to use.

151
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,160
My master came to Yizhou

152
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,760
shortly after traveling through Nanzhao.

153
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,120
The Logistics Officer

154
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
has been helping Niu Jin smuggle tribute brocade.

155
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,080
In your opinion,

156
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,720
where would they sell it?

157
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,440
Go and verify

158
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,160
whether these are real goods,

159
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,560
what year they're from,

160
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,240
and which Nanzhao noble or royal family prefers them.

161
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,240
Understood.

162
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,840
Wait.

163
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,960
Have you found the Logistics Officer's family?

164
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,160
Not yet.

165
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,640
They might have heard the news and fled early

166
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,160
or they were caught by Niu Jin's men.

167
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,320
Whether they escaped or were caught,

168
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,000
as long as they

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,440
are not safely delivered to him,

170
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,120
he won't dare to point the finger at Niu Jin.

171
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,240
Keep investigating.

172
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,040
If they are in Niu Jin's hands,

173
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,480
inform Gao and others,

174
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,560
and let them find a way to rescue them!

175
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,480
Yes.

176
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,560
You've been running around so much.

177
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,640
Have you not slept for days and nights?

178
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,560
Sleep?

179
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,760
Don't you know there's a skill that allows you

180
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,000
to sleep like this?

181
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,960
I once thought

182
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,920
that you were just a spoiled guy,

183
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,840
good for nothing,

184
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,320
But it's fine.

185
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
After all, I once thought you were just a profit-driven person,

186
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,520
unambitious.

187
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,320
Otherwise, how could we be future friends?

188
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,640
Come, future friends, get up.

189
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,400
What is it?

190
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,160
I command you to go to sleep now.

191
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,280
I'll come back a little later.

192
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,160
Go.

193
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,920
Right now,

194
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,280
my mind is full of trivial matters.

195
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,720
And this command of yours

196
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,640
doesn't quite make sense.

197
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,800
Can I ignore it?

198
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,160
No, you cannot. My command must be obeyed.

199
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,160
Mr. Yang,

200
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
Mr. Zhao Xiuyuan requests an audience.

201
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,160
I'm here because I want an explanation.

202
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,840
Did you two already plan

203
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,600
to send the Logistics Officer

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
back to Yizhou?

205
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
The fewer people

206
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,120
know about this, the safer it is.

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,360
I didn't tell you

208
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,760
because I was afraid you'd leak it.

209
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,120
Afraid I'd leak it?

210
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
To Niu Jin?

211
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,360
Yingying,

212
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,160
I went with him to escort the prisoner to Chang'an,

213
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,760
not daring to rest for a moment,

214
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,880
just to clear your father's name,

215
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
to eliminate Niu Jin,

216
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,400
and to protect your safety!

217
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,360
And now,

218
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,640
you both don't trust me.

219
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,840
You treat me like a spy.

220
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,720
You treat me like a joke.

221
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,960
It's not that I don't trust you,

222
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,160
but I can't take even the slightest risk

223
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,560
in my father's case.

224
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,040
Moreover, we never discussed things in detail.

225
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,400
It's mostly been reacting to situations.

226
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,600
So I couldn't inform you in advance.

227
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,720
Reacting to situations?

228
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,960
You two

229
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,040
truly think alike.

230
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,800
The Logistics Officer is in your hands, right?

231
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,160
I want to see him.

232
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,040
The Logistics Officer is an important witness.

233
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,360
His safety comes first.

234
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,800
I can't just bring anyone to see him.

235
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,160
With you two watching from the side,

236
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,440
how could I possibly harm him?

237
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,520
Don't worry.

238
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,600
I'll just ask him a few questions from a distance.

239
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
How he answers

240
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,320
will tell you

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
whether I'm with Niu Jin's people or not!

242
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,320
Yingying, from the moment I went to Chang'an with him,

243
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,040
I've been a thorn in Niu Jin's side.

244
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,920
If you still don't trust me or protect me,

245
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,760
when you see me again in a few days,

246
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,640
it might be my corpse you see.

247
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,040
Promise me

248
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,720
you won't get too close to the prisoner.

249
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,760
Zhao Xiuyuan, you dare come?

250
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,360
You're Niu Jin's son-in-law.

251
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,560
Are my family in your hands?

252
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,600
You know who I am,

253
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,560
and yet you still dare to be so arrogant?

254
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,560
Let me ask you,

255
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,160
who made you swap the tribute brocade?

256
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,680
Was it Niu Wuniang?

257
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,240
I was there at the inn too.

258
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
Do you know

259
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,760
that while you framed Yang Jinglan,

260
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,360
you put me in an inescapable position?

261
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,760
As long as Yang Jinglan is convicted and executed,

262
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,800
she doesn't care about your fate.

263
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Why didn't she tell me the plan?

264
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,040
She doesn't trust you at all.

265
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
She said

266
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,560
that for Ji Yingying,

267
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,440
you would do anything!

268
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,160
Yes,

269
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,520
I am someone whom no one trusts.

270
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,040
You should be grateful.

271
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,720
Although I'm Niu Jin's son-in-law,

272
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,960
I didn't come here on his orders.

273
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,120
Otherwise,

274
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
you would have to die to pay for your sins.

275
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,480
You!

276
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,080
Even when I'm down and out,

277
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,560
it's not your place to humiliate me!

278
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,480
Let go!

279
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,520
Listen carefully and see clearly now?

280
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,440
Have I cleared my name?

281
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,760
I deceived him.

282
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,800
I didn't trust him.

283
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
It has nothing to do with you.

284
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,560
You don't need to feel guilty.

285
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm just a bit saddened.

286
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,160
He never intended to harm me

287
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,040
and I have no regrets.

288
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,920
But now,

289
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,400
we doubt each other,

290
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
We're like strangers.

291
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,160
Life is long.

292
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,960
Some people can only accompany you for a while.

293
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,720
Only those with the same goals

294
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,160
will walk together for the long haul.

295
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,200
They are the true companions.

296
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Companion, I should go home now,

297
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,840
We can no longer walk together.

298
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,000
It's fine.

299
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,960
There's plenty of time ahead.

300
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,120
Yingying,

301
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,000
there's something

302
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,520
I want to say to you.

303
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,320
Mr. Zhao,

304
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,840
I think

305
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,840
we are no longer suited to be here.

306
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,360
Yingying,

307
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,960
when you weren't around,

308
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,040
I often sat here, lost in thought,

309
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,440
thinking about everything we've been through.

310
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,200
It really feels like a lifetime ago.

311
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,840
These scenes,

312
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,680
even after ten or twenty years,

313
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,840
won't change.

314
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,280
But between people,

315
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,800
things have already changed beyond recognition.

316
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,000
Today, I come here

317
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,120
to sincerely apologize to you,

318
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,040
and to explain

319
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,520
everything that's happened in these days.

320
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,320
At that time, Niu Wuniang forced me with your life.

321
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,960
That's why I married her.

322
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,560
The matter of Shu Red Silk

323
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
wasn't voluntary on my part.

324
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,480
But now,

325
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,040
I've gained some power,

326
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,000
and I can protect you in my own way.

327
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,960
What you say now

328
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,200
is already too late.

329
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,000
It's not too late,

330
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,960
With my tireless efforts,

331
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,600
Niu Wuniang has been repeatedly defeated.

332
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,960
She has already lost Niu Jin's trust.

333
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,000
And on Niu Jin's side,

334
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,400
I've found his weakness.

335
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,000
He dares not act rashly!

336
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,760
Yingying,

337
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,760
the time has come.

338
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,960
We can start over!

339
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,720
Xiuyuan,

340
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,600
I'm grateful for everything you've done for me.

341
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,440
I don't want to dwell on the mistakes you've made anymore.

342
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,960
I just hope you can turn over a new leaf

343
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,960
and be yourself again,

344
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,040
Become that clear

345
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,360
and upright Zhao Xiuyuan.

346
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,400
As for us,

347
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,640
let the past be the past.

348
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,560
The past is over?

349
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
But how can it be over?

350
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,640
Because of you,

351
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,360
I endured humiliation and hardship

352
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,560
and became what I am now,

353
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,000
a pawn in Niu Wuniang's game.

354
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,480
Because of you,

355
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,640
I became a despicable person!

356
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,400
Because of you,

357
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,160
I became the laughingstock of everyone!

358
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,360
How can I move on?

359
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,560
You said you did it for my good,

360
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,600
but did you ever ask me

361
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,840
what I wanted?

362
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,400
I don't want a man who thinks he knows what's best for me

363
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,160
and abandons me without consent.

364
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,960
What I want is someone who will brave the storm with me,

365
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,640
and someone who will walk hand in hand with me.

366
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,800
Zhao Xiuyuan,

367
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,600
let's end it here.

368
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,920
Stop right there!

369
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,040
I just want to ask you one question:

370
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,800
Have you fallen in love with Yang Jinglan?

371
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,640
It's none of your business.

372
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,360

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,880
You collaborated with Yang Jinglan to escort the Logistics Officer to Chang'an.

560
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,960
What's the meaning of that?

561
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,560
Do you want to bring me down too?

562
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,600
General, you got me wrong.

563
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,960
I went to Chang'an with them

564
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,920
to get close to Yang Jinglan

565
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,720
and find an opportunity

566
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,000
to kill and silence.

567
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,360
How can I trust you?

568
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,760
I killed the Logistics Officer.

569
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,280
Now,

570
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,720
I am at odds with Yang Jinglan and Ji Yingying.

571
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Isn't this enough

572
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,960
to prove my loyalty, General?

573
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,560
The Logistics Officer was my man.

574
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,720
You acted on your own.

575
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,360
Don't you fear angering me?

576
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,600
He was once your man,

577
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,200
but once he was captured, he became your enemy.

578
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,720
Yang Jinglan tried everything

579
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,520
to make him change sides.

580
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
He could betray you at any moment.

581
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,240
So,

582
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,160
the only way to keep him loyal to us

583
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,040
is to make him stay silent forever.

584
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,280
Stand up.

585
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,200
I once thought you were weak and incapable,

586
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,400
but I never expected

587
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,960
you would have such courage and resolve.

588
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,280
Since you've done something so big for me,

589
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,360
why didn't you send someone to inform me?

590
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,640
This was always my responsibility.

591
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,280
Why seek praise?

592
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,280
In the end,

593
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,880
this matter

594
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,240
was caused by my useless daughter.

595
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,120
Since you have such bravery and wisdom,

596
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
in the future, you should support her more.

597
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,880
I cannot do it.

598
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,960
Is it that you don't want to

599
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,760
or that you cannot?

600
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,360
No one understands her better than you.

601
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,720
This time, she took a great risk.

602
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,160
Fortunately, I was right beside her

603
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,640
and managed to mediate.

604
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,440
If she continues to act recklessly,

605
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,880
the consequences will be unimaginable.

606
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,160
You're trying to drive a wedge between us?

607
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,680
I was just kindly reminding you.

608
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,960
Tell me, what do you want?

609
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,360
This time,

610
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,280
I have already proven

611
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,160
my loyalty and ability to you.

612
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,440
I seek nothing else.

613
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,240
I just want to continue serving you

614
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,440
to protect both families,

615
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,440
and fulfill the duties of a husband and a son-in-law.

616
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,360
So, you want to take her place and seize power?
