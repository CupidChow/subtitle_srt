00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 25]

3
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,830
Mr. Yang, Ms. Ji, it's time to wake up.

4
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,240
All right. Please don't come in now.

5
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,190
Wait a moment!

6
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,440
Don't come in!

7
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,000
Without our permission,

8
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,880
they won't be allowed in.

9
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,320
Come in.

10
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,080
I am Jinxiu, your servant.

11
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,240
Greetings to Mr. Yang and Ms. Ji.

12
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,030
Madam told me

13
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,830
to bring these maids

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,630
to serve in your place.

15
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,320
We await your orders, Mr. Yang and Ms. Ji.

16
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,440
Yingying.

17
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,440
Yingying.

18
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,080
Rise.

19
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,030
Thank you, Mr. Yang,

20
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,880
and Ms. Ji.

21
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,960
Our Yang family has many strict rules.

22
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,470
It may take some time for you to adapt.

23
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
But don't worry.

24
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,790
As long as I'm here,

25
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,880
no one will dare to bully you.

26
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
For now,

27
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,720
the most important thing is to rescue your mother.

28
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,760
Thank you, Yang Jinglan.

29
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,200
No need to thank me.

30
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,550
We have plenty of time ahead.

31
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,760
Look at all this blood.

32
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,390
It's soaked into the planks.

33
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,600
If I don't replace them,

34
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,480
no one will dare to take my boat.

35
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,230
Such bad luck!

36
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,000
Enough, stop complaining.

37
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,670
Is that enough to replace the planks?

38
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,670
It's more than enough!

39
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,830
Could you tell us exactly

40
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,350
what happened that day?

41
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,670
A man should build a family and career,

42
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,200
but where's your career now?

43
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,110
You're a grown man.

44
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,510
Don't you feel any shame?

45
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,350
Boatman,

46
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,480
when will we dock?

47
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,550
Soon.

48
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,110
Why don't you stay in the cabin

49
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,390
and rest a little longer?

50
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,270
Those two women are too noisy.

51
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,320
I came out for some fresh air.

52
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,670
We're almost there.

53
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,760
I'll go check on them.

54
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,000
Murder! Murder!

55
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,200
She killed my wife!

56
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,350
Quick, report to the authorities!

57
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,640
So you didn't

58
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,350
see my mother kill her with your own eyes?

59
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,830
What does it matter if I saw it personally or not?

60
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,760
There were only two people in the cabin.

61
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
If your mother hadn't killed her,

62
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,040
who else could have done it? A ghost?

63
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,440
Do you usually light incense on your boat?

64
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,760
Yes.

65
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,390
It keeps mosquitoes away.

66
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,600
But that's strange

67
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,000
because since they boarded my boat,

68
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,070
the incense burner has disappeared.

69
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,000
It's truly odd.

70
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,010
[Case Report]

71
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,160
The wound on her neck

72
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,200
is the only fatal wound.

73
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,550
This is the murder weapon.

74
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,200
It is indeed my mother's hairpin.

75
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,000
And over here.

76
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,200
These outer garments belong to your mother,

77
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,950
your aunt, and Li Feng.

78
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,480
They're stored as evidence

79
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,230
because of the bloodstains.

80
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,440
Do you notice anything unusual?

81
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,440
The stains on these two garments aren't blood.

82
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
They're dye.

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,790
Dye?

84
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,830
I know what was going on now.

85
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,880
This case is actually very simple.

86
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,230
It's just that the county magistrate refuses to investigate.

87
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,320
The victim's husband, Li Feng,

88
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,440
and the boatman, Yu San, both testified

89
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,030
that on the day of the incident,

90
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,200
Mrs. Li and Mrs. Ji argued on the boat.

91
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,550
As the boat was about to dock,

92
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,400
the two men entered the cabin

93
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,790
and found the victim

94
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,230
stabbed to death with a hairpin by Mrs. Ji.

95
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,400
The evidence and testimony are conclusive.

96
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,670
Ms. Ji,

97
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,440
on what grounds do you claim your mother was wronged?

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,790
Speak truthfully to this court.

99
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,590
I have three points of doubt, Your Honor.

100
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,790
First,

101
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,400
according to the boatman Yu San's testimony,

102
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,880
he did not see my mother committing murder personally.

103
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,400
Instead, he heard shouting after Li Feng

104
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,790
entered the cabin.

105
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,670
Then,

106
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,520
he saw my aunt covered in blood,

107
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,790
lying in Li Feng's arms.

108
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,670
Blocked by Li Feng,

109
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,000
he might not have even seen

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,030
if my aunt had any wounds.

111
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,000
The boat was in the middle of the river,

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
surrounded by no one.

113
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,640
In that cabin, it was only your mother and your aunt.

114
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,790
If your mother hadn't killed her,

115
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,760
then who else could have done it?

116
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,080
Why don't we suspect

117
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,790
the first person who found the victim?

118
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,840
Li Feng and the boatman entered the cabin one after the other,

119
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,400
only moments apart.

120
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,150
How could he have had time to kill?

121
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,880
And why didn't the two women resist

122
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,150
or make any noise?

123
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,790
That's my second point of doubt.

124
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,000
If my mother was the murderer,

125
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,760
then why was she also found unconscious on the boat?

126
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,880
Perhaps your mother hit her head

127
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,200
while committing the murder

128
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,670
and fainted.

129
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,030
Or she was overcome by fear after the act

130
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,080
and passed out.

131
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,760
Those are possible scenarios,

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
but there's another explanation.

133
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,590
My mother was framed.

134
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,400
Both she and my aunt were drugged unconscious.

135
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,470
Your claims are mere speculation,

136
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,840
unsupported by evidence.

137
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,670
I have proof, Your Honor.

138
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,550
Please examine it.

139
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,880
Here is the incense ash that I found

140
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,000
on Yu San's boat.

141
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,000
I had it examined by a physician.

142
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,840
It contains datura

143
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,550
and other sleep-promoting herbs.

144
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,400
If Your Honor don't believe me,

145
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,440
you may have another physician verify it.

146
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,400
You say you found it on the boat.

147
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,760
How can you prove it was from the boat?

148
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,200
Mr. Zhuge!

149
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,590
Please make way.

150
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,790
Your Honor,

151
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,000
Inspector Yang is unwell

152
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,110
and has tasked me and the Qianniu Guards

153
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,000
with assisting Ms. Ji in this case.

154
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,000
I can testify

155
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,230
that this incense ash

156
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,400
was indeed discovered on Yu San's boat.

157
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,840
This matter is unrelated to the brocade industry,

158
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,400
so there's no need for Inspector Yang to be troubled.

159
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,440
Your Honor, that's not accurate.

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,280
The one suffering from this case

161
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,030
is the president of the Bloom Society.

162
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,880
How could it be unrelated to brocade affairs?

163
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,400
Still, Inspector Yang trusts

164
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,790
that you will uncover the truth,

165
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,790
and has no intention of interfering.

166
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,150
However, the murderer

167
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,400
committed the crime openly,

168
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,590
showing great nerve.

169
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,200
Surely, someone must be behind this.

170
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,670
Inspector Yang sent me here

171
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,880
to remind Ms. Ji

172
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,880
that you also have allies on your back.

173
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,280
There's no need to fear them.

174
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,150
So what if it was found on the boat?

175
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,150
How can you prove

176
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,640
that it was the incense lit by the boatman on that day

177
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,400
and that your mother

178
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,550
was drugged by it?

179
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,350
That's right.

180
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,910
How can you prove it?

181
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,590
I can't prove it.

182
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,840
If you can't prove it,

183
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
why bring it up at all?

184
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,080
Nevertheless, I have a third point of doubt.

185
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,440
I ask Your Honor to allow me to present it.

186
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,400
If I don't allow you to continue,

187
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,350
will you really stop?

188
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,350
These three outer garments

189
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,200
belong to my mother, my aunt, and Li Feng who were wearing them respectively

190
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,000
on the day of the incident.

191
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,520
Your Honor, take a look.

192
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,150
Do you notice any difference in the bloodstains?

193
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,200
What difference could there be?

194
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,230
I won't look at them.

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,000
Fine.

196
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,230
Then let everyone else take a look.

197
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,110
What's the difference in the bloodstains on these garments?

198
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,080
Why is the color on this one

199
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,590
different from the others?

200
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,400
Even the smell is not the same.

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,790
The bloodstain on Mrs. Ji's garment

202
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,000
has a noticeably fainter smell.

203
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,590
Because some of it is blood,

204
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,760
and some of it is dye.

205
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,470
Most of the stains

206
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,470
on my mother's garment are dyes.

207
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,230
Your family runs a dyehouse.

208
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,030
It's not strange for your mother's garment

209
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,760
to have dye on it.

210
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,200
But my aunt does not work in a dyehouse.

211
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,350
Why does her garment also have dye?

212
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,670
And why does Li Feng's garment

213
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,000
have only blood

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
and no dye at all?

215
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,000
Ji Yingying,

216
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,400
even if your three points of doubt

217
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,150
are true,

218
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,590
they have nothing to do with the truth of this case.

219
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,590
Of course they do.

220
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,960
These three points, when connected,

221
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,670
can prove

222
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,790
that my mother is not the murderer.

223
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,710
The true murderer

224
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,670
is him,

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,670
Li Feng!

226
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,000
Utter nonsense!

227
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:26,590
IOU?

228
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,280
From the very beginning,

229
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,080
Li Feng planned this entire scheme.

230
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,910
The argument in the cabin that day

231
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,640
was not between my mother and my aunt.

232
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,400
It was Li Feng deliberately causing a scene

233
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,520
to make the boatman hear arguments.

234
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,230
At the same time, he lit an incense stick

235
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,520
in the cabin's corner.

236
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,790
Then, he left under some excuse.

237
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,670
Shortly after Li Feng left,

238
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,790
my mother and aunt

239
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,910
both fell unconscious.

240
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,790
Outside the cabin,

241
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,150
Li Feng deliberately engaged Yu San in conversation.

242
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,880
Soon.

243
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,440
He told Yu San that it was

244
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,470
my mother and aunt who were arguing in the cabin,

245
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,280
creating a motive for my mother to commit murder.

246
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
When the boat was about to dock,

247
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,550
he acted concerned and entered the cabin to call for them.

248
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,470
That was when

249
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,910
he executed his tricks.

250
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,280
After hastily finishing his act,

251
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,590
he shouted loudly,

252
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,520
drawing Yu San into the cabin.

253
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Murder!

254
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,440
By the time Yu San entered the cabin,

255
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,080
he naturally assumed

256
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,550
that my aunt was already dead

257
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,960
and that the murderer

258
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,710
was my mother, who was holding the hairpin.

259
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,910
Once there

260
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,350
was finally someone to serve as a witness for him,

261
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,880
he struck the final blow

262
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,550
and framed my mother for the crime.

263
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,000
This is a total lie!

264
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,550
Utterly absurd!

265
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,960
Your Honor,

266
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,590
she is falsely accusing me!

267
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,200
Ms. Ji,

268
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
your deductions

269
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,030
are certainly intriguing.

270
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,230
Unfortunately,

271
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,230
besides the bloodstains on the victim's clothes,

272
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,550
there is no direct evidence

273
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,590
to prove that Li Feng committed the murder.

274
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,150
Meanwhile, the evidence against your mother is undeniable.

275
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,350
I must still sentence your mother...

276
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,710
Hold on, Magistrate Meng.

277
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,280
Li Feng, can you guess

278
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,110
why I'm so certain

279
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,520
that you are the murderer?

280
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,960
I have another witness.

281
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,520
He saw Li Feng commit murder with his own eyes.

282
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,590
A witness?

283
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,910
I, humble citizen Yu San, am willing to testify!

284
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,960
Your Honor, I am guilty.

285
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,350
I shouldn't have kept silent.

286
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,640
That day on the boat,

287
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,840
Li Feng asked me to report the case.

288
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,230
I wanted to row away quickly,

289
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,590
but I feared I'd be implicated later.

290
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,030
So I went to speak to Li Feng.

291
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,230
Who would know the moment I entered,

292
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,880
I saw

293
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,320
he used the hairpin

294
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,230
to kill his own wife!

295
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,030
You're lying!

296
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,550
There's both testimony and physical evidence.

297
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,640
What else do you have to say?

298
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,840
Yu San,

299
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,550
why didn't you say this earlier?

300
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,550
Do you know giving false testimony is also a crime?

301
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,110
Your Honor,

302
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,000
I just wanted

303
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,760
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

304
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,840
Besides,

305
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,150
this case

306
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,000
involves certain things...

307
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,760
You know what I mean.

308
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,000
How could I dare to speak out?

309
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,840
Impossible!

310
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,230
If no one saw it,

311
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,640
how could I deduce

312
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,150
to check the bloodstains on the clothes?

313
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,590
How could I infer everything

314
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,030
so precisely without error?

315
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,710
No way!

316
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,320
When I did it, I clearly looked back.

317
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,760
There was no one, absolutely no one!

318
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,150
"Did it?"

319
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,350
Magistrate Meng,

320
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,400
he confessed.

321
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,030
Ji Yingying, you tricked me!

322
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,470
Compared to your schemes

323
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,320
and heartless deeds, I fall far behind.

324
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Ji Yingying, how dare you!

325
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,030
You colluded with the witness

326
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,790
and gave false testimony in court.

327
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,320
What punishment do you deserve?

328
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,520
The one who should be punished first

329
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,000
is the murderer.

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,790
Li Feng killed his wife.

331
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,910
His crimes are vile!

332
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,640
Magistrate Meng,

333
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,640
will you turn a blind eye

334
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,760
and a deaf ear to this?

335
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,910
Will you turn a blind eye

336
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,710
and a deaf ear to this?

337
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:03,710
Exactly!

338
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,950
You can't wrong the innocent.

339
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:10,830
Punish the real criminal!

340
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,000
Your Honor!

341
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,710
Magistrate Meng!

342
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,760
I had no choice.

343
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,920
I was forced to do this.

344
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,920
By whom?

345
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,110
Is that person present in this court?

346
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,560
He was wearing black clothes.

347
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,710
I didn't see his face clearly.

348
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,190
But he said if I didn't obey,

349
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:26,350
he would kill me!

350
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,000
What bad luck!

351
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,800
Just wait until I'm lucky at gambling.

352
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,830
I'll win everything back from you!

353
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,560
Mercy, my lord!

354
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,350
Have mercy, my lord!

355
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,560
Are you Li Feng?

356
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,040
My lord, please have mercy!

357
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,710
I swear I'll repay the debt.

358
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,920
If a man isn't dead, his debt isn't gone.

359
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,800
If you kill me,

360
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,000
you won't get your money back either!

361
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,280
I'm not here to collect debts.

362
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,760
I'm here to help you repay them.

363
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,590
Follow my plan,

364
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,430
and I'll ensure your future is secure.

365
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,640
If you don't obey,

366
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,800
then from now on,

367
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,400
you won't need to repay anything.

368
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,190
Do you understand?

369
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,350
I understand!

370
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,800
I understand.

371
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,560
Follow orders and I get money.

372
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Disobey and I lose my life.

373
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,590
He has confessed everything.

374
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,760
Please, Magistrate Meng, deliver justice for the people.

375
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,830
Deliver justice for the people!

376
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,350
Deliver justice for the people!

377
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,800
Deliver justice for the people!

378
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,230
Deliver justice for the people!

379
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,640
Deliver justice for the people!

380
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,760
What am I supposed to do now?

381
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,590
On one side is the Crown Prince,

382
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
and on the other is the General.

383
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,190
I...

384
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,350
I can't afford to offend either of them.

385
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,040
But the Zhao family head has already left.

386
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,520
What's stopping you from delivering a verdict now?

387
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,160
How dare you, Li Feng!

388
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,760
First, you slandered an innocent,

389
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,230
and now you dare to deceive this court.

390
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,000
Guards, seize him!

391
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,430
Magistrate Meng!

392
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:52,920
We had an agreement!

393
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,350
Silence!

394
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,310
You can't do this, Magistrate Meng!

395
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,400
We had a deal!

396
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,350
Magistrate Meng!

397
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,160
I hereby declare

398
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,760
that Mrs. Ji is innocent

399
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,190
and is hereby acquitted.

400
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,680
That's how it should be!

401
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
As for giving false testimony in court,

402
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,000
Ms. Ji, you...

403
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,590
Magistrate Meng's fair judgment

404
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,590
is truly a blessing for the people

405
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,920
and our good fortune.

406
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,760
Magistrate Meng!

407
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,950
Magistrate Meng, you are indeed perceptive and just!

408
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,430
When word of this spreads,

409
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,760
it will surely become a celebrated tale!

410
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,110
A celebrated tale indeed!

411
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,400
If my father hears

412
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,040
about today's case,

413
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,950
he will surely praise Magistrate Meng

414
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,560
for handling it so brilliantly!

415
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,760
So brilliantly!

416
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,430
Sir, the people's trust is crucial.

417
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,000
Considering

418
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,520
that Ms. Ji's urgency to save her mother

419
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,920
and the circumstances,

420
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,310
this court will not pursue the matter

421
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,160
of giving false testimony.

422
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,040
This case is hereby closed.

423
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,560
The court is adjourned!

424
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,400
Great!

425
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,830
- Mother! - Mother!

426
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,110
Yingying!

427
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,800
Mother!

428
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,560
Yaoting!

429
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,280
Mother.

430
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,560
Yingying.

431
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,920
Mother.

432
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,430
Let's go home.

433
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:04,950
Let's go home.

434
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,560
Yingying,

435
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,760
while I was away,

436
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,520
did anything else happen at home?

437
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,400
I married into the Yang family.

438
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,400
I married Yang Jinglan.

439
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,110
Did you marry him

440
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,160
to save me?

441
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,430
No, Mother.

442
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,800
It was my own decision to marry him.

443
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,470
No.

444
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,800
That can't be.

445
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,040
You're lying to me.

446
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,760
I was still in prison at the time.

447
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,430
If it weren't absolutely necessary,

448
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,520
who would marry at such a time?

449
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,280
Yingying,

450
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,920
I'm sorry.

451
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,230
It's my fault for dragging you down.

452
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,430
Mother, don't say that.

453
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,160
Although marrying into the Yang family

454
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,350
was a matter of necessity,

455
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,350
I've long admired Yang Jinglan.

456
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,760
Though it was by chance,

457
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,040
I am willing.

458
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,760
Really?

459
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,310
Yes.

460
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,040
Before,

461
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,110
I only wanted to keep you away from trouble.

462
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,350
At that time, Yang Jinglan was also burdened with problems.

463
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,590
I truly didn't want to marry you off to him.

464
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,760
But who could have guessed

465
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,560
fate had its way,

466
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,560
and you still married him?

467
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,230
Did Yang Jinglan

468
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,190
want to marry me from the start?

469
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,560
Silly child,

470
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,950
can't you see his feelings for you?

471
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,710
Has he not treated you well?

472
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
He treats me very well.

473
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:03,920
He always has.

474
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,920
It's just

475
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,160
that we've always referred to each other as allies,

476
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,160
never expressing our true feelings.

477
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,230
I had planned to ask him directly

478
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,920
when he returned.

479
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,230
A few days ago,

480
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,190
despite traveling great distances and being covered in injuries,

481
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,430
he still rushed back to protect me

482
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,800
and marry me.

483
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,560
How could I not understand his feelings?

484
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,400
But perhaps this marriage happened too suddenly,

485
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,760
and was mixed with too many other things,

486
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,760
I can't face him

487
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,760
like a proper bride should.

488
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,760
The questions I want to ask

489
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,760
and the feelings I want to share

490
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,760
have become so hard to put into words.

491
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,110
I'm happy for you.

492
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,160
There's no rush.

493
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,640
No rush at all.

494
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,880
As long as your hearts

495
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,160
are connected,

496
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,070
I believe some words

497
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,190
can still be understood

498
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,350
even if they're left unsaid.

499
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
He and I

500
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
have a lifetime ahead of us.

501
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,590
Mother,

502
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,800
it's time for your medicine.

503
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,920
Mother,

504
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,160
once you've recovered,

505
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,350
we'll leave Yizhou

506
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,830
and move to Jiangnan.

507
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,000
We'll live a peaceful life as a family.

508
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,800
You and Yaoting go first.

509
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
I'll join you after I settle things here.

510
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,520
If you come with us to Jiangnan,

511
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,190
what about Yang Jinglan?

512
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,760
What about the Yang family?

513
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,430
The Yang family's business will expand to Jiangnan too.

514
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,560
I'll manage it then.

515
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,920
And after this year, Yang Jinglan can transfer his post.

516
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,400
He'll come with me.

517
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,830
Yingying,

518
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,350
are you lying to me again?

519
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,110
I know

520
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,920
you just want to send me somewhere safe

521
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,800
so you can go on taking risks yourself.

522
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,520
Even if we do go to Jiangnan,

523
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,400
you won't easily give up.

524
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,560
You still want to fight for an outcome.

525
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,000
Mother, I've made up my mind.

526
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,310
I won't fight anymore.

527
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,190
All I want is for you to be safe.

528
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,310
Madam,

529
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,040
Yang Jinglan is here.

530
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,880
He said he came to greet his mother-in-law.

531
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,230
Why is he here?

532
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,310
Yingying.

533
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,110
Yingying.

534
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,310
Compose yourself.

535
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,830
He's injured.

536
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,920
He shouldn't be moving around recklessly.

537
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,640
I'll go meet him first.

538
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,640
Do you know

539
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,070
what Yingying's favorite food is?

540
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,280
I don't know.

541
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,710
And what food does she hate the most?

542
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,110
I don't know.

543
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,350
What does she love to play with?

544
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,310
When she's upset,

545
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,070
what does she like to do the most?

546
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,710
I don't know.

547
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,230
Yaoting!

548
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,710
Look at you.

549
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,280
It's only been a day,

550
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,310
and you already miss him.

551
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,520
I don't miss him.

552
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,070
I'm just worried about his health.

553
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,430
That's still missing him.

554
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,520
Don't worry.

555
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,310
Your brother knows his limits.

556
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,040
Come,

557
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,230
sit here.

558
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,280
Yingying,

559
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,760
the Yang family is a prominent household.

560
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,310
There must be many rules.

561
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,950
Now that you're married,

562
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
try to manage your temper.

563
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,110
Don't act like you're still at home,

564
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,680
causing chaos all day.

565
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,070
No, I didn't!

566
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:34,760
Here,

567
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,350
take this.

568
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,470
If you find it hard to bear,

569
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,920
just fiddle with these prayer beads

570
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,280
and think about my advice.

571
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,640
If you really can't bear it,

572
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,560
don't wrong yourself either.

573
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,760
All right.

574
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,190
Let me help you put it on.

575
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,160
Thank you, Mother.

576
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,040
So, what do you truly understand?

577
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,040
I know that since I've married her,

578
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,880
I must be her support,

579
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,470
so she won't face the hardships alone.

580
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,710
You and she are like-minded,

581
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,160
with hearts that resonate.

582
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,040
But marriage

583
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,070
is more than just that.

584
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,070
For a husband and wife,

585
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:22,160
the various household affairs

586
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,880
of daily life

587
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,280
can wear down feelings

588
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,520
just as much as external hardships.

589
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,920
And Yingying is no ordinary woman.

590
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,350
Perhaps,

591
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,760
it will be even harder for her to adjust.

592
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:40,760
That's true,

593
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,640
but where she belongs

594
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,280
is by my side,

595
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,880
not with the prominent Yang family.

596
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,110
Once she fulfills her obligations to the Yang family,

597
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,680
we'll move out.

598
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,680
Through every meal and every night,

599
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,680
through every season,

600
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,560
I'll be with her,

601
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,710
love her,

602
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,800
understand her,

603
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,070
and respect her.

604
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,830
Even though she's now my wife,

605
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,430
Ji Yingying

606
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,160
is still herself first

607
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,070
before she is my wife.

608
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,920
Yang Jinglan,

609
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,520
who allowed you to come out?

610
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,620
[To Ms. Yang: I am Dr. Zhang. Based on my evaluation,]

611
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,630
[Mr. Yang's condition allows him to travel by carriage.]

612
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,880
Did you force him

613
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
to write this?

614
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,110
In your eyes,

615
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,280
am I truly so unrefined?

616
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,280
Come on,

617
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,310
help me up.

618
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,430
What are you trying to do?

619
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,280
Don't move.

620
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,880
It's my first time visiting.

621
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,040
I must pay my respects to my mother-in-law.

622
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,070
Come on, Yingying,

623
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,880
help me up.

624
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,430
But you...

625
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,640
Please, I'm begging you.

626
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,430
Take care.

627
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,110
As you wish.

628
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,830
Guo Kui,

629
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:04,950
look at me.

630
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,070
I've finally entered through the front door

631
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,830
with proper dignity.

632
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,040
Shut up.

633
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,280
Mother.

634
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,280
Mr. Yang, you're still injured.

635
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,470
No need for formalities.

636
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:21,950
Etiquette cannot be abandoned.

637
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,560
I hereby pay my respects to you.

638
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,920
The marriage was rushed,

639
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,070
and I couldn't inform you in time.

640
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,880
Please forgive me.

641
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,680
Good child, get up.

642
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,520
Before, I was so worried about Yingying's safety

643
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,680
that I nearly ruined your union.

644
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:03,280
Now that you're finally together,

645
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,160
I've come to understand.

646
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,430
From now on, our family will stand together

647
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,520
through thick and thin.

648
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,920
I entrust our Yingying

649
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,280
to your care.

650
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,230
Please don't worry.

651
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,880
As long as I'm by Yingying's side,

652
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,640
I'll protect her

653
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,920
until she...

654
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,710
No,

655
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,760
until I give my last breath.

656
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,040
The Crown Prince sends congratulations to the Ji family!

657
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,280
Mrs. Ji,

658
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,230
His Highness congratulates

659
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,880
Inspector Yang and Ms. Ji on their joyous union

660
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,160
and sends these gifts

661
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,470
to celebrate the occasion.

662
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,880
The entire Ji family bows in gratitude for His Highness's generosity.

663
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,310
Please, rise.

664
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,640
This is a gift

665
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,470
that my senior prepared for me.

666
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,160
Please accept it, Mrs. Ji.

667
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,280
The Crown Prince has prepared so much already.

668
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,040
Your husband

669
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,760
is using the Crown Prince's name

670
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,070
to make up your betrothal gifts.

671
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,670
Now let's see

672
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:11,470
who dares say your marriage isn't proper anymore!

673
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,950
Though I stole you as my wife,

674
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,950
what other wives have,

675
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,390
my wife

676
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,560
will have as well.

677
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,190
I'll make sure you get

678
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,390
everything you deserve.

679
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,630
Slow down.

680
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,840
Here.

681
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,190
They're still so careless.

682
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,280
My mother and brother insisted

683
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,630
that I bring these small items.

684
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,800
They're just everyday things I use.

685
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,600
They're afraid I'm not used to the Yang family.

686
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,040
If you ever need anything else,

687
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,080
just let me know.

688
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,390
I'll have someone get it for you.

689
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,230
I don't need it.

690
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,320
Could you go slower?

691
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,230
Yang Jinglan.

692
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:15,840
Fine.

693
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,600
Why are you staring at me?

694
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,120
Because you're beautiful.

695
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,040
Yang Jinglan, can you say something?

696
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,800
It's too quiet.

697
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,800
All right.

698
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,080
Why don't you ask me

699
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,080
about me and the Crown Prince?

700
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,280
Fine!

701
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,360
You're an inspector

702
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,630
and carry the Crown Prince's orders.

703
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,320
So, you're one of his men?

704
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,710
More or less.

705
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,120
What do you mean by "more or less"?

706
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,000
You dare to eat my chicken?

707
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,080
That'll be 500 taels. Cash only.

708
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:42,600
A guest is always welcome.

709
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,000
Don't be so stingy.

710
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,080
Aren't you curious

711
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,910
about who I am?

712
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,080
Looking at your attire,

713
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,320
you're either rich or noble.

714
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,150
No ordinary person would come

715
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,600
to such a godforsaken place.

716
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,910
You must be following orders from that old man.

717
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,080
Do you know

718
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,080
that the old man you speak of

719
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,800
was once the Crown Prince's tutor?

720
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,080
I didn't know before.

721
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,190
Now I do.

722
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,390
Turns out I'm not the only person that the old man's messed with.

723
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,710
If you lie with coal, you get blackened.

724
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,600
The Crown Prince must be terribly crooked, then.

725
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,430
Who is it?

726
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,430
Greetings, Sir.

727
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:23,870
He's your teacher?

728
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,840
Old man, how many students have you taken in?

729
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,870
In my entire life,

730
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,520
I've only taken you two as disciples.

731
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,430
Especially you, little rascal,

732
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,710
you've been more than enough for me to handle.

733
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,840
How could I possibly have the energy for anyone else?

734
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,870
So he is...

735
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:38,120
the Crown Prince?

736
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,040
Call him Senior Brother.

737
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,490
[The Crown Prince]

738
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,470
The old man is dead.

739
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,190
I cannot let this grudge go unanswered.

740
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,230
Please, Your Highness, grant me this.

741
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,080
Rise.

742
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,190
Do you think I haven't thought of avenging our teacher?

743
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,040
If it weren't for my pleas,

744
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,360
he wouldn't have met this end.

745
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,520
But now,

746
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,190
the court is in chaos.

747
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,840
The Military Commissioner is holding his own army.

748
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,870
And Yizhou is not even under my jurisdiction.

749
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,320
Our teacher's death

750
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,190
may be a warning to me.

751
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,390
If Your Highness give me the chance,

752
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,710
Yizhou

753
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,230
can forever remain the Emperor's Yizhou.

754
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,000
You want to help me break this deadlock?

755
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,230
So,

756
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,470
you're not only the Crown Prince's subordinate

757
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:48,840
but also his junior brother.

758
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,040
And Yizhou's fate is tied to the standing of Chang'an?

759
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,000
That depends

760
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,800
on what I can uncover.

761
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
How do you plan to investigate?

762
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,630
Niu Jin knows my identity now.

763
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,280
He'll undoubtedly be more cautious in the future.

764
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,840
But his past deeds

765
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,430
would leave traces.

766
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,600
Now that he knows

767
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,120
I've looked into Nanzhao,

768
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,710
he wouldn't dare

769
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,080
to tamper with anyone tied to that line

770
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,280
for fear of exposing himself.

771
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,000
Niu Jin produces the Shu brocade,

772
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,470
Nanzhao buys the Shu brocade,

773
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,390
so who transports

774
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,670
the brocade?

775
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,630
From Yizhou to Nanzhao,

776
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,800
there are numerous checkpoints.

777
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,630
To avoid detection,

778
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,390
one must disguise themselves.

779
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,600
You want to investigate foreign merchants?

780
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,430
You're smart!

781
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,760
But with so many foreign merchants,

782
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,870
how will you narrow it down?

783
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,800
I have someone in mind.

784
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,390
I've thought of someone too.

785
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,120
- Bai Sheng! - Prince Bai of Nanzhao!

786
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,000
Prince Bai?

787
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,800
Sheng Fengze.

788
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,230
Sheng Fengze...

789
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,950
Bai Sheng...

790
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,870
Could they be the same person?

791
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,230
It's possible.

792
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,560
But based on his age,

793
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,000
he would have been just a child

794
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,000
the year my father had his incident.

795
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,670
That doesn't add up.

796
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,190
However, if he's only involved in smuggling,

797
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,630
why would he personally travel such great distances to Yizhou?

798
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,280
And later, when he approached me,

799
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,190
what was he after?

00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,470
