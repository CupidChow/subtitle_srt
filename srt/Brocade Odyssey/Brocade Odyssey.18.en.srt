00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,590
Mr. Yu!

4
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,040
Mr. Yu.

5
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,040
One hundred guan.

6
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
Nothing less than that.

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,040
During the brocade-weaving process,

8
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,440
you may watch,

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,910
but please do not interfere.

10
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,400
I will leave it all up to you to decide.

11
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,360
Well...

12
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,400
I wish you both success

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,360
in your work

14
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,590
and a speedy completion of the new brocade.

15
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,660
[The Yu Residence]

16
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,000
Deep roots, flourishing leaves,

17
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
and an endless legacy.

18
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Let us begin the nail-dipping ceremony!

19
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,270
Open the brocade workshop!

20
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,080
Father,

21
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,600
as the silk is not ready,

22
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,440
it cannot go on the loom yet.

23
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,440
I am back.

24
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,270
Has the new brocade been weaved already?

25
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
The pattern has not been decided,

26
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,190
so the brocade cannot be woven yet.

27
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,520
They are still selecting threads, matching colors,

28
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,550
and perfecting the weaving method.

29
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,670
Hopefully, the pattern will be finished soon.

30
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,360
From what you are saying,

31
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,600
it seems that the pattern is the core of brocade weaving.

32
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,080
Silk dyeing has its own specific formula,

33
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,110
and the pattern is the formula for brocade weaving.

34
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,910
With the pattern,

35
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,270
even the most complex brocade can be woven.

36
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,880
However, I do not believe

37
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,600
that the pattern is the core of brocade.

38
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,080
Why are you looking at me like that, Mr. Bai?

39
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,720
You are speaking frankly

40
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
and from the heart.

41
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,800
I was not expecting you

42
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,360
to share that with me.

43
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,160
This is included in the 100 guan you paid me.

44
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,720
In business, I have always been fair

45
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,670
and honest with everyone.

46
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,950
With your character,

47
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,920
you are bound to achieve great things in the future!

48
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:27,720
Still, I cannot help but wonder.

49
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Why would a woman like you

50
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,510
indulge in this field?

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,350
That question is not within the scope of the 100 guan.

52
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,350
Okay then. I will ask something else within the scope.

53
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,270
What is

54
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,720
the core of brocade weaving?

55
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,760
I will not

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,880
be able to answer that.

57
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,000
Everyone has

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,070
a different answer to it.

59
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,760
They should be working on

60
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,790
selecting the threads and matching the colors now.

61
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,550
Please come with me, Mr. Bai.

62
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:57,950
After you.

63
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,110
This green is a mix of indigo and gardenia,

64
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,920
perfectly capturing the fresh greenery of wheat!

65
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,480
He is right.

66
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,790
The green you picked is too dark!

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,510
Mine is much brighter and clearer!

68
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,070
It is indeed brighter.

69
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,550
Since we are making a shimmering brocade,

70
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,880
it needs to be bright and stunning!

71
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,720
Wait, I think...

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,550
Since we are aiming for something new,

73
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,110
we should innovate,

74
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,720
- right? - Wait! Wait!

75
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,720
Can I offer some advice?

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,320
These two colors are quite similar.

77
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,110
How about we roll the dice to decide?

78
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:22,920
Shut up!

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,830
Ms. Ji.

80
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,510
Mr. Bai.

81
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,920
You are right on time.

82
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,070
Please decide for us.

83
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,950
Which is better?

84
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,720
Talk it over among yourselves,

85
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
and do not get upset.

86
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,390
I will take Mr. Bai to...

87
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,790
the workshop to take a look.

88
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,200
Come with me, Mr. Bai.

89
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,320
Yingying!

90
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,390
Disagreements are inevitable

91
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,510
when two different parties work together.

92
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,000
Let us head to the workshop now.

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,950
My brother is there.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,230
He likes to study.

95
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,480
He is technically a scholar.

96
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,200
Okay.

97
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,790
Why can we not use the old method then?

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
It is possible,

99
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,760
but...

100
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,790
What is wrong with it?

101
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,510
But to achieve the flowing ripple effect,

102
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,350
I think we should use colors instead.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,390
Yingying is good at matching colors.

104
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,320
I think…

105
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,920
the wheat stalks should be done

106
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,790
in satin weave.

107
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,920
Satin weave?

108
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,480
Plain weave is the best for basic but delicate patterns!

109
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,480
That is it.

110
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,550
You are useless. Stay out of this.

111
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,160
Excuse me? Watch your mouth.

112
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,920
Do you even know who I am?

113
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,670
This place belongs to the Yu family.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,510
Are you sure?

115
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,920
I am almost certain that it will become part of Bloom

116
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,350
pretty soon.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,880
Excuse me, the Ji family!

118
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,390
Where did that come from?

119
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Why would you say that it belongs to the Ji family or Bloom?

120
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,320
It belongs to the Yu family.

121
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,510
Is this what you meant by true teamwork, Ms. Ji?

122
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,270
It seems that I will not be

123
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,920
getting back my investment.

124
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,350
The table is filled with delicacies.

125
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,720
Why are none of you trying it out?

126
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,550
I am too upset

127
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,510
to have any appetite.

128
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,200
Since no one is hungry,

129
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,550
shall we play a game then?

130
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,480
Yes! What kind of game?

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,510
You shall ask a question about the brocade business.

132
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
If my brother answers correctly,

133
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,510
each of you will earn one wen.

134
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,110
Then, my brother will ask you a question,

135
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:52,920
and you answer it.

136
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,350
The more you answer, the more you earn!

137
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,760
The game continues until someone falls

138
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,390
or the board touches the ground.

139
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,110
Sir, what is your question?

140
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,000
The number of chopsticks represents the count for Shu brocade's cardinal colors.

141
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,350
Shu brocade's cardinal colors?

142
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,480
There are five colors.

143
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,670
Red, yellow, blue, white, and black.

144
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,480
Yes! You got it!

145
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,200
Here, it is your turn to ask!

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
The binary colors.

147
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,950
The binary colors of Shu brocade

148
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,230
are red, green, blue, and purple,

149
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,200
making four in total.

150
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,510
Excellent!

151
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,000
Another correct answer! Two wen in total now!

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,110
Hold as long as you can!

153
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,950
Whoever answers the most

154
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,920
will earn an additional three wen. Let us go!

155
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:37,030
How many patterns were featured

156
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,200
in the Five Stars Rising in the East brocade from the Han Dynasty?

157
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,200
Five.

158
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,110
How is it five patterns?

159
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,350
Is it five?

160
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,960
You…

161
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,350
think carefully.

162
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,320
It is five patterns.

163
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,080
You… You!

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,200
Think, will you?

165
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,200
Hold on tight! Hold it!

166
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,520
Are you okay?

167
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,590
It is four patterns!

168
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,080
Seriously, do you even know about brocades?

169
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,400
Grass lizards, talisman tigers,

170
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,470
suns, moons,

171
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,550
and the white-colored small seal scriptures.

172
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,550
The white-colored small seal scriptures are included?

173
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,960
The white-colored small seal scriptures?

174
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,350
That is included?

175
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,150
The characters are part of the pattern.

176
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,790
I meant to test you,

177
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,960
but now it is me who has...

178
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,030
shown my weakness.

179
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,280
I have made a fool of myself.

180
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,790
Congratulations to both of you for getting two wen!

181
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,110
Two wen!

182
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,710
I am rich now!

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,960
People in the Shu brocade business are straightforward!

184
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,590
If there is a question, we will ask it,

185
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,760
and if there is a disagreement, we will settle it through competition.

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,320
But we must remember,

187
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,150
whatever we do,

188
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,760
it is all to create new brocade.

189
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,670
Remember, we succeed

190
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,880
and profit only

191
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,110
by supporting each other!

192
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,880
Yes! Well said!

193
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,230
That is right.

194
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,470
We win and we make money.

195
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,400
Anyone else want to play the game?

196
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,790
Mr. Li,

197
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,350
shall we?

198
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,400
Okay. Let us do it!

199
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,550
I will ask the question!

200
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,670
Let me do it instead.

201
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,320
Exchanging knowledge,

202
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,670
deepening understanding,

203
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
and building closer connections.

204
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,960
You truly live up to your name, Ms. Ji.

205
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,350
This three-in-one approach

206
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,960
is indeed a great method.

207
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,880
By the way,

208
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,400
there was a question just now

209
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,400
about

210
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,880
what is most important in the Shu brocade business.

211
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,910
I am sure

212
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,710
that your answer is unity,

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,790
right?

214
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,110
Yes!

215
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,840
Unity.

216
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
People are the core.

217
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,200
The patterns and the loom are lifeless.

218
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,710
Only in the hands of skilled artisans do they come to life.

219
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,960
Whatever your plans are,

220
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
please remember to value these craftsmen, Mr. Bai.

221
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,550
I will keep that in mind.

222
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,080
Mr. Li won!

223
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,320
Do not worry, Ms. Ji.

224
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,880
Give me the money! I won!

225
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,910
Why are you asking me? You should be giving me the money!

226
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,080
Next! Who will be the next one?

227
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,320
What is it, Mr. Chen?

228
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,790
Ms. Ji,

229
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,960
Mr. Bai,

230
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,350
have a try.

231
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,150
Mr. Bai and I will not be participating.

232
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:32,960
Wait!

233
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,880
Anyway,

234
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,440
I guess I am now

235
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,350
somewhat part of the brocade business.

236
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,960
Why not give it a try?

237
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,960
Give it a try, Ji Yingying!

238
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Yes! Give it a try!

239
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:48,960
Give it a try!

240
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,670
Okay, okay. I will give it a try.

241
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,550
Very well. Let us give it a try.

242
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,320
After you.

243
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,230
Watch out.

244
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,760
My question is,

245
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:13,150
how sincere are you about wanting to be friends with me?

246
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,200
Your question is not about the brocade business.

247
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,670
You just said

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,470
that the people are the most important thing in the brocade business.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,030
So, asking about the heart

250
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,670
is naturally part of it.

251
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,280
If you do not answer,

252
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,960
you will be hurting my sincere heart.

253
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:30,960
Ten chopsticks!

254
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,880
Ten chopsticks?

255
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,470
Really?

256
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,280
Did you fail to sense

257
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,880
my utmost sincerity

258
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,640
in doing business with you, Mr. Bai?

259
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,000
You are hurting my sincere heart.

260
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,960
Very well then. I have lost this round.

261
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,710
But

262
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,550
please give me another chance.

263
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,710
You can ask the question.

264
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,840
Okay!

265
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,640
I would like to ask,

266
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,840
how many days will you be staying in Yizhou, Mr. Bai?

267
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,670
Is this within the scope of the brocade business as well?

268
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,440
The core of the brocade business is the people.

269
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,470
Since you are an important figure here,

270
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,790
this naturally relates to the brocade business.

271
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,200
You are right.

272
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,280
Well, I should think carefully

273
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,080
about the answer.

274
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,230
Ms. Ji, make sure you grab the rope.

275
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,400
Hold on tight.

276
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,670
What are you doing here?

277
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,670
I am sharing the joy with the people!

278
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,910
I have not finished my round

279
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,350
with Ms. Ji.

280
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,670
If you wish to participate, Mr. Yang,

281
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,400
you should wait for a moment.

282
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
From what I see,

283
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,400
this round should have ended a while ago.

284
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,000
Both of you,

285
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,590
I, Ji Yingying, am a person,

286
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,590
not an item that you can try to snatch from one another!

287
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,200
I will not be going anywhere

288
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
just because you ask me either!

289
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,400
Since you two love this game so much,

290
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
you should both play instead.

291
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,280
Sorry, I was being rude.

292
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,550
I'm sorry.

293
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,760
Thank you for walking toward me, Ms. Ji.

294
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,790
Yang Jinglan,

295
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,960
is the silk thread in your hands

296
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,000
the Flushed Rose that I dyed?

297
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,230
Flushed Rose!

298
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:43,960
Yes.

299
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,080
I had no other choice.

300
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,640
Do you know how much effort it took me

301
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,550
to dye this silk thread?

302
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,550
Yeah!

303
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,400
It took days! It was so much work!

304
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,030
How about

305
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,320
I compensate you?

306
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,590
Compensate me, you say?

307
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,230
That will not do.

308
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,000
I will double it.

309
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,230
Is that good enough?

310
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,350
No way!

311
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,670
Doubling it is not enough.

312
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,000
I will triple it. That is the most I can do.

313
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,880
You will triple it?

314
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,640
Those who are caught up in emotions

315
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,840
cannot achieve great things.

316
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,750
[The Yu Residence]

317
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,760
Ms. Ji, you have been working hard. Why not take a break for lunch?

318
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,080
What are you doing here?

319
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,150
I have come to apologize

320
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,000
for mishandling the silk thread

321
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,030
and disrespecting

322
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,350
your hard work.

323
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,080
What is that?

324
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,880
Take a seat and give it a try.

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,590
Be careful.

326
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,590
Push back with your legs.

327
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,000
This is interesting.

328
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,200
But... what is the use of this?

329
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,150
Put this in the brocade workshop.

330
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,230
You can sit on it and move around with ease.

331
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,590
It will help you save some energy,

332
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,670
and keep you entertained.

333
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,200
Did you make this yourself?

334
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:46,790
Yes.

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,030
Can you forgive me now

336
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,790
for mishandling Flushed Rose?

337
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,790
Fine. I will let it slide this time.

338
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,550
But that is not all I am here for today.

339
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,440
I have another favor

340
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,150
to ask of you.

341
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,400
What is it?

342
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,070
Teach me about brocade.

343
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,310
Is it because you have to deliver the tribute brocade?

344
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It is because

345
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,350
I want to see the world

346
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,400
as you do.

347
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,400
Take a seat.

348
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,350
I will get the brocade.

349
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,590
Cover your eyes.

350
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,000
What for?

351
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,350
Do you not wish to learn how to identify brocade?

352
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,950
Ms. Ji, you sure have a unique method

353
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,430
for identifying brocade.

354
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,470
A true expert does not rely

355
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,350
solely on their eyes to identify brocade.

356
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,190
They must use their heart.

357
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:08,830
Yeah.

358
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,800
It is done.

359
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,470
Can you see?

360
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,640
Ji Yingying, stop right there.

361
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,350
I am ready.

362
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,070
Alright. Let us begin with our first brocade.

363
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,070
Touch it.

364
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,070
Take your time to truly feel it.

365
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Can you identify it?

366
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,560
How can you identify this brocade

367
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,470
just by blindly feeling it?

368
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,280
This is a petal.

369
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,070
It unfurls in layer.

370
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,830
This is a stamen.

371
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,070
The weaving is delicate.

372
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,430
This is a leaf

373
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,640
and a vine.

374
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,000
Flowers bloom on all six sides.

375
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,560
There are leaves among the flowers,

376
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,800
and flowers nestled in the leaves.

377
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,350
Layer upon layer,

This is the Lotus Blossom Brocade.

381
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,000
Nicely done!

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,640

we try again?

Dear, you sure are thorough.

419
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,350
You are personally checking the brocade before its delivery.

420
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,400
What are you doing?

421
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,830
You have been working hard these past few days,

422
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,710
and overseeing the brocade daily.

423
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,230
How could anything go wrong?

424
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,430
The servants can handle the brocade delivery out of the city.

425
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,040
You really ought to get some rest.

426
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,070
I am just reminding you

427
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,520
to stay out

428
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,710
of the brocade delivery.

429
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,920
Have you forgotten

430
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:37,470
how Master Ji died?

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,350
Yes, sir.

433
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,470
My dear,

434
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,230
this will be a dangerous journey.

435
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,190
Be careful out there.

436
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,590
I will be going with you

437
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,710
to deliver the brocade.

438
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,590
The list of people handling the brocade delivery

439
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,040
has already been finalized.

440
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,680
Even though you are the Brocade Master,

441
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,590
you cannot come with me.

442
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,800
This has been done by past Brocade Masters.

443
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,430
It is just a matter of choice.

444
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,640
Do not try to force my hand

445
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
with that official document.

446
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,310
Fine. Do as you wish.

447
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,560
Let us go!

448
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,350
Here.

449
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,830
Why are you here?

450
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,070
I wish to personally deliver

451
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,640
the Shu Red Silk I have dyed.

452
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,590
Just wait for me to return.

453
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,590
Back then, my father was killed

454
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,110
because of Shu Red Silk.

455
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,710
Yang Jinglan, I am worried about you.

456
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,680
Even if you will not bring me along,

457
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,830
I will still follow you.

458
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,920
Ms. Ji,

459
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,800
I truly need you.

460
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,830
However, this time,

461
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,280
I need you to stay in Yizhou

462
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,470
and not by my side.

463
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,430
You need me to stay in Yizhou?

464
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,640
Yes.

465
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,710
If I get tired from the journey,

466
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,560
I would like to come back home.

467
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:09,400
Okay?

468
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Please, Ms. Ji.

469
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,070
General,

470
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,230
we have received word from Yizhou.

471
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,230
Yang Jinglan and the rest

472
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,880
are making their way to Chang'an with the tribute brocade.

473
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,470
Please keep him safe.

474
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,190
He is a good officer.

475
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,070
He is vital to Yizhou,

476
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,110
and someone I deeply care about.

477
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,190
I pray for his safety.

478
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:35,950
Ms. Ji.

479
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,760
Mr. Bai, what brings you here?

480
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,880
I was having a drink at San Hua Pavilion

481
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,040
and happened to see you rushing past.

482
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,640
I thought something had happened.

483
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,110
Thank you for your concern.

484
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,640
Oh, right,

485
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,430
the shop had just two left,

486
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,640
so I bought them all.

487
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,880
Here is the last one. You can have it.

488
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,430
This is...?

489
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,520
This is a tradition in Yizhou.

490
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,350
After making a wish, you throw the red ribbon on the tree.

491
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,280
It is believed to keep your loved ones safe,

492
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,880
and a way to send your thoughts to them.

493
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,400
I do not have anyone

494
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,230
I miss.

495
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Everyone has to face

496
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,470
a lonely, cold path at some point,

497
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,470
but life will not always stay that way.

498
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,110
Give it a shot.

499
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,280
You could wish

500
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:33,680
for someone

501
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,920
worthy of your thoughts

502
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,160
one day.

503
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,230
Alright, then.

504
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,160
To be honest,

505
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,710
I do not believe in deities

506
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,230
or making wishes.

507
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,400
How about

508
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,110
you make a wish for me, Ms. Ji?

509
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,520
I have made wishes for my mother, Yaoting,

510
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,880
Mr. Chen, and Ms. Zhu before.

511
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,350
But they are my close family and friends.

512
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,640
As for you, Mr. Bai, we are not quite there yet.

513
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,400
We have known each other for some time.

514
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,760
We have made deals

515
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,920
and shared moments of camaraderie.

516
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,350
But as a friend,

517
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,680
I find you

518
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,710
not entirely honest.

519
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,880
Let us stick to business, shall we?

520
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,280
Farewell.

521
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,110
Make your own wish.

522
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,680
Sincerity is what counts.

523
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,280
Mr. Yang, thank you for your hard work.

524
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,920
Long time no see, sir.

525
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,160
It is late.

526
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,710
Please rest here at the inn tonight, Mr. Yang.

527
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,920
Tomorrow morning, we will set off to inspect the brocade.

528
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,280
Very well.

529
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,350
This way, please.

530
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,640
Hurry!

531
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Replace all the tribute brocade with the fakes.

532
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,070
If you want to blame someone,

533
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,560
blame yourself for offending the wrong person!

534
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:32,830
Are you talking about me?

535
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,560
Do not move!

536
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,520
Mr. Yang?

537
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,680
You have swapped the tribute brocade

538
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,350
and attacked me, logistics officer.

539
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,950
This is a capital offense.

540
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
At this point,

541
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,710
stop accusing others to cover up your own crime.

542
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,470
Instead, you should reflect on this.

543
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,070
Your plan was so meticulous.

544
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,950
If someone did not betray you,

545
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,680
I would not have caught you red-handed.

546
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,880
I have no idea

547
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,160
what you are talking about.

548
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,560
You know that I am at odds with Niu Jin.

549
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,470
Niu Jin wields absolute power in Yizhou.

550
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,830
But tell me,

551
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,950
why do you think he does not dare to kill me?

552
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,680
It is because he fears the person backing me.

553
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,880
The person backing you?

554
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,430
Who is it?

555
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,920
Tell them to get inside.

556
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,560
Go inside!

557
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:34,280
Shut the door!

558
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,230
Mr. Yang,

559
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,470
can you tell me now?

560
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,680
The person backing me is not important.

561
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,640
What matters is this.

562
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,280
Niu Jin does not dare make a move against me

563
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,280
because

564
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,430
he needs to give both me and the person behind me an explanation.

565
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,190
Do you still remember Ji Guinan, sir?

566
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,560
When the truth was revealed,

567
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,710
he became the scapegoat.

568
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,760
Does that sound eerily familiar to what is happening now?

569
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,920
I do not understand what you are saying!

570
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,070
After what happened to Ji Guinan,

571
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,470
you stopped transporting tribute brocade altogether.

572
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,760
Yet now that I am here,

573
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,350
you have suddenly returned to the role.

574
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,830
Niu Jin wants you

575
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,950
to die by my hand

576
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,470
or I die by yours.

577
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,040
With that, he can close the case.

578
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,560
If that is true,

579
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,280
then why have you not acted yet?

580
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,830
I do not wish for both of us to lose,

581
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,040
only for Niu Jin to benefit.

582
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,470
Moreover,

583
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,520
you were only following orders back then.

584
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,560
Killing you is not enough

585
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,560
to bring peace to the departed.

586
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,000
What if

587
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,110
you and I joined forces?

588
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,280
No matter who I collaborate with,

589
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,110
death is the only outcome.

590
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,350
There is a difference

591
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,310
between one death

592
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,040
and the death of an entire family.

593
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,000
What do you think?

594
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,470
Be careful!

595
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,520
Whose men are those?

596
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,950
It seems that I underestimated Niu Jin.

597
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,080
He does not just want one of us dead.

598
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,080
He wants us both dead here!

599
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,760
Later, you will be said to have swapped the tribute brocade

600
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,470
and I risked my life to catch you.

601
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,150
You take the blame for his crime,

602
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,360
and I die in the act of apprehending you.

603
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,040
At this point,

604
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,430
do you still not see that this is a death trap?

605
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,520
Collaborating with me

606
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,520
is your only way out.

607
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,600
Have you not figured it out yet?

608
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,870
Now that it has come to this,

609
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,040
I will collaborate with you!

610
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,470
I am willing to write a confession

611
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,280
for my role in the tribute brocade affair

612
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,470
and expose the traitors.

613
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,840
But in return,

614
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,080
you must guarantee the safety of my wife and daughter.

615
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,670
Very well.

616
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,280
I promise you.

617
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,910
Yang Jinglan has captured the logistics officer.

618
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,120
Take 100 elite soldiers and head north immediately.

619
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,950
You must intercept them

620
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:25,760
before they reach Shannan Road.

621
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,320
Leave no survivors.

622
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,080
What about Mr. Zhao?

623
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,760
I said, leave no survivors!

624
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,360
Yes, sir!

625
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,150
Yang Jinglan

626
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,870
captured the logistics officer two days ago.

627
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,670
How is it that they have only just reached Shannan Road today?

628
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,520
They are moving so slowly

629
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,040
and not concealing their tracks.

630
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,710
This has to be bait.

631
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:21,120
So, General, you are saying...

632
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,670
Mobilize our men immediately.

633
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,670
We return to Yizhou at once.

634
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,600
Yes, sir.

635
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,840
Ms. Ji,

636
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,760
may I have a word with you?

637
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,360
Master Gao,

638
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,910
where is Yang Jinglan?

639
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,150
Has something happened to him?

640
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,230
Ms. Ji,

641
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,560
Mr. Yang risked his life this time

642
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,560
and took such a dangerous gamble.

643
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,520
It is because

644
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
he wants to clear your father's name.

645
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,560
He convinced the military commissioner

646
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,390
to assign the logistics officer who was involved in your father's case

647
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,560
to handle this current shipment.

648
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,520
This was to lure Niu Jin into making a move.

649
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,840
Then, he used the opportunity

650
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,000
to capture the logistics officer,

651
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,600
tricking him into believing

652
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,910
that Niu Jin planned to make him the scapegoat.

653
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,120
Then, we disguised ourselves

654
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,150
as assassins sent by Niu Jin

655
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,630
to make the deception more convincing

656
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,760
- and force the logistics officer. - Collaborating with me

657
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,520
is your only way out.

658
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,840
Then,

659
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,000
he took a fake logistics officer to Chang'an,

660
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,520
drawing Niu Jin's attention away from us.

661
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,190
What about the real logistics officer?

662
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,760
Did you bring him back to Yizhou?

663
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:22,390
Yes.

664
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,040
Initially,

665
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,760
we planned to hide him in a secure location.

666
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,120
But we just received news

667
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,120
that Niu Jin

668
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,080
is leading a large troop

669
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,670
and is heading toward Yizhou.

670
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,360
He has seen through our plan

671
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,520
much sooner than Yang Jinglan anticipated.

672
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,870
If he starts searching,

673
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,360
we will not be able to keep the real logistics officer hidden.

674
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,600
Yang Jinglan told me

675
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,080
that if anything unexpected happens,

676
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,560
I should come to you, Ms. Ji.

677
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,000
Stop!

678
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,600
It is time.

679
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,040
Turn around!

680
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,280
We are heading back to Yizhou!

681
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:07,840
Come!

682
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,710
New brocade pre-orders from Bloom Society!

683
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,600
All interested buyers who attend the event

684
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,120
will receive a complimentary pouch.

685
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,390
First come, first served!

686
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,000
Let us go!

687
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,280
Bloom Society's pouches

688
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,950
are exquisitely crafted, durable,

689
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,040
and have a uniquely pleasant fragrance.

690
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,910
The carriage is here!

691
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,600
The carriage is here! Make way!

692
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,800
Ji Guinan is hereby sentenced to immediate execution

693
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,120
for presenting inferior goods as tribute,

694
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,470
deceiving the emperor,

695
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,630
and resisting arrest!

696
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,520
Everyone,

697
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,520
the logistics officer has been arrested

698
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,040
for dereliction of duty and theft.

699
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,230
This matter threatens the entire brocade industry of Yizhou.

700
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,390
To protect the interests of the brocade merchants,

701
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,870
I, Zhuge Hong,

702
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,430
representing Brocade Bureau,

703
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,230
will now interrogate the accused

704
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,430
to ensure

705
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,000
that justice is served.

706
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,120
What crimes have you committed?

707
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,080
Speak truthfully!

708
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,670
While transporting the tribute brocade,

709
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,430
I swapped

710
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,840
the real goods for inferior ones

711
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,470
to seek personal gain.

712
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,320
Mr. Yang discovered my actions

713
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,670
and caught me red-handed.

714
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,430
Swapping tribute brocade

715
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:46,600
is an unforgivable crime!

716
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,840
With such audacity,

717
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,320
there must be someone else behind this.

718
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,430
No one gave me the orders.

719
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,040
I acted alone.

720
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,630
You have been a logistics officer for years.

721
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:08,950
How many times

722
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,470
have you committed this crime before?

723
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
Ten years ago,

724
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,910
in the case of Ji Guinan's alleged corruption over the tribute brocade,

725
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,230
it was my doing.

726
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,520
I framed Ji Guinan.

727
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,040
He knew nothing

728
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,520
about the embezzlement.

729
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:04,870
I was not expecting you to come in person, General Niu.

730
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,520
How may I help you?

731
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,230
The logistics officer is a soldier of Yizhou's military.

732
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,870
Even if he broke the law,

733
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
he should be handed over to the military.

734
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,470
How is it proper for Brocade Bureau

735
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,760
to make such a spectacle?

736
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,280
General Niu, your reasoning is flawed.

737
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,670
This man swapped tribute brocade

738
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,470
and undermined Yizhou's brocade industry.

739
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,150
He must be tried publicly,

740
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,000
in front of every brocade merchant in Yizhou,

741
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,360
to ensure a fair and transparent inquiry.

742
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,950
Ms. Ji,

743
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,360
this man is ruthless.

744
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,710
Leave him to us.

745
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,800
If anything were to happen to you today,

746
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,470
how would I explain it to Mr. Yang?

747
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,430
My father was falsely accused for years.

748
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,630
I believe in justice and the law.

749
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,710
It will give us the truth we deserve.

750
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,470
You are no officer.

751
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,670
Your baseless accusations

752
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,910
and incitement of the people

753
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,470
are punishable by death!

754
00:41:57,670 --> 00:41:58,710
Take them all away!

755
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,520
Yes, sir!

756
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:00,470
Wait!

757
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,630
I am here under Mr. Yang's orders.

758
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,710
What authority does Brocade Bureau have

759
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,910
to investigate someone from my army?

760
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:08,470
Take them away!

761
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,390
Yes, sir!

762
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:10,710
Hold on...!

763
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,190
General Niu...

764
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,190
Everyone,

765
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,120
the tribute brocade is a treasure beloved by His Majesty.

766
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,430
It is the labor of countless silk and brocade artisans.

767
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,230
It is the pride of Yizhou.

768
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,430
Now, it has been tarnished by traitorous hands,

769
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,040
bringing shame upon us all.

770
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,630
Should we not demand

771
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,040
an explanation?

772
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,150
Exactly!

773
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,600
We deserve an explanation!

774
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,870
General Niu, please investigate thoroughly and seek justice for the people!
