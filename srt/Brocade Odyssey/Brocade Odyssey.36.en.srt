If, within a year,

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,760
you can weave Nanzhao Brocade,

5
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,080

00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,160

It is not a dream.

How did you get here?

24
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
It is dangerous here,

25
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,480

I cannot leave yet.

32
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,160
I made a deal with the King of Nanzhao

33
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,040
to weave Nanzhao Brocade within a year.

34
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,320
If I leave now,

35
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,400
he will vent his wrath on the craftsmen.

36
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,640
A year?

37
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
Are you saying you will stay in this forsaken place

38
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,320

39
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,160
I have no other choice.

40

I understand, Yingying.

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,160
You had no choice before.

42
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,000
But now that I am here, you do.

43

Let's leave this place together.

44
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,800
Nanzhao has always coveted Shu brocade,

45
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,920
yearning for it desperately.

46
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,120
That is why the King of Nanzhao

47
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,720
is willing

48
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,360
to strike a deal

49
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,440
with someone as insignificant as me.

What the King of Nanzhao seeks,

51
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,120
neither Du Yan nor Sheng Fengze can stop him.

52
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,840
Du Yan cannot get us out of here.

53
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,960
But, Yingying,

54
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,560
right now I only want

55

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,480
Shu silkworms and rear them here?

191
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,520
They cannot survive here?

192
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,840
They do survive,

193
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,640
but over time,

194
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,960
the Shu silkworms adapt and turn into Nanzhao silkworms,

195
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
and their silk becomes Nanzhao silk.

196
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,320
Sometimes, I wonder

197
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,440
if silkworms adapt to their surroundings

198
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,440
even faster than people do.

199
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,320
This is not new silk.

200
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,480
It is not.

201
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,920
I began cultivating wild silkworms three years ago.

202
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,520
Nanzhao's silk

203
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,560
combined with Nanzhao's patterns

204
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,880
is the Nanzhao Brocade my brother seeks.

205
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,720
Once Nanzhao Brocade is completed,

206
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,480
my brother will secure his place in history,

207
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
gaining both fame and fortune.

208
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,560
I know

209
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,040
you and I are the same kind of person.

210
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,680
We think alike.

211
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,240
But you are

212
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
too impatient.

213
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,880
You are too impatient, but my brother is even more so.

214
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,280
One year

215
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,680
is far too short.

216
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,440
Your Highness, for something that you have pursued for three years

217
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,360
and still continue to do so,

218
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,680
there must be a certainty of success

219
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,560
that keeps you going.

220
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,560
Look at these.

221
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,520
Are they not beautiful?

222
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,080
They are Shu brocade from Tang Empire.

223
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,480
Of course, they are beautiful.

224
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,240
Now, look at this one.

225
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,120
The patterns and techniques

226
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,240
are Shu brocade,

227
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,640
but the texture and colors are slightly different.

228
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,680
The tensile strength, however, is sufficient.

229
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,760
This was made using silk from Nanzhao's wild silkworms,

230
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,880
then dyed and woven into brocade.

231
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,880
Where is the person who dyed and wove this?

232
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,000
Dead.

233
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,320
There was once a child.

234
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,600
His mother

235
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
was captured by his father

236
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,360
and forced to be his wife.

237
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,440
This brocade robe

238
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,880
belonged to your mother.

239
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,480
I lied to you

240
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,640
before.

241
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,080
This brocade was not something

242
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,360
my mother brought from her homeland.

243
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,200
It was dyed and woven by someone in Nanzhao who succeeded

244
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,480
and gifted it to her.

245
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,040
How long did it take that person?

246
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,480
Ten years.

247
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,880
Doesn't one year seem too short now?

248
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,680
They say

249
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,200
that person was her brother,

250
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,110
but I know the truth.

251
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,920
He was the man my mother truly loved.

252
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,800
And my father knew it too.

253
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,560
All right.

254
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,350
Here is what we will do.

255
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,310
I will take you to another place.

256
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,680
Where to?

257
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,120
That person adopted a child

258
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
named Mu Lan.

259
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,120
I will take you

260
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,600
to see her.

261
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:54,370
[Sheng Fengze and others are not allowed to enter]

262
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,520
Your Highness, even in Nanzhao, there are deals you cannot make

263
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,000
and people you cannot control?

264
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,280
Anyone here?

265
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,680
Anyone?

266
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,600
Are these wild silkworms the kind you have been cultivating?

267
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,040
Do not touch them!

268
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,120
If you were

269
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,680
lying in bed, sleeping peacefully,

270
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,200
when suddenly

271
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
a hand many times your size

272
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
descended from above to touch you,

273
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,800
would you not be terrified?

274
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:39,960
The silkworms feel the same.

275
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,360
Did you not see the sign outside?

276
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Can you not read, or did you change your name?

277
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,680
This is Ms. Ji from Yizhou.

278
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,680
She and her team were the ones

279
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,440
who wove the Ripple Brocade I showed you earlier.

280
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,240
Are you illiterate too?

281
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,200
Your gaze toward her is not exactly pure.

282
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,400
But she looks at you more purely than she would at the clouds.

283
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,800
Why mimic your father, though?

284
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,400
Of all things, why copy him in stealing someone else's wife?

285
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
Your clothes are beautiful.

286
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,480
The colors are quite different from other people of Nanzhao.

287
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,560
Did you dye them yourself?

288
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,600
We are not the same kind of people.

289
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,960
No matter how much you talk, it will not matter.

290
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,000
Shut your lovely mouth.

291
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,560
Even if we are not the same kind of people,

292
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,160
we can still walk the same path.

293
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
I want to use your Nanzhao silk,

294
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,080
combined with Shu brocade's techniques,

295
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,240
to create a new kind of brocade.

296
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,960
One that belongs to Nanzhao.

297
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,800
Do you know how many times

298
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,600
he has said those same things to me?

299
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,160
Men deceiving women is in their nature.

300
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,800
But when women deceive women, that is just heartless.

301
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,480
Young lady,

302
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,640
I would advise you to stay away from him.

303
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,000
This one has plenty of moisture.

304
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,480
You can eat this today.

305
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,640
If you keep feeding them this,

306
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,000
they will die.

307
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,400
These leaves are too moist

308
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,160
and are not suitable for daytime feeding.

309
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Wild silkworms naturally forage freely.

310
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,640
If you insist on raising them like this,

311
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,400
you must understand what they prefer to eat

312
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,760
and when.

313
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,840
Da Bai,

314
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,280
stop stealing Pang Niu's food!

315
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Look at how much bigger you are than her!

316
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:07,840
This...

317
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,880
This one is not bad.

318
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,280
You can feed them this.

319
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,200
But these still are not the best option.

320
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,680
You should be feeding them

321
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,160
a leaf called Tian Bu Pa.

322
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,280
Tian Bu Pa?

323
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,240
You do not even know Tian Bu Pa leaves?

324
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,200
Her skills at raising silkworms are worse than mine.

325
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,120
Let's go.

326
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,480
This was a waste of time.

327
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,200
I did not expect you to have such knowledge

328
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,400
in cultivating wild silkworms, Ms. Ji.

329
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,960
I do not. I was just making things up.

330
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,840
She lives in her own world.

331
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,880
I need to bring her into my world

332
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,680
to truly communicate with her.

333
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,400
Wait a moment.

334
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,600
Is there something wrong?

335
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,440
The leaf you just ate

336
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,880
grows next to poisonous mushrooms.

337
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,680
It is toxic.

338
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,640
People say my words are sharp.

339
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,400
But now your mouth is literally poisoned.

340
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
How do we detoxify it?

341
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,600
What did you give her to drink?

342
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,640
Just something bad.

343
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,080
She will be fine once she vomits.

344
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,480
But,

345
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,400
in a while, she might start seeing things

346
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,600
she should not.

347
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,960
Your Highness,

348
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,640
there have been some absurd rumors

349
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,440
in the city lately.

350
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,400
Some say Ji Yingying is a spring silkworm turned spirit,

351
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,680
or even the reincarnation of Leizu.

352
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,160
They claim you were moved by a divine vision

353
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,240
to bring her into your residence for worship.

354
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,760
Others say...

355
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,920
She is

356
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,160
the reincarnation of your mother.

357
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,840
I have sent men to investigate these claims.

358
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,160
But

359
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,320
all we found was a drunkard spreading the rumors.

360
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
So,

361
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,240
not one of these rumors

362
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,160
suggests a romantic connection

363
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,600
between her and me?

364
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,640
None at all.

365
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,160
Let's do this.

366
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,600
Send someone

367
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,960
to that drunkard's usual spot

368
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,040
and plant a new rumor for me.

369
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,440
Your Highness,

370
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
the King and Du Yan

371
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,720
already know

372
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,400
Ji Yingying is your weakness.

373
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
It is only a matter of time

374
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,240
before they use her against you.

375
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
Doesn't having a weakness

376

377
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,360
Your Highness,

378
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,640
if it is all a calculated act,

379
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000
then it is indeed advantageous.

380
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,640
But I fear that

381
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,320
when the critical moment comes,

382
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,480
and if you truly fall for her,

383
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,800
it is you who will be hurt the most.

384
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,520
Is there anything I truly feel happy about

385
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,760
that is not for fame or fortune?

386
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,080
Someone I would risk everything to see,

387
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,320
or something I would do

388
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,360
without caring about the outcome?

389
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,280
How many years have I been planning

390
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,080
for Shu brocade?

391
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,760
If you count from when you first asked my father

392
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,920
to purchase brocade from Yizhou,

393
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
it has been at least ten years.

394
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,680
I have waited ten years for brocade.

395
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,080
Why not wait even longer

396
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,880
for someone?

397
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,240
Illusions

398
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,560
will eventually turn into a long-lasting reality.

399
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,600
But the King has only given her a year.

400
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,720
If the brocade cannot be completed...

401
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,800
I believe she will weave it.

402
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,600
If she does not,

403
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,280
I will find another way

404
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,760
to keep her here.

405
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,200
It is because

406
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,560
she and I are the same.

407
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,480
We are people who,

408
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,080

Just rest well.

413
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,640
I had these books and a desk

414
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,840
brought over.

415
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,000
When you have time,

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,560
you can look through them.

If you want anything to eat,

419
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,120
just let them know.

420
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,600
Stop looking around. I have my own chambers.

421
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,000
I will not be staying here.

Wait a moment!

00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,160
Can you do me a favor and deliver something

to Mu Lan?

427
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,760
Tell her it is to thank her for helping to detoxify me.

428
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
I imagine

429
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,560
the leaf should look more like this.

430
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,160

Your Highness,

436
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,400
this is a gift from Ms. Mu.

437
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,240
Leave it here.

438
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,280
It is quite similar.

439
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,040
It does not look like it was chewed by silkworms.

440
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,680

Nanzhao does not have Huanhua Creek,

but its dyeing techniques

444
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,800
have its own unique characteristics and color-fixing methods.

445
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,920
I think we could incorporate some of these methods

446
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,200
into Shu brocade techniques.

447
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,440

As work partners, yes.

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,520
If from the start,

489
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,480
you and I had been discussing business as equals,

490
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,800
if our visit to Nanzhao

491
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,800
had been an invitation to weave brocade,

492
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,840
perhaps things could have been different.

493
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,720
Perhaps we could have been friends.

494

But you chose a different path.

495

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,240
I will return the favor

to a celestial silkworm spirit,

510
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,520
and now,

511
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,040

512
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,680
But there are no longer

The earlier rumors

515

were part of Du Yan and Niu Jin's schemes.

But these later ones

517
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,400

That is why

519
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,040
I have spread a rumor of my own.

520
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,640
It goes like this.

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,560
Ji Yingying, a craftswoman from Yizhou,

522
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,280
accompanied me up the mountain,

523
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,720
where we were ambushed.

524
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,280
Her fate remains uncertain.

525
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,040
A rumor so full of holes

526
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,760
could only

527
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,400
make people laugh.

528
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,400
It is impossible to take seriously.

529
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,240
True.

For those who are indifferent,

531
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,880
it is just a joke.

532
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,560
But

533
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,240
for those with feelings and loyalty,

534
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,120
it is a different matter altogether.

535
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,560
After all, for someone who truly loves another,

536
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,440
even the smallest risk to their beloved's life

537
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,040
cannot be ignored.

538
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,120
No matter how slim the chance,

539
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,960
they will investigate.

540
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,200

541
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,640
It is you!

542
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,440

544
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,440
You were too naive!

545
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,080
His Highness has already set a trap.

546
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,080
There is no escape for you now.

00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,040
are you all right?

551
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,520
The rumors were false.

552
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,520
Mr. Yang, after arriving in Nanzhao,

553
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,040
you should have visited my residence openly.

554
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,040
I could have hosted you properly.

Your Highness, your hospitality

556
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,080
leaves much to be desired.

557
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,630
Who asked you to break the guest code first?

558
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,080

559
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
let him go!

560
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,320
Yingying, do not be afraid.

561
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
He will not dare kill me.

562
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,000
Given your connections to the crown prince,

563
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,520
I did tread carefully around you

564
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,520
in Yizhou.

565
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,080
But now,

566
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,000
you are in Nanzhao

567
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,840
and trespassing my residence at night.

568
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,280
If I were to kill you,

569
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,600
it would be entirely justified.

570
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,800
Your Highness, this trap is not particularly clever.

571
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
It is simply a gamble on my feelings.

572
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,680
You knew it was a trap, yet you came anyway?

573
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,040
I could not risk the slightest chance of something happening to you.

574
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,400
Sheng Fengze,

575
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,480
if I dared to infiltrate your residence at night,

576
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,880
how do you know

577
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,840
I came unprepared?

578
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,760
Did you think I did not know

579
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,320
about your collaboration with Du Yan?

580
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,040
But have you ever considered this?

581
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,400
While Ji Yingying is here with me,

582
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,600
her life is, at least, not in danger.

583
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,920
If she goes to the weaving workshop,

584
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,200
do you know

585
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,080
what she will face there?

586
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,920
You and Du Yan are cut from the same cloth!

587
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,440
Sheng Fengze,

588
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,040
if you kill me today,

589
00:35:59,040 --> 00:35:59,880
you will not only bear

590
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,920
the crime of murdering the military commissioner of Yizhou,

591
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,000
but also add the charge

592
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,320
of killing a subordinate of the crown prince.

593
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,680
I am sure

594
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,520
Qingping Officer would love such an opportunity

595
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
to root out all threats.

596
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,200
You are betting that I do not dare to kill you.

597
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,200
Do you dare?

598
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,600
If you kill him,

599
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,440
then kill me as well.

600
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,960
I am gambling on your feelings for him,

601
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,160
and you are gambling on mine for you.

602
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,840
Fine.

603
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,160
If you both love gambling so much,

604
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,760
I will indulge you today.

605
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,960
Let's have a proper wager.

606
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,880
I am no good at chess.

607
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,480
This is not fair.

608
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,480
To Mr. Yang,

609
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,240
these sacrificial soldiers

610
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,200
are not exactly skilled in combat.

611
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,040
Ms. Ji, if you do not wish to gamble,

612
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,720
I can always give the order

613
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,040
to unleash the volley of arrows.

614
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,080
I will ensure he dies here.

615
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
How do you want to gamble?

616
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,360
I will assign 12 sacrificial soldiers

617
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,400
to spar with Mr. Yang.

618
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,240
For every piece you win on the board,

619
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,240
I will withdraw one soldier.

620
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,280
But for every piece I win,

621
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,280
I will add one more.

622
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,240
The game continues until a victor is decided.

623
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,400
If I kill them all,

624
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,040
does that count as our win?

625
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,040
That depends on your ability.

626
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,040
Ms. Ji,

627
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,560
let's start.

628
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,360
Yingying,

629
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,160
do not worry.

630
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,640
These men cannot harm me.

631
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,400
Sheng Fengze!

632
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,680
I have already said,

633
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,480
twelve men

634
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,600
is my limit.

635
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:24,960
Shall we begin?

636
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,600
I advise you

637
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,080
to focus, Ms. Ji.

638
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,520
Mr. Yang's life

639
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,040
rests in your hands.

640
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,200
This game leaves no path to survival!

641
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,120
Sheng Fengze,

642
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,600
stop it!

643
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,200
If you kill him,

644
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,800
I will join him in death.

645
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,400
