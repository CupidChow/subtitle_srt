[Brocade Odyssey]

2
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,950
What a so-called "righteous official" serving the people!

4
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,230
Oppressing the people in broad daylight,

5
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,270
ignoring their grievances.

6
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,800
Today it's the Ji family,

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,630
who knows whose misfortune it will be tomorrow.

8
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,270
Ji Yaoting sought justice for his mother.

9
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,550
That's reasonable and justified,

10
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,800
yet he suffered punishment.

11
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,080
If one day we are wronged,

12
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,270
won't we follow in the Ji family's footsteps,

13
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,080
with no place to appeal our grievances?

14
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,720
Exactly!

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,190
Indeed!

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,910
Right!

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,360
Who is it?

18
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,230
It's me!

19
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,800
Make way!

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,040
Yaoting!

21
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,190
Yaoting!

22
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,830
You all...

23
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,360
Yaoting!

24
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,720
You...

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,080
I have arranged for storytellers to spread the word in town.

26
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,470
Starting today,

27
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,750
everyone will know what happened to our Ji family.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,960
Let's see if the governor has the ability

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,600
to silence everyone!

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
No need to go through such trouble!

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,160
Do you think this Imperial Uncle is just for show?

32
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,240
I'll write a direct petition

33
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,470
to the emperor.

34
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,110
Let's see if the governor

35
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,600
can silence even the emperor!

36
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,000
No justice for grievances! The governor is unjust!

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,550
No justice for grievances! The governor is unjust!

38
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,750
Stop shouting!

39
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,960
Close your mouths!

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,000
Close your mouth first.

41
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,000
A bunch of fools!

42
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,600
Who ordered you to use excessive force?

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,110
Didn't I tell you to give

44
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,390
a minor punishment as a warning?

45
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,750
Yaoting...

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,880
Ji Yaoting,

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,240
you stormed into the bureau

48
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,630
and caused a scene,

49
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,270
leaving me no choice but to punish you!

50
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,800
However, considering your dedication

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
to seeking justice for your mother,

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
and your sincerity,

53
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,000
regardless of the case's truth,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,390
your filial piety is commendable.

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,520
I am not someone

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,240
who disregards humanity for the sake of law.

57
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,390
Since your mother is ill,

58
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,190
I will make an exception,

59
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,030
allowing you to deliver medicine to her in prison once.

60
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
As for the case,

61
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,670
once your mother recovers,

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,800
I will do my utmost

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,750
to bring it to trial promptly.

64
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,670
Thank you, Governor.

65
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,190
Governor, you're wise!

66
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,080
Indeed, wise, my lord.

67
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,880
What a disgrace!

68
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,830
Yaoting...

69
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,830
Folks, disperse now!

70
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,520
Yaoting...

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,440
Let's go back!

72
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm fine.

73
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,240
Yaoting...

74
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,630
I'm fine.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,160
Yaoting, didn't you say

76
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,750
a gentleman avoids dangerous situations?

77
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,270
But with our family in crisis,

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
someone has to step up.

79
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,640
Yingying...

80
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,390
Yaoting...

81
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm fine.

82
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,550
Go quickly and check on Mother.

83
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
See how she's doing.

84
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,230
Hurry.

85
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,480
Go on!

86
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,070
Just go.

87
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,760
We've got things covered here.

88
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,270
Greetings, Warden Wang.

89
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,070
Open the door.

90
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,790
Mother!

92
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,480
Mother!

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,670
Warden Wang,

94
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,200
my mother is gravely ill.

95
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,270
I brought medicine.

96
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,440
Could you help us prepare it?

97
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,670
That's not allowed.

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,440
Just this once.

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,480
Thank you.

100
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,270
Go in.

101
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,270
Mother!

102
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,000
Mother!

103
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,000
Mother!

104
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,040
Mother!

105
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,760
Yingying...

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,830
Mother.

107
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,640
- Yingying! - Mother!

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,790
- Mother. - Yingying.

109
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,720
Why are you here?

110
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,200
Mother,

111
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,600
I came late.

112
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,790
No,

113
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,600
Yingying.

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
I'm fine.

115
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,040
I'm fine.

116
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,000
You're this ill,

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,550
and you say you're fine?

118
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,200
It's nothing.

119
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,480
Don't cry, Yingying.

120
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,200
Yingying,

121
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,880
I didn't kill anyone.

122
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,670
How could I harm

123
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,950
my own sister?

124
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,270
I didn't kill anyone.

125
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,510
I know.

126
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
There must be some mistake.

127
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,350
Don't worry, Mother.

128
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,160
I've uncovered some clues,

129
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,000
and I'll get you out of here.

130
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,480
Yingying,

131
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,000
I've been thinking

132
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,040
about that day

133
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,600
these past few days.

134
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,040
But

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,550
I just can't make sense of it.

136
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,830
I'll tell you now.

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,440
Help me think it through.

138
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,880
That day,

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,200
I went to pay off your uncle's debt.

140
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,720
Then...

141
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,270
Are you okay?

142
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,600
Here,

143
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,200
take a seat.

144
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,550
Slowly.

145
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,760
But I never imagined

146
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,920
that when I woke up,

147
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,640
I'd be holding my own hairpin

148
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,830
covered in blood.

149
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,270
It was all blood.

150
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,320
Mother,

151
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,070
I already know.

152
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,950
Leave the rest to us.

153
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,670
The most important thing now

154
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,760
is to take care of yourself.

155
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,550
It's fine.

156
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,670
By the way,

157
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,670
how is everything at home?

158
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,950
How's Yaoting?

159
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Everything at home is fine.

160
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,320
The Governor only allowed one visitor.

161
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,070
Yaoting and Gui are waiting for you at home.

162
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,880
We'll definitely get you out of here.

163
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,070
Then our family will reunite.

164
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,440
I believe in you.

165
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,830
I believe in you.

166
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,350
Here, let me put some medicine on it.

167
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,440
I'll do it myself.

168
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,880
That day, I never said

169
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,030
I wouldn't be friends with you anymore.

170
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,080
I don't mind at all.

171
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,110
Why are you so stubborn?

172
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,000
Give me your hand.

173
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Don't move.

174
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,110
If you don't treat your hands properly, they'll be ruined.

175
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,670
Say something if it hurts.

176
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,880
It hurts.

177
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,910
Why did you go there?

178
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,520
If your hands are ruined,

179
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,280
you won't be able to weave brocade again in this lifetime.

180
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,080
You'll never be able

181
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,640
to do what you love most.

182
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,640
Switch hands.

183
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,910
The Ji family's rule is

184
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,440
the brocade comes first,

185
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,030
but people are above brocade.

186
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,910
Compared to human life,

187
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,880
no matter how precious the brocade, it's insignificant.

188
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,670
As long as I can protect the people I care about,

189
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,760
even if my hands are ruined,

190
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,550
I won't regret it.

191
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,110
Your family's rule

192
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,080
is quite different from his.

193
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,760
Whose family?

194
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,960
If you're ever in trouble,

195
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,440
I'd do the same for you,

196
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,350
without regret!

197
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:58,880
I...

198
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,550
I didn't mean to curse you with trouble.

199
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,320
Apply medicine once a day.

200
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,880
Avoid water for three days.

201
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,880
Did you hear me?

202
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,670
Yes.

203
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:20,910
Thank you.

204
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,230
Even though you were reckless today,

205
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,030
you're a man

206
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,110
with courage and responsibility.

207
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,790
[Tangchang County Magistrate]

208
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,320
Yingying,

209
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,470
how is Mrs. Ji's illness?

210
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,840
Those few doses of medicine won't cure her.

211
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,760
Conditions inside are terrible,

212
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,470
and she's anxious and unsettled.

213
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,030
How could she recover like this?

214
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,150
This can't be delayed any longer.

215
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,640
We must get her out quickly.

216
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,550
Otherwise...

217
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,080
Bloom Society can help with business matters,

218
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,280
but as for rescuing Mrs. Ji,

219
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,320
I'm your only option.

220
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,910
Only I can help you.

221
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,080
I have only one condition:

222
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,150
as long as you promise me

223
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,080
you'll stay by my side forever.

224
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,350
If you agree,

225
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,350
I'll get Mrs. Ji out today

226
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,150
and treat her illness.

227
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,350
My mother didn't kill anyone.

228
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,520
I just need to find the real culprit,

229
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,080
and she'll be freed from prison.

230
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,030
I can wait until you find the real culprit,

231
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,760
but can Mrs. Ji's health

232
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,840
wait for you?

233
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,110
I really can help you.

234
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,670
You're Niu Jin's favored son-in-law.

235
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,840
Niu Jin and I are sworn enemies.

236
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,760
Using his influence to help me,

237
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,440
don't you find that laughable?

238
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,110
I found it laughable once too.

239
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,520
But now,

240
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,960
you are just like I was back then.

241
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,880
In the face of power,

242
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,520
neither of us has another choice.

243
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,960
Now do you understand me?

244
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,080
I don't understand.

245
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,000
But if you want to be my friend,

246
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,880
there's only one condition:

247
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,710
be sincere.

248
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,350
You're not someone

249
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,080
who'd make a friend willing to die for you.

250
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,150
Sir.

251
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,080
Sir.

252
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,000
Niu Jin sent a message.

253
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,760
He wants to meet you outside the city.

254
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,520
Understood.

255
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,000
Leave now.

256
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:06,880
Yes, sir.

257
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
You and I were never on the same side.

258
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,670
Naturally, we can't be sincere to each other.

259
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,840
Sit.

260
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,350
Gao,

261
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,030
did you see Prince Bai last night?

262
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,080
I was just pretending to be an assassin,

263
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,960
not a real one.

264
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,000
Why would I meet him?

265
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,110
What's wrong?

266
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Is something off?

267
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,470
I heard that Ning Dai

268
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,080
is deeply devoted to Prince Bai.

269
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,280
When an assassin broke into the residence,

270
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,470
she didn't protect the prince but came after me.

271
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,960
That either means

272
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,200
her feelings for the prince are fake,

273
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:03,960
or...

274
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,350
Prince Bai himself is an imposter.

275
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,520
Last night at Prince Bai's residence,

276
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,110
I saw the newly developed Rippling Grain Brocade.

277
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,520
Now the one secretly putting a bounty on my head

278
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,760
knows my name is Yang Jinglan

279
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,080
and even recognizes my appearance.

280
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,710
Don't you find that strange?

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,790
And also,

282
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,640
Ning Dai

283
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,080
identified me as Yang Jinglan just by my voice.

284
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,400
That means she's been to Yizhou.

285
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,230
So I suspect

286
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,880
the real Prince Bai is now in Yizhou.

287
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,760
In the 13th year of Yuanhe,

288
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:05,280
I gifted Prince Bai of Nanzhao a brocade.

289
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,080
Alright.

290
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,000
Give me a moment to think.

291
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,880
It features Jingyanggong patterns,

292
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,150
floral trees paired with deer motifs.

293
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,110
That was the Yang family's new brocade.

294
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,080
However, you didn't gift

295
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,960
just one piece

296
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,350
but an entire chest.

297
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,910
In the 3rd year of Yuanhe...

298
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,710
You gifted the Four Heavenly Kings Hunting Lions Brocade.

299
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,400
Back then, I was still young.

300
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,280
You were doing business with my master.

301
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,910
I remember it was the 10th year of Yuanhe

302
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,350
when I took over.

303
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,320
Greetings, Prince Bai.

304
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,280
General, please.

305
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,350
I'm in a risky position right now

306
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,110
and must act with caution.

307
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,710
I hope Your Majesty understand.

308
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,320
Such prudence

309
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,910
is what pleases me.

310
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,150
It was my oversight,

311
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,910
or how could I trouble Your Majesty

312
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,400
to come to Yizhou personally to collect brocade?

313
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,520
But, for future transactions...

314
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,150
Even the finest brocade cannot surpass tribute brocade.

315
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,710
Once the storm has passed,

316
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,320
I shall celebrate with you, General.

317
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,670
This visit

318
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,710
is to discuss our collaboration.

319
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,000
If we can open trade routes in the future,

320
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,110
then the transactions between us

321
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,590
will naturally proceed smoothly.

322
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,200
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

323
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,880
As for the escort,

324
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,320
I will take full responsibility.

325
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,080
But I've also heard

326
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,880
Your Majesty have taken an interest

327
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,320
in Ji Yingying.

328
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,080
You risked your life to save her from a fire.

329
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,000
If Your Majesty truly fancy her,

330
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,760
I could have my foolish son-in-law let her go.

331
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,710
Ji Yingying...

332
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,680
Currently, she's the only one

333
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,800
capable of dyeing Shu Red Silk.

334
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,310
If she were to die so easily,

335
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,470
wouldn't that be a pity?

336
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,560
I believe that's why

337
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,520
you haven't rushed to eliminate her.

338
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,310
By the way,

339
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,310
there's one more thing to inform you.

340
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,950
An assassin from the Tang Empire

341
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,950
is relentlessly pursuing the smuggled tribute brocade.

342
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,110
He even went to Nanzhao

343
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,190
and made a scene in my Brocade Vault.

344
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,950
In your opinion,

345
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,070
who could this person be?

346
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,280
It's Yang Jinglan.

347
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,400
On the surface, he returns to Chang'an to report,

348
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,880
but in reality, he advances secretly.

349
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,350
All right.

350
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,160
Since he went to Nanzhao,

351
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,710
he should never return.

352
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,000
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

353
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,160
I'll make arrangements immediately.

354
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,520
All you need to do now

355
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,310
is

356
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,560
guard the official road from Yizhou to Nanzhao.

357
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,310
On the Nanzhao side, I've set up an inescapable trap.

358
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,520
If he dares to show up,

359
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,400
he won't escape.

360
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,230
Here.

361
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,190
Zhuge had someone

362
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,110
deliver it from Yizhou City.

363
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,310
Yizhou hasn't really encountered trouble, has it?

364
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,100
[Ms. Ji's in trouble, return quickly]

365
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,040
No,

366
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
I must return to Yizhou.

367
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,470
Gao,

368
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,230
find someone

369
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,710
to draw a portrait of Prince Bai.

370
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,400
I want to know

371
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,590
if he's the person I think he is.

372
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,590
I'm heading back now.

373
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,310
Out there, both openly and in secret,

374
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,710
it's full of people sent by Prince Bai to kill you.

375
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,070
Are you sure you want to return now?

376
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,190
I promised her

377
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
I would stand by her side.

378
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,190
No matter the dangers,

379
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,590
I have to go back.

380
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,950
I'm leaving now.

381
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,970
[Yang Residence]

382
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,190
What brings you here?

383
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,280
Please inform Mrs. Yang

384
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,160
that Ji Yingying from Bloom Society seeks an audience.

385
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,560
Miss, please wait here.

386
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,800
Greetings, Mrs. Yang.

387
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,110
Ms. Ji,

388
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,000
what brings you here today?

389
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,880
I've come today

390
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
to propose a business deal with you.

391
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,190
I've heard about the Ji family's misfortune.

392
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,350
What kind of business deal

393
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,310
do you have in mind?

394
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,110
I want to discuss a deal

395
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,920
regarding the Rippling Grain Brocade.

396
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,310
What do you propose?

397
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,160
I wonder if you've heard

398
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,760
that I've taken an order

399
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,110
for 30 bolts of Ripple Brocade with dragon and beast patterns

400
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,560
at 30% above the market price.

401
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
I have to complete them within five months.

402
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:28,160
But now my family's workshop has burned down,

403
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,470
and all the raw silk is destroyed.

404
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,470
What do you mean, Ms. Ji?

405
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,070
I recall that at the auction,

406
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,950
you seemed very interested in the Ripple Brocade.

407
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,760
Are you planning to sell the Ripple Brocade design

408
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,310
to my family?

409
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,400
The Ripple Brocade was co-developed by me and Mr. Yu.

410
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,110
I have no right to sell it.

411
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,000
However, if you are willing

412
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,760
to help me in this critical moment,

413
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,920
in addition to sharing the profits

414
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,110
from this order,

415
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,640
I am also willing

416
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,070
to collaborate with your family on new brocade designs.

417
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,280
I trust your talent,

418
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,520
but the future

419
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,470
is always uncertain.

420
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,000
True. So, I've brought

421
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,950
something else as well today.

422
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,590
I'm willing to teach the Yang family

423
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,310
all the methods for dyeing Shu Red Silk.

424
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,040
For you

425
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,760
to take such a drastic step,

426
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,040
it must not

427
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,920
just be about the order.

428
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,680
Indeed.

429
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,310
I've also come

430
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,520
for the sake of my mother today.

431
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,760
Everyone knows

432
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,400
that your elder brother

433
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
was adopted by his uncle

434
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,590
and now works in Chang'an.

435
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you could ask him for help,

436
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,000
he could certainly save my mother.

437
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,520
Ms. Ji,

438
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,000
you and I both know

439
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
who you've offended.

440
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,400
If I help you,

441
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,710
then my Yang family

442
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,710
will surely be pushed into the spotlight.

443
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,110
While Shu Red Silk is valuable,

444
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,520
this deal carries

445
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,520
a significant risk.

446
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:57,190
If Shu Red Silk isn't enough,

447
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,280
I also have Flushed Rose.

448
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,000
In the future, I'll create even more new colors.

449
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,800
If you feel

450
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,110
the deal lacks weight,

451
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,880
I can

452
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,760
continue adding more chips

453
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,520
until you're satisfied.

454
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,160
Relying on the Yang family's influence

455
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,920
might protect you for now,

456
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,110
but it won't shield you forever.

457
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,920
It may offer short-term safety,

458
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,160
but not lifelong security.

459
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,710
Unless...

460
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,160
you find yourself

461
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,110
a lasting support.

462
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,950
Are you suggesting...

463
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,920
For the Yang family

464
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,710
to take on the Ji family's burden legitimately

465
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,110
and for you to have no worries in the future,

466
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,350
there's only one solution.

467
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,520
What solution?

468
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,350
I propose that my second son, Yang Jinglin,

469
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,800
marry you.

470
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,880
As the head lady of the Yang family,

471
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,190
I dare say

472
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,950
our Yang family

473
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,710
has the courage to take this gamble.

474
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,470
Naturally, I hope you will agree.

475
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,590
But as a woman,

476
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,470
I must advise you to think carefully.

477
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,520
After all, marriage

478
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,880
concerns a woman's entire life.

479
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,800
Right now, the most urgent matter

480
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,520
for you

481
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,520
is not business,

482
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,280
but

483
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,710
your mother.

484
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,350
I can wait for you to find the true culprit,

485
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,110
but can Mrs. Ji's health

486
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,110
wait for you?

487
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,920
What I want is...

488
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,590
you.

489
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,310
As long as you agree

490
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,310
to stay by my side forever...

491
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,470
I agree.

492
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,470
Are you certain?

493
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,110
To be honest,

494
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,470
your family wasn't my first choice.

495
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
The others

496
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,760
either required me to fake civility

497
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,160
to mend broken ties,

498
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,520
or forced me to leave my hometown

499
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,760
and sell myself into servanthood.

500
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,350
By comparison,

501
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,310
the Yang family can save my mother

502
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,400
and let me stay in Yizhou.

503
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,190
This is already the best option.

504
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,800
These days,

505
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,520
my friends have been working tirelessly

506
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,520
to help me repay debts.

507
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,470
My brother, seeking justice,

508
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,950
has endured great suffering

509
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,560
without fearing authority.

510
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,280
All I have to do is marry someone,

511
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,520
and it's to a family like yours.

512
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,110
What grievance is there in that?

513
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:00,590
Good.

514
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,880
Good.

515
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,920
Rest assured.

516
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,470
Once you marry into the Yang family,

517
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,880
you'll be a proper daughter-in-law.

518
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,070
The Yang family will not mistreat you.

519
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,400
As for your wedding,

520
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,680
I'll ensure it's lively and grand,

521
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,160
worthy of the Ji family's honor.

522
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,760
But my mother is still in prison,

523
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,160
gravely ill.

524
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,680
I fear she can't hold on much longer.

525
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,520
Please set the wedding date quickly

526
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,310
without complications.

527
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,110
Your filial piety

528
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,110
is something I cannot refuse.

529
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,680
I'll send someone to make the necessary arrangements

530
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,710
to get Mrs. Ji out of prison as soon as possible.

531
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,000
As for Mr. Qian's matter,

532
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:49,590
the Yang family will provide the silk and dyes,

533
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,160
ensuring the new brocade is completed on time.

534
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,040
Thank you.

535
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,920
The Yang family is truly shameless!

536
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,640
Yu!

537
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:08,760
Yu!

538
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,470
This is already the best choice.

539
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,560
They've gone too far!

540
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,070
For the Yang family, it's always just about business.

541
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,190
Yu!

542
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,950
Ms. Yu.

543
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,680
Ms. Yu!

544
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,110
Stay here and keep watch.

545
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,350
I'll go inform Mr. Yang Jingshan.

546
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,520
Yuniang,

547
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,430
the Yang family has never been just mine alone.

548
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,830
If my mother agrees to this,

549
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,800
it surely aligns

550
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,880
with the wishes of the family elders.

551
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,190
No matter what,

552
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,040
I cannot change this.

553
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,520
The family elders?

554
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,710
With Yingying's personality, marrying into your family

555
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,310
and following your rules

556
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
would be no different from imprisonment.

557
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,310
The Yang family chose Ms. Ji

558
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,710
for her abilities.

559
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,920
She isn't marrying in to be a housewife.

560
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,760
My mother will have her help

561
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,800
manage the family business together.

562
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,350
So, this marriage contract is nothing but a bondage agreement,

563
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,560
buying Yingying's entire life

564
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,350
to work in your Yang family?

565
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,470
I know

566
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,710
Ms. Ji is your best friend.

567
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,710
But things have come to this,

568
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,710

Protect her?

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,280
You can protect her?

573
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:13,920
You can't protect anyone.

574
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,880
It was true eight years ago,

575
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,280
and it's true now!

576
