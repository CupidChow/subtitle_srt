[Episode 10]

3
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,830
Yu Yuan,

4
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,230
let her enter.

5
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,480
It seems that I underestimated your capabilities, Ms. Ji.

6
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,080
Ever since I was cornered by Mrs. Hua at Lei Zu Festival,

7
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,270
I have learned to prepare for the unexpected.

8
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,080
I now make two plans for every critical matter.

9
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,480
Preparedness ensures no regrets.

10
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,550
You used your authority to pressure others

11
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,040
and have Chief Sang work for you.

12
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,360
Naturally, I used greater influence

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,270
to suppress Chief Sang's actions.

14
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,030
Last time, it was Sang Shisi.

15
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,750
This time, it's the Emperor himself.

16
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,520
Ms. Ji,

17
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,880
you are using influence to suppress others

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,160
and leveraging power against power.

19
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:17,720
Is that not

20
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,960
what I have also done?

21
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,190
Not exactly.

22
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,880
I never had the intent to harm others.

23
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,160
A good person refraining from evil deeds

24
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,240
is not necessarily kind.

25
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,270
Sometimes, it is merely because they lack the ability.

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,270
Even without the flower cookies,

27
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,110
I still managed to produce Flushed Rose.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Do you want to know why?

29
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,880
Yaoting, Mother,

30
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,960
remember to stock up on flower cookies and other ingredients.

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,720
Flushed Rose requires a large amount of them.

32
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,550
The letter you sent to your family?

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,750
Were you already planning to trap me?

34
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,440
At first, I just wanted to try.

35
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,550
Who would have thought that you would take the bait

36
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,470
and buy all the flower cookies on the market?

37
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,630
Replacing flower cookies with madder

38
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,750
was a technique I developed long ago while researching Flushed Rose.

39
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,880
So what if

40
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,080
you tricked me?

41
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,720
All the flower cookies were bought up,

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,080
but no one knows

43
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,470
that it was done by the Niu family.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,030
As for the money spent,

45
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,960
it was hardly worth mentioning.

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,830
But you lost.

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,110
Ms. Niu, I do not think that you have ever experienced

48
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,830
the taste of defeat, have you?

49
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,630
Lost?

50
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,880
Ms. Ji, you overestimate yourself.

51
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,520
If you are careless,

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,110
the registration document and flower cookies

53
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:53,550
could suppress you completely.

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,320
But to me,

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,030
it was nothing more than a minor effort.

56
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,270
Besides,

57
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,440

[The bride, Niu Wuniang. The groom, Zhao Xiuyuan]

Ms. Niu, you certainly know how to put on a show.

62
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,000
Do you think that I would believe this?

63
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,480
If you do not believe it,

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,670
why do you look so pale, Ms. Ji?

65
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,390
Why not ask Mr. Zhao yourself?

66

70
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,200
that you are getting married.

71
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,600
I want to hear it from you.

72
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,320
Is that true

73

The wedding is set for the end of the month.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,790
Why?

76
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,000
Niu Wuniang fell in love with me at first sight.

77
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,880
When my grandfather found out,

78
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
he proposed the match to the Niu family.

79
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,600
That is not what I want to hear.

80
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,640
I want to hear your reason.

81
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,550

82
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,000

84
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,880
I will not show mercy.

That day, I went to see you

87
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,790

88
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,880

94

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,230
I have been waiting to punch him for ages!

190
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,230
Let's go!

191
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:45,760
Sure!

192
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,200
Do not be impulsive!

193
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,280
If this could have made Yingying happy,

194
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,590
I would have burned down the Zhao residence a long time ago.

195
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,080
But doing that

196
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,550
will only make her more upset.

197
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,080
I cannot drink anymore.

198
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,200
Continue if you wish. I am done.

199
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,080

200
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:04,840
I...

201
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,590
What are you doing?

202
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,550
Yingying!

203
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,110
Look at how you plate this dish.

204
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,000
We have been looking for you.

205
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,030
The dishes are incomplete.

The moon... It is beautiful tonight.

207
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,150
Have a seat.

208
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,440
Why have you not started eating?

209
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,590
Did we not agree that you would begin?

210
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,280
Is it because the food is not good?

211
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,960
Or is it that our wine is not up to your standards?

212
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,350
No...!

213
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,230
It is all perfect!

214
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,030
So many delicious dishes!

215
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,960
Come, come! The wine is here!

216

Ting, hurry up and pour some for everyone!

217

Tonight's gathering

225
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,790
is a celebration.

226
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,230
Nothing else matters.

227
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,880
Do not worry.

228
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,880
I am fine. You do not have to worry.

229
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,200
However, I have kept you all waiting today.

230
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,550
So, I will start by drinking three bowls.

231

This is the first bowl.

What a good wine, Mother!

233
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,400
This is the second bowl.

234
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,470
That is enough, Yingying.

235
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,150
Enough.

236
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,150
Next, I offer three toasts.

237
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,280
The first

238
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,790
is for Mother and Yaoting.

239
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,320
Thank you

240
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,030
for your unwavering support and care.

241
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,640
I know I have made you worry.

242
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,000
The second

243
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,670
is for Bloom Society!

244
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:55,350
Here!

245
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,640
Without the trust and protection

246
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,150
from all of you,

247
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,000
we would not have achieved success today.

Here is to everyone!

249
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,110
Do not say that.

250
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,230
Without you, we would not be here today.

251
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:11,910
Am I right?

252
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,960
That is right!

253
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,030
My butt has been through hell,

254
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,670
but

255
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
what happened was truly exciting.

256
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
That is a story that I will be telling for the rest of my life!

257
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,590
I did not know that was something to brag about.

258
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Telling others about his butt going through hell.

259
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
We will do the same.

Come on. Let us drink.

261
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,470
That is enough, Yingying.

262
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,320
You need to slow down.

263
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Just one more.

This is your chance to make your move.

379

You have never fallen for someone, have you?

380
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,070
It's none of your business.

381
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,920
If you truly love someone,

382
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,680
you will share in their feelings,

385

386

387
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,680
that will not be something you will need to worry about.

388
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,280
You are not wrong.

389

I am sure that she will be fine

394

in less than three days.

395
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
She is just pretending to be strong.

396

[From Classic of Poetry, Odes of Wang,Sorrow]
Those who understand her

399
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,350
know that she is troubled, but others might just wonder what she is thinking of.

400
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,560
Mr. Yang,

401
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,880
after keeping an eye on the Niu residence for a few days,

402
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,160
our men finally saw someone go up the mountain

403
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,280
to a secret cave in the dense forest.

404
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,680
We can see signs of lit candles there.

405
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,830
Finally, there is something.

406
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,230
Maybe there are lookout guards stationed there,

407
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,310
just like last time.

408
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,430
Lookout guards?

409
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,680
There should not be lit candles then.

410
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,040
Who went up to the mountain?

411
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,400
It was Niu Wuniang's maid,

412
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,470
Yu Yuan.

413
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,430
That is unexpected.

414
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,350
Niu Wuniang once used this maid

415
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,520
to stage an act before me

416
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,310
to trap Chief Sang.

417
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,070
Normally, someone like her

418
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,560
would discard

419
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,070
such a pawn to avoid complications.

420
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,680
Yet, she still trusts Yu Yuan enough

421
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,640
to send her up the mountain.

422
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:36,760
That means that this maid must hold some special importance to her.

423
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:38,920
What is your plan?

424
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,280
Do you plan to make the maid talk?

425
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,280
If someone

426
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,830

427
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,680
and asked why I came here

428
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,470
or what my purpose was,

429
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,640
would you tell them?

430
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,310
I would not, of course.

431
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,470
But it is

432
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,160
for my master's sake,

434
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,880
It would be the same for her too.

435

Even my own relatives

458
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,640
could not have done what he did.

460

lets me be free,

461

and never pressures me to act like a proper lady.

462
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,190
