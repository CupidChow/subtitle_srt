[Brocade Odyssey]

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,710
[Episode 37]

3
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,500
Ms. Ji,

4
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,820
this will be your room in the workshop.

5
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:43,860
From now on,

6
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,820
if you need anything related to dyeing and weaving,

7
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,300
feel free to ask me anytime.

8
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,340
Yingying!

9
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,540
Yingying!

10
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,700
You're finally here!

11
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,420
It really is you!

12
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:14,740
Yingying,

13
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,980
how have you been?

14
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,620
Did Sheng Fengze ever harm you?

15
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,220
Shh.

16
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,900
Alright, you three chat.

17
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,020
I'll keep watch for you.

18
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,020
Sit down.

19
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,580
Have a seat.

20
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,620
I'll keep it brief.

21
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,900
Sometimes, you have to go along to get along.

22
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,460
But Yizhou is my home.

23
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,380
I will never betray my true self.

24
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,700
We all understand.

25
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,540
You only became the princess consort

26
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,220
and started weaving Nanzhao brocade

27
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,460
to save our lives.

28
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,820
We know

29
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,380
this is only a temporary measure.

30
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,820
You would never actually do it.

31
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,820
I will never become a princess consort.

32
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,180
But weaving Nanzhao brocade

33
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,220
is what I promised the king of Nanzhao,

34
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,660
a one-year term, no less.

35
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,580
But...

36
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,980
are we really going to weave for him?

37
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,420
The Nanzhao people kidnapped us,

38
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,340
treated us as prisoners, captives.

39
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,220
Should we just surrender to this fate

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,220
and work for them?

41
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,660
But what else can we do?

42
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,220
Not weaving will lead to our deaths.

43
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,300
Yingying,

44
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,860
this isn't like you.

45
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,620
Have you changed since coming to Nanzhao?

46
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,900
Did Sheng Fengze feed you some kind of mind poison?

47
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,180
We thought you came here with a plan

48
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,300
to lead us in rebellion,

49
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,060
not to make us into slaves.

50
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,460
Right now,

51
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,180
we're like lambs to the slaughter,

52
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,420
completely helpless.

53
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,020
Our only option is to gamble.

54
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,260
So,

55
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,220
I made a deal with the king of Nanzhao.

56
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,500
It's Liu.

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,380
Liu got beaten up!

58
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,380
Quick, let's go!

59
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,620
Useless fool!

60
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,410
Do you know how much these dyes are worth?

61
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,970
Delaying the brocade for Prince Bai, you deserve death!

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,780
Beat him!

63
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,380
Stop!

64
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:24,980
Stop it!

65
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,580
Stop! Get up!

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,020
What,

67
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,860
do you want to get beaten too?

68
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Let's discuss it!

69
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,420
Let's discuss it!

70
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,260
Stop!

71
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,060
Your King personally made a deal with me.

72
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,860
This is written in his own hand.

73
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,500
We weave brocade for him,

74
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,660
and he will send us home.

75
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,020
[Nanzhao brocade complete, craftsmen return]
We are craftsmen invited by Nanzhao,

76
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,020
not slaves!

77
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,260
Are you going to defy your king's orders?

78
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,620
Isn't she the future princess consort of Prince Bai?

79
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,580
Don't try to fool me.

80
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,180
I'm not easily scared.

81
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,620
If you don't believe it,

82
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,300
then call your king here.

83
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,620
Let him decide.

84
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,300
Who do you think you are?

85
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,700
Just a bunch of lowly captives!

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,260
Do you think you can just meet the king?

87
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,220
Try it.

88
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,620
If anything happens to us

89
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,620
and we can't weave brocade,

90
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,620
your head

91
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,700
might hang on the gate tomorrow!

92
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,660
You're truly the future princess consort of Prince Bai,

93
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,060
always thinking on his behalf.

94
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,860
If Prince Bai can't produce brocade in a year,

95
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,020
he'll be sent to Tang to face consequences!

96
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,260
If someone had any backbone,

97
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,780
they would simply refuse to work.

98
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,100
At that point, they'd die alongside the real culprit!

99
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,300
What are you doing?

100
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,100
No!

101
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,780
You're lucky this time.

102
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,300
Get out of the way!

103
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:09,900
Liu,

104
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,140
don't be scared.

105
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,020
It's alright now.

106
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,580
It's okay.

107
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,260
Ever since he witnessed the killing that day,

108
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,380
he's been terrified

109
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,300
by the sound of blades being drawn.

110
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,380
They keep using it to scare him.

111
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,060
Is that thing you showed earlier real?

112
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,100
Can we really go back?

113
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,500
That is indeed written by the king of Nanzhao himself.

114
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,220
Are you afraid Sheng Fengze will be executed for failing to produce brocade,

115
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,700
and you'll lose your chance to be a princess consort?

116
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,420
Shut up!

117
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,740
You...

118
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,020
Yingying is worried we'll get dragged into this.

119
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,060
Why are you saying this?

120
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,860
Watch your words!

121
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,060
Everyone can make their own choice,

122
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,100
but I just want to go back alive.

123
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,780
I want to see my mother and brother again.

124
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,180
Let's go.

125
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Let's help him back first.

126
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,340
Come on, Liu.

127
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,220
Ms. Ji,

128
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,380
the Qingping Officer's people

129
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,300
are not easy to deal with.

130
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,060
If I were you,

131
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,780
I'd stay away from them

132
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,580
and focus on weaving brocade.

133
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,220
It's precisely because I want to focus on brocade

134
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,460
that I can't just sit by.

135
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,900
Brocade comes first,

136
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,500
but people are above the brocade.

137
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,780
The first thing I care about

138
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,220
is people.

139
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,980
Let's go.

140
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,860
Alright, get some rest early.

141
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,620
Whatever it is, leave it for tomorrow.

142
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,460
What have you all been through these past few days?

143
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,660
Even if Chi Hu stayed,

144
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,060
he couldn't stop Du Yan from harassing you, right?

145
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,660
That head guard sent by the Qingping Officer

146
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,460
openly and secretly

147
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,260
humiliates and tortures everyone.

148
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
If it's not life-threatening or related to dyeing,

149
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,300
Chi Hu won't intervene.

150
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,060
So now,

151
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,260
everyone either ends up like San,

152
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,860
angry but helpless,

153
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,420
or like Liu, afraid or numb.

154
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,810
Why is it like this again?

155
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,820
It's the head guard's doing again, isn't it?

156
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,700
Who's there?

157
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,460
Are you awake?

158
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,820
It's me.

159
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,100
It's Shisi.

160
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,700
I'm Shisi.

161
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,620
Coming.

162
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,020
Here.

163
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,380
Why are you here?

164
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,420
Haven't you rested yet?

165
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,580
Well, San felt bad,

166
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,780
so he asked me to bring over two quilts.

167
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,100
Is it convenient?

168
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,220
Come in.

169
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,580
It seems this isn't the first time they've done this.

170
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,900
I need to think of a way to deal with him.

171
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,700
What?

172
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,220
Deal with him?

173
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,980
Alright, it's late.

174
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,940
Go back and rest.

175
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,380
I...

176
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,660
Thank you for the quilts.

177
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,700
Then, I'll head back first.

178
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,260
Do you have enough quilts on your side?

179
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,860
We do!

180
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,780
Did that look he gave you just now mean

181
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,020
he wants you to keep an eye on me?

182
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,380
Such growing understanding between you two.

183
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,460
These days,

184
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,020
he's helped me a lot.

185
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,220
Adversity reveals true feelings...

186
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,020
Adversity reveals true feelings.

187
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,700
Then, when the adversity is over,

188
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,420
will the feelings disappear?

189
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,620
No, they won't.

190
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,580
The moon is almost full.

191
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,620
It seems like Mid-Autumn Festival is near.

192
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,060
Mid-Autumn Festival...

193
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,180
Since we left Yizhou,

194
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,620
I've been pulling one silk thread from my clothes each day.

195
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,020
I tie every ten threads into a bundle.

196
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,220
It's been a month since we left.

197
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,220
Silk threads...

198
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,380
Apply this.

199
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,700
Look at me now,

200
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,180
can I still harm you?

201
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,900
You came from Yizhou?

202
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,220
How is my family?

203
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,220
Niu Jin is now in charge of Yizhou.

204
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,620
And then?

205
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,260
Niu Jin says

206
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,260
that your Zhao family colluded with Nanzhao,

207
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,060
leading Nanzhao troops into the city.

208
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,180
He acted first and reported later,

209
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,020
killing everyone in your Zhao family.

210
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
Not a single one was spared.

211
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,060
What did Yang Jinglan say to you?

212
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,420
He didn't say anything.

213
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,780
He still doesn't trust me enough.

214
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,540
But I think,

215
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,820
about why he came to Nanzhao

216
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,500
and who his informant is,

217
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,300
even if he won't tell me,

218
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,220
he'll surely tell Yingying.

219
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
What does he want to say to Ji Yingying?

220
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,220
"Stay safe.

221
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,820
Don't worry."

222
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,460
That's all?

223
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,860
That makes sense.

224
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,260
In such a short time,

225
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,220
he wouldn't easily trust you.

226
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,620
Indeed.

227
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,100
Your Highness,

228
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,580
let's take our time and plan this carefully.

229
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Wait a while,

230
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,220
and find another excuse

231
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,060
so I can meet him again.

232
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,620
We'll try once more.

233
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,140
By the way,

234
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
did he eat the food and water

235
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,820
sent in?

236
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,980
He must have noticed something was wrong.

237
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,420
He only eats the bare minimum

238
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,020
to stay alive.

239
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,100
And you? Did you eat it?

240
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,020
Since I've decided to work with you,

241
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,740
I will trust

242
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,940
that in the future,

243
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,460
you'll give me the antidote.

244
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,420
Actually, there's no such thing as an antidote.

245
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,180
The more you take this drug,

246
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,820
the more you desire it.

247
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,580
If you go even one day without it,

248
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,460
it'll feel like thousands of ants biting you.

249
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,820
You'll be in unbearable pain.

250
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,020
When the pain becomes too much to bear,

251
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,220
he'll surrender his dignity

252
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,620
and bow to me.

253
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,220
So, I...

254
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,620
Don't worry, Mr. Zhao.

255
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,300
From today on, you don't need to take it anymore.

256
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,380
It doesn't matter.

257
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,900
You and I are on the same side.

258
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,340
I won't harm you.

259
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

260
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,180
I have one more request.

261
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,620
Say it.

262
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,020
I beg you, Your Highness,

263
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
please be kind

264
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,900
to my family you saved.

265
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,900
Since I saved them,

266
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,010
of course, I will treat them well.

267
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,820
Thank you. I'm willing to serve you loyally!

268
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,420
What else do you want?

269
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,620
Tell me everything at once.

270
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,020
I have no other requests.

271
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,260
I just want to work loyally at your side

272
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,860
and become a person of status in Nanzhao.

273
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,580
After all, this way,

274
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,500
I can still see Yingying from time to time.

275
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,860
To serve me,

276
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,220
it's not that simple.

277
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,140
He...

278
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,620
must learn to obey.

279
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,300
My shoes are dirty.

280
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,380
I know,

281
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,220
it's not easy

282
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,420
to make someone bow.

283
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,460
Kneel now.

284
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,820
Ms. Ji,

285
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,100
someone is looking for you.

286
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,620
What exactly is "Tian Bu Pa"?

287
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,300
Your Nanzhao looms are indeed intricate,

288
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,220
but they can only weave brocade up to seven inches wide.

289
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,020
The loom we're using is unique to Tang.

290
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,820
The patterns it produces are more refined,

291
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,060
with greater luster

292
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,460
and a smoother texture.

293
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,460
This is Nanzhao tiffany.

294
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,980
Your clothes gave me the inspiration for this.

295
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,220
Nanzhao's textile industry has its own characteristics.

296
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,220
Since we're making Nanzhao brocade,

297
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,820
we can learn from and complement each other.

298
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,700
So,

299
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,220
there's really no such thing as "Tian Bu Pa."

300
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,420
Why did you lure me here to see all this?

301
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,100
To weave superior Shu brocade,

302
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,020
you need the finest silk,

303
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,860
meticulously dyed,

304
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,500
with exquisite pattern designs and skilled craftsmanship.

305
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,020
"Tian Bu Pa"

306
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,380
is not a type of leaf.

307
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,620
It's a complete process,

308
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,900
a result of everyone's joint efforts.

309
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,420
This

310
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,220
is my "Tian Bu Pa."

311
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:12,500
To distinguish between a good lie and a bad one,

312
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,260
you need to see if she deceives you

313
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,460
for your benefit

314
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,100
or for hers.

315
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,700
You came

316
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,220
because you didn't want to let any opportunity slip away.

317
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,860
Because you deeply love those silkworms,

318
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,180
and the brocade.

319
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,820
I told you, you and I are not the same kind of person.

320
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,460
We cannot walk the same path.

321
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,460
Go join Sheng Fengze on his path.

322
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,300
I cannot walk the same path as him.

323
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,780
He wants to keep me here,

324
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,700
but I want to go home.

325
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,820
If we cannot produce brocade,

326
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,700
we will all die.

327
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,780
What's this?

328
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,620
Emotional blackmail?

329
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,900
Back then,

330
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,860
when my master's wife was taken,

331
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,620
nobody sympathized with my master.

332
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,060
Yingying,

333
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,020
the items you asked for are ready.

334
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,580
Alright.

335
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,220
This is Nanzhao silk

336
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,420
dyed using Yizhou methods.

337
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,380
Take a look and see the difference.

338
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,380
If you don't want to look,

339
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,980
you can throw it away.

340
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,580
Let's go.

341
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Mr. Chi Hu,

342
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,220
I need your help

343
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,020
with something.

344
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,180
Ms. Ji, your skills

345
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,420
are truly extraordinary.

346
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,100
But this...

347
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,380
I don't dare accept it.

348
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,420
I never said it was a gift.

349
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,500
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon.

350
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,580
In our hometown,

351
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,060
it's a time for families to reunite.

352
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,220
But now, we can't go back.

353
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,380
I want to celebrate the festival with everyone here in the workshop.

354
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,580
I'd like to trouble you

355
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,900
to sell all these

356
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,340
and help me buy things

357
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,100
we need for Mid-Autumn.

358
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,180
The remaining money

359
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,820
can all go to you.

360
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:09,900
Well...

361
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,300
you could just report this to Prince Bai.

362
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,380
He'd likely approve.

363
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,420
It's unrelated to brocade.

364
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,580
This is our personal matter.

365
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,500
We'll handle it ourselves.

366
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,420
Handle it yourselves?

367
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,420
But you're using silk bought by Prince Bai.

368
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,060
What do you call this?

369
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,580
Colluding with each other,

370
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,860
filling your own pockets!

371
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,300
Chi Hu,

372
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,860
you'd better explain this to Prince Bai personally.

373
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,260
Guards!

374
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,100
Take these weavers away!

375
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:41,580
Yes, sir!

376
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,260
Wait!

377
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,100
Sir,

378
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,260
do you have any idea

379
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,980
how much these velvet flowers

380
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,860
are worth?

381
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,020
Mr. Chi Hu surely knows.

382
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,220
These velvet flowers were already valuable in Yizhou.

383
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,220
Now in Nanzhao,

384
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,780
they're even rarer.

385
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,540
Exactly.

386
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,420
The price would multiply several times.

387
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
These things

388
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,620
are worth that much?

389
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,180
Of course.

390
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,060
Sir,

391
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,420
are you thinking of taking a cut?

392
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,020
Ms. Ji,

393
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,860
that's unacceptable.

394
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,780
Why should he get a cut?

395
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,940
Yeah, Yingying,

396
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,540
we can't cooperate with him!

397
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,020
Since we've been discovered,

398
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,700
cooperation is the best option.

399
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,140
Shut up.

400
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,700
Cooperation?

401
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,980
Did I say I wanted to cooperate with you?

402
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,500
I could easily report them.

403
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,020
That's also fine.

404
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,580
But...

405
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,220
we haven't sold these items yet.

406
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,100
Even if you report them,

407
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,380
we can claim

408
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,020
they're gifts for Prince Bai.

409
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,740
I just think,

410
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
only a fool

411
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,780
wouldn't make profit.

412
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,820
Even though these are valuable,

413
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:15,980
will we get caught

414
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,060
selling it on the sly?

415
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,820
There are no marks on the velvet flowers,

416
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,820
no labels either.

417
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,900
No one can trace their origin.

418
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,180
How do we split it?

419
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,500
He takes six, you three,

420
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,540
and I get one share

421
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,060
to buy lanterns and mooncake tools.

422
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,060
Why does he get twice as much as me?

423
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,260
By order, he came before you.

424
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,900
By association,

425
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,300
he tormented us less than you did.

426
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,100
By capability,

427
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,620
he's better at smuggling them out.

428
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,300
I'll handle the transport.

429
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,020
I take six, he takes three.

430
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,460
Otherwise, no deal.

431
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,660
The business can fall through,

432
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,100
but rules cannot be broken.

433
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,220
He gets five, you four.

434
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,020
I get five,

435
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,220
and he gets four.

436
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,620
Let's ask Mr. Chi Hu what he thinks.

437
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,020
Fine.

438
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,020
You get five,

439
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,740
and I get four.

440
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,860
Do we really have to do this?

441
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,060
Qingping Officer wants to make things difficult for them.

442
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,820
That's separate.

443
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,020
I'll take the money,

444
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,780
but I'll still carry out

445
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,220
the punishments.

446
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:55,860
Send them out.

447
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,140
Understood!

448
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,420
You all,

449
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,180
come with me!

450
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:07,900
Tell her,

451
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,460
I also don't like

452
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,620
having someone else's dog

453
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,740
barking on my territory every day.

454
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,620
But we can use these velvet flowers

455
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,420
to turn the tables.

456
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,580
By the way,

457
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,060
did she

458
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,100
mention Yang Jinglan?

459
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,900
No, she didn't.

460
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,620
Ji Yingying once endured ten years

461
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,180
to avenge her father.

462
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,620
Given her character,

463
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,220
the less she speaks about it,

464
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,420
the more it weighs on her heart.

465
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,860
Forgetting someone

466
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,860
does take time.

467
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,300
I can't kill Yang Jinglan,

468
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,500
but

469
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,900
I can make his life a living hell.

470
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:11,860
Give me that.

471
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:12,860
Yingying,

472
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,820
you invited us to celebrate Mid-Autumn Festival?

473
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,100
I've prepared mooncake molds,

474
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,020
osmanthus wine,

475
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,020
and lanterns.

476
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,860
Later, you can light lanterns

477
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,220
or make mooncakes.

478
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,580
I want to go home.

479
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,660
Mid-Autumn is a time for family reunions,

480
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,020
but we're stuck in this awful place.

481
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,460
How can we feel like celebrating?

482
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,380
Are we supposed to treat this place as home?

483
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:39,780
No.

484
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,380
I hope that missing our hometown

485
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,580
can give us strength,

486
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,700
help us pull ourselves together,

487
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,260
unite as one,

488
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,020
and leave this place

489
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,380
to get back home soon.

490
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:54,780
Yingying...

491
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,300
Yingying, um...

492
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,460
the other day,

493
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,380
I spoke too harshly to you.

494
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,500
Please don't take it to heart.

495
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,100
About weaving brocade for the Nanzhao people,

496
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,220
I've thought it over for days.

497
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,980
You're right.

498
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,260
But I still can't accept

499
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,420
being enslaved like this.

500
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,300
I'm also worried

501
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,060
once we kneel,

502
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,460
even if we return home,

503
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,420
we may never stand tall again.

504
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,620
It's like tonight's moon,

505
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,060
hidden behind the cloud,

506
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,020
no longer shining.

507
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,580
We're here!

508
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,820
We're here.

509
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,860
Come on!

510
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:42,740
They're here.

511
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,060
I called everyone.

512
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,580
I went door to door.

513
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,620
No one's missing.

514
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,100
Well, let me say a few words.

515
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,620
Today is Mid-Autumn Festival,

516
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,580
a time when the moon is full.

517
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,420
We...

518
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,180
although there's no moon,

519
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,580
it doesn't matter.

520
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,300
Let's just celebrate together.

521
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,460
No moon?

522
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,660
Then maybe this festival isn't meant for you!

523
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,060
Ji Yingying,

524
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,020
you're not working

525
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,820
but gathering here to cause trouble,

526
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,020
and colluding with outsiders

527
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,620
to smuggle goods!

528
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,420
You've truly betrayed His Majesty's trust in you.

529
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,860
It's an act of deceiving,

530
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,140
a crime

531
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:31,900
deserving of death!

532
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,580
Hey,

533
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,460
you clearly agreed to buy these!

534
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:34,980
That item,

535
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,060
and that item as well!

536
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,700
Do you have evidence?

537
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,100
I...

538
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,300
I called the people.

539
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,620
I bought the things.

540
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,500
It has nothing to do with Yingying!

541
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,060
No, it doesn't.

542
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,900
I bought the items.

543
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,620
It has nothing to do with him!

544
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,620
Everyone, shut up!

545
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,820
Ji Yingying,

546
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,980
what kind of spell did you cast on them?

547
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,420
You can't even protect yourself now.

548
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,820
Fine.

549
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,180
Since you're all so united,

550
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,660
take them all out and execute them!

551
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,380
Understood!

552
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:04,980
Wait!

553
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,900
Sir,

554
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,820
you're just in time.

555
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,500
Sheng Fengze,

556
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,940
I know you're here.

557
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,380
Come out and save them!

558
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,420
Ms. Ji, you're truly clever.

559
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,980
You even guessed this would happen.

560
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,700
Chi Hu.

561
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,180
Here.

562
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,740
Seize them.

563
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:33,820
Seize them!

564
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:35,740
Your Highness,

565
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,500
what crime have I committed?

566
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,220
You forced the artisans in the workshop

567
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,820
to make velvet flowers for you,

568
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,380
and sold them privately.

569
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
You abused your power for personal gain!

570
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,500
The soldiers transporting and merchants purchasing

571
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,780
have all confessed.

572
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,620
There's both proof and witnesses!

573
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,180
Out of mercy,

574
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,220
and because this is your first offense,

575
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
you will be punished with fifty lashes.

576
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,480
But you also...

577
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,500
What about me?

578
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,100
Do you have proof against me?

579
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,330
[Confession]

580
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,820
Fine.

581
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,020
I admit to selling velvet flowers,

582
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,820
but I had them brought from Yizhou.

583
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,820
It has nothing to do with the artisans here!

584
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,820
Those velvet flowers are called "Flushed Rose."

585
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,660
I dyed them myself.

586
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,980
Just a few days ago, I found them a bit plain,

587
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,980
so I added lighter colors

588
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,100
to every one made in Nanzhao.

589
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,420
If you can find the same color scheme in Yizhou,

590
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,780
then I'm slandering you.

591
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,100
If you can't,

592
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,220
then admit your guilt.

593
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,580
Fine...

594
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,300
You've been scheming against me from the start.

595
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,300
Take him away!

596
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,020
Wait a moment.

597
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,100
Prince Bai, since you're punishing him,

598
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,620
may we, his victims,

599
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,860
have a chance

600
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,020
for revenge?

601
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,020
He's one of Du Yan's men.

602
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
I think

603
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:19,980
that's a great idea.

604
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,860
Hit him twice for me,

605
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,260
for yourselves,

606
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
and for all the artisans he bullied.

607
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,340
Hit him!

608
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,740
Go on!

609
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:48,820
Hit him!

610
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:51,780
You wouldn't dare!

611
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,380
Hit him!

612
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,700
Your Highness,

613
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,220
I'm the Qingping Officer's person.

614
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,900
I'll accept your punishment,

615
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,820
but how can you let these Yizhou peasants...

616
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
Who are you calling peasants?

617
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,100
Who are you calling peasants?

618
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,020
Who's a peasant?

619
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,540
Who's a peasant?

620
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,100
Hit him!

621
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,780
Who's a peasant?

622
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,260
I'll help you hit him!

623
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,220
Who's a peasant?

624
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,580
Who's a peasant?

625
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,940
Who's a peasant?

626
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,860
You like drawing swords, huh?

627
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,180
You enjoy drawing blades, huh?

628
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,900
You think you're tough, huh?

629
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,020
Come on, hit him!

630
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,260
Hit him!

631
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,380
Hit him!

632
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,700
This is for picking on us!

633
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,220
This is for bullying us!

634
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,060
Let's go.

635
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:07,820
Drag him out.

636
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,180
Fifty lashes!

637
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,740
Prince Bai,

638
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,220
since we're weaving brocade here,

639
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,020
shouldn't we be given

640
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,620
proper working conditions?

641
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,980
Agreed.

642
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,500
What do you want?

643
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,620
First,

644
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,860
the guards here should only restrict us

645
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,020
from leaving this place.

646
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,340
They must not interfere otherwise,

647
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,340
nor insult or beat the artisans.

648
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,780
Alright, I agree.

649
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,220
Second,

650
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,260
the artisans' basic living needs

651
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,940
should match those in Yizhou.

652
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,820
We must have enough food, proper clothing,

653
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,220
and medical care.

654
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,980
Of course.

655
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,740
I agree with that as well.

656
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,060
One last thing,

657
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,460
please allow each of us to write a letter home.

658
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,060
This request...

659
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,740
I might not be able to grant it.

660
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,220
You don't understand.

661
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,940
Right now in Yizhou,

662
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,380
Niu Jin holds all the power.

663
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,380
He's declared himself Military Commissioner.

664
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,220
Not only are letters from Nanzhao blocked,

665
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,860
even letters from Chang'an can't get through.

666
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,220
Moreover,

667
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,340
he's been exploiting Yizhou's brocade industry.

668
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,180
Right now,

669
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,980
the artisans in Yizhou

670
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,260
are living far worse than you.

671
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,580
So...

672
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,740
I think it's better for you

673
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,780
not to return to Yizhou for now.

674
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,580
Stay here in Nanzhao for a while.

675
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,980
No matter how chaotic Yizhou gets,

676
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,060
it's still our home.

677
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,020
We'll return there someday.

678
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,020
Do you know why I didn't take advantage

679
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,660
of today's opportunity

680
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,660
to drive Du Yan's men out?

681
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,420
Such exquisite items...

682
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
are they really made in the weaving workshop?

683
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,380
They are.

684
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,540
However,

685
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,260
as delicate and beautiful as these velvet flowers are,

686
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:32,740
they're nowhere near as valuable as Shu brocade.

687
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,420
Right now,

688
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,260
the top priority for the weaving workshop

689
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,060
is to produce our Nanzhao brocade.

690
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,220
Since he abused his power

691
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,180
and delayed brocade production,

692
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,780
deal with him as you see fit.

693
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,980
Is it because

694
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,980
you don't dare to deal with the Qingping Officer's people

695
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,380
that you came to me?

696
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
Actually,

697
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,740
this is Ji Yingying's plan.

698
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,220
That head guard

699
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,620
bullied the Yizhou artisans

700
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,860
far too cruelly.

701
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,740
Ji Yingying wanted to lift their spirits

702
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,180
so they could focus

703
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,060
on weaving brocade.

704
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,780
That man had to go.

705
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,660
So,

706
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,500
Ji Yingying and I

707
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,980
seized this opportunity

708
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,980
and presented it to you, Your Majesty.

709
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,620
You're quite honest.

710
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,420
Between you and me,

711
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,060
we're not just lord and subject,

712
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,060
we're also brothers.

713
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,380
We're family.

714
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,860
I don't need to hide anything from you.

715
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,620
Alright.

716
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,540
If that's the case,

717
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,140
for the next year,

718
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,540
I'll put you in charge

719
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,340
of all brocade production.

720
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,340
Actually, that wasn't my intention.

721
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,460
Then what is your intention?

722
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,900
With this one-year agreement,

723
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,780
I'll do my best.

724
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,900
However,

725
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,380
it's unavoidable

726
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,580
that someone will try to cause trouble.

727
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,780
So,

728
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,380
I wish to work with Qingping Officer.

729
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,140
If the brocade is completed,

730
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,020
we'll share the rewards.

731
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,780
If it isn't,

732
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,260
we'll share the blame.

733
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,620
If you force them to withdraw openly,

734
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,580
they'll secretly try to undermine you.

735
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,980
Only by making them share both the rewards and punishments

736
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,980
will they stop making reckless moves

737
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,460
and truly step aside.

738
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,380
You understand me,

739
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,540
because

740
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,380
you and I are the same kind of person.

741
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,780
Then why do you always act

742
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,580
like you're the good guy and I'm the bad guy,

743
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,140
keeping me at arm's length?

744
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,580
Thank you

745
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,820
for today's help.

746
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,500
We still have a festival to celebrate.

747
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,380
Please excuse yourself.

748
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,780
As the princess consort, won't you invite me to join?

749
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,620
Have you forgotten

750
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,980
why we're celebrating here at all?

751
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,420
Everyone,

752
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,300
I trust that a king

753
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,980
wouldn't break his word.

754
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,820
All I can do is

755
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,420
fight for as much freedom and dignity as possible.

756
