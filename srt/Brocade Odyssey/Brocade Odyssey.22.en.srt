00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,810
[Episode 22]

3
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,550
Yingying,

4
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,680
luckily, we had you around.

5
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,480
Thank you.

6
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
When our family was in trouble,

7
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,510
you gave us a hand too.

8
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,510
We are family.

9
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,360
You do not have to thank me.

10
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,160
All right. I will keep my gratitude, then.

11
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,550
Once I reach home and settle down,

12
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,550
I will try my best to find you a good husband

13
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,590
to make your wish come true!

14
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,310
Just focus on yourself.

15
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,830
I am not in a rush!

16
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,080
I am not in a rush!

17
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,800
Yingying,

18
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,480
be good at home

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,760
while we are gone.

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,720
Do not simply go out,

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,760
all right?

22
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,720
My dear sister,

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,240
you do not have to come with me.

24
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,750
You are needed at home.

25
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,360
You are just worried that I will nag at Li Feng, are you not?

26
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,270
Is he scared of being reprimanded after doing this?

27
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,670
When I get there,

28
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,630
I will give him a proper scolding!

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,630
All right! We have spoken enough.

30
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,440
Let us get going.

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,600
Take care of yourselves on the way!

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,110
[Harbor]
Let us depart.

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,240
I suppose

34
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,550
Mr. Zhao still knows Ms. Ji the best.

35
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,470
Mr. Bai,

36
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,670
you should just focus on doing your own tasks properly.

37
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,750
Madam, you have drunk too much.

38
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,960
I am confined here all day.

39
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,960
I cannot do anything.

40
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,190
I might as well entertain myself.

41
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,030
Mr. Zhao

42
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,440
has been going out frequently in recent days.

43
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,830
However, he has been very secretive.

44
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,670
I am not able to find out what he is doing.

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,550
What else could he be doing?

46
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,830
It must be related to Ji Yingying.

47
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,550
Ji Yingying's aunt came and left.

48
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,670
She even accepted a large order from Tubo.

49
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,960
She is rushing work for it.

50
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,470
Once Zhao Xiuyuan makes up his mind on something,

51
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,670
he will not just sit by and wait.

52
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,470
He must have had a hand in it.

53
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,800
You once said

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,080
it would benefit us

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,160
regardless of whether she succeeds or not.

56
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,080
If she succeeds,

57
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,470
I will have her life.

58
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,160
If she fails,

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,950
I will also have her life.

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,200
Do you not think she and I are alike?

61
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,480
We do not believe in fate.

62
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,830
We both want to survive

63
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,320
through our own efforts.

64
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,550
But she has so many people who love her.

65
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,070
Her parents,

66
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,550
her friends,

67
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,950
and the man she loves.

68
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Why?

69
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,950
Why is she the same as me,

70
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,160
yet she is not falling

71
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,000
into the abyss with me?

72
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,230
Why?

73
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,640
The lonely white rabbit, gentle and bright.

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,230
Hops to the east,

75
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,880
yearns for west's light.

76
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,920
New clothes may gleam with a shine so true,

77
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,880
but old friends are the ones who will see you through.

78
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,600
Madam!

79
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,070
If there is an opportunity,

80
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,550
I will do everything I can.

81
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,070
Yu Yuan,

82
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,600
you are all I have.

83
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,270
No matter what happens,

84
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,440
you must put your safety first.

85
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
Do you understand?

86
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,480
Yes, I do.

87
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,920
The 1,000 guan is paid off now.

88
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,390
However,

89
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,510
there is still no news about Yan's dowry.

90
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,920
Hey,

91
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,230
why don't...

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,760
you lend us a little more?

93
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,270
Li Feng,

94
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,480
you have got us all into trouble

95
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,720
with your gambling.

96
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
Why are you not showing any remorse?

97
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,550
How can you be so shameless as to ask from my sister?

98
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,320
Shut up!

99
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,390
Was I talking to you?

100
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,550
I was tricked by others!

101
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,110
I did not lose on purpose!

102
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,670
Besides,

103
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,270
your sister's business has improved.

104
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,320
So what is wrong

105
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,070
with lending me some money?

106
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,070
Am I right?

107
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,920
Here.

108
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Let me get you a cup of tea.

109
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,200
Have a drink.

110
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,760
Li Feng, listen here!

111
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,920
You are wrong to get into gambling!

112
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,070
What did you promise

113
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,320
when you asked for my sister's hand in marriage?

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,670
You would get a successful work after marriage.

115
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,200
Where is it now?

116
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,600
Are you not ashamed

117
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,920
to call yourself a man?

118
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,790
Hey!

119
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,920
When your family was in trouble,

120
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,760
I know that

121
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,790
she secretly helped you!

122
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,640
What now?

123
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,390
Are you criticizing me

124
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,070
just because you did me a small favor?

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,350
All right! I understand!

126
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,760
You do not want to help us.

127
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,920
You want to cut ties with me!

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,720
Am I right?

129
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,880
We are family.

130
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,160
You can just get straight to the point.

131
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,920
Li Feng!

132
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,510
Do you think my sister has it easy with her business?

133
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,200
You lost 1,000 guan!

134
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,040
Yingying is a little girl.

135
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,480
She had to run everywhere

136
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:48,390
to finally gather enough money for you!

137
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,920
They never asked you to go into a bond of debt, did they?

138
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,760
How can you be so shameless

139
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,720
as to take advantage of their family?

140
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
Bond of debt?

141
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,880
How dare you bring that up?

142
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,950
I see it now.

143
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,950
You two are working together to set me up,

144
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,480
are you not?

145
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,880
You...!

146
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,440
What about me?

147
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,510
- You are twisting facts! - Was I wrong?

148
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,320
Say that again!

149
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,640
I will teach you a lesson today!

150
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,510
You want to teach me a lesson?

151
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,440
Get out!

152
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,720
I will leave now.

153
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,070
Are you all right?

154
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,760
Here.

155
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,110
Sit down.

156
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,350
Slowly.

157
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:25,600
Boatman,

158
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,790
when will we reach the shore?

159
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,320
Soon!

160
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,070
Why are you not getting some rest

161
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,040
inside the boat's cabin?

162
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,550
The two women are too noisy.

163
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,760
I came to get some air.

164
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,150
Ms. Ji!

165
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,670
Mr. Ji!

166
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,470
What's wrong, Gui?

167
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,960
Mrs. Ji...

168
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,760
Mrs. Ji is in trouble!

169
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,230
There is so much blood!

170
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,030
I have never been more unlucky!

171
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,150
I cannot used my boat now!

172
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,550
[Harbor]

173
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,350
You two are sisters!

174
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,000
You got into a fight!

175
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,590
There was not a need to kill her, was there?

176
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,320
Mother!

177
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,030
Move!

178
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,350
Mother?

179
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,960
Mother!

180
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:15,950
Mother!

181
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,640
Mrs. Ji...

182
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,760
Mother, what happened?

183
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,550
It was not me.

184
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,550
It really was not me.

185
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,760
Your aunt... is dead.

186
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,440
I did not kill her!

187
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,350
I did not kill your aunt!

188
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,440
Mother...

189
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,350
Aunt Yan...

190
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,760
That...!

191
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,440
Uncle Feng, what exactly happened?

192
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,150
It was all your mother!

193
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,230
She killed my wife!

194
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:53,960
Impossible!

195
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,840
You are lying!

196
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,760
Mrs. Ji of Sandaoyan

197
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,590
murdered Mrs. Li of Ba County.

198
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,440
We have witness and evidence here.

199
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,790
Lock her up in the county magistrate's prison for prosecution later on.

200
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,230
Everyone else,

201
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,230
move aside!

202
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,960
Hold on!

203
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,910
Wait!

204
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,590
Why would my mother kill my aunt?

205
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,000
There must be a mistake somewhere!

206
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,350
If you hinder us from performing our duty,

207
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,520
we will bring you in together!

208
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,350
Move! Let us go!

209
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,030
Mother, do not be afraid!

210
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,590
Yingying!

211
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,150
Mother, do not worry!

212
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,640
Mother!

213
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,230
Ting!

214
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,150
I did not kill your aunt!

215
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,000
I really did not kill her!

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,550
Leave your explanation...

217
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,320
Mother, I know!

218
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,350
for the magistrate!

219
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,840
[Tangchang County Magistrate]

220
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,760
Officer, it has been a long time now.

221
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
Is the county magistrate still occupied?

222
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,790
Would you please help us talk to him again?

223
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,280
Even if we are not able to see him,

224
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,200
it would be enough if you could explain the situation!

225
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,000
I agree!

226
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,590
We already said he is preoccupied!

227
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,520
Get going!

228
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,590
Apologies for my intrusion.

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,400
I did not mean to disturb you from your work.

230
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,000
There is no such thing!

231
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,790
It is my honor

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,590
to have the opportunity to sit down and have a drink with you.

233
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,200
The people outside...?

234
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,640
I am not going to see them!

235
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,840
No!

236
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,760
Mr. Zhao is correct.

237
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,790
We have all the evidence.

238
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,320
There is no room for denial.

239
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,590
Here's to you.

240
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,350
We cannot just keep waiting here.

241
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,960
Since the boatman and Uncle Feng were at the scene,

242
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,030
I will go and ask them about what happened again.

243
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,200
Yaoting, find a legal practitioner.

244
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Have him take a look at this case

245
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,350
and see what we should do next.

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,550
All right.

247
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,470
Ms. Ji!

248
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,440
Mr. Ji!

249
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,280
Gui!

250
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:36,320
I have bad news!

251
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,640
A thief broke into our residence!

252
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,710
All the silk we just stocked up have been stolen!

253
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,520
What?

254
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,200
Yaoting,

255
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,350
I will head home to have a look.

256
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,550
You should still look for a legal practitioner.

257
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,520
Let us split up.

258
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:45,960
All right.

259
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,960
Come on, Gui!

260
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,440
Was it only the silk?

261
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,960
Did they steal any of our money?

262
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,110
Only the silk!

263
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,960
I noticed that the door was broken open when I came home.

264
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,150
Even the storehouse has been emptied!

265
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,840
I cannot think of which scoundrel who would do this!

266
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,590
Gui,

267
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,880
take some money from the house

268
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,760
and go to my brother.

269
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
I will take a look at the storehouse

270
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,230
and see if the thief left any traces behind.

271
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,200
They did not steal money.

272
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,470
That means wealth is not what they seek.

273
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,880
They were able to move a large amount of silk in a short period of time.

274
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,790
That means they came prepared.

275
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,760
They struck

276
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,200
at the same time Mother got into trouble.

277
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,030
Thief! Stop!

278
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,200
Help!

279
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,230
Help me!

280
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,000
Mrs. Ji is imprisoned.

281
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,400
Their business got hit.

282
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,030
Do you think Ji Yingying will submit

283
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,880
in the face of this double crisis?

284
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,400
Instead of becoming Zhao Xiuyuan's concubine,

285
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,880
she might as well work for me.

286
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,150
Master, Ms. Ji's residence caught fire.

287
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,670
Let me go! I want to save Yingying!

288
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:36,550
The fire is too strong!

289
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,880
Are you trying to die?

290
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,760
She is alone!

291
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,960
- She is inside all alone! - No!

292
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,110
Listen to me!

293
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,520
No!

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,790
The fire is too strong! Stop rushing to get in!

295
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,880
Behave!

296
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,350
Pin, the fire is too strong!

297
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,230
Are you trying to kill yourself?

298
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,350
Yingying is here!

299
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,790
Yingying!

300
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Yingying, are you all right?

301
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,710
Are you all right?

302
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:33,200
Yingying!

303
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,960
Put out the fire!

304
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,960
Yingying!

305
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,440
Put out the fire quickly!

306
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,230
Wake up!

307
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,110
What happened?

308
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,230
What is going on?

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,790
What happened here?

310
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,440
Yingying!

311
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,320
Put out the fire!

312
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,440
Hurry up and put out the fire!

313
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,760
Yingying!

314
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,400
Ji Yingying!

315
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,200
What happened?

316
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,670
- Yingying! - Ms. Ji!

317
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,200
Yingying!

318
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,110
She is waking up!

319
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:54,960
She is alive! Put out the fire first!

320
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,440
Put out the fire!

321
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:56,640
The fire!

322
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,520
Thank goodness you are awake!

323
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,960
Pin, look after her!

324
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,590
Hurry!

325
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,840
Master, are you all right?

326
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,590
Are you injured?

327
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,760
I am fine.

328
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,640
That is good to hear.

329
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,590
Please forgive me for being frank.

330
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,280
However useful Ms. Ji is,

331
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,200
she cannot compare to a millionth of your life.

332
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,350
You should not have put

333
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,080
so much importance in her.

334
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,150
What are we going to do

335
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,000
if something were to happen

336
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,590
to you tonight?

337
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,670
Ji Yingying

338
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,400
has her own views toward brocade.

339
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,640
She is highly talented.

340
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,000
If we want to achieve our goal,

341
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,590
a talent like her

342
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,790
is a must.

343
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,150
That was why I saved her.

344
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,030
The fire was not

345
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,400
as bad earlier.

346
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,760
If I was not perfectly confident,

347
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,230
I would not have acted brashly.

348
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,150
If...

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
I want to use a person.

350
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,760
If I want her to work for me,

351
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,590
there is nothing more important than the favor for saving her life.

352
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,670
Am I right?

353
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,710
Where is Yingying?

354
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,590
Why don't you go and check on her yourself?

355
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,840
You promised me

356
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,230
that you would not hurt her.

357
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,000
Why did she almost burn to death today?

358
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,400
If I wanted to harm her,

359
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,230
would I save her myself?

360
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,640
Listen here.

361
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,790
I will not forgive you

362
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,110
if anything happens to her!

363
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,350
I am afraid we will not make it in time

364
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,830
for the Xu and Zou families' orders.

365
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,190
Mr. Chen,

366
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,230
can you please help calculate

367
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,280
the penalty that will be incurred by these two orders?

368
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,430
Bloom Society will receive a sum of payment tomorrow.

369
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,710
Adding it to the previous orders,

370
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,040
there should be about 300 guan.

371
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,920
While it is not enough,

372
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,430
I am confident I can convince them to delay the deadline.

373
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,830
Following that,

374
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,430
the Yang and Shen families' orders

375
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,280
are the most urgent.

376
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,710
Other than dyeing,

377
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,800
we will also have to mix the color.

378
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,830
There can be no mistakes.

379
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:02,800
Can all of you

380
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,190
handle this?

381
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,230
Leave it to me.

382
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,710
Do not worry.

383
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,590
Ms. Ji has taught us for so long.

384
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,400
We will definitely be of use this time.

385
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,520
We must not

386
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,400
let Yingying fret over Bloom Society's business.

387
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,640
We must handle it on our own.

388
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,230
But now that we lost the silk,

389
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,880
we will not be able to start production

390
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,110
on Mr. Qian's large order.

391
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,110
It is all right.

392
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,070
There will be a way.

393
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,680
We have survived

394
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,000
countless plights before.

395
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,400
This, too, shall pass!

396
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,640
Come on! Let us split up and work on our tasks.

397
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,430
Yes.

398
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
It will be all right, Gui.

399
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,830
It will be all right.

400
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,710
Yaoting...!

401
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:14,710
Yingying, sit!

402
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,000
Sit properly!

403
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,520
Are you still feeling unwell?

404
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,070
I am all right.

405
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,760
How is Mother?

406
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,470
They still refuse

407
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,560
to allow me to meet Mother.

408
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,470
I gave the warden some money

409
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,520
and asked him to help us care for her.

410
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,880
I have also found a legal practitioner.

411
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,470
But the magistrate claims

412
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,920
that the case is still under investigation.

413
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,110
They will pick a date for court.

414
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
I will visit a few other places

415
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,110
to get more information.

416
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
You do not have to worry about this.

417
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,470
Do not worry.

418
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,310
What are you doing here?

419
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,400
Are you hurt?

420
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,880
Mr. Zhao, save your concern.

421
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,190
Our family is a mess right now.

422
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,560
We are not receiving guests at the moment.

423
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,070
Please leave.

424
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,590
Why was there a fire all of a sudden?

425
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,920
Why, do you think?

426
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,520
Who are my enemies

427
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,280
in Yizhou?

428
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,590
Why did they steal the silk,

429
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,920
light a fire intentionally, and come after my life?

430
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,880
Someone start a fire intentionally

431
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,520
to go after your life?

432
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,310
So, you suspect it was me?

433
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,710
I would rather die

434
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,590
than hurt a hair on you!

435
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,190
The people who want to harm me

436
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,310
have always been the same.

437
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,800
Yingying!

438
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,110
Yaoting, you do not need to do this, do you?

439
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,520
I only want to say

440
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:54,760
that if I could help you

441
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,800
rebuild your family the last time,

442
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,070
I can also do that again this time.

443
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,880
We will never forget

444
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,160
the favor you did for us.

445
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,950
But you are now married.

446
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,400
There is no need to talk like this any longer,

447
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,350
or people will misunderstand if they hear you.

448
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:07,800
I do not care what they think!

449
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,000
I can help you.

450
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
I also want to help you!

451
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,000
You need me now!

452
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,190
She does not.

453
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Are you going to leave?

454
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,680
We will not be so polite

455
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,880
if you still refuse to leave!

456
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,350
All right. Since none of you believe me,

457
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,160
I will find the true culprit.

458
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,880
Dear, are you here to visit me?

459
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,280
Come and have a look.

460
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,520
What do you want to show me?

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,190
Something interesting.

462
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,230
Yu Yuan!

463
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,470
What are you scheming?

464
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,310
Ji Yingying almost got burned to death in her home.

465
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,070
Do you know about that?

466
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,920
You have had me confined in the house all day!

467
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Why would I know about that?

468
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,070
I thought you knew.

469
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,920
Must you let it out on the two of us

470
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,000
just because something happened to Ms. Ji?

471
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,070
She admitted to it!

472
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,160
She said she did it.

473
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,920
Within Yizhou,

474
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,470
there are countless of people who hate Ji Yingying.

475
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,400
But you two

476
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,190
are the only ones who want her dead.

477
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
You envy her.

478
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,110
The more successful she is,

479
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,920
the more obvious it is that you are an impostor.

480
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,110
A lowly servant.

481
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,190
Do you think

482
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,110
I will care if she dies?

483
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,400
She will not die!

484
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,160
I learned about water torture

485
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,880
from your father.

486
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,110
At the beginning,

487
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,470
she will only be agitated.

488
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,350
But slowly,

489
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,350
she will begin to lose consciousness.

490
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,310
In the end,

491
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,590
living is not much different from being dead.

492
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,470
It was me.

493
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,280
I was jealous of Ji Yingying.

494
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,640
I sent Yu Yuan to keep watch on you.

495
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,110
I want to kill her regardless of the method.

496
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,710
This has nothing

497
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,560
to do with Yu Yuan.

498
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,950
Let her go, please?

499
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:31,430
Do you think

500
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,590
I am unaware of your thoughts?

501
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,640
You once said

502
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,280
we are the same type of people.

503
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,920
We do not live for ourselves.

504
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,310
We will only wish we were dead

505
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,310
when the things we care for are harmed.

506
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,880
I am the one you hate.

507
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,520
Let her go.

508
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,280
Let her go, please?

509
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,710
Listen here.

510
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,950
If anything happens to Ji Yingying,

511
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,520
I will come after you,

512
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,590
regardless of whether you are behind it.

513
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,280
I am not after anything else.

514
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,520
I just want to make myself feel better!

515
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,590
Yu Yuan...

516
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,160
Yu Yuan!

517
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,920
Yu Yuan!

518
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,470
Yu Yuan...

519
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,160
Yu Yuan...

520
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,590
Within this divided land,

521
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,160
I might be the emperor's father-in-law, but I am but a symbol.

522
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,000
Wait!

523
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,230
You are the governor's secretary.

524
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:46,000
Why are you afraid of a lowly county magistrate?

525
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,470
Above a governor's secretary is the governor.

526
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,310
And above the governor is the military commissioner.

527
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,310
While this case

528
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,710
should be prosecuted by the county magistrate,

529
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,110
every minister working in Yizhou

530
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:04,520
knows about it.

531
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:07,000
Ms. Ji,

532
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,350
you should understand what I am trying to say.

533
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,310
You need to get to the source of the problem to fix it.

534
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,520
It is Niu Jin's orders.

535
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,400
I did not say anything!

536
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,760
Hold on! What are you talking about?

537
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,800
How about this? Just wait here.

538
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,950
I will get help from Chang'an.

539
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,310
Where are you going?

540
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,280
Do you know who is behind all of this?

541
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,400
You are going for help?

542
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,950
They are all too far away.

543
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,400
Even Chang'an cannot oversee everything.

544
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,950
Then...!

545
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,520
What is going to happen to her?

546
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,950
Shisi,

547
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,680
help me find my uncle, Li Feng, first.

548
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,920
I want to know what exactly happened that day.

549
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,760
Sure! Leave it to me.

550
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,560
Yingying,

551
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,310
do you know who is framing Mother?

552
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,310
Is it the Niu family?

553
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,950
Or is it Zhao Xiuyuan?

554
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,350
[Li Feng's Bond of Debt]
Our master said

555
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,110
if you repay us within three days,

556
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,310
nothing will happen.

557
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,110
If you do not,

558
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,310
you can just wait and see what will happen

559
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,920
to your husband and daughter!

560
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,590
Ms. Ji, if you trust me,

561
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,880
I can lend you a sum of money

562
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,190
to use as a buffer.

563
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,230
I would rather die

564
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
than harm a hair on you!

565
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,880
I was not careful enough.

566
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,680
If it was not for me,

567
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,590
Aunt Yan would not have died.

568
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,430
Mother also will not...

569
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,470
It is not your fault that you thrive!

570
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,310
You did nothing wrong.

571
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,680
He also cannot make everything go their way.

572
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,110
There must be a place

573
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,680
that upholds justice within Yizhou.

574
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,160
There must also be a minister who dares to undertake it!

575
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:37,040
[Brocade Bureau]

576
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,160
I told you I will not let you face everything alone.

577
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,710
You got into trouble, did you not?

578
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,280
Yingying?

579
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,160
Yingying!

580
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,070
What is it?

581
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,280
It's nothing.

582
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,470
[The Bai Residence]

583
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,280
Master,

584
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:41,760
Ms. Ji is here.

585
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,430
Thank you for saving me from the fire last night.

586
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,470
It was nothing.

587
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,430
I merely did not want to lose

588
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,880
a good business partner like you.

589
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,680
I was too careful with you previously.

590
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,160
I brought a gift

591
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,710
to express my gratitude.

592
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,950
Whenever you want to order silk or brocade,

593
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,000
no matter the amount,

594
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,110
it will be priced a tenth lower than market price.

595
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,040
This is a promise from Bloom Society.

596
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,680
Whenever you are in trouble,

597
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,110
as long as it is not immoral

598
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,280
or illegal,

599
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:22,760
I will help you out of it.

600
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,350
This is my promise

601
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,070
to my friend.

602
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,680
[No regrets, even in death.]

603
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,560
Friend?

604
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,470
By the way,

605
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,350
I heard that

606
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,680
Bloom Society is purchasing some dye materials and silk.

607
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,920
But some people are pulling strings behind the scene.

608
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,830
Is that why you have not been able to gather everything?

609
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,040
Yes.

610
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,640
To be frank with you,

611
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,350
the most important thing

612
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:32,040
to you right this moment

613
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,070
is not your business,

614
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,280
but your mother.

615
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,430
Will you believe

616
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,710
that I am able

617
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,110
to save your mother?

618
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,800
Yes.

619
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,310
That is good.

620
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,430
Let us discuss the conditions.

621
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,920
What do you want?

622
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,110
I want...

623
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,830
you.

624
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,920
I want you to dye silk and mix colors

625
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,830
for me from now on.

626
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,520
I want you to get Bloom Society

627
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,560
and the Yu family to work for me.

628
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,000
I want you

629
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,950
to return to Nanzhao with me.

630
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,280
So that is your true intentions

631
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,710
toward me.

632
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,310
You need a bigger stage.

633
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,070
With your talents,

634
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,760
the stage in Yizhou is too small.

635
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:43,400
You do not need to make purchasing servants

636
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,710
sound so pleasant.

637
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,950
Servants? I have a lot of them.

638
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,680
I want talented people.

639
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,950
Of course, business negotiations

640
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,560
do not need to be decided on the spot.

641
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,350
If you are not satisfied,

642
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,160
we

643
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,680
can negotiate further.

644
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,710
There is no need.

645
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,880
To express my gratitude,

646
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,710
I will leave that note with you.

647
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,470
But this...

648
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,230
You are not a friend

649
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,120
one would be willing to sacrifice for.

650
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,670
Farewell.

651
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,670
You are being attacked on all sides,

652
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,670
yet you still will not concede.

653
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:19,560
Are you planning

654
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,560
to go to that Master Zhao?

655
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,080
All of Bloom Society know

656
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,120
that I came here to thank you today.

657
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,560
If I do not return by nightfall,

658
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,230
people will come to look for me.

659
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,430
A spy that was placed by your side.

660
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,280
What are you waiting for?

661
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,080
Ze!

662
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,840
Please forgive me!

663
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,080
Forgive me!

664
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,870
I am sorry!

665
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,910
I raised you since you were a baby!

666
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,910
Kill her.

667
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,950
Kill the things that you care about.

668
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,470
From now on, you will be untouchable.

669
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,000
Kill her!

670
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,430
If you are troubled by feelings,

671
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,360
you will not achieve anything in life!

672
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,870
Father is right.

673
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:31,760
Love

674
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,800
is the most useless thing

675
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,670
in this world.

676
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
What is Bloom Society up to?

677
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,870
Helping Ji Yingying with the orders.

678
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,710
They have settled all the smaller orders.

679
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,040
But they cannot sort out

680
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,280
Mr. Qian's order.

681
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,390
They are trying to raise funds

682
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,670
to purchase silk and dye materials again.

683
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,910
Please rest assured.

684
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,320
Our men are watching them.

685
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,670
Even if they get enough funds,

686
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,040
they will not be able to buy everything.

687
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,630
What about Ji Yingying?

688
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,670
Ms. Ji

689
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,560
went to see Bai Sheng.

690
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,000
Why do you always go

691
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,360
to the men you just met

692
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,230
rather than come to me?

693
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:20,230
Is Mrs. Ji

694
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,230
doing well in prison?

695
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,760
Since she was suddenly apprehended,

696
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,120
it is expected that she will be overly anxious.

697
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,670
But because of your orders,

698
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,280
the warden did not use any torture on her.

699
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,280
She is still unharmed.

700
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,230
Overly anxious...

701
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,280
I suppose it might affect her health.

702
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,080
Come on!

703
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:48,120
Small!

704
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,000
Place your bets!

705
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,040
Hands off!

706
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,120
[Big]
Big!

707
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,800
Small!

708
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,200
Small!

709
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,340
Big!

710
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,600
We found him! He is inside!

711
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,470
Aunt Yan just passed away.

712
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,120
But instead of settling her affairs,

713
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,760
he came here to gamble!

714
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,520
That is not all.

715
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,560
I saw him being very generous

716
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
inside there.

717
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,120
He lost tens of guan in a game.

718
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,950
He looked unperturbed.

719
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:15,150
He seemingly is not short of money!

720
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,150
Get him!

721
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,120
Come on!

722
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,840
All right!

723
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,080
You were in a lot of debts recently.

724
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,470
Why are you so rich now?

725
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,120
Are you hiding some shortcut

726
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,950
to get rich from us?

727
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:40,520
No...!

728
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,670
No!

729
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,470
This money belongs to my family.

730
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:44,630
My stupid wife

731
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,430
would not let me spend it.

732
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,120
Now that she is dead,

733
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,670
I can finally splurge now!

734
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,280
That does not seem right.

735
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,910
I heard that your wife borrowed a lot of money from the Ji family

736
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,230
to pay off your debts.

737
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,760
Why would she borrow money if she had so much?

738
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,000
She kept this money

739
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,630
for our daughter's dowry.

740
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,520
She would not have used it on me!

741
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,470
It is the truth.

742
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,430
Dowry!

743
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:06,950
Ouch!

744
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,360
Do you think I will believe that?

745
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,870
Speak your truth! Where did you get the money?

746
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,840
I have been investigating you for a few days.

747
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,760
The money you owed

748
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,120
was all paid off

749
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,470
before your wife came to get you.

750
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,560
How did you pay it off?

751
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,670
Is it the 1,000 guan from the Ji family?

752
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:19,560
No!

753
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,910
Sir, I am telling the truth.

754
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,280
This is my money!

755
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,390
Your money?

756
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,910
Did you kill your wife

757
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,910
and blame it on another

758
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,560
because of that 1,000 guan?

759
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,360
Ji Yingying sent you, did she?

760
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,630
Ji...!

761
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,870
Who is that?

762
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,950
I am asking you where you got the money!

763
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,230
Why are you bringing up someone else?

764
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,430
Go back and tell Ji Yingying

765
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,760
that even if you beat me to death today,

766
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,560
that person was murdered by her mother!

767
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,360
The boatman and I

768
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,710
saw it clearly!

769
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:49,080
Do not try to push it on me!

770
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,710
No deal!

771
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,420
I...

772
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:50,950
Try it!

773
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,560
Try and touch me again!

774
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,080
I will report to the magistrate

775
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,870
that you are trying to kill a witness!

776
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,150
Untie me!

777
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,230
I say, untie me!

778
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,760
I... Was I

779
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,280
too straightforward? Are we exposed?

780
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,430
Since he dares to use the money for gambling,

781
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,760
that means he has thought of an excuse.

782
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,520
I suppose we will not be able to get him to confess.

783
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,280
Then, have we wasted our efforts these past few days?

784
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,670
At least we know

785
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,870
that Uncle Feng is suspicious.

786
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,230
Let us go and meet that boatman today.

787
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,710
Hold on!

788
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:20,670
Even if there is evidence,

789
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,430
there is no use if the magistrate will not go to court.

790
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,870
[The Residence of Yizhou's Governor]
My mother is innocent!

791
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,000
Governor, please look into this

792
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,760
and get us justice!

793
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,080
The governor said

794
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,280
the local county magistrate will handle the case.

795
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,710
You are not to bypass the chain of command!

796
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,320
Mr. Meng is delaying the case and refusing to go to court.

797
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,950
My mother fell sick in custody, but he forbids medical care!

798
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,870
Governor, please get us justice!

799
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,950
Governor, please have a look at my appeal!

800
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,560
Off with the appeal!

801
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,870
The governor is being very generous to you.

802
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,320
Do not be ungrateful!

803
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,760
Leave at once.

804
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,080
Otherwise, we will use punishment on you.

805
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,670
I am Ji Yaoting

806
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,630
of Sandaoyan.

807
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,360
My mother, Mrs. Ji, was framed of murder.

808
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:38,430
The county magistrate is delaying the case and refusing to go to court.

809
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,630
My mother fell sick in custody,

810
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,120
but he will not allow for medical care!

811
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,080
Governor, please get us justice!

812
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Ji Yaoting, you are a commoner going against a minister.

813
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,470
You cannot do this!

814
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,670
Yu, stay out of this.

815
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,190
Ji Yaoting!

816
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,600
The county magistrate forbids medical care!

817
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,840
Please get us justice, governor!

818
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,120
Move! Stand back!

819
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,870
This man has caused disorder

820
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,520
and created a scene.

821
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,430
The governor has ordered that he be punished

822
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,470
as a lesson.

823
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,040
They are going to punish him!

824
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,040
A brocade weaver

825
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,560
cares about their hands above all else.

826
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,080
You still have the chance to repent now.

827
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,710
Ji Yaoting!

828
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,280
Even if I lose my hands today,

829
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,870
I will still help my mother

830
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,670
appeal for her innocence!

831
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,150
Let us see how long you can keep this up!

832
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,840
Do it!

833
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,760
Ji Yaoting, at this juncture,

834
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,150
just surrender if you have to.

835
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,600
My mother is a lone widow.

836
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,630
She empathizes with the poor and weak.

837
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,630
She is virtuous, yet she is being slandered.

838
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,840
Where is the justice in this?

839
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,950
Do you concede?

840
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,150
My mother is sick! She is denied medical care!

841
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,320
A woman wronged

842
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,360
and suffering unjustly!

843
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,760
There is no regard for human life!

844
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,320
What happened to justice?

845
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,360
What happened to it?

846
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,710
How dare you call yourself a minister who serves the people?

847
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
You are oppressing a commoner out in public!

848
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,040
You disregard the misfortune we are suffering from!

849
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,560
It is the Ji family today.

850
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,390
Who knows which family will suffer tomorrow?

851
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,040
The Ji family's eldest son came to appeal his mother's innocence.

852
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,320
It is reasonable and legal,

853
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,560
yet he got punished for it.

854
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,840
If we are wrongly accused in the future,

855
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,040
does that mean we will be following the footsteps of the Ji family

856
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,840
and have no place where we can appeal our innocence?

857
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,470
