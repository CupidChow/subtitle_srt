1
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,291
RIVERS OF FATE

2
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,083
Your Zé has waited all day for you.

3
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,083
Now I'm gonna make love to you.

4
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,541
Come here, my love.

5
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,208
Have you lost your mind, girl?

6
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,958
So this is how you thank me?

7
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,375
-If you don't want to be my princess…
-Get off!

8
00:00:46,458 --> 00:00:49,000
-…you'll be someone else's whore!
-Let go of me!

9
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,750
You whore!

10
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,916
You're gonna regret
being such a smart ass!

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,125
I'd ruin your face
if it didn't end up costing me money!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,041
Your turn now, my little wild cat!

13
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:05,000
Come here! Come here!

14
00:01:05,083 --> 00:01:06,833
-Stop!
-My little wild cat!

15
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,291
-Please!
-Come!

16
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,666
-Come, little wild cat! Come here!
-Stop!

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,583
Come!

18
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,416
Come!

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,875
Quiet! Shut up!

20
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:32,833
And the body?

21
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:35,833
When are they releasing the body?

22
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,791
The medical examiner is…

23
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,708
performing an… autopsy.

24
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:45,583
Maybe today or tomorrow.

25
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:50,833
Do you need help
getting Pedro's body here?

26
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,833
I will find your daughter, Lizete.

27
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,208
The idiot owed some whores
and almost got wrecked for it.

28
00:02:40,583 --> 00:02:42,041
Piss off, man.

29
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:46,583
Go after the whore's cash.

30
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,916
Piranha

31
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:06,875
Is a voracious fish
Of the São Francisco River

32
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:07,958
No, no

33
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,958
One of those goes for three grand.

34
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,125
It's marked. Later, it's ours.

35
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,208
Amazon

36
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,083
Our great river

37
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:22,083
Amazon

38
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:28,958
To hell with anyone
Who ever says they're not

39
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,083
Piranha

40
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,291
It's the name of the fish

41
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:39,416
I swear it is

42
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,541
I wouldn't play my guitar
Or write a song

43
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:47,875
For just any fish

44
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,958
Piranha

45
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,500
Ouch!

46
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:54,166
It's been six months.

47
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:55,666
Six months.

48
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,875
Don't be mad at me, my little bunny.

49
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,166
-If I told you--
-My finger is getting tired.

50
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,708
Promise me this time

51
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:04,125
you'll stay?

52
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,125
You better get used to it.
I'm staying here.

53
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:10,750
Tabaco can go fuck himself.

54
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,000
SOMEONE KILLED TABACO, MAN

55
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:23,125
PREÁ SAID IT WAS YOU!
WAS IT?

56
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,291
All right, everyone!

57
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,916
Next round's on me.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,583
We're raising a glass to the late Tabaco.

59
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:33,333
What do you mean? Tabaco's dead?

60
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,541
He's dead.

61
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:39,125
Let's celebrate the rise of my new boss,
and your new boss too,

62
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:41,125
myself!

63
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,416
Cheers, you fuckers.

64
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,375
Get the skis.

65
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,333
Round up a tight crew.
We're heading to Breves.

66
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:49,666
Preá's hunting season is officially open.

67
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,125
You're going to Breves?

68
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,541
-Where are you going?
-You just got here and you're leaving?

69
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,375
Wait up, damn it. Come here.

70
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,500
It's work, babe. Chill.

71
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,541
I may be far,
but I'm always thinking about you.

72
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:06,458
Here.

73
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,166
After I'm done with Preá,

74
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,458
I'm coming back here,
and you'll be my queen.

75
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:22,708
Watch out, man.

76
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,375
Stay sharp, damn it!

77
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,583
-Stay sharp.
-Hurry up, damn it!

78
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,166
Go!

79
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,458
Damn it, man.
Crazy thing missing someone, huh?

80
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,875
Right.

81
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:46,166
When someone's stuck in your head,
you can't think straight anymore.

82
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,416
You spend the whole night
dreaming about them.

83
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,500
I felt the same when my old man died.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,666
I couldn't stop dreaming about him.

85
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
But that's life.

86
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,708
At least your old man, Tabaco,
left you all his wisdom.

87
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,333
Right, man?

88
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,208
I've been doing some thinking, man.

89
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,791
I want to leave the hustle,
start a family.

90
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,708
For real?

91
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:32,958
For real.

92
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,625
Damn.

93
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,166
I met a girl, you know?

94
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:42,625
I'm marrying her. You'll see.

95
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:43,666
For real, man?

96
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,291
I'm telling you.

97
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,875
Damn.

98
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:50,041
We'll rob one of these boats
and sail away, man.

99
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:54,666
Just like in the movies, you know?
Happily ever after, man.

100
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,375
Happily ever after, Player!

101
00:06:58,291 --> 00:07:00,375
-Hand it over, man.
-Hurry up.

102
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,125
-Move it.
-Hurry.

103
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,750
It's all there, man.

104
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,708
How will I know all is here?

105
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,041
-Come on, Preá.
-I'm checking, damn it.

106
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,291
What the fuck are you talking about?

107
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,583
Your dad trusted me.

108
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,583
It's Jonas, damn it.

109
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:19,625
My dad's gone.

110
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,250
You gotta chill, Preá.

111
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:22,666
Take it easy, bro.

112
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,666
-Hey, we got company.
-Who is it?

113
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,000
-Take it inside.
-Got it.

114
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,791
Fuck! Gigante is coming, man!

115
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,375
Shit! What the fuck is this?

116
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,750
Go! Get the fuck up!

117
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,333
-Run!
-Move, damn it! Hurry!

118
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,958
Go! Just fucking shoot them!

119
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:40,875
Now!

120
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,250
Go, motherfucker!

121
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:59,333
Move, damn it!

122
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,291
Come on! Get the fuck up!

123
00:08:08,708 --> 00:08:10,166
Fuck, they're coming!

124
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,083
They're here!

125
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,333
Turn around!

126
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,750
Motherfuckers! Let's go!

127
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,250
They're coming back!

128
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:25,583
I'll fuck you up, Preá!

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,750
Shit! Fucking shoot them!

130
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:35,291
Wait, Preá! Wait!

131
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,333
Fucker!

132
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:38,875
-Kill him!
-Let's go!

133
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,958
Fucking kill him!

134
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:03,500
THERE WAS NO COMFORT, ONLY REVENGE.

135
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:17,958
Pull it back.

136
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:18,916
-Here?
-Yes.

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,916
-I'll pull it down.
-That's it.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,416
HERE, THE LAW IS DIFFERENT.

139
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:48,833
GOD'S HELP BOAT

140
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:50,625
Hey, handsome.

141
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,500
-Do you know Gigante?
-I don't.

142
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,416
Thanks.

143
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Let me work for you
Breves is in my heart

144
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,875
Brazão, Brazão
That name is legacy

145
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,333
Vote 37 and join Brazão's ride

146
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,666
Brazão, Brazão
That name is legacy

147
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,333
Vote 37 and join Brazão's ride

148
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,833
-Hi. Good evening.
-Good evening.

149
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,125
-Do you know a guy named Gigante, ma'am?
-No.

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,041
Did you find him?

151
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,208
What do you think?

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,166
What are you doing?

153
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,666
I'm just dancing. Acting casual.

154
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,208
No?

155
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,666
-I'm gonna talk to that guy.
-Okay.

156
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,625
Hey, man.
Can I have one cachaça and two glasses?

157
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,500
Sure thing.

158
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,250
A friend recommended this place.

159
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:05,125
-And he said that--
-Said what?

160
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,583
Check this out. Look over here, Marluce.

161
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,541
-Hi.
-She's only 13.

162
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,916
-Practically a virgin.
-It's…

163
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,041
It's for my dad. He's just lost his wife.

164
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,375
And this one's young enough
to be my sister.

165
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,625
But she's a damn good fuck, boy.
I assure you.

166
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,000
Hell. She's my daughter, boy.

167
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,333
-Your daughter?
-Yeah. What's the matter?

168
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,541
I raised her, fed her.

169
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,291
I was the first one to try that pussy.

170
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,875
Isn't that right, Marluce? Huh?

171
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:36,166
Right, honey?

172
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,416
-Wanna fuck my daughter?
-No.

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,583
It's… No, I'll…

174
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,166
I'm waiting for a friend.

175
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,166
He'll help me pick one.

176
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,250
And who is this friend that knows more
about my business than me?

177
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:49,916
Gigante.

178
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,375
If it's up to him,
you'll be left high and dry.

179
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,375
Good thing I know who he's banging. There.

180
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,291
Tereza.

181
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,333
She's sort of his girlfriend, you know?

182
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,541
You want her?

183
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,083
If she's his, I'd rather not make a move
without his consent.

184
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:12,916
I'll just drink this and decide later.

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
-Okay.
-Thanks.

186
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,166
-Pour me a drink.
-Sure.

187
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,083
Thanks.

188
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,916
-Are you 18?
-Yeah, 18.

189
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,500
DOG EAT DOG WORLD OF HELL.

190
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,208
Pssica!

191
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,041
Mariangel?

192
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,625
Mariangel?

193
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,125
Hey!

194
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:50,375
Mrs. Mariangel?

195
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,458
That one over there is Gigante's girl.

196
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,875
She's like his girlfriend.

197
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,500
We've got whiskey today.

198
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:30,041
Let me work for you
Breves is in my heart

199
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,416
Brazão, Brazão
That name is legacy

200
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,708
Vote 37 and join Brazão's ride

201
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,125
Brazão, Brazão
That name is legacy

202
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,875
Good evening.

203
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,708
-Tereza, how are you?
-Good.

204
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,583
-Let's go in and chat.
-What do you want in my house?

205
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:47,000
-Let's go in and talk.
-I can't. Swing by the bar tomorrow.

206
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,083
Is that Gigante, Mrs. Mariangel?

207
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,625
No.

208
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,458
That guy wasn't there.

209
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,958
We'll wait for Gigante here.

210
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:01,166
If he doesn't show up by tomorrow morning,
we talk to her.

211
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,041
And where are we sleeping?

212
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,625
Go on, Valdo. Start your whining.

213
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:29,458
Mr. Mayor, those punks' war
will ruin everyone's business here.

214
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:31,958
I'm not deaf, Valdo.
Can you lower your voice, please?

215
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,416
I got shot! Shot, Mr. Mayor!

216
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,375
Valdo, if you keep shouting,
do you know what will happen?

217
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,125
This tiny bullet hole in your arm
will be the least of your problems.

218
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:43,416
For fuck's sake.

219
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,708
There. What is that, Brazilian cherry?

220
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:47,708
Piquiá.

221
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,166
Piquiá. Look at that.

222
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,833
So here's what you'll do.

223
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,000
You're going to cut

224
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:57,666
the center slab out of this piece
and set it aside for me.

225
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,250
-Okay.
-This is certified, right?

226
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,958
-It is. I bought it last month.
-All right.

227
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,041
Come here, Valdo.

228
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,791
Do you know
what I should be worrying about?

229
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:09,625
Making the people in my town happy.

230
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,666
Start thinking about my campaign
for Congress.

231
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,000
That's it, man.

232
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,833
You want to know when I used to worry
about these clowns you mentioned?

233
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,375
When I was a city councilman.

234
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:24,791
What are you, Valdo?

235
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:26,875
A city councilman.

236
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,583
I'm sorry, Mr. Mayor,
but those fuckers don't listen to us.

237
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,625
-They've got no limits.
-Calm down, man.

238
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:39,125
Tell you what, invite these two punks
to my birthday party.

239
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,625
But let them know
I don't want any trouble in my house.

240
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:47,041
This number is temporarily unavailable.
Please--

241
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,375
Babe, where are you?

242
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,583
HEY, BABE

243
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,625
I MISS YOU

244
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,375
Crazy. I miss you like crazy.

245
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,291
Listen, let me tell you something.

246
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,458
I'm in a drought over here.

247
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,083
Can't you send me a pic
of that big pussy of yours?

248
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,291
Didn't you say it was all shaved?

249
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,125
I WANT TO SHOW YOU HERE

250
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,750
I know.

251
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:18,333
I'd like that too. You think I don't?

252
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,500
But I gotta stay in Breves for now.
I have to lie low.

253
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,083
The mayor invited me to his birthday party

254
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,333
back at his little farm.

255
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,541
It's this Saturday, babe.

256
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,458
I WANT TO GO WITH YOU

257
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,666
No, babe.

258
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,500
I thought about taking you.

259
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:44,166
But they say it's only for men.

260
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,333
I'M LOSING MY MIND, HOTTIE

261
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm holding it together, and so will you.

262
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:56,875
FINE
LOVE YOU, BABE

263
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,500
I LOVE YOU

264
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:02,833
I'm a romantic.

265
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,041
Mrs. Mariangel, come over here.

266
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,166
What are we doing with her?

267
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,833
Relax.

268
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,125
Relax, it's okay.

269
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,333
It's okay! Calm down!

270
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,541
It's okay!

271
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,333
Never again.

272
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,541
Never again.

273
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:03,958
Let's go.

274
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,791
Move, move, move!

275
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,166
That way!

276
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,083
Let's go!

277
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:20,166
Go!

278
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,291
Go! Go! Go!

279
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,083
Get in there.

280
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,000
Go!

281
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,666
For fuck's sake, Cristóbal!

282
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,583
Thank you, my friend.

283
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:52,750
No.

284
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,583
No, no, no, no, no!

285
00:18:58,875 --> 00:18:59,750
Never again.

286
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,750
THERE'S A VOID.

287
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,166
Excellent.

288
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,000
Turn around.

289
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,333
Afternoon, my friend.

290
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:24,666
Are you free?

291
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,541
Where to, man?

292
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:30,583
Drive.

293
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,750
Just drive.

294
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,291
And don't do anything stupid.

295
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,833
All delicate.

296
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:58,708
Smile for me.

297
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,041
Big smile.

298
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,541
Smell her skin.

299
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,416
You'll see she's worth it.

300
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:15,333
Sweet.

301
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,750
Keep going straight ahead.

302
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,625
Now turn right here.

303
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,916
Are you a virgin?

304
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:31,208
Is she a virgin?

305
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,458
Nowadays, nobody is anymore.

306
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:42,875
No.

307
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,666
Miltinho, move that barricade.

308
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,416
Come here.

309
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,625
Here. Get something to eat.

310
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:03,791
Put it back and don't let anyone through.

311
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,208
All right.

312
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,250
But my order was very clear.

313
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,250
Five white girls.

314
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,750
Gorgeous.

315
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,000
Barely ripe.

316
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,375
There are only four here.

317
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:28,041
My man, let's get something straight here.

318
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,541
These are luxury items.

319
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,375
You can't find them
on just any corner, you know?

320
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,000
I only managed to get these four.

321
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,791
-We can get something extra here.
-Boss.

322
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,708
For sure.

323
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,291
And this Indian girl?

324
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,750
-Excuse me?
-Aren't you interested in her?

325
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,500
I was just thinking,
we could make a different deal.

326
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,833
Where's this girl?

327
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,750
I'm telling you, man!

328
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,500
This Indian boy is lying!

329
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:23,083
I have an order for an event coming soon.

330
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:24,208
A party.

331
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:28,000
If I take these girls,
I can get some extra cash.

332
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,375
Good cash.

333
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,791
He can pay. He's the mayor.

334
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:36,958
So I'd get half, you'd get the other half,
and we're settled.

335
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,708
What do you say?

336
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,833
All right.

337
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,416
The Indian girl stays for the party.

338
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:49,833
But it's 60% for me, and 40% for you.

339
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,583
-Where's the girl?
-Stop!

340
00:22:58,666 --> 00:23:00,125
-I'm not the seller!
-No?

341
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,791
I just take them to the seller!

342
00:23:06,375 --> 00:23:08,458
Call whoever ordered them now.

343
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:10,250
And put it on speaker.

344
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,125
Hello?

345
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,500
Hi, son.

346
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,000
Hi, Mom.

347
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,250
Is my godfather there?

348
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:25,166
You have a son?

349
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,958
Does he live here or in Belém?

350
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,791
Let me talk to my godfather.

351
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,375
He's busy now.

352
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,166
He's taking the girls
to the mayor's party today.

353
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,958
-What's wrong?
-Where is he?

354
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,500
Shut up, girl!

355
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:42,958
I said quiet, Jane. You've got some nerve.

356
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,041
-I need…
-Give me that.

357
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,833
No.

358
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:47,958
Mariozinho?

359
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,375
L/M CHAMPION 9

360
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,375
RECLINING SEATS

361
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,166
CHAMPION 9 SPEEDBOAT

362
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:23,916
-Did you find the bathroom?
-I did.

363
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:27,166
Do you really think they'll be there?

364
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:29,166
I think so.

365
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,125
I got a hot tip.

366
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:42,375
MAKE MARAJÓ CHEESE
A TOURIST ATTRACTION.

367
00:24:42,458 --> 00:24:43,291
Let's go!

368
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,250
Abreu, get the girls to the other car.

369
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:47,416
Let's go.

370
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,333
Can you stop playing around, my petite?

371
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:32,416
BREVES
[MARAJÓ ISLAND]

372
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:08,708
Careful, someone's coming.

373
00:26:08,791 --> 00:26:10,041
Get out of there.

374
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,416
Get out, Jana.

375
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,333
Stand up.

376
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,041
Please.

377
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,583
How are my babies doing?

378
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,250
This is Marcela.

379
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:28,375
Hi.

380
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:32,666
Marcela has brought some clothes
I told her to buy

381
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,416
so you'll be even prettier
than you already are.

382
00:26:37,708 --> 00:26:42,125
I have some friends coming over,
and we'll entertain them for a while.

383
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,375
But I don't wanna see any tears.

384
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,083
And no acting up, either.

385
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,291
You'll enjoy it.

386
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:51,750
It's a party.

387
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,625
Have you ever had champagne before? No?

388
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,791
So you're gonna have
your first taste of champagne.

389
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:04,666
I told you to drink it. Drink it.

390
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:09,375
Drink it. I want to see you drink, baby.

391
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,875
And you?

392
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:16,250
Why aren't you drinking?

393
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,125
Until the last drop.

394
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:23,833
Drink it all.

395
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,208
-It was you, wasn't it?
-I'm sorry.

396
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,916
It's always you, huh?

397
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:34,500
Did you bring more?

398
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:35,625
Sure, boss.

399
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,000
Drink it.

400
00:27:50,541 --> 00:27:51,750
Come on, girls.

401
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:53,333
I speak…

402
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:55,208
and you obey.

403
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,708
Simple as that.

404
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,458
Now you finish getting ready

405
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:03,500
because the show is about to start.

406
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,458
And I want you all looking beautiful.

407
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,708
Do your best, Marcela.

408
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:11,291
-Come here.
-Why did you do that, Jana?

409
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:12,625
Try this one.

410
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,416
One of us has to be well
to get us out of here.

411
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,333
Look.

412
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:18,333
Girl, I think this is your size.

413
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,208
You need to be very brave, okay?

414
00:28:21,458 --> 00:28:24,000
You'll do whatever you want
and leave here.

415
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:25,416
-Okay?
-Okay.

416
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,625
This is a little smaller.

417
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,250
We're taking him, right?

418
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:06,166
How?

419
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,708
First we need to get in.

420
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,500
There are cars coming! Let's go!

421
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,458
This is our chance. Come on.

422
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,458
Let's go!

423
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,083
Easy.

424
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,500
Stay calm.

425
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:23,500
Okay.

426
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,375
Good evening.

427
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:28,333
Good evening.
We're with the Buffalo Association.

428
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:30,750
-These are all our cars back there.
-All three?

429
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,166
Go ahead.

430
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:38,833
Thanks, man.

431
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:26,833
Mom!

432
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,958
Mom!

433
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:30,875
Mom!

434
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,250
One of them is here.
With the jaguar shirt.

435
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,875
Let's take a look around first.

436
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:40,375
What are you doing here?

437
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:41,625
Are you nuts?

438
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,458
-Not scared of dying?
-You used to be softer.

439
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:47,041
-Get your gun! Try and kill me!
-I don't need it to kill you!

440
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:49,875
-Kill me now, fucker!
-What the hell is this?

441
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,083
What the hell is this?

442
00:31:52,958 --> 00:31:54,958
This isn't the place or the time.

443
00:32:01,791 --> 00:32:03,666
Now that's much better.

444
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,958
And there's more for both of you.

445
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,708
If we can share, everyone thrives.

446
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,500
Everyone's life is better.

447
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,875
Just like the good old days with your dad.

448
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,208
Dioclésio.

449
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,708
Apologize to your partner.

450
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,791
Brazão!

451
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:28,583
-Come here, my friend!
-Hear that? They want me at the party.

452
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:31,291
-Everybody's getting some today!
-Dioclésio.

453
00:32:33,916 --> 00:32:35,916
-My bad, Preá.
-It's Jonas, motherfucker!

454
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,833
Jonas. Jonas.

455
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,000
In my house, we speak quietly

456
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:43,958
and politely.

457
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,375
Accept your friend's apology.

458
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,750
Apologize to him as well.

459
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:52,833
-This fucker killed my dad.
-Prove it then!

460
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:55,166
-You killed my dad, fucker!
-Dioclésio.

461
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:57,000
-He doesn't have any balls!
-Dioclésio!

462
00:32:57,083 --> 00:32:58,250
I'm not dealing with him!

463
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:01,958
I told you, in my house, we speak quietly.

464
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:05,375
Sorry.

465
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:07,833
Jonas.

466
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,625
He's right.

467
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:13,750
You've been telling everyone
he killed your father.

468
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,708
Did you see it happen?

469
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,333
No, I didn't.

470
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:27,041
Did anybody see it
or tell you what happened?

471
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,625
Well then.

472
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,750
Do it for your father's memory.

473
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,750
-Do it for me.
-Fuck you!

474
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:38,583
My dear Brazão,

475
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:42,250
come up on stage
and get your birthday gift, my man!

476
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,125
HAPPY BIRTHDAY,
MAYOR BRAZÃO

477
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:49,708
A round of applause
for our dear mayor, Brazão!

478
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:56,750
And to celebrate,

479
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:02,791
we're auctioning off the girls!

480
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:13,541
Make way for the girls!

481
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,625
Sexy girl!

482
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:28,166
Hot stuff!

483
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,125
Velvet lips!

484
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,541
Do you think they're hot?

485
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah!

486
00:34:35,083 --> 00:34:39,375
Just wait until you see the gift I have

487
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:43,958
for our future congressman!

488
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:49,250
I ask you to make way for her!

489
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,000
Damn!

490
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:53,916
Hot damn!

491
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,791
-Yummy!
-Hottie!

492
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,583
-Damn!
-Hottie!

493
00:35:18,666 --> 00:35:19,625
Hottie!

494
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,750
Look at that whore!

495
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,125
Hot damn!

496
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:48,750
Come and get
your birthday present, my friend!

497
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,333
Brazão! Brazão! Brazão!

498
00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:58,250
Brazão! Brazão! Brazão!

499
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:00,583
She's coming with me.

500
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,958
What the hell, boy?

501
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,208
I'll pay whatever you want.
She's coming with me.

502
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,583
-Get out of there!
-Get out!

503
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,625
Man, somebody
needs to kill this motherfucker…

504
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:15,541
Easy! Easy! Easy!

505
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:16,666
Here's the deal,

506
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,208
Jonas here can go first.

507
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:22,416
In memory of my longtime partner,
Tabaco, who left us.

508
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,166
That's beautiful.

509
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,666
So much generosity
from our future congressman.

510
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,083
Fuck you, man!

511
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,166
Get the fuck out!

512
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,833
Gentlemen, welcome to our big auction.

513
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:43,500
We have a special lot today. Four girls…

514
00:36:43,583 --> 00:36:45,041
What the hell, Mayor?

515
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:48,583
You really gonna let Preá
be the first to fuck your girl?

516
00:36:48,666 --> 00:36:51,208
Let the boy have one last happy night.

517
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,083
It's the least I can do for Tabaco.

518
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:55,666
And then…

519
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:02,166
Right here, in your city?

520
00:37:03,416 --> 00:37:04,958
It's my city, isn't it?

521
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,750
Preá got more men around?

522
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,541
There's Player.

523
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:16,375
Is he one of ours?

524
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:18,541
He will be.

525
00:37:44,416 --> 00:37:45,250
Hey.

526
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,291
Didn't I say I'd save you?

527
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,958
No one is gonna hurt you anymore.

528
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,416
Remember what I promised you on the boat?

529
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,541
Do you?

530
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:04,916
You were on the boat?

531
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,916
Yeah, I was on the boat.

532
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,791
Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you.

533
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,458
It's like God is trying to talk to me.

534
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,166
It must be fate.

535
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,708
Gentlemen, we haven't finished!

536
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:30,250
I know I was a coward that day,
but today I'm not backing down.

537
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,000
I'm taking you with me today.

538
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:36,708
Bidding starts at 500 reais!

539
00:38:37,708 --> 00:38:39,291
So delicious!

540
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:41,875
Do I hear more than 500? 500?

541
00:38:41,958 --> 00:38:43,458
Gorgeous little ass!

542
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:47,291
-1,100!
-1,100 from the gentleman over here!

543
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:52,041
Do I hear 1,200?
Can he get this beauty for 1,200?

544
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,583
We're at 1,200!

545
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,416
1,200!

546
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,458
Do I hear more than 1,200?

547
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:00,583
1,200!

548
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,250
1,400 on my right!

549
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:06,625
1,400!

550
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:08,958
Look at how pretty she is, everyone!

551
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:10,291
-Do I hear more?
-1,500!

552
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:12,250
I hear 1,500 over here!

553
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,583
1,500! Do I hear more?

554
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,291
-Do I hear more?
-1,800!

555
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:19,083
1,800! Going once!

556
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,458
Going twice, going thrice!

557
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:25,250
Sold to our gentleman here!

558
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,625
Take this big gift home, my friend!

559
00:39:29,708 --> 00:39:32,541
Sold for 1,800!

560
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:41,750
Get off me, damn it!

561
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,250
Get off!

562
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:48,500
Get off, damn it!

563
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,250
You motherfucker!

564
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,291
Say hi to the devil, you miserable fuck!

565
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:57,500
Let me go, motherfucker!

566
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,791
You fucking faggot!

567
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,583
Go to hell.

568
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:37,958
Fucker.

569
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,666
You know this place? How do we get in?

570
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,458
The gate is on that side.

571
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:59,208
We can manage from here.

572
00:41:03,041 --> 00:41:06,041
Damn, man! You didn't waste any time, huh?

573
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:07,291
Respect.

574
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:08,916
Come.

575
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,916
Come in!

576
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:12,916
Brazão!

577
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,333
She's coming with me.

578
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:21,541
I'm losing my patience with you, Preá.

579
00:41:21,625 --> 00:41:23,375
It's Jonas! I told you already!

580
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:25,416
Keep your voice down in my house.

581
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,458
Show some respect, Baby Tabaco.

582
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:29,000
Fuck this. She's coming with me.

583
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,583
I don't care.

584
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:32,666
Talk to my friend over here.

585
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:35,125
That's not possible.

586
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,458
What?

587
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,458
Don't you want money? I've got money.

588
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,583
She's been paid for, chéri.

589
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,541
Talk to Zé Elídio here.
He can get you another one.

590
00:41:45,625 --> 00:41:47,375
That's out of my hands now.

591
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,125
Are you deaf?

592
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,625
I don't want a whore.

593
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,375
It seems you're the deaf one here.

594
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:57,541
Do you know who you're talking to?

595
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,083
I don't care, mon cher.

596
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,416
She's already taken.

597
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,416
By whom?

598
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
You?

599
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,333
I'd rather go with him.

600
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,791
She's coming with me. Fuck you all.

601
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,500
-What the fuck?
-Enough.

602
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,583
You could've settled for less, Preá.

603
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:22,250
-But you chose to lose it all.
-Fuck you!

604
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:23,458
I'm coming back for her!

605
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,666
-Babe, I'm coming back for you.
-Move!

606
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,916
What did you do
to drive the guy crazy like that?

607
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,666
I want to know.

608
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:36,416
-I want to know.
-Let me go!

609
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,583
Happy birthday.

610
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,750
Remember, stay close to me.
Don't wander off.

611
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,375
They're inside.

612
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,208
We gotta stay put here.

613
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,708
-Let's go now.
-Not now.

614
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:07,000
The place is crawling with killers.
We gotta wait for the right moment.

615
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,291
One down.

616
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,083
Did you kill him?

617
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,583
One word about this
and you'll suffer like never before.

618
00:43:35,666 --> 00:43:39,208
HE COULDN'T GET HARD. TOO BAD.

619
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:41,583
So let me and the girls leave.

620
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,666
I'll keep my mouth shut,
and you won't go to jail.

621
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:48,083
Are you threatening me?

622
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:50,750
Are you, little brat?

623
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:07,791
Take her.

624
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:09,250
Perfect timing.

625
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:14,125
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you, monsieur.

626
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:18,625
Come back anytime.

627
00:44:22,375 --> 00:44:23,833
Get the cars ready.

628
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:26,375
You're not coming.

629
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:27,500
Take her.

630
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:30,791
Come. I'll take care of you.

631
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:32,083
Come, Indian girl.

632
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:33,458
Let's go.

633
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:37,291
Come!

634
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,458
Let's go.

635
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:39,500
Move.

636
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,375
Come, damn it! Come!

637
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:49,083
What are they doing in the pool?

638
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,458
Swimming.

639
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:55,875
Let go of me!

640
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:57,416
-Let's go!
-Let me go!

641
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,916
An Indian indeed.
You like the jungle, huh?

642
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,083
-Let me go!
-Come!

643
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,333
Get back here, bitch!

644
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,375
Luzia!

645
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,875
Miltinho! No!

646
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,166
Stop right there! Who are you?

647
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,375
Turn around! Now!

648
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:18,125
-Miltinho!
-Follow me. I know the way.

649
00:45:24,916 --> 00:45:26,250
Are we free?

650
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,375
We're free!

651
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:28,791
Run!

652
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:42,541
THE RIVER'S FLOW.

653
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:51,916
I've heard many stories like that before,
but I never thought

654
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,541
something like that
could happen in my town.

655
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:58,708
Let's go. Hurry.

656
00:45:58,791 --> 00:45:59,958
Let's go!

657
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:01,708
God almighty.

658
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:04,000
-You two up front, quiet!
-Hi, cutie!

659
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:05,708
Leaving already, cutie pie?

660
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,916
-Thanks, hottie!
-Don't go, cutie!

661
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:11,333
Didn't you feel even a little ashamed
of what you did?

662
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:14,791
You pretended to be my friend
just to get away with your crimes.

663
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,500
Get in. Move, slut!

664
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:21,416
Didn't you stop to think
this could hurt my campaign for Congress?

665
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,583
Get in! Move!

666
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,791
Or worse, ruin my political career?

667
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,125
Go! Move, damn it!

668
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:39,041
That's your man over there.

669
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,875
Player, we're fucked. Where are you?

670
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:47,333
Get the car. Where the fuck are you?

671
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,500
Mayor, I don't mean to overstep,

672
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:52,583
but I'm worried about
what those thugs might do to the girl.

673
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,916
I'll call the Public Safety Secretary.

674
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,458
Move, damn it! Get out!

675
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,375
Move!

676
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:04,708
That's him.

677
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:05,875
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

678
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:12,791
Let's go.

679
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,375
There's Preá.

680
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,166
Let's go.

681
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,375
Go, go, go!

682
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:32,291
Just a quick question, mister…

683
00:47:32,375 --> 00:47:33,291
Amadeu.

684
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:40,750
What the fuck were you thinking

685
00:47:40,833 --> 00:47:44,375
when you decided to ruin
my birthday party?

686
00:48:58,875 --> 00:48:59,958
