00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,583
RIVERS OF FATE

2
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:23,958
Are you trying to get yourselves killed?

3
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,625
Have you lost your minds?

4
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,416
You keep pulling this shit,

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,083
and your lives won't be worth a damn!

6
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:52,833
Let's go!

7
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,958
Go faster!

8
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:23,083
Go! Don't lose the truck! Hurry!

9
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,916
PARAUAÚ RIVER
[BREVES]

10
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,666
You. Go up there and check the perimeter.

11
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,625
Wake the captain and start the boat.
We're leaving now.

12
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,125
You too, piece of shit. Move.

13
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:20,333
Captain! Get the boat started.

14
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,708
We're leaving.

15
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:24,958
Look.

16
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:30,583
Fuck.

17
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,125
You again, Baby Tabaco?

18
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:35,583
I come in peace. I just want her.

19
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,625
I've got money. Name your price.

20
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,083
I've told you, boy. The girl's been sold.

21
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,666
You'll have to go to Cayenne
to sleep with her, mon ami.

22
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,958
But bring a fat stack.

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,750
She's gonna be a deluxe whore over there.
Got it?

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,208
Now go! Hey!

25
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:55,875
Are you fucking crazy?
That's my woman you're talking about!

26
00:02:55,958 --> 00:02:57,708
I'm not leaving without her.

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,291
Let's go get that motherfucker.

28
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:05,083
Go. Open this fucking door.

29
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,416
Easy.

30
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,125
Come on, get out! Out now!

31
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,375
Where's Jana?

32
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,958
Where is she? Open the door!

33
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,291
If you choose that path, Preá,
you're gonna lose.

34
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,708
Go fuck yourself! Open this shit now!

35
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,125
All right.

36
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,458
Come on, baby.

37
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:26,375
-Stop!
-Get behind me.

38
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,166
I'm not leaving without them.

39
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,000
-We're all going.
-What the fuck, Jana?

40
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,291
What a mess.

41
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,416
Shut the fuck up!

42
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,750
-Get the fuck back or you're all dead!
-Easy.

43
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,083
-Tell them to get back now.
-Easy!

44
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,750
Easy, motherfuckers!

45
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,875
So, are you letting
a woman boss you around, Jonas?

46
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,291
Or are you Preá again?

47
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,791
Fuck you!

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,625
-Want to die, fucker?
-Putain.

49
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,041
Preá, your time's up, motherfucker!

50
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,250
God damn it, Gabiru! Fucking hell!

51
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,125
Fuck! Let's go!

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,208
-Hurry!
-Go!

53
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,583
That way!

54
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:20,916
You two, go after the girls!

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,666
Move! After the blondie!

56
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,291
Coward.

57
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,541
Come on! Hurry up, Jana!

58
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,083
Get down!

59
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,083
Trust me, babe.
We're getting out of here, okay?

60
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,625
-We're both gonna die.
-You're done, Preá!

61
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,416
Leave Janalice and bon voyage!

62
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,083
Go fuck yourself, motherfucker!

63
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,416
Hurry!

64
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,166
We can't get through! Get back!

65
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,625
Stop right there!
Are you trying to get shot?

66
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,541
Put the gun down!

67
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,291
Where is the guy with the red hair?

68
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,833
Can't you fucking hear her?
Where are the girls?

69
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,208
-I don't understand. I don't speak--
-And the other girls?

70
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,208
-Tell me!
-I don't speak your language!

71
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,750
Why did you do that?

72
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:31,833
I didn't mean to.

73
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,750
Fuck!

74
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:39,125
Go on, girls! Get out of here now!

75
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:40,458
-Go.
-Let's go!

76
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,000
Head over there. I'll go this way.

77
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,916
-I'm not dying here!
-Jana, wait!

78
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,958
Hey! Wait!

79
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,250
Wait, girl! Wait, damn it!

80
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,708
Go, Nuno! Go!

81
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,791
I'm after Preá, man!
Stay the fuck out of this!

82
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:05,791
Over here!

83
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,208
Go! Pull it! Hurry!

84
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,250
Got you, fucker!

85
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:19,750
-Get off!
-Fuck!

86
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,916
-Stop!
-Get off, motherfucker!

87
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,375
Move, girl. Move.

88
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:28,708
No! Stop!

89
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,041
God damn it! Fuck you, Gigante!

90
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,958
I'm gonna kill you
and fuck your little blondie in the ass!

91
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:37,041
-Leave me alone, damn it!
-Put the gun down!

92
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,583
-What the fuck?
-Put the fucking gun down!

93
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:50,875
You're lucky you're worth a lot, girl.
Otherwise…

94
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,458
Get off!

95
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:55,375
-Let me go! Son of a bitch!
-Shut up!

96
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,458
-Move! Out!
-Oh my God!

97
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,666
I'm gonna blow your boss's head off.

98
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,750
You think I care?

99
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,791
Blow that fucker's head off now
or I'll do it myself.

100
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,791
Who are you, motherfucker?
I've never seen you!

101
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,875
Yes, you have.

102
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,916
I want you to look me in the fucking eye.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,541
I want to make sure…

104
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,750
Crazy motherfucker.

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,416
-Start the boat.
-Easy, man!

106
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,875
-Go!
-Philippe!

107
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,333
Let her go, motherfucker!

108
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,416
Leave her here, damn it!

109
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,791
Stop! Leave her here!

110
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,541
Let her go, motherfucker!

111
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,041
Au revoir, Preá!

112
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:09,833
It's okay.

113
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,250
I won't let anyone hurt you.

114
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,333
No!

115
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,625
It's okay.

116
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,333
It's okay.

117
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,000
Stop right there, motherfucker!

118
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,916
I need to save her.

119
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,208
Save her?

120
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,500
You killed my husband and my son.
You kidnapped this girl.

121
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,333
It's over now, son of a bitch.

122
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,125
Look me in the eye, murderer.

123
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,333
It wasn't me who killed them.

124
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:14,250
-You were with them.
-I tried to save your son.

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,833
Why do you want to kill me?

126
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,041
Whose death are you avenging
by killing me?

127
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:23,125
The girl I love will become a whore now.

128
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,708
Fuck it. Go on, shoot me, then.

129
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,750
Wasn't it you who kidnapped her, fucker?

130
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,875
I love that girl.

131
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,583
I'm gonna marry her.

132
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,708
I just need to save her first.

133
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,791
-Do you know where they took her?
-Cayenne.

134
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,291
Where in Cayenne?

135
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,666
Coq Dew, or Coq Down…

136
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,166
Something like that.

137
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,666
You pathetic son of a bitch.

138
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:55,833
I'm going after her.

139
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,083
A coward.

140
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,583
Like all your friends.

141
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:10,625
You can't even save yourself.

142
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,708
IT WAS THE END, WHAT ELSE WAS LEFT?

143
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,916
I can't believe we made it.

144
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,208
We made it.

145
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,458
How did you even find me here?

146
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,083
I went to Belém to look for you.

147
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,583
I met two girls.

148
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,041
One ended up dead,
and the other was taken.

149
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,333
-Taken?
-Yes.

150
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:23,041
-Who took her?
-I don't really know.

151
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,625
She was at the party.

152
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,041
Do you remember her?

153
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,125
-Janalice.
-Janalice?

154
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,708
-Yeah.
-She's my friend.

155
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,791
She gave me these earrings.

156
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,750
We were together.

157
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,791
And she had no one else.

158
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,625
Is she gonna be okay?

159
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,791
I hope so.

160
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:57,750
I'm glad you're here.

161
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,458
I'm glad you're here.

162
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,000
I can't believe you found me.

163
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,958
Do you like the sea?

164
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,708
In Guiana, we say lanmè.

165
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,291
In the feminine.

166
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:33,291
The sea is a woman.

167
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,875
A beautiful

168
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:38,958
woman

169
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:43,250
who lures and swallows many sailors.

170
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,125
That's called power.

171
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:55,125
Instead of suffering for being beautiful,
she uses her beauty

172
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:56,916
to overpower men.

173
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,958
On land, the more men you overpower,

174
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,375
the freer and richer you'll be.

175
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,000
But you gotta enjoy it while you can.

176
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,041
In this business, after a few years,
sailors will think you're too old.

177
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,500
But by then,

178
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:20,708
you'll already have made a lot of money.

179
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,375
You'll like Cayenne.

180
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:40,625
Where you came from,
you've never seen this kind of luxury.

181
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,541
If you had stayed there…

182
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,666
they would've eaten you alive.

183
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,250
You can dream big now.

184
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,541
I'm speaking from experience.

185
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,208
CAYENNE
[FRENCH GUIANA]

186
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,541
Good evening.

187
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,708
Gentlemen and gentlemen,

188
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,291
I'd like to introduce you to Jane,

189
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,750
the new star of Coq d'Or.

190
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,416
Take a good look at her.

191
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,666
Take…

192
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,041
What are you doing?

193
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,208
Walk!

194
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,375
Step into the light.

195
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,166
Look at the tables.

196
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,375
Smile.

197
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,583
Smile!

198
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,125
That's it. Gracefully. Again.

199
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,875
I'd like to introduce you to Jane.

200
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,083
What the hell? What are you doing?

201
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:54,541
I explained everything.

202
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:55,958
What are you doing?

203
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,083
Smile.

204
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,666
The new star of the Coq d'Or.

205
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,916
Go on, raise your head.

206
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,958
More fire, more attitude, more sensuality.

207
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,166
Let this gorgeous hair down.

208
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,625
That young face, barely ripe.

209
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,458
Toss your hair over.

210
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,000
Go on. Again.

211
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,541
Toss your hair. I want to see it.

212
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,541
Hair! Waist!

213
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,500
Now sexiness.

214
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,333
Again. Walk. Go on.

215
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,541
Go on. Smile.

216
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,958
Again. Smile.

217
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,000
Again.

218
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,208
Pssica.

219
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,208
Gentlemen and gentlemen.

220
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,791
I'd like to introduce you

221
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,083
to the new star of the Coq d'Or.

222
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,416
Coming straight from Brazil,

223
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,916
Jane!

224
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,916
Unfortunately, she's already booked.

225
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,291
Our dear ambassador,
who needs no introduction,

226
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,875
has booked her indefinitely.

227
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,750
We're not going to break
our democratic tradition.

228
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,833
Thursdays are sacred, aren't they?

229
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,000
It's auction day.

230
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,583
The highest bidder is the winner.

231
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,250
But today's not Thursday, so…

232
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,041
Please.

233
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,958
FRESH MEAT. THE PRETTIEST OF THEM ALL.

234
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,833
Hey, you can't sleep here.

235
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,916
They're unloading here. Move.

236
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,500
Move!

237
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,375
Go on. Move.

238
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,041
Comrade?

239
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,291
What are you doing here?

240
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,750
Comrade.

241
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,458
For fuck's sake, Cristóbal!

242
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,666
Think it through.

243
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,791
You're gonna get in trouble.

244
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,208
You don't even know this girl.

245
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,833
It's my fault she's here.

246
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,458
We're connected somehow.

247
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,458
So call the police
and let them solve the problem, not you.

248
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,208
You know they're useless.

249
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,750
Do you know a place called
Coq Dew, or Coq Down?

250
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,416
That's not how you say it.

251
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,916
Is anyone there?

252
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,333
Look…

253
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,583
if you're thinking
of using violence to get inside,

254
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:25,666
I'm not going.

255
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,708
I'm not. I made a promise and so did you.

256
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:30,541
I know.

257
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,750
It has to be without violence.

258
00:20:37,791 --> 00:20:39,833
Is there another entrance over there?

259
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,541
Get the fuck out of there!

260
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,458
What are you doing? Let me through!

261
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,708
Why is this wall sealed up?

262
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,666
A girl once got out through there.

263
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:33,166
Now there's just the front entrance,
but there are guards.

264
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,083
And there are guards inside too.

265
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,333
What's behind this wall?

266
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,750
Look, comrade, what you do with your life
is none of my business.

267
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,291
It's not my place to judge you.

268
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,541
Quite the opposite, I need your help.

269
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,083
Those are the girls' rooms.

270
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:06,041
There's a window

271
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,375
to the patio,
and the patio is behind this wall.

272
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,541
That's the owner playing golf.

273
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,791
-Good.
-Is it?

274
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,333
Do you play golf too?

275
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,000
Gaspar. Get this.

276
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,833
Is this a quiet street?

277
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,375
It is, why?

278
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,833
No reason.

279
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,666
Just asking.

280
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,250
What are you thinking?

281
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:53,875
Remember the operation in Cúcuta?

282
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,375
That was a classy operation.

283
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:01,833
Wow!

284
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:05,125
No one was injured.

285
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:09,083
Not a single damn shot fired.

286
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,333
And we got the commander.

287
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,416
You went in first,
dressed as an army lieutenant.

288
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Remember?

289
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:23,625
Okay, so we might have an option here.

290
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,250
Go on.

291
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:33,583
But I don't get it.
Do you play golf or not?

292
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,083
Nice! But there's no such thing in Creole.

293
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,791
Fire is pronounced feu.

294
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:49,125
Feu. F-E-U.

295
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:50,250
Feu.

296
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,541
Try again.

297
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,625
On your ass.

298
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,916
Fire on your ass.

299
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,083
Want some?

300
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:14,958
Cof-fee?

301
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,000
Want… some coffee?

302
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,875
He doesn't speak Portuguese?

303
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:35,291
Him?

304
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,458
He can barely speak Creole.

305
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,666
Can I have some?

306
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,833
You look like a dry-ass fuck,
don't you, asshole?

307
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,125
Have you ever tried getting out of here?

308
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:30,333
Just pretend
you're teaching me to make coffee.

309
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,291
Rafa tried and got fucked up.

310
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:39,041
How about you?
Didn't even make it past the hallway.

311
00:25:39,875 --> 00:25:41,375
We've all tried.

312
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:46,500
Pour the water slowly and move it around.

313
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:48,708
Then put it in the thermos.

314
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,125
I'm getting too old for these fuckers.

315
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,583
I'm counting the days until I turn 25.

316
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:01,125
You're lucky the diplomat chose you.

317
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,833
You won't suffer as much.

318
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,375
This wall here faces a building,

319
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:29,750
but it's got barbed wire all along it.

320
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,041
Okay.

321
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:33,500
And this is the room where she is.

322
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:35,166
They call it the Princess Room.

323
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,583
-Are there any guards on the patio?
-No.

324
00:26:38,166 --> 00:26:40,708
Patio is closed off.
That's where we were before.

325
00:26:40,791 --> 00:26:42,500
The owner plays golf here.

326
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,291
All right.

327
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:48,083
We have three days until the auction.

328
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:50,041
It'll work.

329
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,291
How much do you think you need to win it?

330
00:26:56,375 --> 00:26:58,666
I've seen men pay 15,000 euros for a girl.

331
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,958
Holy shit.

332
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:03,416
I have some money saved, but…

333
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,666
No, it's not necessary.

334
00:27:07,416 --> 00:27:09,750
All I've got left is 30,000.

335
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,291
I just need a little to buy some stuff.

336
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,708
Thirty thousand?

337
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,166
We can get in through the window?

338
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,375
Oh, no. The windows are too narrow.

339
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,958
THE CURRENT IS STRONG HERE.

340
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,166
The important thing is that they think
she's the one who hits me, okay?

341
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,916
Otherwise, they'll kill me.

342
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,208
Comrade.

343
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,666
Look at me. They'll kill me.

344
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:03,250
I'm only doing this for you, okay?

345
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,666
-Take care.
-Yes. I know.

346
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:13,625
Hey!

347
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:18,041
I'm coming. I'll be right there.

348
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,708
Thanks.

349
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:50,625
How's it going?

350
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,916
Good evening!

351
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,166
Good evening.

352
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,500
Son of a bitch!

353
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,916
…who needs no introduction.

354
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:54,125
The star of Coq d'Or.

355
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,916
I'd like to introduce you to Jane!

356
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:02,791
The new star of Coq d'Or!

357
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,916
Ready to place your bids?

358
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,625
Yes!

359
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,583
-One grand!
-Starting at one grand.

360
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:25,458
-Fifteen hundred!
-Fifteen hundred.

361
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:27,708
-Eighteen hundred!
-Two grand.

362
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,625
Two grand.

363
00:31:29,708 --> 00:31:32,541
-Hottie!
-Yes! One of our regular clients.

364
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:35,208
He knows what he's doing.

365
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,125
But she's worth more!

366
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,208
We're at 2,000. Anyone else?

367
00:31:39,291 --> 00:31:40,208
Three grand!

368
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,541
Three grand.

369
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:44,666
Now that's a big move, huh?

370
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,500
Three grand for the diplomat
who knows what he's doing.

371
00:31:47,583 --> 00:31:49,375
-Oh là là!
-Four grand!

372
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:51,291
Four grand!

373
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:06,291
Anyone else?

374
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,666
-4,500!
-4,500.

375
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,875
Five grand!

376
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:12,125
Five grand!

377
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,458
Anyone else?

378
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,416
We're at 5,000.

379
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,375
We're at 5,000.

380
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:20,583
Anyone else?

381
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:32,333
Anyone else?

382
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:33,875
We're at 5,000.

383
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:35,666
Interesting.

384
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,291
Interesting.

385
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,250
Five thousand is the price to win Jane.

386
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:42,958
Pará's delight.

387
00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:48,083
Well, it seems
we've reached our limit for now.

388
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:51,416
But as I've told you before,
gentlemen, she'll be back.

389
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,791
So going once…

390
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,666
-Going twice…
-I'll give you ten!

391
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:58,916
Excuse me?

392
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,416
Ten grand.

393
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,125
It seems we have a new bidder.

394
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,375
Thirteen grand.

395
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:28,708
Thirteen thousand?

396
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:29,875
Twenty!

397
00:33:33,458 --> 00:33:34,458
Twenty grand.

398
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:45,166
-We're at 20,000--
-Twenty-five, and that's it.

399
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:49,125
Going once, twice, thrice, sold!

400
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,750
Congratulations!

401
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:54,958
-I have more money! Wait!
-To our successful businessman!

402
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,791
I have more money! Wait!

403
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:15,916
A pillar of our community.
You deserve the princess of pleasure.

404
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,125
Tell him to get back. I have more money.

405
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:19,916
Hey! I have more money.

406
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,208
Tell him to get her back.

407
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,833
Relax, monsieur Preá. It'll be fine.

408
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:25,166
It's Jonas.

409
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,458
Jonas, let's talk somewhere more private?

410
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:29,958
All right.

411
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,000
Put the club down!

412
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,291
Oh, it feels so good…

413
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,375
After what you cost me in Breves,

414
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:13,750
how stupid do you have to be
to show up at my home and challenge me?

415
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:17,708
I just came for Janalice.

416
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,708
Relax, I'm not doing anything.

417
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,625
I'm here to help you. Relax.

418
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:39,583
Mari! Comrade!

419
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:50,166
Mari?

420
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,041
Mariangel…

421
00:36:00,583 --> 00:36:03,833
Do you really think you can buy Janalice
with so little money?

422
00:36:03,916 --> 00:36:06,166
It's a lot more
than what you paid Zé Elídio.

423
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,375
She's worth a lot more.
And I'm not as dumb as Zé Elídio.

424
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:12,791
I have more.

425
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,333
I don't have it with me now.

426
00:36:16,416 --> 00:36:19,958
But I have more.
I can bring it here whenever you want.

427
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:23,000
You're not getting out alive, mon cher.

428
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:25,041
Unless you pay ransom now.

429
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:27,458
I've given you all I have!
I'll bring the rest!

430
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,041
You have that ring.

431
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,041
What about the ring?

432
00:36:35,125 --> 00:36:36,750
It was my father's.

433
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,458
He gave it to me. It's a family heirloom.

434
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,083
Everyone knows Tabaco's ring story.

435
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:53,125
Mariangel…

436
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:09,333
Now, take that ring off your finger.

437
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:13,208
Let me see if it's worth
as much as they say.

438
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:21,125
Well, you can take it off your finger
and give it to me.

439
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,666
Or I can take it off myself

440
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,083
after one of my associates
is done with you.

441
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:55,625
Look at that.

442
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,833
Gaspar!

443
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,166
What happened, comrade?

444
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:23,166
And the girl?

445
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,583
Where is the girl?

446
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:28,708
-Gone.
-What? What do you mean, "gone"?

447
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:29,791
Gone!

448
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,541
-Where?
-Gone!

449
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:32,666
-Gone?
-Gone!

450
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:35,583
That way!

451
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:53,166
Tonight, I want full service, okay?

452
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,458
SOS - EMERGENCY CALL

453
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:07,666
Cayenne Fire Department.
What's your emergency?

454
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,333
Fire!

455
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,500
Fire. Le Coq d'Or.

456
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Help.

457
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,000
Fire!

458
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,625
Hey! Come here.

459
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:27,666
You have to help me get through
that guy at the door. Look.

460
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,958
Look. That one.

461
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,500
You distract him, and I'll get out, okay?

462
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:40,041
Come. We're leaving together.

463
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:41,875
-Hey, stop!
-Fuck!

464
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:43,916
-I'm taking her! Move!
-Stop!

465
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:52,000
Get out, damn it! Come!

466
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,291
-Move!
-Go! Run!

467
00:39:53,375 --> 00:39:55,333
-Run, girl!
-Go!

468
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,416
Jana!

469
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,333
Move! Get out of my way!

470
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,708
Hey! We fucking did it!

471
00:40:20,791 --> 00:40:21,958
What are you doing?

472
00:40:22,041 --> 00:40:24,333
Don't you see I did all of this for you?

473
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:26,583
Hey, look at me! I'm here to save you!

474
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:28,208
Let's go!

475
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:29,416
Hey, Philippe!

476
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:30,916
Let's go!

477
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,541
I love you, damn it!

478
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:33,625
I'm here for you.

479
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:36,166
-Are you crazy?
-I'll make you the happiest woman.

480
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,833
I don't want anything from any man!
Get the fuck away!

481
00:40:38,916 --> 00:40:39,958
Janalice!

482
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:41,666
Get back! Get away from her!

483
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:43,458
I'm taking her with me.

484
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,750
-Easy.
-Move! Get away from her!

485
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,833
I'm taking her.
I fucking told you already.

486
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:49,916
Put the gun down.

487
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:51,833
Come, Jana.

488
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:55,208
-No. Stay close. Stay by my side.
-You belong to me.

489
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,666
-Come, Janalice.
-Look at me. Stay here.

490
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,583
-If you go, I'll kill you.
-Stay here!

491
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:15,958
-The girls have left!
-Come, Janalice.

492
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,875
-Get the girls!
-Come!

493
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:18,833
Get them!

494
00:41:18,916 --> 00:41:19,875
Come!

495
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,000
Get on.

496
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,458
Pssica!

497
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,083
Go!

498
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:30,250
Let's go.

499
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,625
THANK YOU FOR VISITING GUIANA

500
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:19,416
…to free the youth, my Lord,

501
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,000
from the claws of the Devil.

502
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,541
They have lost the ability
to discern what is right.

503
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:36,541
Go.

504
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,041
Go.

505
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:58,875
Go home.

506
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:06,750
Sweetheart?

507
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,250
Father, we ask You for deliverance.

508
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:13,416
Lord, we pray that You may clear the way…

509
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,333
THAT IMMENSE FOREST RUSHED BY

510
00:44:32,541 --> 00:44:35,500
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING

511
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:39,875
NOW

512
00:44:39,958 --> 00:44:41,458
SAFE

513
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,375
Pssica.

514
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:56,375
IF YOU OR ANYONE YOU KNOW
IS EXPERIENCING SEXUAL ABUSE, SEEK HELP.
