00:00:17,166 --> 00:00:19,666
RIVERS OF FATE

2
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:23,500
Relax, my friend. Relax.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,416
That's just how kids are.
They vanish and do these things.

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,875
Here. She's smiling in this one.

5
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,458
Here. Look.

6
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,416
-Listen, if you see her around…
-Sure.

7
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:39,958
Pedro.

8
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,583
Have you checked her social media?

9
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:46,333
We told her to delete them
and her phone stayed back home.

10
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,750
Damn it, Pedro.

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,416
These days,
people post everything on social media.

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,583
You can't just erase evidence like that.

13
00:00:53,666 --> 00:00:55,333
-Fuck this.
-You need to stay calm.

14
00:00:55,416 --> 00:00:58,708
We can't think straight
when we're all worked up.

15
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:01,458
If you see this girl,
stop her for God's sake.

16
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:03,625
What's your name?

17
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,666
Hey. I need to know your name.

18
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,958
Save me, please.

19
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,416
Let's go, Preá.

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,958
-You gonna pretend you like pussy now?
-Let's go!

21
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,750
-We're late already.
-Ouch!

22
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:19,750
The others are loaded. She's the last one.

23
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,166
-How much do you want for her?
-Wake up, man.

24
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:25,583
-I want her. I'm taking her.
-This is top-shelf material.

25
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,666
-She's not for you. Not for anyone here!
-Easy with her!

26
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,458
-Your job is just to take her.
-Quiet!

27
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:33,333
-Let's go!
-Easy with her, man!

28
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:36,625
-Let go of me! Damn it!
-You got that, Preá?

29
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,250
No!

30
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,833
-Let's go, Player.
-Piss off, you annoying piece of shit.

31
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:46,166
Hey, Gigante.
Sorry to hear about your brother.

32
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,666
-I'll pray for that motherfucker's soul.
-Go fuck yourself!

33
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:10,750
On the fucking ground!

34
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,416
You motherfucker!

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,875
Move!

36
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,541
Get fucking moving!

37
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:21,666
-Want to play tough, little bitch?
-Get down, tough guy!

38
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,208
And keep your eyes open!

39
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,541
You wanted this? Now you're gonna get it.

40
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,541
Are you sure he's one of Tabaco's guys?

41
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,500
I am, Mrs. Mariangel.

42
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,875
But don't worry.
I'll find where those fuckers are hiding.

43
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,583
And do what?

44
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:22,666
No.

45
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:28,541
I'll go to Belém and talk to the police.

46
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,750
Let go of this revenge nonsense.

47
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,416
Why should I, Mrs. Mariangel?

48
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,208
You think those cops give a damn about us?

49
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,500
They might even arrest you
for killing this fucker.

50
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,250
Then what?

51
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,791
THERE WAS NO COMFORT

52
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:50,291
Pass me some of that booze.

53
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:10,625
We have to go back
and kill that Spanish woman.

54
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:14,000
But first we need to teach that bitch
how to be a real woman.

55
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:16,958
Her pussy must be missing some action.

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,166
I'll talk to the boss.

57
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,625
Go talk to him now.
The boss is down there.

58
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:26,541
-Preá is your boss? Since when?
-Isn't Preá in charge?

59
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:27,625
Your boss is Tabaco.

60
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:29,833
He's the one who put Preá in charge.

61
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:55,666
What's your name?

62
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,083
I need to know your name.

63
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,666
Your name. Tell me.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,041
Janalice.

65
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,166
Janalice.

66
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,166
My dad doesn't have money for ransom.

67
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,833
You're so pretty.

68
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,333
I can get you out of here.
Do you want me to?

69
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,291
Promise?

70
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,083
I promise. I'm gonna take you home.

71
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,791
Hey.

72
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,833
It's just a picture. To save you.

73
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:44,791
You're so pretty.

74
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,375
Damn.

75
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,125
Move, Preá!

76
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,541
Enough jerking off. It's my turn now.

77
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,708
Hey, listen up.

78
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,583
No one touches those girls, all right?

79
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:10,875
No one!

80
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,791
-What are you saying?
-You heard me!

81
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,208
Touch any of them
and I'll put a bullet in you!

82
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,208
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

83
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,500
And who do you think you are
to bark orders?

84
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,791
I'm your fucking boss.

85
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,958
If you'd followed my orders,
your brother would still be here.

86
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,041
-It was your fault!
-The cops.

87
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:30,333
-I'll kill you, motherfucker!
-The fucking cops!

88
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,166
Cut it out! The cops!

89
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,166
Cut it out!

90
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,791
You want to die, motherfucker?

91
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,958
Cut it out, damn it!
It's the fucking cops!

92
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:49,041
What's up, boss?

93
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,500
MARAJÓ ISLAND
[PARÁ]

94
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,833
Stop.

95
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,166
Who's in charge here?

96
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,541
Where's Zé Elídio?

97
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,041
I need to talk to him.

98
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,666
It's about one of the girls.

99
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,833
Come.

100
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,583
Move.

101
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,875
I need to talk to him. It's urgent.

102
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,833
Now clear out, all of you.

103
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:42,041
Don't worry, Janalice.

104
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,666
-Etelvina?
-Go! Move!

105
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,541
What's so funny?

106
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,041
Move, Gigante.

107
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:54,250
Move.

108
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:56,458
Move, damn it.

109
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:02,250
"I need to talk to Zé Elídio."

110
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,708
"I need to talk to him about something."

111
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,583
Move! Hurry up.

112
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,916
IT HAD TO BE A MISTAKE.

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,416
Move, Indian girl! Hurry up.

114
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,791
You have to stay calm, Pedro.

115
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,875
You and everyone here.

116
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,875
-What about your friends in the police?
-You know me.

117
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,875
I never had many friends
when I was on the force.

118
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,333
Now that I'm retired, I have none.

119
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,750
-Something here got to her.
-Here?

120
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,625
No, not in my place.

121
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:49,916
I may have given her a scolding.
No big deal.

122
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,666
I don't mean you.

123
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,958
-What did you do to her?
-Pedro!

124
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,583
-Tell me!
-Pedro!

125
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,708
-Stop, Pedro!
-Get off!

126
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,500
-What did you do to her?
-I didn't do anything.

127
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,583
I know a lot of motherfuckers like you.

128
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,625
Are you talking or not?

129
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,541
She came on to me, damn it!

130
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,125
-She did what?
-What? She did what, Ramiro?

131
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,083
She's just a girl, Ramiro! How could you?

132
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:20,166
Go home. I'll take a look around.
She's not coming back here.

133
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,333
-Get out of my house!
-To hell with you!

134
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:26,708
I lost a damn good man
'cause you wanted to get drunk

135
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,541
in the middle of the fucking night?

136
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,125
Joelinton was my brother, boss.

137
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,750
We gotta go back there and get even.

138
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,250
I should kill you.

139
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:47,625
And avenge your brother,
you fucking worthless thug.

140
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,291
If you don't want to help, then fuck it.

141
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,791
Now don't you forget.

142
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,375
My brother's dead
'cause of that pussy son of yours.

143
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,291
You know what you're doing, Gigante?

144
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,916
You're going to Tucuruí.
Far away from here.

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,333
Stay with your whore there
and only come back when I tell you to.

146
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,208
Run your mouth at me one more time.

147
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,958
-Go fuck yourself!
-Run it.

148
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,875
You can all go fuck yourselves.

149
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,333
And you two?

150
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,916
You want to fuck around like rookies?

151
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,208
Then go do some fucking rookie work.

152
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:27,250
Go wash the boat! Go, damn it!

153
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:28,916
Let's go, Player.

154
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,666
You gotta be a fucking leader
so this kind of shit doesn't happen!

155
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,500
Didn't I get the job done?

156
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,458
Weren't the girls delivered?

157
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,541
Yeah.

158
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,083
-Aren't they?
-Yeah.

159
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,875
I need to talk to you about something.

160
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:55,916
I need to buy that girl. From the cargo.

161
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,458
I need money.

162
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,375
You know why I never got
this shit polished?

163
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:04,708
Huh?

164
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:08,625
It was the first one I shoved up my ass so
I wouldn't get robbed at the gold mines.

165
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:12,291
You don't know the gold mine grind.
Catching malaria, getting robbed.

166
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,875
I went through all of that shit

167
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,250
so you wouldn't have to, damn it.

168
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,166
Here.

169
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,875
Go fuck all the whores you want.

170
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,625
Clear your mind, Jonas.

171
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,708
But first,
go wash the boat like I told you.

172
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,291
-Take care.
-Thanks, man.

173
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,291
Good luck out there, bro.

174
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,125
Get it nice and clean.

175
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,833
I'm taking one of these to my girl.

176
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,791
Don't get jealous, Preá.

177
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:58,625
Maybe one day you'll get to fuck
that little bitch of yours.

178
00:13:58,708 --> 00:13:59,708
Pssica!

179
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,208
Pssica!

180
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,958
Pssica!

181
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,041
-Have you seen this girl?
-Pssica.

182
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:18,500
Pssica.

183
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,750
Have you seen this girl, ma'am?

184
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,208
-No. I'm sorry.
-All right. Thank you.

185
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,708
Have you seen this girl?

186
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,875
Have you seen her?

187
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:31,500
Jair, I'm helping a friend find this girl.

188
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,458
She's 16, white, light eyes.

189
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,750
Thanks.

190
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,250
Pretty girl. Downtown.
Her parents are desperate.

191
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,208
Jana?

192
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,916
Get me Camões' number.

193
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,916
Hey. Have you seen this girl around?

194
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,333
No, I haven't.

195
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,416
-Have you seen her? Are you sure?
-I haven't.

196
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,250
Jana?

197
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,791
Sorry, miss.

198
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,458
My friend!

199
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,833
-No. I've never seen her.
-Okay.

200
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:58,875
-Thanks
-I know her, sir.

201
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,791
She hangs out with that crazy girl.

202
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,916
-What crazy girl?
-See that boy over there?

203
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,250
Yeah.

204
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,333
He also hangs out with the crazy girl.

205
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,708
-Hey! Easy!
-Let me go!

206
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,250
-Easy, boy.
-Get off!

207
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,833
I just want to talk about this girl.

208
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,375
Relax, no one's out to get you.

209
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,791
You look like a cop.

210
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:34,416
That's because I used to be one.

211
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,666
I'm not anymore. I'm retired.
I don't arrest people anymore, you know?

212
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,958
Are you her aunt's boyfriend?

213
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,666
You think I'd be out there
with a girlfriend at my age?

214
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,166
There are lots of old men
with young girls out there.

215
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,541
Yes, but I'm not one of those old men.

216
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:54,250
I'm just looking for Janalice.

217
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,916
She's my goddaughter.

218
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,916
I'm looking for someone too.

219
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,250
Who?

220
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,333
My sister, Luzia.

221
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,125
I was thinking,

222
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:13,250
if you help me find my sister,
I'll help you find Jana.

223
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,166
Of course I'll help you.

224
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:16,875
Do we have a deal?

225
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,208
Do we?

226
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,333
Dessert?

227
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:25,833
Didi lives over there.

228
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,458
Does her mother know you?

229
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,541
Stay here then.

230
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,125
Wait for me here.

231
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,791
Huh! Never seen her face.

232
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,916
She's friends with your daughter.

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,083
Can I talk to her?

234
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:45,333
What daughter? I don't have a daughter.

235
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,375
Dionete, ma'am.

236
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,916
She's her daughter.
God forbid I had that daughter.

237
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,208
Your goddaughter is her friend?
She's already on the wrong path.

238
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:55,250
Can I talk to her? My goddaughter's gone.
Maybe she saw something.

239
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:58,208
She hasn't been home
in God knows how long.

240
00:16:58,291 --> 00:17:01,000
And this one cries
'cause she's always vanishing like that.

241
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,250
And you two are always fighting.

242
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,541
-We don't.
-You know…

243
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,500
Hi, Di.

244
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,000
Hi.

245
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:18,458
Did you know
that Jana has an uncle who's a cop?

246
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,291
-A cop?
-Yeah.

247
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,333
He's looking for her.

248
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,541
Get in, kid.

249
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:26,250
-Have you seen Janalice?
-Get in.

250
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,583
Get in, and I'll take you to Janalice.

251
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,625
-Did you do something to her?
-I didn't.

252
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,250
-Did you do something to my friend?
-I didn't. Get in.

253
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,750
Did you do something to her?

254
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,750
-I'll just go get him.
-Hey, kid!

255
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,458
-Hey, kid! Get in now!
-Run, Miltinho!

256
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,250
-Hey, kid! Get off!
-Run, Miltinho!

257
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,958
Any news, man? I got nothing here.
I've tried everywhere.

258
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,541
School, church, her friends.
No one knows where she is.

259
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,375
I'm worried, man. Call me back.

260
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,416
Where is that boy?

261
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,458
I apologize for the state

262
00:18:18,291 --> 00:18:20,291
of your accommodations.

263
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,750
But this is temporary.

264
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,666
In a few days,
you'll all be going to a beautiful place.

265
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,750
And life will be great.

266
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,708
Hear that, baby?

267
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:39,250
Juicy legs and wild cat eyes.

268
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:43,250
Look at me, baby. Look here.

269
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,833
Really good job… this time.

270
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:51,708
They're incredible.

271
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,583
You're beautiful, baby.

272
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,875
And these earrings?

273
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,125
Don't take them.

274
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,041
Please.

275
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,500
I won't take them.

276
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:41,291
They're very pretty.

277
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,291
If you behave,

278
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,791
your life will be better than the others.

279
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,583
You…

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,625
You were one of us, weren't you?

281
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,041
Let's get these nails done.
They're terrible.

282
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,458
Zé Elídio likes pretty painted nails.

283
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,666
I LOVE YOU

284
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,666
SMILE AND CARRY ON

285
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,125
Damn, baby girl.

286
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:02,625
You look beautiful.

287
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,208
I'm gonna give you
all the best things in life, baby.

288
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,833
You're gonna like it.

289
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:22,041
You're mine.

290
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,416
Come here.

291
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,000
Come over here.

292
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,291
-I'm gonna show you the good stuff.
-Get off!

293
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,458
-Come here.
-Get off!

294
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,416
No!

295
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,458
Come.

296
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,125
SHE CLOSED HER EYES.

297
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:44,708
SHE CRIED IN ANGER.

298
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,125
You didn't really think
a filthy Indian like you

299
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,708
would last long
in the boss's bed, did you?

300
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:12,916
In the kitchen first thing
tomorrow morning, Luzia.

301
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,708
Jana?

302
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,291
Janalice?

303
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,125
Jana?

304
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
I have to go.

305
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,750
Then this tragedy happens.

306
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,791
She had been missing for days, ma'am?

307
00:23:00,875 --> 00:23:04,166
She was such a good girl.
She was the light of our home.

308
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,958
A happy, fun girl.
We were desperately looking for her.

309
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:09,375
DIONETE ARAÚJO FOUND DEAD
IN TELÉGRAFO DISTRICT

310
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:12,541
Then we were informed
of the tragedy that happened to her.

311
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:17,166
Residents found her body
in the Telégrafo district of Belém,

312
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,416
and called the police,
who have yet to respond…

313
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:33,833
Is that your daughter?

314
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,125
PARÁ RIVER POLICE STATION

315
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,208
No.

316
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,375
Goddaughter.

317
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,333
She went missing
and I'm trying to find her.

318
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,458
At least there's still hope for you.

319
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,041
That's true.

320
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:06,750
What about you, ma'am?

321
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,083
My son.

322
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,000
My husband.

323
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,875
My life.

324
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,791
I'm sorry.

325
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,000
Please.

326
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:46,958
Thank you.

327
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,541
Mrs. Mariangel,
I'm not saying I don't believe you.

328
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,500
I don't know
where you got this information.

329
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:59,791
But Tabaco's gang
is a huge criminal organization.

330
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,166
They target boats carrying electronics.

331
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,250
Robbing a grocery store
doesn't seem like them.

332
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:07,750
They are the killers.

333
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,375
I understand, ma'am.

334
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,833
I really do.

335
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,625
But even if we could arrest
these criminals,

336
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,416
which I don't think would be easy,

337
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,375
how would we be able to prove
they killed your family?

338
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:24,500
Are you…

339
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:26,250
Are you telling me

340
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,666
there will be no justice
for my son and my husband?

341
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,041
What if I bring you a witness?

342
00:25:40,916 --> 00:25:44,041
Someone who recognized one of them.
The one who died.

343
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:47,458
One of them died?

344
00:25:48,083 --> 00:25:50,416
And you know where the body is, ma'am?

345
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,416
Who killed this criminal?

346
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,666
Why would you want to know?

347
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:01,375
Does this son of a bitch
deserve the justice

348
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,875
that my son and my husband will never get?

349
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:08,875
Mrs. Mariangel,
I really want to help you. I really do.

350
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,875
You have no idea how many cases
with witnesses that saw…

351
00:26:20,916 --> 00:26:23,583
Hey, Amadeu. It's been ages.

352
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,958
What happened, Camões?
Couldn't you help her?

353
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:28,833
I tried, my friend.
But there are things we can't say.

354
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:32,000
So that bastard Tabaco is still alive.

355
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:34,000
And still active.

356
00:26:34,666 --> 00:26:39,000
He's hiding in this hellhole near Breves.

357
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,416
But, you know, now he steals,

358
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,708
and the guy who got robbed
just cashes in the insurance

359
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:47,833
and buys his stuff back from Tabaco
for half the price.

360
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:50,083
This is Brazil.

361
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,958
Tired of your retirement?

362
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,125
What favors do you want from me this time?

363
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:00,791
My goddaughter.

364
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:04,916
She went missing near downtown
and her parents are desperate.

365
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm trying to find her,
but it's been hard.

366
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:10,666
The friend who was always with her

367
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,875
was found dead.

368
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:16,666
A murder could mean
it was a kidnapping, couldn't it?

369
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,416
This is the River Crimes Division,
my friend.

370
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,208
I know, Camões.

371
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:26,208
I look after rivers, not streets.

372
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:28,041
But tell me, what can I do for you?

373
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:30,833
You know I don't have
many friends here, right?

374
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:32,916
So I was thinking…

375
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:37,416
maybe you could make a few calls,
pull some strings…

376
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:43,875
and help open the doors for me
at the right division, yeah?

377
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,833
What do you think?

378
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:49,291
What if I lose a friend along the way?

379
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,000
Come on, my friend.

380
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,958
You know I've always been discreet.

381
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,500
Help me out on this one.

382
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:09,583
Sell the house.

383
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,708
Leave all this evil behind,

384
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:17,250
leave this country and come work with me
in the French Guiana.

385
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:21,583
My shop is doing well in Cayenne.

386
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:25,041
Come be my business partner.
You'll have all you need.

387
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,875
Look.

388
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:31,916
My friend…

389
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:37,958
this is the least I could do
for the person who saved my life.

390
00:28:39,166 --> 00:28:40,250
Excuse me.

391
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,833
Chief Camões is a good police officer.

392
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,791
If she didn't tell you the whole story,

393
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,541
it's because she wants to protect you.

394
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,125
But I know where this Tabaco guy is.

395
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:09,583
Where?

396
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,333
On Marajó.

397
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,041
Breves.

398
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,125
Did that man just say
what I think he said?

399
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,291
Mariangel, look. Mariangel.

400
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,958
We made a promise.

401
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:41,791
You made a promise.

402
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,500
Come work with me.

403
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,375
I'll meet you there.

404
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,500
I need to take care of some things here.

405
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,291
What's your name, baby?

406
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:14,708
Huh?

407
00:30:16,541 --> 00:30:17,416
Damn.

408
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:22,958
So I can't even know your name, girl?

409
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,375
Janalice.

410
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:26,791
No.

411
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,083
That's a swear word, not a name.

412
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:33,125
From now on, you're Jane.

413
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,583
My Jane.

414
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,333
From Tarzan, girl.

415
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:42,583
Eat, baby.

416
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:46,083
Go ahead and eat something
because your Tarzan here

417
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:50,500
likes his women with meat
so I can have something to grab on to.

418
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,125
Oh! I'm sorry.

419
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,291
Did he also…

420
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,541
I didn't think they'd bring us here for…

421
00:31:40,708 --> 00:31:42,458
Why else would they bring us here?

422
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:45,625
They take us from our villages.

423
00:31:48,083 --> 00:31:50,458
They said I was lucky I was pretty.

424
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,958
Some luck.

425
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:01,375
You came from far?

426
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,750
I come from Baú.

427
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,041
Look, do you want to go back home?

428
00:32:13,916 --> 00:32:15,625
Because I'm getting out of here.

429
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,333
I'm leaving.

430
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,333
And I need help.

431
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,958
-Will you help me?
-I will.

432
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,333
You have to help me too.

433
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,625
-I promise.
-Do you have somewhere to go?

434
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,375
No. My parents want me gone.

435
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:33,708
But don't worry. I'll figure it out.

436
00:32:34,583 --> 00:32:37,083
Come to my village.
There's a place for you there.

437
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:38,833
I mean it. You'll like it.

438
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:42,458
Let's do it.
We're getting out of here together.

439
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:46,333
I'll let you know when it's time.

440
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,041
Where's that…
Where were you? I was looking for you!

441
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,833
-I know who killed Dionete, come.
-How do you know that?

442
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:56,416
This is his taxi stand.

443
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,791
He's not here.
Maybe he's at the other one.

444
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,291
-What's he like? Tall, short?
-Tall.

445
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,916
Did he give you drugs too?

446
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,750
No, he gave them to Didi.

447
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,500
There. I think that's him.

448
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:09,916
-Easy. Wait up.
-It's the same car.

449
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:12,208
-Neto!
-Geez.

450
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,291
-Hand me that wrench again.
-He's uglier.

451
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,500
I got a nail here.

452
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:20,750
Camões?

453
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,416
Another four went missing this week.
All with the same profile.

454
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,708
I can't give you the case files,
but I left the keys with Mr. Gilmar.

455
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:28,625
Great.

456
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,291
Getting ready for war?

457
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:07,791
You're not going alone.

458
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:11,583
I won't let anyone hurt you.

459
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:14,541
Why?

460
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,500
I know where Tabaco's gang is hiding.

461
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,166
MARAJÓ IS A WORLD.

462
00:35:39,708 --> 00:35:45,416
POLICE STATION

463
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:06,000
MISSING PERSONS

464
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,583
Easy. Come with me.

465
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,375
Come!

466
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,708
What the fuck is this?

467
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,208
We did it.

468
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:26,083
We did it! I can't believe it.

469
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,083
-It worked.
-We did it!

470
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,416
I can't believe it!

471
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:36,125
-We left that nightmare!
-Girl, we did it!

472
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:43,000
Hey, look!

473
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:44,875
-Who's that?
-Think it's from the farm?

474
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:47,125
I don't think so.
It's coming from the other side.

475
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,500
Let's ask for help.

476
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,500
-Must be an outsider.
-We're here.

477
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:53,125
Must be an outsider. This is great.

478
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:55,250
-Whoa.
-Hey!

479
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,541
Hey!

480
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,500
-Over there!
-Hey!

481
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:02,250
-Help!
-Help!

482
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,583
Over here! Help us over here!

483
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,291
Please help us, miss!

484
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:10,708
-They took us and put us in a boat!
-Save us!

485
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:14,000
-We just managed to run away!
-We were kidnapped, miss!

486
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,708
Wait. I'm not getting any of this.
One at a time.

487
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:17,791
Please, save us.

488
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:20,083
Get in the car. Come on.

489
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:22,458
Let's go! She's taking us!

490
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,916
Get in the car! Hurry!

491
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,625
Are you sure no one saw you running off?

492
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,958
I am. They were all sleeping.

493
00:39:33,916 --> 00:39:36,750
I know what I'll do.
I'll take you to my farm.

494
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:41,500
Everyone, keep your heads down
until we get there.

495
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,500
Down! Get down.

496
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,416
Is it here?

497
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:24,833
You fucking bitch! Run, girls!

498
00:40:24,916 --> 00:40:26,291
Run!

499
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,666
Stop!

500
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:40,958
-You weren't supposed to kill her!
-You killed the girl, dumb ass!

501
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,541
What a fucking mess you made!

502
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,250
Fuck!

503
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:56,750
You want to run away, you bitch?

504
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,416
Go! Upstairs!

505
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,458
Upstairs!

506
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:15,375
CHILD SEX-TRAFFICKING ROUTE
ON THE AMAZON BORDER

507
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:04,333
-How did you feel?
-Scared.

508
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:09,041
-Did you like it?
-Yeah!

509
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,416
What are you telling us, Amadeu?

510
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:15,250
-How did you feel?
-Scared.

511
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,416
It's a complicated situation, my dear.

512
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,166
-Did you like it?
-Yeah!

513
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:23,000
She could be in the United States,
in Europe.

514
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:24,500
Nearby in Venezuela.

515
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,958
She's here, Amadeu.

516
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,666
God wouldn't do this to us.

517
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,708
We dug this hole ourselves.

518
00:42:34,958 --> 00:42:36,625
What kind of father was I?

519
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,625
What kind of father am I?

520
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,916
Come on. It's not your fault.

521
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,791
This is my fault. Why, Amadeu?

522
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:47,583
She's an angel, and we lost her.

523
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,583
Forgive me, sweetheart.

524
00:42:49,666 --> 00:42:50,708
My friend.

525
00:42:51,541 --> 00:42:52,458
My dear.

526
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:54,666
We will find her.

527
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,791
Oh, sweetie, please.
I'm so sorry for the kind of father I am.

528
00:43:00,875 --> 00:43:03,541
-I'm sorry.
-We'll find her. Don't lose faith.

529
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:09,875
Still upset?

530
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,500
Just because I scolded you?

531
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,000
I was just thinking.

532
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:17,500
I think I'm entitled
to a share of your money, aren't I?

533
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,000
Where's the green one?

534
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:21,166
The green pod.

535
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,250
Aren't I?

536
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:34,083
If she's with Zé Elídio,
she already has an owner.

537
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,125
-Forget this shit.
-I can't.

538
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,875
I just can't.

539
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,458
Listen to me. Get it together.

540
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:49,875
Pussy isn't for marrying.

541
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,916
Remember what your mother did to me?

542
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:56,958
The only good thing
that came out of that bitch was you.

543
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:07,375
Here. Her name is Janalice.

544
00:44:16,041 --> 00:44:16,875
Okay.

545
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:17,958
And the phone?

546
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,375
Go, Jonas. You have work to do.
The boys are waiting.

547
00:44:23,458 --> 00:44:24,875
I'll give it back after.

548
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,333
It's the Rats.

549
00:44:50,416 --> 00:44:53,166
They must be hiding back there. Let's go.

550
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,375
BREVES
[MARAJÓ ISLAND]

551
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,625
Where are the cookies?

552
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:52,833
Here it goes. It's cold.

553
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:57,541
This is so refreshing.
One more time, please.

554
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:02,666
Jonas?

555
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:06,916
I can't believe it.

556
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,041
Let's start over.

557
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:36,708
The names.

558
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:39,208
You're looking for a bastard
called Gigante.

559
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,333
I sent him away. He's worthless.

560
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:44,125
Gigante?

561
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:46,250
Where have you sent him?

562
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,708
Tucuruí. He has a woman there.

563
00:46:48,791 --> 00:46:52,291
-What woman? What's her name?
-A whore! I don't know!

564
00:46:52,375 --> 00:46:53,250
Yes, you do!

565
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:59,250
The other two. Who are they?

566
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:04,375
Player. But I don't know where he is.

567
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,791
-And the other one?
-There's no one else, damn it.

568
00:47:06,875 --> 00:47:08,333
Yes, there is. Who is he?

569
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:11,083
-There's no one else. I don't know!
-Yes, you do!

570
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,708
Who's the other one?

571
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,375
Look for her!
See if she's hidden somewhere.

572
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:28,833
I'll ask one last time.
Who's the other one?

573
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:31,291
Fuck you, you Spanish bitch!

574
00:47:31,375 --> 00:47:33,541
You can kill me! I'm not telling you shit!

575
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,750
Now get the hell out of here.

576
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,541
I'll pretend I never met you.

577
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,708
The past always comes back, doesn't it?

578
00:48:00,166 --> 00:48:03,041
Mrs. Mariangel, what do we do now?

579
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,166
Let's start with that man Gigante.

580
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:13,666
And the girl?
Do you think she's with the other two?

581
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,500
I'm fairly certain she is.

582
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,458
Just think how desperate
her parents must be.

583
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:25,208
-How did you feel?
-Scared.

584
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:30,416
-Did you like it?
-Yeah!

585
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,208
-How did you feel?
-Scared.

586
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:40,041
-Did you like it?
-Yeah!

587
00:48:41,083 --> 00:48:43,500
I'm sorry for the shitty father you have.

588
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,166
How did you feel?

589
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:50,916
The wind keeps dragging me far

590
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:56,666
Feels like I'm about to crash down

591
00:48:57,666 --> 00:49:02,500
The waves remind me of the sea

592
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:07,750
I think I'm slipping beneath

593
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,875
-Did you like it?
-Yeah!

594
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:12,416
-Was it cool?
-Yeah.

595
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,041
WHERE TO BEGIN?

596
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:30,875
Don't let it drag me down

597
00:49:32,208 --> 00:49:36,916
The wind keeps dragging me far…

598
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:42,458
Hi, baby.

599
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:44,041
My Jane?

600
00:49:44,125 --> 00:49:46,458
I want to get a TV for my mom, okay?

601
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:48,083
Sure, man. You got it.

602
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:57,625
My baby?

603
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,250
How did you feel?

604
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:15,375
Scared.

605
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,083
-Did you like it?
-Yeah!

606
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,208
Are you sleeping, my baby?

607
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:29,583
-How did you feel?
-Scared.

608
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,375
What the fuck? Stop the boat, Jorge.

609
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:36,583
-Did you like it?
-Yeah!

610
00:50:58,083 --> 00:51:00,083
You're not sleeping.

611
00:51:00,583 --> 00:51:02,875
You were just waiting for me.

612
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:21,458
You're pretending to be asleep
for your Zé, aren't you, baby girl?

613
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:35,416
Wake up, baby girl.

614
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:39,625
Come on.

615
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,375
Let's get my dad down.

616
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:46,208
And bury him like he deserves!

617
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:47,875
Come on, guys.

618
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:49,500
Do as Preá says.

619
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:52,416
-You on the jet ski--
-It's Jonas, motherfucker!

620
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:57,875
From now on, call me Jonas!

621
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:01,166
Wake up, sweetheart.

622
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,500
You're Jonas' gang now!

623
00:52:02,583 --> 00:52:04,208
I'M THE MAN NOW.

624
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:08,916
Wake up. Your Zé
is gonna give it to you real nice, okay?

625
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:12,666
We're Jonas' gang, motherfuckers!
Jonas' gang!

626
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,583
Let's go, Jonas' gang!

627
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:24,208
Jonas' gang!

628
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,083
Come here, sweetie.

629
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:33,750
RIVERS OF FATE

BASED ON THE BOOK "PSSICA,"

Subtitle translation by Luciana Nardi

632
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,375
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED.

633
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,875
THIS IS A FICTIONAL WORK.
