00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,333
THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM CONTAINS SCENES
OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:12,916
THAT MAY BE DISTURBING TO SOME VIEWERS.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,333
Pssica!

4
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,833
Come here.

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,333
Come here already. Hurry.

6
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:53,125
Close to me! Come here!

7
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,250
-Wait!
-Don't worry.

8
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,666
-No one will see us here.
-Wait! Take it easy!

9
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,416
Are you scared?

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,875
Stop being such a wuss.

11
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,916
-You're gonna keep filming?
-Relax, Jana.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,291
It's just so
we can watch it together later.

13
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,583
RIVERS OF FATE

14
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,291
SCHOOL BOAT

15
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:42,125
BELÉM CITY HALL

16
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:43,166
Mango?

17
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,500
I like the fruit, but not the juice.

18
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:48,208
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A REGULAR SCHOOL DAY

19
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,416
Look who's just arrived.

20
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:58,000
-Hi, Jana.
-Hi.

21
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,250
-Geez!
-Whoa.

22
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:04,375
Geez.

23
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,625
-That's bold.
-How embarrassing. Seriously.

24
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,166
What's going on?

25
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:23,041
I think she'd say yes, wouldn't she?

26
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,208
Look!

27
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:29,333
Hey!

28
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,083
-Hey!
-Why did you do that?

29
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,916
Me? You're the one who did the sucking.

30
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:41,000
Man, I didn't know
she was into some smacking!

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,500
We can finish this later if you'd like.

32
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:17,416
Water! Water for two reais, everybody!

33
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,708
-They're all trash.
-He took her to the beach.

34
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:23,833
What the hell is this video
you two have been watching all morning?

35
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,166
Some dirty stuff.

36
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,458
At this time? Let me see it.

37
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,041
Here.

38
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,041
He took her to the beach, bro.

39
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,583
And she likes it. Look at that.

40
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,500
-I think she does.
-This one likes to blow.

41
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:48,791
Who is she?

42
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,958
Who sent you this video? Delete it.

43
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,708
-Delete it, son.
-Damn.

44
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:53,791
Please delete it.

45
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,666
-Don't you like it?
-Delete it.

46
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,416
-I'm not your son.
-Delete it.

47
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,875
-Go back to work!
-I'm telling you to delete it!

48
00:03:59,958 --> 00:04:01,875
-Go back to work!
-Get off!

49
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,958
Get off me!

50
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:05,541
Delete the video! Delete it! Get off me!

51
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,875
-Delete the video, you devil!
-Pssica on you!

52
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:10,250
-Give me that phone, punk!
-Pssica!

53
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,166
Pssica!

54
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,625
Is this what we raised you for?

55
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,416
What are you doing, girl?

56
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,375
You're never getting your hands
on this thing again!

57
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,458
Do you hear me?

58
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,041
May God have mercy on you.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,083
Look at me.

60
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,416
Look at me!

61
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,250
You sure know how to raise your head
for something else.

62
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,833
That's enough, Lizete.

63
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,875
Why do I work my ass off
to take care of this house, of you?

64
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,833
Why does your dad work his ass off
working under the sun?

65
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,541
That's right, cry!

66
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,166
Maybe it'll wash away your sins.

67
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,291
Holy fuck!

68
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,041
Hurry, damn it!

69
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,958
Holy fuck.

70
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:00,833
WATER RATS

71
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,416
What the fuck is going on?

72
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:09,250
You know what? Fuck those sons of bitches.

73
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,750
We're back here, motherfucker!

74
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,000
Go to that side. Stay calm!

75
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,541
Easy, everybody!

76
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,750
Turn that shit off!

77
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,833
We're the Rats, motherfucker!

78
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:35,958
Turn that shit off!

79
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,375
Anyone copy?

80
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,375
Cobra Sete. Anyone copy?

81
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,583
Anyone copy? Cobra Sete.

82
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:47,833
Get closer! Go!

83
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:48,958
Closer, damn it!

84
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,750
Anyone copy? Cobra Sete.

85
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,083
Move!

86
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,916
They're getting in, damn it!

87
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:00,791
Move!

88
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,958
Move, damn it!

89
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,541
Get on the fucking floor!

90
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,416
Stop this shit!

91
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,833
-Stop this shit or I'll fuck you up!
-Easy!

92
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:10,541
-Now! Stop this shit!
-Easy!

93
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:14,125
-I'm stopping!
-Want to die?

94
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,333
On the fucking floor! Move, fucker!

95
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,416
-Move!
-Go!

96
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,208
Now, damn it! Are you deaf?

97
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,500
Easy! I'm turning it off.

98
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:25,375
-Shut up!
-Leave it! Give me that fucking shit!

99
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,791
On the fucking floor! Now!

100
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,166
On the ground, you queer!

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
Don't be scared, okay? All right?

102
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,958
It's off, man.

103
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,125
Move! It's over!

104
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:37,833
Look down, fucker!

105
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,625
Give me that, you old hag!

106
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,708
Go! Move, damn it!

107
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,500
Down! On the ground!

108
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,916
Colibri! Take over. I'm going down.

109
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,333
Pass me your fucking phones and wallets!

110
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,500
Move, damn it!

111
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,750
Want to die, fucker?

112
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,708
Please!

113
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,166
-Everybody on the fucking floor!
-Grab it all, damn it!

114
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,083
Give me this purse, you old hag!

115
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,791
Does anyone copy? Are you there, chief?

116
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,166
Get those fucking boxes down there!

117
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,291
Move, damn it!

118
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,250
Fucking hurry! Move!

119
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,750
Hey! Where are you going?

120
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:21,916
Let me see it!
Let me see that, you fucking queer!

121
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,041
No! Please no!

122
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,166
Hey, Gigante!

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,875
Hey, Gigante!

124
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,708
-Damn!
-Check it out.

125
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:32,000
-Holy fuck!
-Check it out.

126
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,458
Let me see this! Fuck!

127
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:34,666
Get the fuck out!

128
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,541
-See what this can do?
-You fucking queer!

129
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:42,625
-What the fuck?
-Just some fun!

130
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,958
You want this one
or the one that shoots milk?

131
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,958
-Go, Gigante. We have a lot to do.
-I'll be quick!

132
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,750
Fuck this! Get out, lady! Go!

133
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:52,375
What the fuck, Preá? Trying to be a hero?

134
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,500
-Fuck you, Gigante!
-Are you the dick patrol now?

135
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:56,416
Fuck, man.

136
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,000
We'll get plenty of young chicks later.

137
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:00,958
That's the cargo today, damn it.

138
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,958
You'll get your tasting, man.

139
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,125
Go! Let's get this over with.

140
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,458
Then we'll have more time with them.

141
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,750
Move!

142
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,625
Hurry, guys! Move!

143
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,125
Hurry up, damn it! Move!

144
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,708
Move!

145
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,500
-Faster, damn it! Move!
-Go!

146
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,666
Fucking hurry!

147
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:21,916
Hurry up, damn it!

148
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:25,291
It's taking too long! Move!

149
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,041
Hurry, Joelinton.

150
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,833
Hurry! Move!

151
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,291
Move.

152
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:41,708
Hey, Preá! Go fuck yourself!

153
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,250
Not like this, you…

154
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,958
Hey!

155
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,333
Stop fooling around.

156
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,583
Oh! You’re into that, huh?

157
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,541
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

158
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,333
Just a little bit.

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,041
Stop.

160
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,458
Fine, but you're gonna get it.

161
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:45,916
What is it, honey?

162
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,000
What's wrong?

163
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:48,958
Your son.

164
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,583
Leave him be.

165
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,000
"Leave him be."

166
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,041
If someone sees what I saw…

167
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,875
They play it safe.

168
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,791
Around here, folks like him
get their asses beat until they die.

169
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,208
Is that what you want?

170
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,458
No.

171
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,083
Isn't that why we're moving to São Paulo?

172
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,375
Leave everything behind
to satisfy his whims, right?

173
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,375
They're not whims, honey.

174
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:17,125
He was born like that.

175
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:28,083
In six months,
I believe we'll have enough.

176
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,291
Hi, Dad. I didn't see you come in.

177
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:38,375
Shouldn't you be helping your mom?

178
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,875
-I asked her, but…
-No, it's fine.

179
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,041
Don't you have to study
for your college exam?

180
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,750
Yeah. I'm just grabbing
something to eat first.

181
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,541
Come give Mom a kiss.

182
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:57,416
Son, come here.

183
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,333
How about we go out
and practice some shooting tomorrow?

184
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,166
-Sure. What time?
-Early in the morning.

185
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,833
Call your buddy Zé do Boi.

186
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,708
-João Mauro!
-They say he's a good shot.

187
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,541
João Mauro, we've talked about that.

188
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,833
-No means no.
-He wants to.

189
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:15,458
No, son. Guns only bring misery.

190
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,583
-And protection too.
-No!

191
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,625
No. You have all the protection
you need with this.

192
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,833
Our Lady of the Rosary of Chiquinquirá.

193
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,458
-Never forget that.
-Don't worry, son.

194
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:31,750
When the bullets start flying,
Our Lady of the Rosary will protect you.

195
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,375
-In Colombia, no one gets gunned down.
-Don't say that!

196
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,375
Don't ever say that!

197
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,208
You know nothing about
how people die in Colombia.

198
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:44,208
-Come on, guys.
-And when someone holds a gun?

199
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,875
A gun to your son's head?
What will you do?

200
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,041
I told you already!

201
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,791
I can teach people
how to defend themselves without guns.

202
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,125
They just have to ask,
and I'll teach them.

203
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,875
Don't play with food.

204
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,375
I'm gonna study, okay?

205
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,791
Do that in front of him
and he'll think his dad's a wimp.

206
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,333
I'm sorry, honey.

207
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,291
Okay. I'm sorry too.

208
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,333
CAYENNE
[FRENCH GUIANA]

209
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,791
Boss!

210
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,500
Duck or fish?

211
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,666
Shrimp.

212
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,125
Torrontés or Muscat?

213
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,083
Mr. Ambassador…

214
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,041
Riesling.

215
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,833
-Ooh la la!
-Come, baby!

216
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,208
I double it.

217
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,708
Has Hao arrived yet?

218
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,250
I'm out.

219
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,166
Me too.

220
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,250
Are you ready?

221
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,291
Fuck!

222
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,458
Not so fast, mate.

223
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,458
-Four of a kind!
-Son of a bitch!

224
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,333
Easy there, Colombian.

225
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,375
Excuse me.

226
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,208
It's all your fault, China.

227
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:44,125
What?

228
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:48,541
Look around.
This place is crawling with cheap whores.

229
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,916
That's not true, Mr. Ambassador.

230
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,583
There's no place in Guyana with women
as beautiful and sweet-smelling as ours.

231
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,083
This is not your Brazil.

232
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,833
No offense, my friend,

233
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,958
but we're talking business here.

234
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,041
Business.

235
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:06,958
Look at those girls.

236
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,916
They're all dark-skinned. Like you.

237
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:15,083
Personally, I have nothing against it.

238
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,708
Quite the contrary.

239
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,625
But where is the diversity?

240
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:25,041
Hao, tell your partner
you need to get white girls.

241
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,583
You don't have to go to Sweden
to get them.

242
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,500
Pará is just around the corner.

243
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,666
WHITE GIRLS. BARELY RIPE.

244
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,375
-Another round?
-Cheers!

245
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,875
Come on, faster.

246
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:39,791
Hurry!

247
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,916
Go on.

248
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,750
Safe travels, my friend.

249
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,416
My fellow brothers and sisters,

250
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:59,666
we must stand strong in our mission

251
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:03,125
to educate and discipline our children.

252
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:06,000
-Praise the Lord!
-Hallelujah!

253
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:08,208
But don't think it'll be easy.

254
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,125
It won't.

255
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:14,708
We, as parents, as parents in Christ,

256
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,583
parents in God,

257
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:21,041
we cannot be led astray
by the pressures of the world.

258
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:22,541
Hallelujah. Amen, Father.

259
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:27,791
Especially by this new
social media technology.

260
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,875
-Praise the Lord.
-Hallelujah.

261
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:34,416
Let us raise our children
in righteousness.

262
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,375
-And guide them down the righteous path.
-Hallelujah, my Lord.

263
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,625
Grounded in God's word.

264
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,583
Praise the Lord.

265
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,291
Let's take action!

266
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,416
Praise the Lord!

267
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,583
Let us cast the Devil out of our homes!

268
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:53,458
Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!

269
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:58,625
Let God guide us through this mission.

270
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,375
Hallelujah!

271
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,500
Praise the Lord!

272
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:04,750
Hallelujah, my Lord!

273
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,291
Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!

274
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,541
Hallelujah!

275
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,416
-How will I get to school?
-We'll manage.

276
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,833
-It's too far.
-We'll see.

277
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,000
Daiane!

278
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:08,375
It's not that.
It's just that I think here…

279
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,958
Can't she stay somewhere else?

280
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,500
It's just until we find a place to move.

281
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,291
Things are complicated there.

282
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:28,000
She can't cook yet,
but it's about time she learns.

283
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,583
-Okay. Fine, Lizete.
-Let's go, Pedro.

284
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,708
We'll talk more later.

285
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,291
Okay. Take care.

286
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,750
Thank you, Daiane.

287
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,208
Take care.

288
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:42,791
-Come, Pedro.
-I'm going.

289
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,875
Damn, girl.

290
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,708
I told Lizete you'd be trouble.

291
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:03,500
Who would've thought, huh?

292
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,125
Hey, Jana.

293
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,833
This is the city.
You don't need a hammock.

294
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,250
You'll sleep on the couch.

295
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,250
Use less water so it comes out thicker.

296
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:22,750
Hi!

297
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:33,083
Who's the cook over there?

298
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,041
-My niece. Lizete's daughter.
-For real?

299
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,291
Hey. How's it going? I'm Ramiro.

300
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,958
Oops. I'm all dirty.

301
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,333
-What's your name?
-Move along, Janalice.

302
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,416
I'll handle that.

303
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:16,833
Show me.

304
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:19,333
It's a .45 Colt.

305
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:22,000
It's what we use at the base.

306
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,333
It's similar to a Glock,
but only the cops carry them.

307
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,250
-Easy.
-Okay.

308
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,958
Just hold steady.

309
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,541
Stop shaking.

310
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,833
Look at your target.

311
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:40,958
Now.

312
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,416
-It's not working, Zé.
-Let me show you.

313
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,208
Look. Push this in.

314
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,083
There. Now pull it like this.
Steady hands.

315
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,083
-Okay.
-No shaking.

316
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,000
Eyes on the target.

317
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:56,791
Now.

318
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,166
Here. Let me show you.

319
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,875
-Let me try again?
-It's getting late.

320
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,958
-Let me try again, Zé.
-No. We should go.

321
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,083
-Let me try one more.
-No, let's go.

322
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,291
It's getting late.

323
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,333
Let's go.

324
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,208
Untie these ropes.

325
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,750
Go on.

326
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:39,125
Who rules this river?

327
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,083
We're here, motherfucker!

328
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,916
We're the Rats, motherfucker!

329
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,791
We're here, motherfucker!

330
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,875
We're here, motherfucker!

331
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,791
Hey! Get moving! Damn it!

332
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,375
Move along, damn it!

333
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:10,500
The cargo's here! The girls are here!

334
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:11,833
Give me a hand here.

335
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:15,500
-Come! Help out here!
-Grab this shit. It's fucking heavy.

336
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:18,458
-Move, motherfucker.
-Go on!

337
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,916
-Move!
-Hold this.

338
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,125
Move, damn it!
Get them up there! For fuck's sake!

339
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,333
Let's unload this! Move!

340
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,208
Move!

341
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:28,958
Come on! Move!

342
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,291
-Hurry!
-Hold this!

343
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,041
This is taking forever!

344
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,791
That's some good stuff, son.

345
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:36,833
I told you, sir.

346
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,541
Hey, man! Keep it down, Joelinton!

347
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,291
-Hey, Joelinton!
-Unload this shit!

348
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:45,208
-Secure these boxes, man!
-Sorry, boss.

349
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:49,000
-That one's reckless.
-Hey, fucking awesome cargo.

350
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:51,708
Good one, son.

351
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,833
-Hey, boss. All good?
-What's up, Gigante?

352
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,041
Tired?

353
00:22:56,791 --> 00:22:59,458
No. I just wanted to know about the girls.

354
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,500
Girls? The ones at Zé Elídio's?

355
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:08,333
Preá said we could have a tasting
when we take them to the farm.

356
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,125
What the fuck did you tell this moron?

357
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,875
"A tasting."

358
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,750
Easy, Gigante. That's in a few days!

359
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,125
-Relax!
-No dirty shit today!

360
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,750
Let's get to work, damn it!

361
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,083
"Girls…"

362
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,416
"Have a tasting." Go taste some wine!

363
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,875
Look at that, Rony. Some nasty shit.

364
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,500
-Zé Elídio's girls…
-I can hear you, Player.

365
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,666
-See what I have to deal with?
-Easy!

366
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,291
Get to work, Gigante!

367
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,291
Throw a box to Gigante
to see if he does something.

368
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:51,625
Hey, Jana.

369
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,916
Once you're done, you know the drill.

370
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:55,833
Do the dishes.

371
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,083
This is no luxury hotel.

372
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,916
I left some laundry in the washer.

373
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,333
-Can you hang it once it's done?
-Yes.

374
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,041
Babe, I'm off, okay?

375
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:15,750
Babe?

376
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:23,750
-Don't get me all dirty, babe.
-Relax. Hey.

377
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:27,375
Let me go. I'm late.

378
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:29,541
Have a nice day.

379
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,166
-See you later.
-See you.

380
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,125
Bye, Jana.

381
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,083
-So, Jana, aren't you eating this?
-I don't think so.

382
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:46,541
Check out my hands.
Farmer's hands. All dirty.

383
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,541
I'll eat this then, okay?

384
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,416
-Want some coffee?
-No, thanks.

385
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:56,916
Don't mind your aunt.

386
00:24:57,791 --> 00:25:01,083
She puts on a hard shell,
but she's soft as a kitten.

387
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:07,625
What a pretty face you have.

388
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,333
Don't be sad, okay?

389
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,583
Soon your parents will show up
to take you back.

390
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,416
I was thinking…

391
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:37,333
They will soon forget
about that video, you know?

392
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:03,208
WANDERING AROUND ALL DAY,

393
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,666
-Damn, girl! I'm about to fall over here!
-Hold on tight, girl!

394
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,666
This is Brazil!

395
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,625
Damn! This flour is tough.

396
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,666
I need a friend.

397
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:41,875
Want some?

398
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,875
-Would you like?
-I'm still chewing.

399
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,041
No, girl.

400
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:50,291
To be my friend.

401
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,791
-You don't even know my name.
-What is it?

402
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,833
Janalice.

403
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,708
Dionete. Pleasure.

404
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:00,791
Friends?

405
00:27:03,416 --> 00:27:04,416
Want more?

406
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,708
-I live in Vila do Sal.
-Yeah?

407
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,208
With my mom and my aunt.

408
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:16,083
They think I'm crazy, you know?
They even put me away once.

409
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,750
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-No.

410
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,541
I have a boyfriend, you know?

411
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:27,375
But he should shower more often
'cause, girl, it's hard sometimes.

412
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,500
My aunt won't let me take hot showers.

413
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,125
Have you been here?

414
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:43,833
Be careful.

415
00:27:43,916 --> 00:27:46,750
-Mind your head.
-Don't forget to buy toilet paper, okay?

416
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,291
-Okay.
-I'm off! Bye!

417
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,041
This is usually more crowded.
People come for the açaí and fried fish.

418
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,750
-Have you ever eaten here?
-No.

419
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,833
It's delicious.

420
00:27:54,916 --> 00:27:57,125
-Do you have a cuckold tamer too?
-Yes, I do.

421
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,458
-You ever see a guinea pig?
-Like a rat?

422
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:02,166
What are you doing there alone, girl?
Waiting for me?

423
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,250
Listen, girl.

424
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,708
Mário, my boyfriend, he drinks so much
that some days he can't even…

425
00:28:07,666 --> 00:28:09,125
He can't get it up.

426
00:28:09,208 --> 00:28:12,208
Let's play some brega, DJ!

427
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:19,791
The hottest thing, brother!

428
00:28:23,375 --> 00:28:25,833
They sell all sorts of stuff
from across the border here.

429
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:29,541
I always come by at night.
I bring Miltinho too.

430
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,458
Miltinho?

431
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:33,333
You don't know Miltinho yet.

432
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:39,666
Sir, have you seen a girl
who looks like me, but a bit taller?

433
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,583
I've told you I haven't! Leave!

434
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,291
Go away, boy. Go.

435
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,125
Again, boy? Get lost.

436
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,416
That's him over there.
He comes here every day.

437
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:52,541
He thinks he'll find his sister,

438
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,458
but he can't remember
if she was taken from their village

439
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:58,000
a week, a month, or a year ago.

440
00:28:58,083 --> 00:28:59,541
You haven't seen her?

441
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:00,458
Miltinho.

442
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,833
Look. This is my friend Janalice.

443
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:04,750
Hi, Miltinho.

444
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:08,333
Miltinho, tell her about how you spent
who knows how many days hitchhiking

445
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,666
to look for your sister here in Belém.

446
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,125
Tell it all to Jana.

447
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,833
-Yeah--
-No, tell her later.

448
00:29:13,916 --> 00:29:15,750
Now we need to give her a gift.

449
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:18,333
-A gift?
-Yeah, because you're my friend.

450
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,125
-Come help me out.
-No!

451
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:26,000
No? You won't help me?

452
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,041
No.

453
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:31,041
Who always brings you food?

454
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:36,166
When you're hungry,
you come looking for me, don't you?

455
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,916
And I always bring you something to eat.

456
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,583
Now I ask you one tiny favor, and you…

457
00:29:43,416 --> 00:29:44,333
You say no?

458
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:45,875
To me?

459
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,666
That one.

460
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,000
Know what to do?

461
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:17,583
What do you want, kid?

462
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,916
Get lost. Leave me alone.

463
00:30:21,166 --> 00:30:23,833
There's nothing for you here.
Go on, get lost.

464
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,750
Didn't I tell you to get lost?
Go on, get lost.

465
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,250
There's nothing for you here.
Stop bugging me!

466
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,500
You're getting on my nerves, boy!
Go on, beat it!

467
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,166
Didn't I tell you to leave?

468
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,250
Beat it, kid! Go on, get lost!

469
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,625
Nagging me at this time of the day?

470
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,708
Are you mad?

471
00:31:08,291 --> 00:31:09,541
Why?

472
00:31:09,625 --> 00:31:11,875
I don't like doing that. She knows it.

473
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:16,000
I don't think she means any harm.

474
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,375
It's just how she is.

475
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,375
I can try bringing you food
from my aunt's.

476
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,208
So you don't have to steal anymore.

477
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,333
-And what do you want from me?
-Nothing.

478
00:31:32,041 --> 00:31:32,875
Nothing?

479
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:35,541
You can trust me.

480
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,916
I don't want anything from you.

481
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,958
Hey, you dumbasses! Let's eat.

482
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:45,041
Don't get the usual trashy hoes, Mário.

483
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:50,375
You gotta find some fresh whites, got it?

484
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,875
I need five.

485
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:54,750
And if you pull it off,

486
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:57,500
I'll make sure
you come back here to the farm.

487
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,750
Clean white girls, all right?

488
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:06,958
Don't screw this up, okay?
They're on my neck here.

489
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,541
Oh, I'm sending you some local cheese.

490
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,500
The guys will give it to you.

491
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:14,708
Pssica!

492
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:16,916
You look pretty
with the earrings I gave you.

493
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,375
I don't think I can accept these.

494
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,708
Girl, aren't you my friend?
Just take them.

495
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,916
And don't ever take them off, okay?

496
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,333
So you'll remember me.

497
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,708
Why do you like that rock
so much, Miltinho?

498
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:46,708
It's from the river
that crosses my village.

499
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:50,208
Where me and my sister used to play.

500
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:51,666
We would throw it…

501
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:57,250
It would hit the water and jump,
hit the water and jump…

502
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,416
It's a dumb Indian game.

503
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,416
Who's dumb?

504
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,833
I think we can help you find your sister.

505
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,583
-How?
-Using a phone.

506
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,458
But my mom took mine.

507
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,041
And my aunt won't lend me hers.

508
00:33:11,125 --> 00:33:12,791
And how are you looking for her?

509
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,166
You know those websites
with lots of girls the guys check--

510
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,791
Oh, whore websites, right?

511
00:33:19,458 --> 00:33:22,541
My boyfriend loves those.
He always shows me to get a hard on.

512
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:25,875
Would he lend you his phone?

513
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:29,250
I don't know, Janalice. His is all fancy.

514
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,416
Ask him, Di.

515
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:34,250
-Miltinho can steal one.
-No. No way.

516
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:35,333
Do you really mean it?

517
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:39,041
Yeah. We don't know for sure
if we'll find your sister.

518
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,708
But there are a bunch of girls there.
It's worth a shot.

519
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,750
Di, ask your boyfriend.
We'll help the boy.

520
00:33:50,458 --> 00:33:51,583
Please.

521
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:56,291
Damn it. I'll ask him.

522
00:33:56,375 --> 00:33:57,500
Yay!

523
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm only asking because it's for you.

524
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,583
-Really?
-Yeah.

525
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,583
-But you're my best friend, aren't you?
-Yeah.

526
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:10,291
Hi there! Let's get to work?

527
00:35:04,208 --> 00:35:05,875
Here. Well done.

528
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,000
And the phone?

529
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,000
It's not for me.

530
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,166
It's for a friend who's clean.

531
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:23,625
She needs it for… something personal.

532
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,041
The blonde one?

533
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,125
How do you know?

534
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:31,791
I saw you at the park.

535
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:39,416
If she comes by tomorrow
and asks me nicely, I'll lend it to her.

536
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,666
Promise?

537
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,125
I promise.

538
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,750
The blonde one? I'll lend it.

539
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:56,333
Pssica!

540
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:20,541
It's hot, isn't it?

541
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,375
I can't sleep.

542
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:56,916
How can you sleep with this? Take it off.

543
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,291
You sleep with your earrings on?

544
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,625
Pretty.

545
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,750
Let me see them.

546
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,916
EASY,

547
00:37:18,333 --> 00:37:21,750
I can't even tell my aunt.
She'll say it's my fault.

548
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:26,125
Why don't you pretend you like it?
He'll do whatever you want.

549
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,583
Are you insane, Dionete?

550
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,083
Janalice, he's going to fuck you anyway.

551
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:31,833
You know it, right?

552
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,708
At least try to get something from him.
Some money.

553
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:38,208
I don't want his money.
I want to kill that son of a bitch.

554
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,000
-Let's do it.
-What?

555
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,125
Let's kill him.

556
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:53,458
-I know something that can help.
-I don't want crack, Dionete.

557
00:37:53,958 --> 00:37:55,625
By the way, he said you can use it.

558
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,875
-I don't want crack, Dionete.
-Not crack, girl.

559
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:01,000
His phone.
So you can look for Miltinho's sister.

560
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:04,208
My boyfriend said you can borrow it
if you ask him nicely.

561
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,166
Let's go?

562
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:06,958
What do you mean, Miltinho?

563
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:10,750
It'll be at night, and just us.
My boyfriend doesn't like Indians.

564
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,041
Auntie?

565
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,041
Here. Just be quick.
I'm running out of minutes, okay?

566
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,416
Okay. Thanks.

567
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:13,375
Hello?

568
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:16,291
Hello?

569
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:20,416
Jana?

570
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,541
Janalice?

571
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,833
When can I come home, Dad?

572
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,000
Oh, sweetheart…

573
00:39:28,083 --> 00:39:31,125
Whose phone is this? Where are you?

574
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,625
Aren't you coming back for me?

575
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,500
Your mother…

576
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:41,416
is arranging our move
to a new neighborhood.

577
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,458
Once that's done, you're coming back.

578
00:39:43,541 --> 00:39:45,208
And when is that happening?

579
00:39:48,958 --> 00:39:50,625
How's your bruise, Jana?

580
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:55,083
You should be protecting me.

581
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,708
That's what a father does.

582
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,041
But you left me here, and now…

583
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:04,750
-My aunt's boyfriend, Dad…
-What about that jerk?

584
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,875
-What did he do, Janalice?
-I'm sorry.

585
00:40:10,666 --> 00:40:12,083
What happened, Jana?

586
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:13,916
Are you done, miss?

587
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:18,583
-I love you, okay?
-I love you too, sweetie. I'm sorry--

588
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,083
What happened, Jana?
Talk to your dad, for God's sake!

589
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,250
Jana?

590
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,458
Thanks.

591
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,750
Lizete!

592
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,500
Lizete! Come here.

593
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:34,208
Let's go.

594
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,666
What do you want to do with this?

595
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,625
We'll get the numbers
of all the Indian girls.

596
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,875
The whores? Got it.

597
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:47,166
My boyfriend will love
helping us find whores online.

598
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,458
My dear Lord…

599
00:40:48,541 --> 00:40:51,875
It's her parents' responsibility, Lizete.
Not her aunt's.

600
00:40:51,958 --> 00:40:53,375
Holy Father, we pray…

601
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:56,166
-Not her aunt's.
-You think this is easy for me, Pedro?

602
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,333
Is it easy for me?

603
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:01,500
-You think I don't want my daughter here?
-I didn't say that, Lizete.

604
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:04,250
I didn't.

605
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,583
You heard what the minister said,
didn't you?

606
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,500
We have to be tough on her now.

607
00:41:10,875 --> 00:41:12,375
God is watching over her.

608
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,333
What kind of God

609
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:19,500
tells parents
to abandon their daughters, Lizete?

610
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,291
What kind of God is that?

611
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,083
Listen to me, for God's sake!

612
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:29,875
I mean the real God.

613
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:32,125
This son had no example.

614
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:34,916
In the name of Jesus Christ, we ask You,

615
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,166
rescue the young ones
from the Devil's claws.

616
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,250
Rescue the young ones,
oh Father, oh Lord, from this web,

617
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:46,291
from this prison where the enemy
keeps them trapped.

618
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,125
Almighty God…

619
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,708
Let's stop to get some booze.

620
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:59,583
-Yeah!
-Forget that, Gigante.

621
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:02,458
-We have a lot of work to do.
-Fuck you, Preá.

622
00:42:02,541 --> 00:42:04,583
It's an easy cargo. We have time.

623
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:06,125
It's getting dark soon.

624
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:08,291
-Do you want booze?
-Yeah!

625
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,541
-Do you?
-Fuck yeah!

626
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:11,583
-No, damn it.
-Three against one. You lose!

627
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:12,625
Fuck, I said no!

628
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,583
You're not the boss. Your dad is.

629
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,625
When he's not around, I'm the boss.
You all know that.

630
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:20,583
-Damn, Preá. It's just some booze.
-No!

631
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,083
-I don't want to be late.
-Isn't everyone there late?

632
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,125
Where's the booze you had earlier?
Why didn't you bring it?

633
00:42:26,208 --> 00:42:28,291
I forgot it, damn it. You know why?

634
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:30,083
My head was full of shit.

635
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,500
Because you didn't let me fuck
that whore earlier.

636
00:42:38,083 --> 00:42:39,125
Holy shit.

637
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:41,625
Are you two kissing?

638
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,208
What the fuck, man?

639
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:45,375
There's a bar over there. Let's go.

640
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:48,083
So, Preá? I'm thirsty, man.

641
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,166
Fine, man. Pull this shit over.

642
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,208
-Hell yeah!
-Let's go, damn it!

643
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,291
Motherfucking rats!

644
00:43:24,541 --> 00:43:25,666
Anyone there?

645
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,875
Hey!

646
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,666
Anyone there?

647
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:33,041
Open up!

648
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:43,833
Isn't it dangerous, Di?

649
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,291
No, girl. All good.

650
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:54,125
Let's leave it for some other day.

651
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:56,625
Are you crazy? Come on, Janalice.

652
00:44:01,333 --> 00:44:03,083
It's closed. Can't you see?

653
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,500
Let's go, damn it.

654
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,708
I see people there. The lights are on.

655
00:44:06,791 --> 00:44:07,708
Open up!

656
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,375
Here.

657
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,541
Go.

658
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,291
Let's go?

659
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:23,625
Let's go.

660
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,291
Come, Janalice.

661
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,458
-Open up or we'll break in!
-Are you fucking deaf?

662
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:35,375
He doesn't want to sell! Let's go!

663
00:44:35,458 --> 00:44:36,875
The fuck we will, Preá.

664
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:39,333
I'm not leaving until I get my booze.

665
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:43,750
After that, can you come by again?

666
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:45,166
I can, but…

667
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:50,250
Open up, damn it!

668
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:52,000
There are people in there!

669
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:54,875
I can see you! Open up, damn it!

670
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:57,375
-We just want some booze!
-We're closed!

671
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,750
-Come back tomorrow!
-It's closed. Let's leave.

672
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,041
Are you fucking deaf?

673
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:04,291
-Open up, or we'll break in!
-Open up!

674
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,416
It's fucking closed! Go away!

675
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,208
Open up or I'll break in!

676
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,541
I don't want any trouble.

677
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,666
You don't?

678
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:36,541
Good stuff, Di!

679
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:44,250
I'll get you one.

680
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:45,750
I don't want it.

681
00:45:46,416 --> 00:45:47,291
Thanks.

682
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:49,166
Yes, you do.

683
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,416
We only came for your phone.
I need to help a friend.

684
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,750
Fuck. And I thought you were my friend.

685
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:00,666
But you're only here for my phone?

686
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:06,166
-Di said that if I came here--
-And you listen to her?

687
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,583
Here.

688
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,666
I'll get one for you. Okay?

689
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,041
I'll light it up,
and you'll inhale it quickly,

690
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:19,833
or my hand gets burned.

691
00:46:20,625 --> 00:46:23,791
And you don't want your friend
to get burned, do you?

692
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,583
Right?

693
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:27,416
Here.

694
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:31,250
Feel that, okay? Inhale it quickly.

695
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:38,041
Fuck's sake! What the fuck is this?

696
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:42,500
-Damn it, Gigante! Are you fucking dumb?
-Stop being a wuss, man!

697
00:46:42,583 --> 00:46:44,791
-Fuck!
-It's self-defense.

698
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:46,291
You fucking bitch!

699
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:49,166
He wasn't shooting at us.
Why did you shoot him?

700
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:50,416
Let's go.

701
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,791
We're late already. Let's go. Move!

702
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,166
-This one's heavy-duty!
-Holy shit! This is wild!

703
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,916
-You're fucking unbelievable.
-Go! Chug it!

704
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,208
-Holy fuck! Hey, kid!
-What the fuck?

705
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:06,250
No!

706
00:47:07,208 --> 00:47:08,333
You son of a bitch!

707
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:09,750
Are you fucking crazy?

708
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:12,625
Bitch!

709
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,541
Man, I thought I was fucking done now.

710
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,000
Come. Leave that boy.

711
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,458
Stop this bitch!

712
00:47:21,166 --> 00:47:23,833
Leave the boy?
Didn't you see he almost killed us?

713
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:26,375
-Please, go away!
-"Please, go away!"

714
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,166
I'll kill you!

715
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:32,250
Aren't you a fucking man?
Didn't you want to kill us?

716
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:35,333
Here, Preá.
He's not the chick you promised me…

717
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,083
But I think he'll do.

718
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:39,083
Damn right.

719
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:41,750
Fuck!

720
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:42,666
Holy fuck!

721
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:44,166
Come back here!

722
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:45,625
Stop, you old hag!

723
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,416
Fuck!

724
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:51,291
Hey, lady! Easy.

725
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:52,541
Stop that girl!

726
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:55,041
Go around the block!

727
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,416
We're leaving now.

728
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,416
Let my son go.

729
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,541
Stop that bitch!

730
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,041
Let the boy go! Now, Player.

731
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:04,125
Start the boat.

732
00:48:04,208 --> 00:48:06,416
-Let me go, please!
-Shut up!

733
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,375
Let my son go.

734
00:48:08,333 --> 00:48:11,291
-Let the boy go!
-Fuck, no! That bitch killed my brother!

735
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,500
-Let him go!
-I'm taking this fag! I'll feast on him!

736
00:48:14,583 --> 00:48:15,583
Let's fucking go!

737
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:17,916
-Let him go!
-I'm taking your son, bitch!

738
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,541
-Stay there!
-Let my son go!

739
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,750
-Let the fucking boy go!
-I'm taking him!

740
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,083
-Let him go!
-Stay there!

741
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:25,125
-Can't you fucking hear me?
-Help!

742
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,541
-Stand the fuck back!
-Mom!

743
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,541
Get out of here!

744
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:36,750
Go, Player!

745
00:48:36,833 --> 00:48:37,750
Mom!

746
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,125
-Go, Player! Damn it!
-Guilherme!

747
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,416
Guilherme!

748
00:48:54,958 --> 00:48:55,916
Help me!

749
00:48:57,625 --> 00:48:59,041
Help me! Miss!

750
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,125
Stop her!

751
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:13,583
-Go!
-Get her!

752
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,583
No!

753
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,291
Let's go.

754
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,083
No!

755
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,333
No!

756
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,916
My son!

757
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,958
Help!

758
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,583
She's not home yet.

759
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,000
Thank you.

760
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,791
-Did she tell you anything, Ramiro?
-No.

761
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:12,250
Amadeu?

762
00:50:14,291 --> 00:50:15,416
I need you.

763
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:17,958
I need the police, my friend.

764
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:51,083
Look, you better take care now, you know?

765
00:50:51,166 --> 00:50:53,166
That body is not yours anymore.

766
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,500
-Go! It's time!
-Let's go!

767
00:50:58,916 --> 00:51:02,458
-Let's go, damn it! Get up!
-Let me go!

768
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:06,541
-Move!
-Help! Somebody help me!

769
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,666
-Get off me!
-Stop it! Stay still!

770
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,041
No! Please!

771
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,083
Shut up!

772
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,458
-Ow! Fuck!
-Help!

773
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:16,625
You fucking bitch!

774
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,166
-Save me, please!
-She bit my hand!

775
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,708
-Save me, please!
-She's the last one.

776
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:24,208
The others are on the boat.

777
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:27,375
You saw it. That girl is dangerous.

778
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,291
-What's your name?
-Let's go!

779
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:31,625
-Let's go!
-Pssica!

780
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:32,750
RIVERS OF FATE

781
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:34,708
