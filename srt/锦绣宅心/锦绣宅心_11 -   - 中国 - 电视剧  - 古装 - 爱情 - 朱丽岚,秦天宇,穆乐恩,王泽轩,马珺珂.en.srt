=Episode 11=

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,240
Your Ladyship,

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,519
this is a return gift

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
sent by the Princess Royal.

19
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,176
The Princess Royal is truly considerate.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,840
With the blessing
of Goddess of Fertility,

21
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,799
Junxing and Xueying
will surely bear a child soon.

22
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,319
Then our Lu family

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,799
will have four generations
under one roof

24
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:45,760
with flourishing descendants!

25
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,000
Good. Good.

26
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,439
Take it.

27
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,000
Greetings, Master Liang.

28
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,799
What's wrong?

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,079
Feeling unwell?

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Dear.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,840
Yes?

32
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,520
We're going to have our own child.

33
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
Huh?

34
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,400
Th-That physician...

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,319
Exactly.

36
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,448
But today the physician said

37
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:21,472
my condition is unstable.

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,456
We must not be intimate for now.

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
It's fine.

40
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,159
I must rest well.

41
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,999
As your wish.

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
Ah!

43
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,048
Shiyi isn't my brother's real child.

44
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:31,759
This baby is our family's
first true heir.

45
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,000
If it's a son,

46
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,199
he'll be the eldest grandson
of the Lu family.

47
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
Yes.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
I'll finally surpass Lu Junxing.

49
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,560
They say

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,640
when magpies arrive,

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,879
good fortune follows.

52
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:53,479
When will you bring a child
to our household

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,000
and let me hold my great-grandchild?

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
Grandmother,

55
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,080
you love bamboo shoots best.

56
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,639
Oh,

57
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,599
you little thing.

58
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,439
Yu'er,

59
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,360
what is it?

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
Are you feeling unwell?

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,400
Grandmother,

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,159
thanks to your blessings,

63
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,879
Yu'er is pregnant.

64
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,159
We will

65
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,919
be welcoming a new life into the family.

66
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,039
Really?

67
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,719
Yu'er is pregnant?

68
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,816
Thank God!

69
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:23,879
Thank God!

70
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,879
The Goddess of Fertility

71
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,520
truly favors our family!

72
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,120
We've finally received
what we prayed for!

73
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,719
Now that you're pregnant,

74
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,120
you must take care of yourself.

75
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
I'll call the physician

76
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,080
for some nourishing medicinal meals.

77
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
Yes. Yes.

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,240
Xueying remains the most considerate.

79
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,479
I appreciate your kindness,

80
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,280
but I've already secured a physician

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,120
who checks my condition
every three days.

82
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Grandmother,

83
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,919
truth be told,

84
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:56,280
this being my first pregnancy,

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm both joyous and anxious.

86
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,400
Lately my appetite has been poor,

87
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,439
yet I crave nothing

88
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,439
but Xueying's handmade
Eight-Treasure Soup.

89
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,479
Xueying has such culinary skills?

90
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,319
Yes.

91
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,680
Grandmother, don't worry.

92
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,240
I manage the household now.

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,960
And Yu'er is my sister.

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,919
I'll ensure she is well cared for.

95
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,800
Very well.

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,519
Then I'll trouble you

97
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,519
to prepare
the Eight-Treasure Soup for me.

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,759
Others' versions

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,439
simply don't suit my palate.

100
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:24,959
Yu'er,

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,600
just focus on resting for the pregnancy.

102
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,080
Your Highness,

103
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,399
you supervised the soup preparation
for four hours.

104
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,839
I think Lady Yu'er
is making things difficult for us.

105
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,319
Now the entire household

106
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,040
knows I'm preparing her soup.

107
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,879
If anything goes wrong,

108
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,079
she'll seize the chance to cause chaos

109
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,600
and frame me for wrongdoing.

110
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,839
I must oversee this personally.

111
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:55,959
Chunmei.

112
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,799
Yes.

113
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,439
Go investigate

114
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,279
the exact day she supposedly conceived.

115
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,000
Find out who confirmed her pregnancy.

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,080
Focus on details.

117
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,239
Understood.

118
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,399
I never expected you
to have such fine culinary skills.

119
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,560
What a pleasant surprise.

120
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,352
Have you nothing better to do

121
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:17,720
than come here to mock me?

122
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,544
It's my grandmother.

123
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,879
She insisted I come,

124
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,040
saying even Yu'er is pregnant

125
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,920
and we should try harder too.

126
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,279
Well,

127
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,480
how about

128
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,720
you swallow your pride

129
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,040
and tell her

130
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,279
you're incapable?

131
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,439
How do you know I didn't?

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
But she retorted,

133
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,680
"Junxing,

134
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,319
how could you be incapable?

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,720
Xueying knows medicine.

136
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,120
Why not have her treat you?

137
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,264
Illnesses require treatment."

138
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:58,079
You do need treatment.

139
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:02,400
How exactly would you treat me?

140
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,440
Perhaps

141
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,000
you should try this?

142
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,480
How punctual you are.

143
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,680
You deliver the soup precisely on time.

144
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,920
Since you're pregnant,

145
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,360
I mustn't show negligence.

146
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,720
I understand.

147
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,879
You're being so meticulous,

148
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,680
handling every detail personally,

149
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,199
because you fear that I'll

150
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,480
seize this chance to harm you.

151
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,160
You read me perfectly.

152
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,639
(This smell...)

153
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,120
(The sachet contains motherwort.)

154
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,759
(It's a forbidden substance
for pregnancy.)

155
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,639
Let me check your condition.

156
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,000
You're not pregnant.

157
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,199
Master Liang,

158
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,639
Lady Yu'er says it's too windy.

159
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,519
She requests you bring her cloak.

160
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:28,359
Okay.

161
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:29,440
I'll fetch it immediately.

162
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,680
There's a magnificent twin lotus
in the garden.

163
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Let's go see it.

164
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,480
We should visit the garden too.

165
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,320
Agreed.

166
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,839
How dare you fake a pregnancy!

167
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,240
That's right.

168
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,096
It's all fake.

169
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,519
So what?

170
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,520
However,

171
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,279
you won't get to expose it.

172
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,679
Xueying,

173
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,639
I beg you to spare us.

174
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:02,519
What are you doing?

175
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,839
Don't hurt my child. I beg you.

176
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,839
- Let go.
- Xueying.

177
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,679
Xueying.

178
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,599
Blood!

179
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,599
So much blood!

180
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Someone!

181
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
Hurry!

182
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,200
Now in this manor,

183
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,559
you're always oppressed
by Jiang Xueying.

184
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,519
What's the point of allying with you?

185
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,799
After all, I'm part
of the Prince's Manor.

186
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,240
That gives me more advantages

187
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,159
than you, a temporary mistress.

188
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,240
I have a plan

189
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:50,879
that could reverse
your current predicament.

190
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,759
This Western pill will induce bleeding

191
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,039
after twenty-four hours.

192
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,200
The symptoms mirror
pregnancy loss perfectly

193
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,399
but leaves anomalies in pulse diagnosis.

194
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,200
If you bribe a physician in advance,

195
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,840
this scheme will succeed.

196
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,519
(After bribing the physician,)

197
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,679
(everyone believes my pregnancy.)

198
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,919
(When they witness the bleeding,)

199
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,519
(they'll confirm my miscarriage.)

200
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
My proposal demonstrates my sincerity.

201
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:28,759
The rest

202
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,720
is up to you.

203
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,960
Don't worry.

204
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,840
Once Jiang Xueying is defeated,

205
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:36,279
the Prince Heir

206
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,759
will naturally be yours.

207
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,440
Lady Yu'er is weak.

208
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,519
First pregnancies
are inherently fragile.

209
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,559
Now with external interference,

210
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,840
the miscarriage caused bleeding.

211
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,480
She needs immediate recuperation.

212
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,080
Mister,

213
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,000
is there any way to save her?

214
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,519
I'll write a prescription.

215
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,240
Take the medicine regularly,

216
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,879
and she may conceive again
in the future.

217
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,192
It was you!

218
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,559
You pushed Yu'er,

219
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,000
making her fall and bleed!

220
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,080
Why would you harm my child?

221
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:23,200
I didn't push her.

222
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,056
Nor did I intend to harm her.

223
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:26,279
Grandmother,

224
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,616
you were in the garden today.

225
00:10:27,616 --> 00:10:28,639
You saw what happened.

226
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,680
Xueying,

227
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,639
what's really going on here?

228
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:33,399
Why did you push Yu'er?

229
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:34,800
Grandmother,

230
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
she was never pregnant.

231
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,639
She made this whole drama herself

232
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,679
to frame me.

233
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,584
My child is gone.

234
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:49,632
Yet you're spouting such nonsense.

235
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:55,520
Please see clearly.

236
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,600
I concerned about Yu'er health,

237
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:58,816
so I asked Junxing

238
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:00,000
to summon Physician Xu

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,120
who served in the palace.

240
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,320
Now

241
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,159
we can verify the truth.

242
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,639
No need for that.

243
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,279
I don't want to see anyone now.

244
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:18,208
Dear...

245
00:11:20,064 --> 00:11:21,840
You murderer!

246
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,960
Still trying to twist the truth?

247
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,759
The truth remains unverified.

248
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,600
Liang,

249
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,759
you'd better not make baseless claims.

250
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,440
You claim

251
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,528
she just had a miscarriage,

252
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,799
but the baby in her womb

253
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,080
is still there.

254
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,600
Really?

255
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,528
What?

256
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,960
Still there?

257
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
Still there!

258
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,599
The baby...

259
00:11:58,848 --> 00:11:59,879
Mine?

260
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,960
Come.

261
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,039
Place these rewards

262
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,360
over there.

263
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,879
(I'm actually pregnant?)

264
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,200
Leave us.

265
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,879
Yes.

266
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,119
Why are you here?

267
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,600
Since you're truly pregnant,

268
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,440
you wouldn't purposefully fall
to frame me.

269
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,240
Who's using you against me?

270
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,240
Surely

271
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:53,408
you have some idea.

272
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,960
This was just an accident.

273
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,320
Stop trying to sow discord.

274
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,320
The medicine that caused your bleeding

275
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,039
contains frigid elements,

276
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:04,224
severely damaging the body.

277
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,568
If not detected early,

278
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:06,840
your child

279
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,240
might not have survived.

280
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,720
I don't understand your rambling.

281
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,840
Don't believe me?

282
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,720
Physician Hu here
is your trusted physician.

283
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,559
Ask him yourself.

284
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,279
Why did you summon me?

285
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,000
You shameless woman!

286
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,360
Knowing I hired
Physician Hu for this act,

287
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,279
when he confirmed my pregnancy,

288
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,799
you threatened him to keep it secret

289
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:03,440
and feed me frigid medicine.

290
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,776
Were you trying to kill me?

291
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,159
What are you talking about?

292
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,159
I don't even know this physician.

293
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:14,919
My Lady,

294
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,256
she's the one who paid me

295
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,799
and ordered me to keep quiet.

296
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:20,608
When you first approached me,

297
00:14:20,608 --> 00:14:22,360
you insisted it was a false pregnancy.

298
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,639
But after taking her pulse now,

299
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,408
it's unmistakably a pregnancy sign.

300
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,039
What? She's truly pregnant?

301
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,600
She's been pregnant for over a month.

302
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:30,759
Yet she herself hasn't noticed at all.

303
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
Here's the medicine for her.

304
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,719
- You need to...
- No need.

305
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,240
You've taken my money.

306
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,000
Now follow my instructions.

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,519
Everything proceeds as planned.

308
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:43,392
Remember.

309
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:44,799
Keep your mouth shut.

310
00:14:44,896 --> 00:14:45,879
Understood.

311
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Her pregnancy

312
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,112
must not be revealed to anyone.

313
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,399
You want to use me
to overthrow Jiang Xueying

314
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,919
and weaken my health with that medicine.

315
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,120
Your two-birds-one-stone scheme

316
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,679
is truly vicious.

317
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,320
We've never been involved
with each other.

318
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,159
Yet you frame me
when the Prince Heir's away?

319
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,119
What?

320
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
Even you

321
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,799
are bullying a lone girl like me now?

322
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,639
Still stubborn?

323
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,039
Today I'll properly teach you a lesson,

324
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,856
so you know the price of bullying me.

325
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,879
(Fake pregnancy turns real.)

326
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,000
(False bleeding)

327
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:24,544
(can also become a real miscarriage.)
