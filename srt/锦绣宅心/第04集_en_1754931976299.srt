=Episode 4=

16
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:20,159
Why have you come?

17
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,784
Lord Lu.

18
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,159
My love,

19
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,159
I've missed you so much.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,799
Look at this bracelet.

21
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,319
It's clearly imperial-grade emerald,
the finest quality.

22
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,920
Yu'er is so capable.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,360
Father,

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,280
I have urgent matters to attend to.

25
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,464
I must excuse myself.

26
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,848
The Prince Heir didn't come.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,519
How could she still smile?

28
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:01,840
Exactly.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,560
Your husband's been out long.

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
Where did he go?

31
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,599
(Had you not insisted
on switching grooms,)

32
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,319
your current husband
would be your brother-in-law.

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,039
That wretch!

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,680
Could she be plotting something else?

35
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,688
What...

36
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,680
Why have you come?

37
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
My lord,

38
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,800
days apart

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
made me yearn for you.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,439
So I became a maid at Prince's Manor.

41
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,479
I couldn't bear the longing any longer.

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,072
Be good.

43
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,960
Be good. Go back now.

44
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,560
I'll visit you tonight, alright?

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,960
Will you deceive me again?

46
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,040
I...

47
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,120
Or

48
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,080
does your new wife

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,199
serve you better than I do?

50
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,120
No.

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,840
It's the Jiang Residence.
We'll be caught.

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,159
They're all at the banquet.

53
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,039
No one will notice.

54
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,159
You little vixen!

55
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,039
I'll teach you a lesson.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,879
Wait, Yu'er.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,240
I advise you not to go there.

58
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,080
Now you try to stop me?

59
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,599
When you seduced my husband,

60
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,599
did you ever think of me?

61
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,439
Some secrets are best left unexposed,

62
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,000
and they'll burden others.

63
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,639
Exposing them

64
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,280
will only burden yourself.

65
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:31,840
You wretch!

66
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,800
Move aside!

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,719
Lu Liang!

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,479
How could this be?

69
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,319
You adulterous couple!

70
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:55,424
No.

71
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,400
Adulterers!

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,736
Stop hitting!

73
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:03,844
You wretch!

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,439
I'll tear you apart.

75
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
Die!

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,039
Die!

77
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,439
She's a mere maid.

78
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,519
Why stoop to her level?

79
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,040
Such jealousy

80
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,920
makes you unfit to be my principal wife.

81
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,439
You humiliated me for a lowly maid?

82
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,240
You humiliated me for a lowly maid?

83
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,839
How could you?

84
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,368
Lu Liang,

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
today's her homecoming.

86
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,560
How could you do this
in the Jiang Residence?

87
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,920
If this spreads,

88
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,600
how will Yu'er face others?

89
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,519
You... you...

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,480
Utter scoundrel!

91
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:49,959
Mother!

92
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,480
If I'm not mistaken,

93
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,600
Xueying brought this woman here.

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,960
I...

95
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,879
This is your doing.

96
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,120
Jiang Xueying,

97
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,480
you couldn't stand our marital bliss.

98
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,800
So you used cheap tricks
to drive us apart, didn't you?

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,319
By your logic,

100
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:14,079
I made your husband lose control,

101
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,072
enga...

102
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,199
engaging in such indecent acts
in broad daylight?

103
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,720
- Shut up!
- Stop arguing!

104
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,376
Lu Liang,

105
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,040
regarding today's incident,

106
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,959
you must give our family
a proper explanation.

107
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,000
Father-in-law,

108
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,480
this is a matter between me and my wife.

109
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,120
Please refrain from interfering.

110
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,368
You!

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,079
Look at the husband you chose!

112
00:05:57,632 --> 00:05:58,639
(Lu Liang!)

113
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,120
I am your wife!

114
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,800
How could you commit
such a vile act today

115
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,439
and refuse to offer any explanation?

116
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:05,319
Where does this leave me?

117
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,279
Explanation?

118
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,360
You caused a public scene
and humiliated me,

119
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,680
disgracing me completely!

120
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,639
I haven't settled accounts with you.

121
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,680
My household still answers to me.

122
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,199
Defy me again and see what happens!

123
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:40,920
Haven't you always wanted
to see Lu Liang?

124
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,560
Now's your chance.

125
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,639
How do you know?

126
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,480
I...

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,439
(The husband you so carefully chose)

128
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,800
(has many surprises in store for you.)

129
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,639
(In my past life,)

130
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,800
(I never heard of Lu Liang
having mistresses.)

131
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,120
(But in this life,)

132
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,000
(why is everything different?)

133
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,439
Shouldn't you be savoring
your glorious homecoming today?

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,480
Why do you look so devastated?

135
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,744
(Blossom Pavilion)

136
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,839
It's all Jiang Xueying's fault.

137
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,319
Alright.

138
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,279
Crying won't help.

139
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,360
Either go charm Lu Liang
to keep him close,

140
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,560
or find a way
to deal with Jiang Xueying.

141
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,879
What can I possibly do?

142
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,519
Even you, Ms. Tian,

143
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,680
fell victim to her

144
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:53,092
- and lost...
- You...!

145
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,399
I underestimated her,

146
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,519
that's all.

147
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:02,360
Ms. Tian,

148
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,560
let me kindly remind you.

149
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,304
For today's homecoming,

150
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,279
she brought Master Shiyi along.

151
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,216
What?

152
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,040
She took Shiyi to the Jiang family?

153
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,560
Though Shiyi isn't your biological son,

154
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,680
he's been raised by you.

155
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,120
Today he kept
calling Jiang Xueying 'mother',

156
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,560
sounding like they're mother and son.

157
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,759
My sister has always

158
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,199
been skilled at manipulating hearts.

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,088
That wretch!

160
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,200
I should teach her a real lesson.

161
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,639
Why are you here?

162
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,279
To request you

163
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,919
to honor your promise.

164
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,159
The time has come?

165
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,552
Yes.

166
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,799
I demand the Prince's Manor's

167
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,519
household authority.

168
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,001
The household authority
lies with Grandmother.

169
00:09:13,601 --> 00:09:14,464
You should go to her.

170
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,881
Just cooperate, Your Highness.

171
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,081
As for Grandmother,

172
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:21,472
I'll figure out a way.

173
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,050
I thought you only wanted

174
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,250
the title of Princess Consort.

175
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:30,809
Never imagined you'd be so ambitious.

176
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,089
The Princess Consort title is merely

177
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:37,729
temporarily useful to me.

178
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,089
Rest assured,

179
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,290
in one year I'll willingly

180
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,170
divorce you.

181
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,010
Divorce?

182
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:52,530
You schemed so hard for this position.

183
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,490
Would you abandon it?

184
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,104
We share no affection.

185
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,530
Forced relationships bear no fruit.

186
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,369
You'll lose nothing.

187
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,770
In your future matters
where I can assist,

188
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:03,808
I'll help you fully.

189
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:08,608
You?

190
00:10:08,736 --> 00:10:09,856
Help me?

191
00:10:10,849 --> 00:10:12,849
Though the Lu family's fortune
runs deep,

192
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,930
you constantly revel in pleasure houses

193
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,050
and show no responsibility.

194
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,728
You likely won't be able

195
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,209
to preserve your family legacy.

196
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,984
I can't preserve the legacy?

197
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,050
You want a divorce?

198
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:27,648
Fine.

199
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:31,530
Draft the agreement now.

200
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,504
And no takebacks later.

201
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,552
Jiang Xueying,

202
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:41,729
you did come prepared.

203
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,010
Men can't be relied on.

204
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:45,184
Better safe than sorry.

205
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,770
(Divorce Agreement)
You even stamped it.

206
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:51,136
(Signed by Jiang Xueying, Eternal Joy)

207
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:54,080

Signed by Lu Junxing)

208
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,088
Honey,

209
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:14,929
I acted rashly today.

210
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:15,849
It's because

211
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,890
I care too much about you.

212
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,890
I made your favorite pastry.

213
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,410
Would you like to try some?

214
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,256
Honey,

215
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:41,969
don't be angry.

216
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:43,296
How about I

217
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:45,329
make it up to you?

218
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:31,490
Oh dear.

219
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,449
Why won't this untie?

220
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,904
Honey, help me please.

221
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,670
Honey,

222
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,944
why did you prepare a gift for me?

223
00:12:51,584 --> 00:12:54,368
You little vixen have so many tricks.

224
00:12:55,392 --> 00:12:56,910
Let me show you

225
00:12:57,696 --> 00:13:00,096
my various skills.

226
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,616
Your Ladyship!

227
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:16,928
Your Ladyship!

228
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:17,888
Your Ladyship!

229
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:20,091
Your Ladyship! Your Ladyship!

230
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,016
Please save Shiyi!

231
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:23,890
What happened to him?

232
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,208
Last night he suddenly fell unconscious.

233
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,390
The physicians couldn't
determine the cause.

234
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,664
I fear he's been cursed.

235
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,510
We beg your permission

236
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:33,430
to summon an exorcist.

237
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,071
What... Hurry!

238
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:37,951
- Find someone!
- Yes!

239
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:38,910
Find an exorcist!

240
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,832
(Supreme Valor)

241
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,750
Great calamity!

242
00:14:42,831 --> 00:14:44,231
This is an omen of great calamity!

243
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:45,711
What is it, Master?

244
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:47,910
Someone in this household
bears heavy sins,

245
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:49,471
with resentment soaring high.

246
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,591
It disrupts the young master's destiny.

247
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:53,910
Master,

248
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,790
who is it?

249
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:02,150
This lady

250
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,744
committed grave sins in her past life.

251
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,630
Evil spirits haunt her,

252
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,630
and their grudges linger.

253
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:09,951
Master,

254
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,831
is there a way to resolve this?

255
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,311
Wretched creature, kneel at once!

256
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,231
I can endure for Shiyi's sake.

257
00:15:34,471 --> 00:15:35,390
But that doesn't mean

258
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:37,430
I'll suffer your abuses.

259
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,792
Someone!

260
00:15:57,728 --> 00:15:59,872
