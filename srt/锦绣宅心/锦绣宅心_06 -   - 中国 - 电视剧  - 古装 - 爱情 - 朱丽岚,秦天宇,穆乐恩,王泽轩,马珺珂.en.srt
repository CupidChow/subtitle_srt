=Episode 6=

16
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,040
Grandmother,

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,239
Xueying knows you like operas.

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,359
So she invited this performer for you.

19
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:38,959
Do have a listen.

20
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,920
It's truly delightful.

21
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,719
I'm glad it pleases you.

22
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,439
Xueying,

23
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,239
I sent you to the temple
for contemplation earlier.

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,159
I'm relieved you don't resent me.

25
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,480
You've exhausted yourself
for the Lu family.

26
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,680
My heart

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,000
brims with respect.

28
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,560
However,

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,400
I have a request to make.

30
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,319
Speak freely.

31
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,879
Since Concubine Tian was expelled,

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,240
and you manage the household,

33
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,520
I wish to learn to share your burden.

34
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,840
Want to manage the household?

35
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:18,919
Yes.

36
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,479
Grandmother,

37
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,439
she is the Princess Consort.

38
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,680
The household authority
will fall to her someday.

39
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,439
Let her gain experience now.

40
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,439
So you could enjoy some peace

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,120
and live the good life.

42
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,639
No rush.

43
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,719
In three days, the Princess Royal
will leave the palace on inspection.

44
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,000
I've invited her to come.

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,520
Will you prepare a gift
on the Prince's Manor's behalf?

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,479
Well...

47
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,919
Xueying is gifted

48
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:46,919
and thoughtful.

49
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,080
Her gift will please the Princess Royal.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,120
(Why is she speaking up for me?)

51
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,879
(It's a trap.)

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,719
The Princess Royal is of exalted status.

53
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,240
This gift reflects the honor
of the Prince's Manor.

54
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,800
Grandmother, please allow me

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,879
to have Yu'er assist me

56
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,919
in preparing this gift properly.

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,879
Really?

58
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,960
Very well.

59
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
You two shall prepare it together.

60
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,439
(You want the household authority?)

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,599
(I'll never let you succeed!)

62
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,360
(You're in now.)

63
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,680
(If it goes wrong,)

64
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,960
(none shall walk away clean.)

65
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,759
The Matriarch is highly satisfied

66
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,159
with the gift you two prepared.

67
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:42,240
We'll present it to the Princess Royal
at tomorrow's banquet.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,120
No mistakes can be tolerated.

69
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,520
Which of you ladies

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,080
will safeguard this key?

71
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,599
As the Princess Consort,

72
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,520
the key should naturally go to Xueying.

73
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,479
I

74
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,199
won't fail your expectations.

75
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,439
You dragged me into this

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
merely to share responsibility.

77
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,199
Now our fates are intertwined.

78
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,199
I won't cause you trouble.

79
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,519
You'd better not.

80
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,439
You always stayed in the shadows
at the Jiang family.

81
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,560
Yet now,

82
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,800
you've become so different.

83
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,319
Long live the Princess Royal.

84
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,600
Your Highness, it's a rare honor
to have you at the Prince's Manor.

85
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,680
I've prepared a special gift for you.

86
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,120
May boundless blessings

87
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,000
and prosperity follow Your Highness.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,920
(Princess Royal)
Your Ladyship, you're too kind.

89
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,199
This gift was prepared
by my granddaughter-in-law, Xueying.

90
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,839
We hope you like it.

91
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,600
Such a ceremonial garment

92
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,560
has piqued my curiosity.

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
The clothing...

94
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,560
How did this happen?

95
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,360
Indeed.

96
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,560
The crane-feather cloak

97
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,399
uses rare white crane feathers
from the northernmost lands.

98
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,519
Merely collecting these feathers
took a hundred days.

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,360
Now it's ruined.

100
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,360
Xueying,

101
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,680
what is going on?

102
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,480
Please calm your anger.

103
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
It's just a garment.

104
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:26,160
Forget it.

105
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,920
But the Matriarch's heartfelt gesture

106
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,319
and this banquet have both been ruined.

107
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,519
Princess Consort,

108
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,360
what punishment do you deserve?

109
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,199
Your Highness, please calm your anger.

110
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,000
I accept the blame.

111
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,600
Your Highness,

112
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,959
I beg you to grant me a chance
to redeem this failure.

113
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,560
Let me find who sabotaged the gift.

114
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,920
If you fail,

115
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,000
you'll be punished for defiance.

116
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Bring them in.

117
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,720
This gift is extremely precious.

118
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,079
Just in case,

119
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,199
I applied something special to the lock.

120
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,399
Anyone who sabotaged the gift

121
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,120
would leave marks on their hands.

122
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,399
Just immerse the hands in water,

123
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,399
and the culprit will reveal themselves.

124
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,000
Perhaps

125
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,279
Yu'er should go first.

126
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,959
What do you mean?

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,360
I've been helping you prepare the gift
these past days.

128
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,079
How could I sabotage it?

129
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,680
Yu'er,

130
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,879
as the two who handled this gift
most frequently,

131
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,319
if we don't clear our names,

132
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,040
how can others be convinced?

133
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,160
Xueying,

134
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,480
has my suspicion been cleared now?

135
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,519
(It seems)

136
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,320
(she has prepared a scapegoat.)

137
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,559
Follow Lady Yu'er's example

138
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,679
and put your hands in water.

139
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,960
What is this?

141
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,240
Your Highness,

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,519
it's chrysanthemum oil.

143
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,240
Colorless and odorless after use.

144
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:12,360
When hands are immersed in water,

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,759
the marks become visible.

146
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,840
I applied this oil to the lock,

147
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,279
so if anyone

148
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,960
tampered with the gift,

149
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,919
their oil-stained hands

150
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,840
would be irrefutable evidence.

151
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,519
Why did you sabotage the gift?

152
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,600
Who instructed you?

153
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,720
No one.

154
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,120
Jiang Xueying,

155
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,639
you've committed countless evils.

156
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,279
I wanted you to face the consequences.

157
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,039
She's confessed. Take her away now!

158
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,639
Have mercy!

159
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,600
Your Ladyship,

160
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:47,159
I was wrong.

161
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,399
Your Ladyship, spare my life!

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,360
Your Ladyship!

163
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,879
Okay.

164
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,679
Grandmother,

165
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,000
I assisted the Princess Consort
with the gift.

166
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:56,159
Things went wrong today.

167
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm to blame.

168
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,879
After the banquet,

169
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:01,159
please allow me
to interrogate the culprit myself.

170
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,320
I'll give proper account
to the Prince's Manor and Her Highness.

171
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,039
Though the culprit has been caught,

172
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,759
my enthusiasm has been spoiled.

173
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,759
It's so disappointing today.

174
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:14,840
Your Highness.

175
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,639
Please calm down, Your Highness.

176
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,039
Please grant me another opportunity

177
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,440
and come with me to the garden.

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,360
Very well.

179
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,759
Let's go see.

180
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,799
Ah!

181
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,399
(Why is there another one?)

182
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,919
A single crane-feather cloak
is already extraordinary,

183
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:58,720
yet

184
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,159
there's another one here.

185
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,799
This gift symbolizes the Matriarch
and Prince's Manor's sincerity.

186
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,200
Too precious to risk.

187
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,639
Fearing potential sabotage,

188
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,440
I created a replica

189
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,919
and hid the real one at Zixiao Temple.

190
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
Only after twenty-four hours
of Taoist blessings,

191
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,120
did it appear.

192
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,879
Boundless blessings
from the Heavenly Venerable.

193
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,480
The Princess Consort
displays remarkable wit

194
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:40,639
and preparedness.

195
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,080
Reward her!

196
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

197
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,879
(So she anticipated this all along)

198
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:53,080
(and deliberately involved me
in preparations.)

199
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,960
(But dear Xueying,)

200
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,559
(I still have backup plans.)

201
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,440
(Just you wait.)

202
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,679
I heard you stole the spotlight today.

203
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,240
You were brave
before the Princess Royal.

204
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,279
Quite impressive.

205
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,519
Rare praise from you

206
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:12,200
makes me feel undeservingly honored.

207
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,039
Grandmother has agreed

208
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,480
to grant you household authority.

209
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,960
You should thank me properly.

210
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,559
That was earned through my own efforts.

211
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,840
You just spoke a few kind words,

212
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,279
and you expect thanks?

213
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,720
Won't deny it, right?

214
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,159
Just kidding.

215
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll acknowledge it.

216
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
Thank you, Your Highness.

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,080
Manage the household affairs well.

218
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,399
From now on, all matters
within the manor

219
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,159
will be entrusted to you.

220
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,960
I won't disappoint you.

221
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,600
Xueying,

222
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,360
now that you're in charge,

223
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,360
you must start a family
with Junxing soon.

224
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:00,360
Let me enjoy
the happiness of family life.

225
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,639
I've got something to do.

226
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:02,440
I'm leaving now.

227
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,879
You always flee
when serious matters arise.

228
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,200
Grandmother.

229
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,840
The maid Cuizhu has confessed
to sabotaging the gift.

230
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,919
But it concerns the Princess Consort.

231
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,639
I dare not make decisions alone.

232
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,000
I beg for your judgment.

233
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,120
Speak freely, Yu'er.

234
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,840
Cuizhu said

235
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
Concubine Tian is gone.

236
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,919
What?

237
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,399
Tian is gone?

238
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,000
Grandmother.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,200
She also said

240
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,120
the person who killed Concubine Tian

241
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,360
is the Princess Consort.

242
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,080
I had to create a commotion
by sabotaging the gift

243
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,759
to get justice for Concubine Tian.

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,159
What happened?

245
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,600
Days ago,

246
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,720
I went to deliver clothes
to Concubine Tian.

247
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,799
And I saw

248
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,080
the Princess Consort
killing Concubine Tian.

249
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,080
You're lying!

250
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,759
She never visited the estate.

251
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,879
I trust Xueying.

252
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,360
Though they had conflicts,

253
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,679
she would never

254
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,320
commit murder.

255
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,600
That's why I came here.

256
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I have proof.

257
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,679
I found this at the estate.

258
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,759
It belongs to the Princess Consort.

259
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,399
Yes, this is mine.

260
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
A few days ago,

261
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,759
I noticed I'd lost an earring.

262
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,399
Does a single

263
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,559
unverified earring

264
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,200
prove murder?

265
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:37,919
Your Ladyship,

266
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,720
I wouldn't dare to lie.

267
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:41,240
I confessed to sabotaging the gift.

268
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,279
Why would I
falsely accuse the Princess Consort?

269
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,080
I'm insignificant.

270
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,720
I just beg justice for Concubine Tian.

271
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
Since Tian was already punished.

272
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,600
I believe Xueying wouldn't kill her.

273
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,240
Xueying,

274
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,200
how should we handle this?

275
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,279
Confine her first.

276
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,440
Keep an eye on her.

277
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:13,759
Chunmei,

278
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,879
have the steward go to the estate

279
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
and check on things.

280
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,879
Yes.

281
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,639
(Xueying,)

282
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,240
(do you know how hard I've schemed)

283
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,799
