(Adapted from Qi Xing Jiu Yue's novel, Reborn Matriarch Watches,
Prince Heir Destroys from Zongheng Chinese Network)

15
00:01:14,148 --> 00:01:15,072
=Episode 14=

16
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:17,677
(Prince's Manor)

17
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:20,960
Who died at the Prince's Manor?

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,959
You didn't know?

19
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:24,239
I heard that the Princess Consort

20
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,560
committed suicide
in prison out of guilt.

21
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,840
It seems she forced a musician
into prostitution.

22
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,280
Appearances can be so deceiving.

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,760
What did you say?

24
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:40,760
Jiang Xueying is dead?

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,159
Is that true?

26
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:44,576
Did she really die?

27
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:48,439
Well,

28
00:01:48,672 --> 00:01:50,000
Lu Junxing made excuses today

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,519
to send Grandmother away to the villa

30
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,519
before daring to hang mourning banners.

31
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:56,599
After Jiang Xueying was convicted,

32
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,240
she hanged herself in jail.

33
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,000
They have kept this quiet

34
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,079
and can't even hold a funeral.

35
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,039
So she did die.

36
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,840
My dear sister

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,400
always outshone me before.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
So what?

39
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,784
The last one standing wins.

40
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,680
You should've seen

41
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,439
how pathetic Lu Junxing looked today.

42
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,439
He utterly humiliated
the Prince's Manor.

43
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,384
Her Ladyship will know eventually.

44
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:33,696
By then,

45
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,080
the household authority will be mine.

46
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:37,599
Right.

47
00:02:42,368 --> 00:02:43,560
My baby,

48
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,840
you're truly my lucky star.

49
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,000
That Taoist master's
prediction about fortune

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,400
was right.

51
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:55,680
Once you become the matriarch

52
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,639
with the Lu family's first grandson,

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,800
from then on in this manor,

54
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,599
what does Lu Junxing have
to compete with me?

55
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:04,439
Exactly.

56
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,439
Our good days are just beginning.

57
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,400
Dear,

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,759
the imperial exam is approaching.

59
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,000
With your talent,

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,840
if you pass the exam,

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,400
prosperity will follow.

62
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:18,680
The Taoist master said those too?

63
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,240
Okay.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,919
(In the past life,)

65
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,439
(after passing the exam,
Lu Liang rose steadily)

66
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:34,759
(through official ranks,)

67
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,319
(finally becoming the chancellor.)

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,759
The master specifically advised

69
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,000
that I'm destined
to become a lady of rank.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
You must work harder.

71
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,599
I'm waiting to gloriously

72
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:50,319
become a lady of rank.

73
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,280
Okay.

74
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,920
I'll study diligently

75
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:55,919
and top the exam.

76
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,199
You're finally dead.

77
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,519
So what if you were Princess Consort?

78
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,784
You couldn't defeat me.

79
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,519
Are you a human or a ghost?

80
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,000
I died with unresolved hatred.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
So I'll haunt you as a vengeful spirit.

82
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:16,759
To claim Lu Junxing,

83
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,639
you falsely accused me

84
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,560
of being the bawd

85
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,519
and even hired a killer

86
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,399
to take my life.

87
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,128
You drugged the musician
at Jingwu Hall, didn't you?

88
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,639
So what if I did?

89
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:30,720
What can you do about it now?

90
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,639
Why did you impersonate me?

91
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,120
Jingwu Hall is mine.

92
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,800
Lu Junxing is mine too!

93
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:39,040
Why did you steal everything?

94
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
I wanted to ruin you completely

95
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,319
and make you taste public scorn.

96
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:45,920
You framed me for prison.

97
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,639
Why did you pursue further

98
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,040
by taking my life as well?

99
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,399
Because only the dead
won't compete with me.

100
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,399
Perfect.

101
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:00,959
Come in.

102
00:06:05,568 --> 00:06:06,560
Leng Yue!

103
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,352
You just confessed everything

104
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:10,879
with multiple witnesses present.

105
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,560
You tricked me!

106
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,800
You thought only you knew

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,032
Western Regions' disguise arts?

108
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:26,199
We simply did

109
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,879
the same thing.

110
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,680
Then you'll

111
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,048
die again!

112
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,560
We faked your death earlier.

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,199
We still need to explain it
to the family

114
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,600
to prevent panic.

115
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,040
Stay here

116
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,120
for the night.

117
00:07:40,608 --> 00:07:41,120
Okay.

118
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:41,920
Okay.

119
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,759
This room is rather dim.

120
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:52,448
I'll get another lamp.

121
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:54,439
Okay.

122
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:24,519
Does the jade pendant

123
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:26,784
serve as payment?

124
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,919
What's your name?

125
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,000
When you've recovered,

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,759
I'll tell you when we meet again.

127
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:42,799
This will serve as payment.

128
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:44,399
I'll leave it with you.

129
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:46,519
When I come to claim it back,

130
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
you must tell me your name.

131
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,240
My name is Jiang Xueying.

132
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:02,960
So it was you who saved me back then.

133
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,840
I never imagined

134
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,176
our bond

135
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:08,120
began much earlier than I realized.

136
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:10,720
After all we've been through,

137
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,159
actually,

138
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,559
I should have

139
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,872
confessed my feelings earlier.

140
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,399
- I...
- My feelings

141
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,799
were made clear long ago.

142
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:29,159
(When the lantern glows,
I'll guard you for life.)

143
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,639
When the lantern glows,

144
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,240
I'll guard you for life.

Finding the item that will ruin
our marital harmony.

164
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,559
The divorce agreement.

165
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,279
I'll destroy it completely.

166
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,039
I have

167
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,840
another copy.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,600
Keep talking,

169
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,679
and we won't leave bed today.

170
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:13,679
Your Highness,

171
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,080
Master Li awaits you,

172
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,519
saying you two scheduled a Pai Gow game.

173
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,799
Tell him

174
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,480
to return home.

175
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm not going.

176
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,480
Yes.

177
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,519
You're really not going?

178
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,952
My former playboy act

179
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
was to uncover the truth
about Xinyang Pass.

180
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,848
Now,

181
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:38,440
I aim to be a proper husband

182
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:40,159
and make you

183
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,159
the most envied wife in Yu City.

184
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:47,120
You've lain low for years.

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,159
A sudden demeanor change

186
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:50,799
might

187
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,879
put you in danger.

188
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,879
For you,

189
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,559
I won't act recklessly.

190
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,559
I'll protect both of us.

191
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:26,840
Jiang Xueying isn't dead?

192
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
How's that possible?

193
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,919
She was already buried.

194
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,679
She was...

195
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,080
Your pacing is annoying.

196
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,159
I can't study anymore.

197
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:50,159
(Zuo Zhuan)
Don't be angry.

198
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,679
Our future rests on you now.

199
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,120
Once you pass the exam,

200
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,192
fame and success will naturally follow.

201
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,159
The imperial exams aren't easy.

202
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,720
You are talented,

203
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,639
so I'm fully confident in you.

204
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,832
I do know a shortcut to success.

205
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
However,

206
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,600
it requires money.

207
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
Money, money!

208
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,039
It's all you care for.

209
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,440
Scholar Jia predicted

210
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,080
policy essay questions right for years.

211
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,840
With his guidance,

212
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,279
success is guaranteed.

213
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:32,288
But

214
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,080
meeting Scholar Jia

215
00:14:34,432 --> 00:14:35,639
requires connections.

216
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,360
But,

217
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,879
I don't have money left.

218
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:43,488
My dowry

219
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,568
is nearly depleted.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,759
Must we watch helplessly

221
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,639
as this chance slips away?

222
00:14:58,528 --> 00:15:00,256
The imperial exam is paramount.

223
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:02,464
If the whole manor focuses on you,

224
00:15:02,464 --> 00:15:03,879
and is eager for your triumph,

225
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,639
Jiang Xueying

226
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:07,648
can't stand by and do nothing.

227
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:16,192
You have a plan?

228
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,240
I'll help you.
