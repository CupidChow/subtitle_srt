=Threads of Destiny=

00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:14,002
(Adapted from Qi Xing Jiu Yue's novel, Reborn Matriarch Watches,
Prince Heir Destroys from Zongheng Chinese Network)

15
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:15,058
=Episode 8=

16
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,159
I seized the advantage of rebirth first.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,040
Why has Jiang Xueying
outmaneuvered me all the time?

18
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,040
And her temperament and nature

19
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,920
are completely different from before.

20
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,760
(Could it be)

21
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,239
(that she was reborn as well?)

22
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,560
(If that's the case...)

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,280
Chunmei,

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,159
fetch me some flower fertilizer.

25
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,159
Your Highness,

26
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:00,879
Chunmei went out early
to buy ink, saying

27
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,120
she'd return by the Si hour.

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,840
The Si hour?

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,400
Yes.

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,599
But it's already noon now.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
Why hasn't she returned yet?

32
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:13,759
Your Highness,

33
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,919
we've searched everywhere.

34
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,120
We found no sign of Chunmei.

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,120
Chunmei!

36
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,000
Chunmei!

37
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,479
This is Chunmei's sachet.

38
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,120
In the past life,

39
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,479
her brother racked up gambling debts.

40
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,599
She couldn't repay,

41
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,439
so she went to the casino.

42
00:02:33,678 --> 00:02:34,479
(The past life)

43
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,319
(But she got killed.)

44
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,039
What happened?

45
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
She died.

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,759
(Perhaps)

47
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,159
(her tragedy
from the past life will repeat.)

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,159
(I must check the casino.)

49
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:56,039
(Dasheng Casino)

50
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,199
In the past life,

51
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,520
Chunmei jumped from here to her death.

52
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,520
If Jiang Xueying comes here
looking for Chunmei,

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,000
it means she knows about the past life,

54
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,919
and she was reborn as well.

55
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,120
Jiuyue.

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,840
Chunmei's missing.

57
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Find her for me, please.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,719
Okay.

59
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,319
Also,

60
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,319
if you see His Highness,

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,639
let him meet me at the casino.

62
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,240
Okay.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,159
When someone close to her is in danger,

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
I don't think she'll remain composed.

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,680
This move

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,919
will test whether

67
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,319
she loses her composure.

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,039
Just as I thought,

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
I made the right bet.

70
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
Why is it you?

71
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,039
The casino people claimed

72
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,680
someone from Prince's Manor
owes them debts.

73
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,680
I wondered who it could be.

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,960
Never imagined it'd be you.

75
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,240
No.

76
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,120
I'm not here to gamble.

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,279
Then why are you here?

78
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,920
To play chess?

79
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,920
These casino credit slips

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
bear our family's seal.

81
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,560
If not you,

82
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:28,639
then it must be your husband.

83
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,279
I'll ask my husband about this.

84
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,199
Your Highness,

85
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,399
Xueying and I have always loved

86
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,839
the osmanthus cakes here.

87
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,160
I wonder where she is now.

88
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,959
How should I know?

89
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,720
Her whereabouts aren't your concern.

90
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,800
Repay the money.

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
Okay.

92
00:05:00,032 --> 00:05:02,040
(Debt: 450 taels of silver)

93
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
That scoundrel!

94
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,920
Dared to lose so much money
behind my back!

95
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:08,519
(Dasheng Casino)

96
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,839
(Jiang Xueying didn't come.)

97
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,279
(So she wasn't reborn.)

98
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,480
(I acted too hastily before)

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,600
(and suffered setbacks.)

100
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,519
(Using my foreknowledge)

101
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,959
(to carefully plan,)

102
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,480
(I'll turn the tables.)

103
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,879
Wait.

104
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,519
This isn't like before.

105
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,360
Chunmei's current salary
triples her previous life's.

106
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,519
She wouldn't go to the casino.

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,199
Unless

108
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,319
someone is using her as bait?

109
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,079
Your Highness,

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,560
a lot of money in the manor was spent.

111
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,360
I suspect secret gambling.

112
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,439
As a woman,

113
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,240
I can't go in.

114
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,759
Please go in and take a look.

115
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:02,560
Okay.

116
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,519
I'll handle this.

117
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,360
After this test,

118
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,040
you're more convinced I was not reborn.

119
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,040
From now on,

120
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,680
you're in the light,

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,959
and I'm in the dark.

122
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,480
In future confrontations,

123
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,360
if you cross me by an inch,

124
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,639
I'll retaliate tenfold.

125
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
I heard Young Master Shiyi
fell ill recently.

126
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,240
I wonder how he's doing now?

127
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,160
Cared for by his mother,

128
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,519
he's perfectly fine.

129
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,800
Mother?

130
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,839
Thanks to Xueying's medical expertise,

131
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
she pulled Shiyi back from death's door.

132
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,079
I prepared some tonics for Shiyi.

133
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,279
Remember to take them when you leave.

134
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:52,680
He's just a child.

135
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,879
He doesn't need such things.

136
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,399
Moreover, he's gone to the outer estate.

137
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,959
Your Highness.

138
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:03,800
Leave us first.

139
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,680
There's news from General Sun.

140
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:14,959
We'll meet

141
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,000
at the outskirts tomorrow.

142
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,279
My lady, these gifts...

143
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,399
Since he has his mother's care,

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,600
he doesn't need my gifts.

145
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,040
Throw them away.

146
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,240
Okay.

147
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,839
Jiang Xueying hasn't been
in Prince's Manor long,

148
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,959
yet she's gained Shiyi's trust

149
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,319
and toppled Concubine Tian

150
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,560
to seize household authority.

151
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,439
She's something.

152
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:46,279
It seems I need to meet her.

153
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:02,120
(Ledger)

154
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,319
All these expenditures

155
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,720
were spent by Lu Liang

156
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,959
as official hospitality.

157
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,800
Given my knowledge about him,

158
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,839
all the money

159
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,639
was likely spent at brothels.

160
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,879
Master Liang appears respectable,

161
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,560
yet he's addicted to gambling and women.

162
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,199
I need to check accounts
at Elegance Pavilion.

163
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,839
If I find proof
of Lu Liang's false accounts,

164
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,519
I'll cut off his monthly allowance.

165
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,720
(Elegance Pavilion)
Your Highness,

166
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,959
the ledger is ready.

167
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Thank you.

168
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,160
Take care.

169
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Thief!

170
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,279
Halt!

171
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,559
Stop running!

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,480
This also belongs to you, right?

173
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,240
(Ledger)

174
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,480
The ledger of Prince's Manor?

175
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,720
Are you Princess Consort?

176
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:00,919
I am.

177
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,799
Thank you for your help, miss.

178
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,519
I'm Leng Yue.

179
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,279
Without your golden pill,

180
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,799
I'd have lost my life long ago.

181
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,559
No wonder you look familiar.

182
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,679
So it's you,

183
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,200
Miss Leng.

184
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,000
Ahead lies the Jingwu Hall.

185
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,000
Would Your Highness honor me

186
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,879
by allowing me to express gratitude

187
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,120
for your life-saving grace?

188
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,279
Okay.

189
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,399
The job is done.

190
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,639
This is a Western Region specialty wine,

191
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,120
priceless and rare.

192
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:37,399
Please taste it.

193
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,600
See if it suits your palate.

194
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,080
Such fine wine

195
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,279
must've cost you dearly, Miss Leng.

196
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,080
Just call me Yue, Your Highness.

197
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,559
I offer the first toast to you.

198
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,720
Thank you for saving my life.

199
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,799
And I thank you
for helping me today, Miss Leng.

200
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,240
And this is my second toast to you

201
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:21,879
to apologize

202
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,039
for what His Highness did
on your wedding day.

203
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
General Sun!

204
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,519
Shen's Medicine Shop

205
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:42,039
has evidence
of military grain embezzlement.

206
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:45,720
General Sun?

207
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,879
General Sun!

208
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,320
Who's there?

209
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,600
This man is a traitor who fled

210
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,919
the Xinyang Pass Battle.

211
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,960
Colluding with him

212
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,000
merits death.

213
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,440
After him!

214
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,080
Your Highness?

215
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,679
Your Highness?

216
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,679
This face

217
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,639
has a great complexion

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,759
and is stunningly beautiful.

219
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,799
If I were to ruin it,

220
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,159
would His Highness still cherish you?

221
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,639
If I destroyed you easily,

222
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
wouldn't that be boring?

223
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,879
You shine so brightly in Prince's Manor.

224
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
But now it seems you're mediocre.

225
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:13,360
If silver needles can detect
a thousand poisons,

226
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,559
those they can't detect

227
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,600
amount to a thousand and one.

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,360
Jiang Xueying,

229
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,440
enjoy thoroughly

230
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,639
the grand gift I prepared for you.

231
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,080
Don't go.

232
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,720
Master Xu,

233
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,879
you're drunk.

234
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,519
Let me take you
to a private room to rest.

235
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,000
(There is marital discord
in Prince's Manor.)

236
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,440
(And the Princess Consort
engages in illicit affairs.)

237
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,240
(If this gets out...)

238
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,840
Where is she?

239
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:22,919
Don't touch me!

240
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,480
Pretty,

241
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,600
don't be shy.

242
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,879
Come to me.

243
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,080
Don't touch me!

244
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,320
Remove your filthy hands!

245
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,559
Jingwu Hall's yard is ahead.

246
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,440
Take a look there.

247
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,200
Understood!

248
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,240
Search!

249
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,559
Let me go!

250
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:02,480
Someone!

251
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,759
Let me out!

252
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,759
Let me out!

253
00:14:09,799 --> 00:14:11,120
Miss Leng, have you finished?

254
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,600
Why would Your Highness
frame me so viciously?

255
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,879
The grand play you prepared for me

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,440
probably began with that thug's theft.

257
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,080
If I didn't play along,

258
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,840
wouldn't your efforts be wasted?

259
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Before this,

260
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,720
I underestimated you.

261
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,440
So you're better at acting than I am.

262
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,120
You make a worthy opponent.

263
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,159
Miss Leng,

264
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,799
I never intended to oppose you.

265
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,919
What's between you and His Highness
is none of my concern.

266
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,120
Don't provoke me again.

267
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,000
You're no match for me.

268
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,000
Official investigation!

269
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,360
Clear the area!

270
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,360
You're injured?

271
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,519
They're after you?

272
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,240
Who the heck hit me?

273
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,399
Which one of you?

274
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,320
Move aside!

275
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,159
Search upstairs!

276
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,120
I did it.

277
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,519
What's happening?

278
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:58,960
Move!

279
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,320
You dare hit me?

280
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,840
Officer, control this drunkard.

281
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,720
He's causing trouble here.

282
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:16,639
Continue!

283
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:17,399
Understood.

284
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,440
Search every room!

285
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:21,480
Understood.

286
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,039
Check this room.

287
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,240
Necessity prevails.

288
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,600
