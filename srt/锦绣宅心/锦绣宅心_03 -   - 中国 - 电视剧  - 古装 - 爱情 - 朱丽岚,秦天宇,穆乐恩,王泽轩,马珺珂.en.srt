=Episode 3=

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,879
Such an ill omen.

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,544
In that case,

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,760
let me divorce her.

19
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,079
She's such an inauspicious person.

20
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,000
We hope Your Ladyship

21
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,840
can grant permission for the divorce.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,040
I helped you once last night.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,760
I can't help you again.

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,359
No need for you to act.

25
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,480
With such clumsy methods,

26
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,560
how dare you scheme against me publicly?

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,432
Nanny Liu,

28
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,319
before coming to the ancestral hall,

29
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,039
I only interacted with you today.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
Is Your Highness alright?

31
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:12,800
Your Highness,

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,400
don't wrongfully accuse me.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,120
I did nothing at all.

34
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,439
You deliberately ran into me

35
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,479
and smeared phosphorous powder on me.

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,199
Thus,

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,784
when I lit the incense,

38
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:46,960
the so-called ill omen
of broken lineage would show.

39
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,120
But you forgot

40
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,639
your hands still

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
bear traces of phosphorous powder.

42
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:53,664
I'm innocent.

43
00:02:53,664 --> 00:02:54,680
I'm innocent.

44
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,800
You wretch!

45
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,672
Your Ladyship,

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,319
if we delay the incense offering,

47
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,319
we'll miss the auspicious hour.

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,759
Xueying,

49
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,360
offer the incense first.

50
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,400
We'll handle other matters later.

51
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,648
Okay.

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,680
(The incense didn't break last life.)

53
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:28,288
(This time,)

54
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
(it's clearly targeting me.)

55
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,256
(Sacred Tablet)

56
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,344
(Late Lady Fu and Lord Lu)

57
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,944
(Tablet of Lu Ancestors)

58

(Sacred Tablet of Venerated
Late Lady Fu and Lord Lu)

59
00:03:46,116 --> 00:03:49,920
(Tablet of Ancestor Lu Yongquan)

60
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,840
What's happening?

61
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,280
This is our ancestors
crying blood in protest!

62
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
The Lu ancestors are warning us again,

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,000
the Princess Consort

64
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,360
is an ominous person.

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,439
Whether it's the ancestors' will

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
or human treachery

67
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:21,439
(Venerated Late Lady Fu and Lord Lu)
remains unclear.

68
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,639
If the incense mishap was accidental,

69
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:25,800
how do you explain this?

70
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,232
Otherwise,

71
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,680
why would the ancestors
keep weeping blood?

72
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:42,920
Since that's the case,

73
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,680
I'll personally ask the Lu ancestors

74
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,160
what secrets lie herein.

75
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,720
What are you doing?

76
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:53,720
You're Shiyi, right?

77
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:54,759
Come here.

78
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,199
Get the divination blocks for me, okay?

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,504
Okay.

80
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,512
- Here.
- Thank you.

81
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,760
Go play now.

82
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:17,319
(Sacred Tablet of Venerated
Late Lady Fu and Lord Lu)

83
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,800
Ancestors, please reveal the truth.

84
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,199
I face adversity today.

85
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,519
Have I fallen

86
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,879
for malicious schemes?

87
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,680
One flat and one convex, a sacred omen.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,439
It means a sacred 'yes'.

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,279
Could you truly be wronged?

90
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,439
(The matriarch is a devout believer.)

91
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,519
(Then I'll borrow divine authority)

92
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,639
(and use the blocks to escape.)

93
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
Three consecutive block throws

94
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,839
all show opposing sides.

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
The sacred will is clear.

96
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,759
The ancestors

97
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,279
have vindicated Xueying's innocence.

98
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,879
My gratitude to the Lu ancestors
for upholding justice for me.

99
00:06:09,892 --> 00:06:12,420
(Sacred Tablet of Venerated
Late Lady Fu and Lord Lu)

100
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,160
(So that's why.)

101
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,000
You tampered
with the incense to harm me.

102
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,439
Was the tablets' bleeding

103
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:26,920
also your doing?

104
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,839
I'm innocent.

105
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,959
I know nothing!

106
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:29,839
What do you mean?

107
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,959
The bleeding was man-made?

108
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,952
Grandmother,

109
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,800
someone concealed blood in white wax

110
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,600
and smeared it on the tablets.

111
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,160
The ancestral hall's

112
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,680
flames melted the wax,

113
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,279
creating the false bleeding.

114
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,000
She's right.

115
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,528
On the tablets,

116
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,319
there is indeed wax.

117
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,639
Why did you frame me?

118
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,079
Who gave you the order?

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,040
Nanny Liu!

120
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,519
I've treated you well.

121
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
How could you do this?

122
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,759
I was wrong.

123
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,839
It was a moment of madness.

124
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,720
Your Ladyship, spare my life!

125
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,000
Someone!

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,720
Drag this deceitful servant away.

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,279
Administer 50 strokes,

128
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,680
kick her out, and sell her

129
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,720
to a slave trader.

130
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,800
Have mercy!

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,319
Have mercy!

132
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,480
Nanny Liu served Concubine Tian.

133
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,959
When leadership is corrupt,

134
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,079
subordinates follow suit.

135
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,960
Grandmother,

136
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,920
the discipline in the manor
must be corrected.

137
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,800
You can't even manage your own servant.

138
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,759
Kneel and reflect here

139
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,279
for 24 full hours.

140
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,480
And forfeit three months' allowance.

141
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,680
If this happens again,

142
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,759
I'll revoke your household authority.

143
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,560
Your Ladyship!

144
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,199
Grandmother, watch your step.

145
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,120
(Household authority?)

146
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,480
(This does remind me.)

147
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,079
- (Rather than remaining passive,)
- Your Ladyship!

148
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,399
(I'd better take charge.)

149
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,160
Your Ladyship, I'm innocent!

150
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,160
You're not foolish.

151
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,360
You used the syrup
on Shiyi's hands to tamper

152
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,600
with the blocks.

153
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,560
If you applied such sharpness
to proper matters,

154
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,319
you wouldn't be called a wastrel.

155
00:08:33,824 --> 00:08:34,752
Shiyi,

156
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,320
thank you for today.

157
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,159
My great-grandmother says

158
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,440
you're my father's wife

159
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
and my mother.

160
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,320
I have a mother now.

161
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,616
Good boy.

162
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,440
Only Shiyi deserves thanks?

163
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,080
Shiyi.

164
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
Mind the steps.

165
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:05,200
If I recall correctly,

166
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,000
you wanted to divorce me earlier.

167
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,320
You've only been here two days,

168
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,919
yet you've caused such turmoil.

169
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm curious

170
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,200
what other surprises

171
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,960
you might have.

172
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,879
If you want entertainment,

173
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,519
visit Miss Leng Yue instead.

174
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,440
Don't waste time on me.

175
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,679
On our wedding day,

176
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,679
you demanded a promise from me.

177
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,600
What scheme are you plotting?

178
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,080
It's not yet time

179
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
to inform you.

180
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,200
Since you're so capable,

181
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,840
I suppose tomorrow's homecoming

182
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,879
won't require my presence.

183
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,879
Your promise is valuable.

184
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,879
It shouldn't be wasted
on trivial matters.

185
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,896
(Prince's Manor)

186
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,352
Yu'er,

187
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,759
though my status
isn't as lofty as my brother's,

188
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,120
I'll ensure

189
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,159
this homecoming honors you properly.

190
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,039
Dear,

191
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,720
you're so good to me.

192
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,472
Xueying,

193
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:33,200
where's the Prince Heir
for your homecoming?

194
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,440
I forgot.

195
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,080
He's been with Miss Yue since dawn.

196
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,159
May I share some inappropriate words?

197
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,679
If they're inappropriate, keep them.

198
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,120
(Dear Xueying,)

199
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
(let's see if you can smile)

200
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,559
(when we return to the Jiang family.)

201
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:55,679
Let's go.

202
00:10:59,716 --> 00:11:02,752
(Jingwu Hall)

203
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:56,096
(Leng Yue)

204
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,320
Your Highness,

205
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,360
I learned this new dance for you.

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,840
Does it please you?

207
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
You were recently poisoned.

208
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,519
Don't push yourself

209
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,480
while recovering.

210
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:13,399
Your satisfaction

211
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,840
is my joy.

212
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,424
Yue,

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,480
your health matters.

214
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,120
If you risk your life again,

215
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,679
I might not save you next time.

216
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,720
What happened that day
wasn't my intention.

217
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,000
I was just afraid that after you marry,

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,440
you'd abandon me.

219
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:39,480
I understand.

220
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,960
That's why I bought this place for you.

221
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,759
It's now your sanctuary.

222
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,759
No need to feel insecure ever again.

223
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,960
You're giving me this place?

224
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,159
Look around.

225
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,000
See if you like it.

226
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:02,120
Why are you gifting the dance hall
to Miss Leng Yue?

227
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:07,080
The prodigal prince
splurges extravagantly,

228
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,159
buying a dance hall for his mistress.

229
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
Such a scandalous reputation
helps conceal me.

230
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,120
Place our men here and use this place

231
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,840
as our communication hub.

232
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
Understood.

233
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,184
(Lu)

234
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,296
How dare you come back?

235
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,320
I'm the Princess Consort.

236
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,799
What are you doing, Father?

237
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,600
I deliberately yielded to Xueying,

238
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,440
letting her become the Princess Consort.

239
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,200
Yet she abuses her position,

240
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
beating and humiliating me.

241
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,440
You repeatedly bully your own sister,

242
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,720
publicly exposing your discord

243
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,360
and making our family a laughingstock!

244
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,759
You're such an awful elder sister.

245
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:05,879
Why don't you ask

246
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,320
what Yu'er did to me first?

247
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:10,279
How dare you talk back?

248
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,159
If I don't discipline you
properly today,

249
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,720
you'll forget you're a Jiang!

250
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,960
Who dares hit my mother?

251
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,080
It's you, Young Master Lu.

252
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,120
Is His Highness here?

253
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,360
You knew my father didn't come,

254
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,200
so you dared to bully my mother?

255
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,720
It's just a misunderstanding.

256
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,879
This is your mother's parental home.

257
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,600
How could anyone bully her here?

258
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,399
Mother, you told me

259
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,159
to come in after 15 minutes.

260
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,200
Did I arrive in time?

261
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,039
Perfectly.

262
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,159
Then don't forget to reward me, Mother.

263
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,399
I won't forget.

264
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Alright.

265
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm sure Xueying meant no harm.

266
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,272
The girls are back today.

267
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,539
It's a joyous occasion.

268
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,940
Let's go inside.

269
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:28,672
(Jiang Residence)

270
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:36,820
Look at this jade bracelet.

271
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:39,779
And these white jade chess pieces.

272
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:41,580
Obviously precious beyond measure.

273
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:43,180
Very good.

274
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,288
You're thoughtful.

275
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:46,539
Father, Mother,

276
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:49,248
these things aren't commonly seen.

277
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:50,592
My husband

278
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,340
spared no effort in preparing these.

279
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,539
As long as they please you.

280
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,940
Marrying Yu'er

281
00:15:56,259 --> 00:15:57,419
is my greatest fortune.

282
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:04,820
For such an important homecoming day,

283
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,659
the Prince Heir doesn't show up.

284
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,779
How poorly have you served him?

285
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,379
Mother, don't say such things.

286
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,899
Xueying is the Princess Consort.

287
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,340
What's the use of an empty title
without affection?

288
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:19,419
A woman's true worth

289
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,499
lies in her husband's devotion.

290
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:23,220
Look at Lu Liang,

291
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,340
completely devoted to you.

292
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,060
True enough.

293
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,139
Yu'er and her husband
share such tender love.

294
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,820
It's enviable indeed.

295
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,940
Had you not insisted
on switching grooms,

296
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,619
your current husband
would be your brother-in-law.

297
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,860
Surely you haven't forgotten?

298
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,336
Not bad.

299
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,088
Father,

300
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,499
the Prince Heir is occupied
with duties today.

301
00:17:03,739 --> 00:17:05,580
Though he couldn't
accompany my homecoming,

302
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,100
he sent homecoming gifts.

303
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:09,088
Chunmei.

304
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,740
Master Jiang,

305
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
His Highness
prepared these luminous cups.

306
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,768
Please accept them.

307
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,379
These cups

308
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:39,219
have such gentle, refined luminescence.

309
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,100
They're truly rare.

310
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,020
His Highness is so considerate.

311
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:01,619
Why have you come?

312
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,128
Lord Lu.

313
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,856
My love.

314
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:07,619
I've missed you so much.
