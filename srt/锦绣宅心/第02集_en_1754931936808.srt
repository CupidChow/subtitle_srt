(Adapted from Qi Xing Jiu Yue's novel, Reborn Matriarch Watches,
Prince Heir Destroys from Zongheng Chinese Network)

=Episode 2=

16
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,239
Are you threatening me?

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm merely offering you another option.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
No threat intended.

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,519
What do you want?

20
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:24,439
Naturally

21
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,599
the position of Princess Consort.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,359
Not only shall we
perform the wedding rites,

23
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:31,719
but you'll also give me a promise.

24
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,959
No one's ever dared bargain with me.

25
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:37,719
You've got nerve.

26
00:01:37,728 --> 00:01:39,359
Miss Yue's life

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,840
rests in your hands.

28
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,799
Weigh what matters most.

29
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,439
The choice is yours.

30
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,451
I accept your terms.

31
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,850
But if you deceive me,

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,224
I'll have your life.

33
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,848
Begin the ceremony.

34
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,691
First bow to heaven and earth.

35
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:09,891
(Joy)

36
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:12,210
Second bow to the elder.

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,171
Final bow between spouses.

38
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:27,776
(Yu'er,)

39
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,571
(you only saw my glory and title)

40
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:32,011
(in the past life)

41
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:33,696
(and chose Lu Liang.)

42
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,611
(But you never knew)

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,851
(the hidden price behind his success)

44
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,891
(that others never witnessed.)

45
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:45,731
(Joy)
The Prince Heir went too far!

46
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,611
He went to his mistress
on your wedding night,

47
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,810
leaving you alone in an empty room.

48
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,851
Perfect, isn't it?

49
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:55,731
Now I have wealth and status.

50
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,250
And no need to please any man.

51
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:59,171
This is true freedom.

52
00:03:00,576 --> 00:03:01,490
My lady,

53
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,171
you seem different from before.

54
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,331
You always spoke of sacrifices
for the greater good

55
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:09,171
and bore injustices silently.

56
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:12,930
From now on,

57
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,490
I won't swallow bitterness again.

58
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:18,731
I'll live for myself.

59
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,210
It's been a long day.

60
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,771
Rest early.

61
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,131
Okay. You have to offer incense
tomorrow morning.

62
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:29,410
You should rest too, my lady.

63
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,304
Okay.

64
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:31,712
(Joy)

65
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,640
Chunmei,

66
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:36,011
seeing you again

67
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,440
is truly wonderful.

68
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,771
What do you mean, my lady?

69
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:41,131
We see each other daily.

70
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,410
Go back now.

71
00:03:43,771 --> 00:03:44,704
Okay.

72
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,520
(In my past life,)

73
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,210
(Concubine Tian put a man in my room)

74
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,464
(to ruin my reputation.)

75
00:03:59,011 --> 00:04:01,451
(I barely escaped
by jumping through a window.)

76
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:19,090
Did someone just sneak past?

77
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:20,811
Come with me to check.

78
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,931
Concubine Tian knew
the Prince Heir was absent

79
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,011
and repeated her old trick.

80
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,610
Dearest Xueying,

81
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:33,170
let's see how you escape this time.

82
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,600
Who is it?

83
00:04:41,451 --> 00:04:42,730
Trespassing in my room at night?

84
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,891
How audacious you are!

85
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,072
(Joy)

86
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:53,451
Ms. Tian.

87
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,528
Why are you here?

88
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,931
I witnessed

89
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,331
a man heading
to Princess Consort's room.

90
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,090
He was acting suspiciously.

91
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:01,491
I grew concerned.

92
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,850
Prince Heir resents this marriage.

93
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,371
He'd never consummate it.

94
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,530
He's likely accompanying
that dancer now.

95
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,152
In the dead of night,

96
00:05:09,152 --> 00:05:11,331
someone else
visits Princess Consort's room?

97
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:12,448
Let's go

98
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:13,931
and take a look.

99
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:19,090
(Joy)

100
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,064
Secure all exits.

101
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:20,970
I'd like to see

102
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,290
what fool would dare steal

103
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,650
(Joy)
from the Prince Heir's room!

104
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,544
Well, well.

105
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,011
I thought we had a burglar.

106
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:34,970
It turns out the Princess Consort
is having an affair!

107
00:05:35,491 --> 00:05:37,050
Xueying was raised in the countryside.

108
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,530
She must fear being unable
to consummate the marriage tonight,

109
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,530
making her a joke.

110
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,080
So she made a silly mistake.

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,090
She fears ridicule?

112
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,011
Does our family
not fear becoming a joke?

113
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,050
Jiang Xueying,

114
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:50,170
tell that man in your bed
to scram immediately!

115
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,571
The Prince Heir is here.

116
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:53,530
How audacious you are!

117
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:56,512
Xueying,

118
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,016
stop acting tough.

119
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,650
Quickly apologize to Concubine Tian

120
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,371
and beg her not to inform Grandmother.

121
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:02,528
Otherwise,

122
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,131
you'll face execution by drowning.

123
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:05,371
Someone!

124
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,610
Arrest the adulterers
and take them to the Matriarch!

125
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:15,290
It's the Prince Heir.

126
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,288
Let's go.

127
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:17,891
How could this happen?

128
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:20,032
Why is the Prince Heir here?

129
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:23,931
Jiang Xueying,

130
00:06:24,491 --> 00:06:25,730
what did you do to Prince Heir?

131
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,571
Our marital affairs
are none of your concern.

132
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,251
How dare a mere concubine
like you question this?

133
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:36,771
Concubine Tian,

134
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:38,571
who exactly

135
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,331
did you call

136
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,691
"the adulterers"?

137
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:46,251
I didn't know it was Prince Heir.

138
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:47,491
It's a misunderstanding.

139
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:48,730
A misunderstanding?

140
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,410
You dare barge into our wedding chamber

141
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:53,970
as you please?

142
00:06:54,496 --> 00:06:56,811
Do you fancy yourself the matriarch?

143
00:07:04,576 --> 00:07:05,491
Dear,

144
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,931
please don't be angry.

145
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,811
I'll discipline them myself.

146
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,824
Your Highness,

147
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,410
I admit my wrongs.

148
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,931
(I saw the man in black enter.)

149
00:07:18,931 --> 00:07:20,416
(How could he not be here?)

150
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,536
(So that's why
the man in black "vanished".)

151
00:07:26,131 --> 00:07:27,251
(It turns out)

152
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:28,210
(he's hiding here.)

153
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,771
- Yu'er.
- What?

154
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,011
Tonight is your wedding night too.

155
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,530
Yet you came here.

156
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,451
What exactly is your purpose?

157
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,256
I simply

158
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,730
came to check on you.

159
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,170
Knowing the Prince Heir was in bed,

160
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,811
you still approached the bed.

161
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:56,251
What filthy intentions do you harbor?

162
00:07:56,251 --> 00:07:57,210
No, no.

163
00:07:58,451 --> 00:07:59,730
I meant well.

164
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:01,771
I feared a thief
might've entered your room.

165
00:08:02,912 --> 00:08:04,032
Causing such commotion,

166
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,410
do you think your "meant well"

167
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,771
and "misunderstanding" will suffice?

168
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:10,210
I've taught you

169
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,730
what should be done.

170
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,530
You had the strength to drag me

171
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,210
and pull curtains earlier.

172
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:28,931
Where's that vigor now?

173
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,131
The Prince Heir finds your slaps feeble.

174
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,410
He wants you

175
00:08:41,851 --> 00:08:42,880
to slap each other.

176
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:46,611
You can't do that?

177
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:48,530
Well, I must

178
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:50,930
establish discipline tonight.

179
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,011
If you can't do it,

180
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,450
then Concubine Tian

181
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,832
shall slap you first.

182
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:07,050
Insolence!

183
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,000
You wretch!

184
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:09,170
Die!

185
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,992
Die!

186
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,050
How dare you!

187
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,904
(In this lifetime,)

188
00:09:24,251 --> 00:09:26,211
(why would the Prince Heir
be in her room?)

189
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,930
(What happened?)

190
00:09:30,211 --> 00:09:31,200
Ms. Tian!

191
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,971
Ms. Tian,

192
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:33,851
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,891
I had no choice but to slap you.

194
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,450
Scram! You Jiangs are all vicious!

195
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:40,491
Ms. Tian.

196
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,211
My sister's been domineering
since childhood,

197
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:46,650
hitting me at will.

198
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,611
I sympathize with you.

199
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:50,810
You have the Matriarch's protection,

200
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:52,928
but

201
00:09:53,131 --> 00:09:54,570
she is Princess Consort.

202
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,891
Princess Consort?

203
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,731
She must prove worthy of that title.

204
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,251
Currently in this manor,

205
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,810
I still hold the household reins.

206
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:13,024
You shrew!

207
00:10:13,024 --> 00:10:13,891
Untie me quickly.

208
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,410
You can't escape.

209
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,371
What are you doing?

210
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:30,971
Don't just stand there.

211
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:32,000
Help me.

212
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,584
This has nothing to do with me.

213
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,544
Why should I help you?

214
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,851
Send more servants here.

215
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,050
Someone reported a thief here.

216
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:44,971
Do me a favor.

217
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,211
As you can see,

218
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:49,611
if I weren't a shrew,

219
00:10:49,731 --> 00:10:50,810
I'd probably have been

220
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,650
drowned in the pond by now.

221
00:10:55,168 --> 00:10:56,224
But Your Highness,

222
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,304
shouldn't you be with your mistress?

223
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,690
I came to thank you for saving Yue.

224
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,650
But you?

225
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,568
Is this how you repay me?

226
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,570
Then we're even.

227
00:11:09,984 --> 00:11:11,712
Please leave now.

228
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:12,960
We're even?

229
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:15,211
How are we even?

230
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,570
You just humiliated me
in front of everyone.

231
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,570
What about that?

232
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,211
Given what you did at our wedding,

233
00:11:20,211 --> 00:11:21,856
I thought you didn't care about dignity.

234
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,040
You...

235
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:27,971
You are

236
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,290
truly sharp-tongued.

237
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,016
Of course I'm not like Miss Yue,
who's kind and obedient.

238
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,330
I won't see you out.

239
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,891
This seems to be my room, right?

240
00:11:46,528 --> 00:11:50,208
Are you planning to stay here tonight?

241
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,251
Shouldn't I sleep here?

242
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,971
But for a shrew like you,

243
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
I have no interest.

244
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,328
Your Highness,

245
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,810
the golden pill can save lives.

246
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:12,768
But Miss Yue's sudden illness
is suspicious.

247
00:12:13,376 --> 00:12:14,690
You should stay alert.

248
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,170
(The windows are sealed shut.)

249
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:28,930
(It seems)

250
00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:30,752
(not only Concubine Tian acted,)

251
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:32,960
(but Jiang Yu'er also did something.)

252
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,536
(Joy)

253
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,570
Where have you been?

254
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,410
Something happened
in my sister's courtyard.

255
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,731
So I went to check.

256
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,776
Look,

257
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,170
even my face is injured.

258
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,650
It's our wedding night.

259
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,290
I waited here so long for you,

260
00:13:02,371 --> 00:13:04,290
yet you went to someone else's courtyard

261
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:07,371
to watch the drama.

262
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,771
She is my sister after all.

263
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,640
I couldn't just stand by.

264
00:13:17,851 --> 00:13:19,891
Making you wait alone

265
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,611
was my fault.

266
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,340
(Joy)

267
00:14:11,891 --> 00:14:13,611
Is Your Highness alright?

268
00:14:13,891 --> 00:14:15,771
I recklessly offended you.

269
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:17,570
I beg for your forgiveness.

270
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,810
It's nothing.

271
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,891
Please come in.

272
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:21,971
The Matriarch awaits
your incense offering.

273
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,472
(Loyalty Through Ages)

274
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:34,496
(Eternal Prosperity)

275
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,530
Greetings, Grandmother.

276
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,330
May you enjoy endless blessings.

277
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,930
You may offer incense first.

278
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,930
The incense broke.

279
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,771
It's an omen of broken lineage.

280
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:15,491
Such an ill omen.

281
00:15:16,771 --> 00:15:17,792
In that case,

282
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,011
let me divorce her.
