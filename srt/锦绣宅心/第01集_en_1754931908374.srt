(Lu Liang's wife,)

(Jiang Xueying,)

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,360
(is from a noble family)

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,600
(and is virtuous, talented,)

5
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,800
(Elder Sister Jiang Xueying)
(gracious, and benevolent.)

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,599
(By decree, she's hereby granted
the title of Third-Rank Lady.)

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,640
Let go of me!

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,959
(Jiang Yu'er exploits)

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,480
(and preys on commoners.)

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,919
(She's unfit for the position
of Princess Consort.)

11
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,520
(She shall be punished with 20 strokes,)

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,840
(Younger Sister Jiang Yu'er)
(deprived of her title,)

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,680
(and demoted to commoner)

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,640
(by imperial decree.)

15
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,720
(This is the letter of divorce.)

16
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,119
(Letter of Divorce, Issued by Lu Junxing)
(Henceforth, you and Prince's Manor)

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,920
(shall have no further ties.)

18
00:00:45,124 --> 00:00:46,496
(Prince's Manor)

19
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:50,304
You can't treat me this way!

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,832
No!

21
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,768
Yu'er?

22
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,760
Why are you in my room?

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,439
Xueying, your dress

24
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,360
fits me perfectly.

25
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,039
You're in my ceremonial dress.

26
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:36,079
If this gets out,

27
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,400
it's a grave offense.

28
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Take it off now.

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Yours?

30
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,079
We both married into Prince's Manor.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,440
I was Prince Heir's principal wife.

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,720
You married a lowly concubine-born son.

33
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:50,280
Yet your husband
became a noble minister,

34
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,360
and you were titled,

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,000
while I was cast aside.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
How is this fair?

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,360
As Princess Consort, you abused power

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,400
and bullied the weak.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,480
How can you

40
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,000
blame your ending on me?

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,519
Xueying, do you recall?

42
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,599
Father once consulted a Taoist master

43
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:09,760
who divined our fates. According to him,

44
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,599
as sisters, we are destined

45
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,079
to counteract each other.

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,240
One's rise spells the other's fall.

47
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,400
Our fortunes shift,

48
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:21,479
ever in flux.

49
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,319
That's nonsense.

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,359
As the legitimate daughter,

51
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,960
I endured you
and your concubine mother's abuse.

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,280
Now you blame your downfall on me?

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
You twist truth,

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,720
and it's totally absurd!

55
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,520
Yet his prophecy came true!

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,280
I married the Prince Heir

57
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,879
and should've lived in splendor.

58
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,520
It's you who stole my fortune.

59
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,319
Give it back!

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,960
Give me back my fortune!

61
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,152
Let go!

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,464
Let go!

63
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,032
Let go!

64
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,840
Let's go!

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,919
Come back here!

66
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,352
Watch out!

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,759
Jiang Xueying!

68
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,128

86
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:50,752
Jiang Xueying!

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,776
Xueying,

88
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:01,261
I won't marry the Prince Heir.

89
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,381
Let's switch grooms.

90
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,420
What did you say?

91
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,352
I said

92
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,861
I won't be the Princess Consort.

93
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,420
It's yours.

94
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:19,456
(Joy)

95
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,460
(This is our wedding day.)

96
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,512
(Jiang Residence)

97
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:26,016
(Could it be)

98
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,020
(I've been reborn?)

99
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:32,141
Lady Yu'er,

100
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,741
you insisted on
marrying the Prince Heir earlier.

101
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,261
Lady Xueying conceded to you once.

102
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:37,701
Why are you backing out now

103
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,741
in the wedding sedan?

104
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:40,741
When I'm speaking,

105
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,460
no lowly maid gets to interrupt!

106
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,540
Why do you want to switch grooms?

107
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,340
Out of kindness, naturally.

108
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:54,741
To give you the position
of Princess Consort.

109
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:57,460
You'd abandon the Prince Heir

110
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,460
to marry a concubine-born son?

111
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:01,420
What's wrong with a concubine-born son?

112
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,501
Perhaps in time,

113
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,181
he'll earn noble titles
and become chancellor!

114
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,621
What?

115
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,861
You don't want to marry Prince Heir?

116
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,340
Of course I do.

117
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,501
That's the Princess Consort's position.

118
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,460
Since you're so generous,

119
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:19,501
let's switch then.

120
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,861
(It seems she doesn't know
about our past lives.)

121
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,816
(Just as I thought,)

122
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,861
(only I was reborn.)

123
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,980
(So you were reborn too.)

124
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:43,261
You dare hit me?

125
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,501
Since we've switched grooms,

126
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:46,621
I am now the Princess Consort.

127
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,821
There are protocols
you'll need to learn.

128
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,980
From now on,

129
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,100
you don't touch my people.

130
00:06:54,976 --> 00:06:55,980
Someone!

131
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,061
Switch the dowries too.

132
00:06:58,381 --> 00:06:59,584
The Princess Consort's grandeur
must be upheld.

133
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:00,096
Yes.

134
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:01,741
Don't touch them. They're mine.

135
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,580
The groom swap or keeping your dowry?

136
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,941
The choice is yours.

137
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:13,100
(Just dowry goods.)

138
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,900
(I'll let you have them all.)

139
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,640
(Yu'er,)

140
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,741
(do you think switching grooms
changes everything?)

141
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:25,701
(Xueying,)

142
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:29,061
(do you think it's easy
to be the Princess Consort?)

143
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,280
(Joy)

144
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:52,096
(Joy)

145
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,689
(Since heaven granted me this rebirth,)

146
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:56,450
(this time,)

147
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,080
(I won't compromise myself anymore.)

148
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,929
(I'll live for myself alone.)

149
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:01,952
(With both the groom swap
and foreknowledge,)

150
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,579
(no one can outmaneuver me this time.)

151
00:08:04,579 --> 00:08:06,980
(I'll be the one receiving the title.)

152
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,540
(From now on, my destiny's course)

153
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,259
(will be forged by my own hands.)

154
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:18,752
(Prince's Manor)

155
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,504
(Prince's Manor)

156
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,040
(In the past life)
(I had the Matriarch's support.)

157
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,719
Destroying you as Princess Consort

158
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,440
isn't difficult.

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,440
Dear Princess Consort,

160
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,119
they say a maiden's sweat
makes good medicine,

161
00:08:49,479 --> 00:08:51,920
and it's beneficial
for the Prince Heir's health.

162
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,759
We'll be counting on you.

163
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,479
(Joy)

164
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,680
(The Prince Heir's household)

165
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,999
(is a den of wolves.)

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,560
(Xueying,)

167
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,160
(do enjoy yourself there.)

168
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:09,999
(Given this second life,)

169
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,639
(even if the path ahead is perilous,)

170
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,119
(Prince's Manor)
(I'll still brave it.)

171
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
As twin lotus flowers enter the manor,

172
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,920
double blessings descend.

173
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,999
I oversee the household
for the Matriarch.

174
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:31,200
(Concubine Tian of Prince's Manor)
I come to bless both brides.

175
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,239
Please pass the test
of the Golden Lotus Path.

176
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,280
(As expected,)

177
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,920
(it's the same as last life.)

178
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:48,256
(In the past life)

179
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,432
Wait.

180
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,400
What if you fall during the lotus walk?

181
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,759
I'll carry you.

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
(Xueying,)

183
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,879
(for the suffering I endured,)

184
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,639
(you'll now experience it
in full measure.)

185
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,759
Why does Your Highness delay?

186
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:36,010
Do you expect the Matriarch
to personally invite you?

187
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,150
First step,

188
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,230
smooth sailing ahead!

189
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:51,350
Second step,

190
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,669
marital harmony!

191
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:55,789
Third step,

192
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,888
a house full of descendants!

193
00:10:57,888 --> 00:10:59,470
(How is she unscathed?)

194
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,110
Tenth step,

195
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,309
perfection attained!

196
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:29,510
Why are you lingering?

197
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,390
Do you expect the Matriarch
to personally invite you?

198
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,552
(Joy)

199
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,270
The Prince Heir is notorious
for his wild ways.

200
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,390
He went to that dancer again yesterday

201
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,630
and didn't return all night.

202
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:52,110
Causing such a scene on the wedding day.

203
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,840
Being the Princess Consort
isn't easy, is it?

204
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,200
Just wait and see.

205
00:11:56,352 --> 00:11:57,519
Xueying,

206
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,600
the Prince Heir wouldn't

207
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,639
bring that mistress here, would he?

208
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,960
My heart aches for you.

209
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,440
The wedding ceremony is not over yet,

210
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:06,496
and you've become a laughingstock.

211
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:08,032
Slandering Prince Heir?

212
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,630
I just taught you manners.

213
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,470
Already forgotten?

214
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,549
Does the slap from earlier

215
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:14,784
still hurt?

216
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,870
My wife meant no offense.

217
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:20,549
(Lu Liang, Concubine-born Son of Prince's Manor)
I apologize on her behalf.

218
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,230
We beg you

219
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,264
to show mercy.

220
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:25,709
Since you speak so,

221
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,910
you should properly
teach your wife some decorum.

222
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,470
The auspicious hour has arrived.

223
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,270
Two couples will be wed today.

224
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,429
Where is the Prince Heir?

225
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:53,669
The Prince Heir is here!

226
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:55,040
The Prince Heir?

227
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,192
- Prince Heir is here.
- Prince Heir.

228
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:10,624
(Lu Junxing,
Prince Heir of Prince's Manor)

229
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:14,669
(Joy)
Lu Junxing,

230
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:16,870
are you abandoning our family's honor

231
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,189
for a mere dancer?

232
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:20,736
As the Prince Heir,

233
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,189
if I can't protect those I care about,

234
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,189
what honor remains?

235
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:27,789
You rascal!

236
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,510
On this crucial day,

237
00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:33,429
can't you distinguish priorities?

238
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,040
I never agreed to this marriage.

239
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,549
If you feel slighted,

240
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:39,328
send her back to the Jiangs.

241
00:13:45,184 --> 00:13:46,630
But if anything

242
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,909
happens to Yue today,

243
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:53,429
I'll turn this wedding into a funeral.

244
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,390
(The Prince Heir
remains as reckless as ever.)

245
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,309
(In my last life's wedding,)

246
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:00,669
(he made me
the laughingstock of Yu City.)

247
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,390
(Xueying,)

248
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:04,829
(now it's your turn.)

249
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:07,968
I can save Miss Yue.

250
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:10,990
You?

251
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,110
I possess an imperial golden pill

252
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:19,549
that cures all ailments.

253
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:21,669
That's part of my dowry!

254
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,189
Xueying, you took my dowry.

255
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:24,909
It's the Princess Consort's dowry.

256
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:28,630
Once the ceremony concludes,

257
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:29,789
all these

258
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:32,750
enter your household.
