SEOUL

00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,224
- Get out! I said get out! Out!
- This little--

14
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,477
This is my house! Get out, jerk!

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,937
Hey, you little shit.
What's with the attitude?

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,275
Heedong! Heedong!

17
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,027
Are you okay?

18
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,570
What are you guys doing?

19
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,614
Hey, are you okay?

20
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,950
Are you Oh Taeseok?

21
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,537
-No, sir.
-Yeah, my ass, you aren't.

22
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,169
I'm his brother,
Oh Gwanseok. Here.

23
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,630
What are you,
a pair of twins?

24
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,714
OH GWANSEOK

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,883
Where the hell is he?

26
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,928
Beats me. Three months ago,
he left and no one's heard a word since.

27
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,179
What's this about?

28
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,640
He's wanted. He violated
the Political Purification Laws.

29
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,433
-What's that mean?
-That he's anti-government.

30
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,060
LAW THAT SUPPRESSES
ANTI-GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES

31
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,895
He was in the Young Korean Academy.

32
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,230
My brother?

33
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,107
Hey, you've got the wrong guy.

34
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,067
He's not the type
to get himself involved--

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,444
Don't give me that,
you lying piece of shit.

36
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,947
Hey. You think we're
fucking around here?

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,200
No, no, no, no. I mean it.
Here. Just this once.

38
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,536
If you let us off easy today,
when he gets here,

39
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,538
I'll grab him by the neck and drag him
to the station myself.

40
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,831
You are gonna bring him in.

41
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,958
- Got it?
- Yes, of course.

42
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,377
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,586
Bye.

44
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,172
Oh, thank you, sir.

45
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,716
Have a good day, officers.

46
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,637
How are you? You okay?

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,556
Heedong, what about you?

48
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,435
Where could he have run off to?

49
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,438
I don't know.
He mentioned he was going south.

50
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,564
South?

51
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,149
I can't believe those bastards.

52
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,818
They smashed up our house!

53
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:01,283
Your dad… he'll be back soon, okay?

54
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,373
Here.

55
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,125
Take it.

56
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:13,879
Hey.

57
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,840
Do you know what
the most important thing in the world is?

58
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,135
This right here.

59
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,512
This is the reason your dad's on the run.

60
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,307
Everything in the world moves
because of this.

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,059
This is life itself. Remember that.

62
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,023
<i>My uncle Gwanseok was there</i>
<i>for me when my dad wasn't.</i>

63
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,107
ONE HUNDRED WON

64
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,235
<i>He taught me the true value of money</i>
<i>and what it can really do.</i>

65
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,031
We had to flee during the war…

66
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,367
Hang on a sec.

67
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,662
PUNGNYEON STORE

68
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,957
Anyone home?

69
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,710
Excuse me?

70
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,716
Stay here and keep watch.
Cough if you see someone, got it?

71
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,554
<i>I wasn't allowed to get involved at first,</i>

72
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,599
<i>then he started giving me</i>
<i>some smaller, safer roles.</i>

73
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,810
<i>Just enough to participate</i>
<i>without the risk.</i>

74
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,406
What are you doing in front of my store?

75
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,700
- What?
- Come on, move.

76
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,121
Uncle! Uncle!

77
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,374
Hey, run!

78
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,670
Thieves! Thieves!

79
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,922
Thieves! Help!

80
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,132
Stop!

81
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,763
Ow. What the fuck?

82
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,268
Son of a bitch. Trying to die?

83
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:55,105
<i>My uncle was never the type</i>
<i>to get easily intimidated.</i>

84
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,191
<i>He would even stand up to gangsters</i>
<i>when they picked fights with him.</i>

85
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,818
What'd you say?

86
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,486
You're a stupid fuck.

87
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,406
Do you even know who you're talking to?

88
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,616
You can kiss my ass, for all I care.

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,619
You really are dumb.

90
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,414
You really wanna die, don't you?

91
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,624
We should call the police!

92
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,960
<i>He wasn't really a good fighter, though.</i>

93
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,712
Fucking asshole.

94
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,547
Heedong.

95
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,135
You sons of bitches. Come back!

96
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,261
Ow, shit.

97
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,728
PALSEONG LIQUOR

98
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,899
There's no way to find an opening
with all these trucks coming in.

99
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,319
Shit, it'll be a pain
once they lock it up in storage.

100
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,862
Then why wait? Let's do it.

101
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,864
Not with them working right there.

102
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,365
Hey!

103
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,700
This crazy little…

104
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,204
Ah, shit.

105
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,516
You're crazy.

106
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,605
There's some more in the truck.

107
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,898
Oh, yeah, yeah.

108
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,361
Huh?

109
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,240
|Who are you?

110
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,410
Oh, hi. Working the late shift, huh?

111
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,162
I'll leave you to it.

112
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,082
Go. Hey, hey. Go!

113
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,752
Go, go! Damn it.

114
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,922
- Over here! Thieves! We got thieves!
- Uh… oh, shit.

115
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,841
-Whoa, where are they?
-Hey!

116
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,468
Whoa! Whoa!

117
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,554
Damn it, you fuckers! Bring it on!
I'll crack your heads wide open.

118
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,014
Run for it, Uncle!

119
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,684
- Put it down!
- Asshole!

120
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,063
Come on, then! You want more?
You want more?

121
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,941
You motherfuckers wanna go? Bastards.

122
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,442
Calm down!

123
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,069
Yeah, that's right, assholes.

124
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,157
Whoa! Get him!

125
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,157
Whoa! Get him!

126
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,461
How could you leave me
like that, you traitor?

127
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,297
Hey, one of us had to make it.

128
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,509
- Come on, push!
- I am pushing, damn it!

129
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,803
So tired.

130
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,807
<i>When I was old enough,</i>
<i>we started out with petty theft,</i>

131
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,518
<i>which eventually turned</i>
<i>into some pretty dangerous jobs.</i>

132
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,564
<i>And yet, none of those jobs</i>
<i>made us any money.</i>

133
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,900
Quietly, you idiot, you'll wake the kids.

134
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,319
- Yeah, I got it.
- Then do it right.

135
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,781
You're not even helping.

136
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,956
- Careful with that.
- I said I got it.

137

-You scared me.

138

-Catch you at a bad time?
-Who are you?

139
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,424
Is it over here?

140
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,928
Wow. Quite a haul you got.

141

- Uh… who…
- Oh, me?

142
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,559
I'm from Criminal Affairs.

143
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,982
Wow, you wrote every last detail.

144

<i>Uncle was in school during</i>

<i>to keep sharp.</i>

147
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,284
<i>But he kept his books so detailed</i>

<i>that they ended up becoming</i>
<i>the evidence of all his crimes.</i>

Hey, why did you steal soy sauce?

150
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,960
I really like marinated crab.

151
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,673

Look at you.

157

Can't even do it for one minute,

Come here, asshole.

Please. Please, just stop.
Please, I can't--

160

Stop being a bitch.
Head on the ground, now.

Head on the ground, you piece of shit!

162
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,616
Shut the fuck up, you idiots!

163
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,077
I've had it up to here
with this shit, okay?

164
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,458
What was that?

165
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:29,921
Look, you crazy fuck.

166
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,881
You sit there and mind your business.

167
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,260
You want a piece of me?
You know who you're talking to?

168
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:41,808
Oh, shit.

169
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
Anyone else?

170
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,401
So you go out
into the boonies and what do you find out?

171
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,154
All these folks are just sitting
on these priceless ceramics,

172
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,197
wasting away, using them as dog bowls.

173
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,615
A good eye, that's how you know

174
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,450
- what they're really worth…
- Huh?

175
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,535
Mr. Song.

176
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,079
Oh, look who it is! Gwanseok. Hey.

177
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,998
-Oh, wow.
-What landed you in here this go around?

178
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,374
Oh, don't even go there.

179
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,419
I handed over a few ceramics to a guy,
and it all went sideways.

180
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,671
- Oh, man.
- Hey, do you know each other?

181
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,922
Hmm?

182
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,633
He's the Insa-dong Wildcat.
I've told you about him.

183
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,051
Oh.

184
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,220
How do you know this kid?

185
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:20,889
My nephew.

186
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,017
Ah, the rude little bastard who…

187
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,603
Wow.

188
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,856
-You two make quite the pair.
-No, no, no, that's my other nephew.

189
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,610
- Heedong.
- Ah…

190
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,778
I'm gonna be transferring
over to your cell.

191
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,656
-Wait, how?
-I gave the guards some money.

192
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,742
What'd I say?
There's nothing money can't buy.

193
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,161
Where'd you get the dough?

194
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,663
In my cell, I run the books.

195
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,502
Look at you. Your day is here.

196
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:54,005
Don't wanna stick around
a little longer? Hmm?

197
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,257
Get in touch once you're out.
I got work for you.

198
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:57,342
Hmm?

199
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,011
- Come on, let's go.
- Yes, yes.

200
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,180
- I'll see you.
- Hang in there.

201
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,349
<i>Song was the first to get out,</i>

202
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,893
<i>-and then Uncle moved into my cell.</i>
<i>-</i>How are y'all doing?

203
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,604
<i>My uncle had a real knack</i>
<i>for making things happen.</i>

204
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,315
<i>Like if someone wanted to start</i>
<i>a business, he'd find them a spot,</i>

205
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,318
<i>help them get funding, find people</i>
<i>who wanna work, all that stuff.</i>

206
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,278
<i>He was really good at that kind of thing.</i>

207
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,989
Hey, Song says
he's got a job lined up for us.

208
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,659
-Doing what?
-I'll know once we're out.

209
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,410
No thanks.

210
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:25,787
Well then,

211
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,873
the guy in the next room
has a little racket selling fake booze.

212
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:32,001
He says we can get 50% of it.

213
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,837
Except we need a truck
for that kind of work. We don't have one.

214
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,174
We got the handcart, don't we?
You just gotta tough it out.

215
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,677
No way. I ain't doing that.

216
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,099
Fine, then.

217
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,184
Find some rich old bat and seduce her.

218
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,520
Where would I find her?

219
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,023
Look at you.
This great face you're packing.

220
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,901
And speaking of packing,
that ain't nothing.

221
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,861
Hey, forget it.

222
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,656
You're being too picky right now. Do it.

223
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,617
It's safe.
There's no risk.

224
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,244
I said forget it.

225
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,996
Anyway, I have a girlfriend.

226
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,540
You do?

227
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,375
I do.

228
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,627
Soon as I'm out, we're getting hitched.

229
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,046
You're nuts.

230
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,257
I'm already engaged.

231
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,592
-What?
-I met someone else.

232
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,638
Well, that didn't take long.

233
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,101
You need to get your act together
and start settling down.

234
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,602
Stop scamming others.

235
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,233
Were any of the things you gave me
real to begin with?

236
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:42,113
I mean, is there anything
in your life that's real?

237
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,536
Take care.

238
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:53,708
Shit.

239
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,216
Geez, way to go, bonehead.

240
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,342
INSA-DONG, SEOUL

241
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,470
You tried your luck
with a college girl? Really?

242
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,264
What's wrong with college girls?
Come on. Chicks are chicks.

243
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,766
I don't know, man.

244
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,976
Did you even understand
a word she was saying?

245
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,354
-We were hitting it off just fine.
-Your ass barely got through junior high.

246
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,483
Educated women see it all, you know?

247
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,818
She could probably see
right through you, dummy.

248
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,821
I said find work,
not go on dates and shit.

249
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,656
You gotta show some love to get it.

250
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,036
You're supposed to fake it, not be
the one who actually falls first, yeah?

251
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,205
Come here. When you're in deep,

252
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,290
you're supposed to
keep your emotions in check.

253
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,667
Whatever. It's just what happens
when I get close.

254
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,419
You idiot.

255
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,630
A smart girl like that
is too good for you.

256
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,507
Know your worth before diving in.

257
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,925
What'd you think would happen?

258
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,053
What? Were you expecting her
to roll over and give you some money?

259
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,057
I don't have trouble getting chicks,
but then I just…

260
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,141
ORIENTAL ART GALLERY

261
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,309
-Here it is.
-Yeah.

262
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,062
Oh, brother.
Let's see who his mark is now.

263
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,523
This price is just for you.
Otherwise it'd be over a million.

264
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,319
So, when did you get out then?

265
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,321
- A little while ago.
- Mmm.

266
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,740
It reeks in here.

267
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,325
What is this, a flea market?

268
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,870
Hey, this place is one of the top three
antique stores in the country.

269
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,124
Dream on. This garbage?

270
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,250
Ah…

271
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,670
The real stuff's all inside. I'll show ya.

272
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,005
All right.

273
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,175
Right in here.

274
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,387
Have a seat, yeah.

275
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,015
Well, this is more like it.

276
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,565
Have a seat, I said.
I'll get you some coffee.

277
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:47,155
- Okay.
- How much do you think that is?

278
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,407
I don't know. Like, 50 won?

279
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,033
That's inlaid celadon.

280
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,827
30,000 won.

281
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,706
Wait, celadon's, like,
a national treasure, right?

282
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,041
Nah, it's not all that rare, actually.

283
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,210
That's why it's only worth 30,000 won.

284
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,005
- Really? This is worth that much?
- Hey, hey, hey! D…

285
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,382
Don't do that.
Just put it down and settle.

286
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,925
Come on. Come on, sit.

287
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,762
Mmm.

288
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,020
Hot.

289
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,272
So what are you working on these days?

290
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,150
Keeping busy. I've got a full plate.

291
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,986
You just got out of prison.
How busy can you be?

292
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,071
You said you had work.

293
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,367
These folks over in Jeolla, Sinan coast,

294
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,870
they caught a few pieces of pottery
in their nets.

295
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,496
They could be worth something.

296
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,789
What are you asking?

297
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,250
I want you to go and get them for me.

298
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,252
You want me to deliver pottery?

299
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,046
That's not all you're doing.

300
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,215
These pieces are buried underwater,

301
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,550
which means you'll have to fish them
out of the sea.

302
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,844
And I'll pay you up front,
so don't worry about that.

303
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,804
Why me, though? I'm no sailor.

304
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,308
Well, you're a fellow
who gets things done around here.

305
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:00,519
It sound like a lot of hassle.
How valuable are these?

306
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,356
The place is probably a complete mudflat.

307
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,483
Valuable, my foot.

308
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:09,362
Look, this is just what I do.
Just trying to develop a collection.

309
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,030
Well, what's it pay, then?

310
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,991
400,000.

311
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,619
F-F-Four hundred thousand won?

312
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,039
You know, that's about
half a year's salary for a civil servant.

313
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,791
Just bring them to me intact, okay?

314
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,461
These pieces have been underwater
for so long, they're likely fragile now.

315
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,046
Handle with care, huh?

316
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,436
Let's eat some grub at my place.

317
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,063
I'm good. I'm not hungry.

318
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,066
We gotta talk about the job, kid.

319
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,610
What do you mean?
There's nothing to talk about.

320
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,153
We get 400,000.

321
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,655
Shut up and follow me.

322
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,415
<i>I dreaded going to my uncle's.</i>
<i>He was a pain in the ass.</i>

323
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,298
<i>He had a son in seventh grade</i>
<i>and a daughter with tuberculosis.</i>

324
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,675
<i>He'd always give them</i>
<i>a long lecture before dinner.</i>

325
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,802
What's this?

326
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,140
You think I swam all the way
across the Han River during the war

327
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,684
just to see grades like these? Hmm?

328
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,935
What'd I say?

329
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,855
You have to be indispensable.

330
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:30,276
Like a screw that got jammed deep in there
and won't come out, no matter what.

331
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,903
<i>But the worst part was</i>
<i>that he'd take all the time in the world</i>

332
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,238
<i>just to go over his day.</i>

333
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,324
Hey, did she take her meds?

334
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,618
<i>Uncle had to jot down everything</i>
<i>that happened throughout the day</i>

335
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,244
<i>before he could feel relaxed.</i>

336
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,539
Hey, weren't we gonna talk?

337
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,750
In a minute.

338
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,257
<i>Then, he'd spend time</i>
<i>going through his son's bag</i>

339
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,594
<i>to make sure he had everything ready</i>
<i>to go for school the next day.</i>

340
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,806
<i>And he'd never forget</i>
<i>to slip in a bar of chocolate.</i>

341
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,934
Hey, get us something to eat.

342
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,061
Right now?

343
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,189
-But we don't have anything--
-Oh, no. Don't worry, Auntie.

344
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,815
It's the middle of the night.

345
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:11,400
I think this right here

346
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,737
is the last drink
we're going to have for a while.

347
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,867
I have a feeling
that this job Song got for us…

348
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,452
It's not gonna be easy.

349
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,412
Why?

350
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,083
Well, he's asking us to go fishing, right?

351
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,542
Me, of all people.

352
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,628
Why do you think that is?

353
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,340
He trying to avoid using pros.

354
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,592
And why would he avoid bringing them on?

355
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,887
-'Cause word will get out.
-And then what happens?

356
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,013
Less profit.

357
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,057
Just profit?

358
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,436
The real issue is, it's pottery.

359
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,440
There are probably others who are
going after it too.

360
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,275
So, there's danger.

361
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,902
Yeah.

362
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,656
This whole job is looking like
it's going to be a real pain in the ass.

363
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,616
Hmm.

364
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,743
But how do you figure?

365
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,162
We just gotta fish them out
and hand them over, right?

366
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:10,251
Like I'm gonna go all the way down there
to make a measly 400,000.

367
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,420
What do you take me for?

368
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,090
Hey.

369
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,885
Look, about how many pieces are there
in the sea?

370
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,097
-We don't know.
-Then tell me, who would know?

371
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,057
Nobody would.

372
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,684
Right, no one knows.

373
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,311
Get what I'm saying?

374
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:32,898
Oh.

375
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,694
- We take some.
- Yeah, that's it!

376
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,946
Right.

377
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,660
So stay off the drinks for now, okay?

378
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:49,457
-Go to Mokpo and hear what they're saying.
-Mokpo and what? Why? Who's there?

379
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,834
My third cousin's daughter lives
over there.

380
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,296
Third cousin?
You're practically strangers.

381
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,758
MOKPO

382
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,953
The owner? She should be here soon.

383
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,581
Go inside and have a cup of tea
while you wait.

384
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,333
You the third cousin's kid?

385
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,627
Third cousin?
Don't that make us strangers?

386
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,961
Exactly.

387
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,632
Hey, do y'all like coffee in Seoul?

388
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,967
Yeah, right? Ours is real nice.

389
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,052
I'm good.

390
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,348
Here she comes. That's the owner.

391
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,434
It's gonna take forever
to teach you

392
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:51,936
how to make any money at this rate.

393
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,314
Ms. Jang, you got a guest.
Came here all the way from Seoul.

394
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,941
Oh, yeah.

395
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,694
Hmm, I wasn't expecting
such a pretty boy, at that.

396
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,490
I suppose you're looking
for a captain with a boat, huh?

397
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,910
- Yeah.
- A captain… Well, let's see.

398
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,120
Will the old man be at his home yet?

399
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,540
-Well, where does he live?
-You kidding?

400
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:13,666
If I was a psychic,

401
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,210
why would I be running this joint?

402
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,754
- Where does he usually hang around, then?
- Where do you think?

403
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:22,091
I mean, it's likely he's eaten now,
being suppertime and whatnot.

404
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,469
-<i>Kambap</i> is one of his favorite meals.
-Okay, so how do I find him already?

405
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:28,472
Well, he likes to come by
my place just about every day,

406
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,641
so you can stick around,
if you buy something.

407
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,561
You want me to just wait
for who knows how long?

408
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:37,273
Just hold your horses.
He'll show up after dark.

409
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,985
Are people so rude in Seoul, they don't
buy something if they ask for directions?

410
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,319
Gratitude gets you far.

411
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,822
I'm introducing you to a captain,
aren't I?

412
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,199
So come in and buy a drink.

413
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,701
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

414
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:07,469
<i>Sometimes, you come</i>
<i>across things that seem so out of place.</i>

415
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,060
Mmm.

416
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,522
The coffee's pretty good.

417
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,159
Where's the captain?

418
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,788
Madam Jang, guess who's here.

419
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:37,249
- Oh, you're here.
- I'm here too.

420
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,335
Got quite a crowd today,
don't we?

421
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,629
Geez,
where'd you wet your beaks?

422
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,297
You two are drunk as skunks.

423
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,884
Drunk? Who's drunk?
We had some <i>makgeolli</i>.

424
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,304
-Just one glass each with our meal.
-Just a glass, my ass.

425
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,764
More like you shared a barrel.

426
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,683
Anyway, heard someone's looking
for us, huh?

427
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,234
<i> I ask for one captain,</i>
<i>and now the whole town knows.</i>

428
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,363
Who could have any idea
if they're fake or real?

429
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,531
Well, uh, even so.

430
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,576
When we catch things like that
in our nets, we don't like it at all.

431
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,870
It's real bad luck, don't you know?

432
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,956
You know, apparently,
someone caught a few pieces,

433
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,625
took 'em to Gwangju.
Even made a pretty sum of it.

434
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,794
Once that happened, that was it.

435
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,712
His eyes were never the same after that.

436
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,130
That's not how it went, okay?

437
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:27,424
Look, Choi went out there,
set out his nets,

438
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,051
caught what he thought was trash,

439
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,595
but his younger brother,
he reckoned it's Goryeo ware,

440
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,138
and took it to the county office.

441
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:35,224
But the person there laughed in his face.

442
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,601
"Goryeo ware in this small town?"

443
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,311
"You must be outta your damn gourd."

444
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,688
Then word started getting out

445
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,773
and someone came by and said,
"Here, show me,"

446
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,483
and what do you know, they was real.

447
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:48,112
And now, that's exactly
how it all went down.

448
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,489
Dang, look at you.

449
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,409
We got ourselves a storyteller here,
don't we?

450
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,161
- You talkin' shit now?
- What?

451
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,581
The hell? What the hell's your problem?
I ain't talkin' shit.

452
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,001
Hey, you need to learn
to watch your mouth.

453
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,294
I'll choke you in a fucking net,
you little--

454
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,463
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- What?

455
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,008
So you're saying
they're already gone then, right?

456
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,301
Mind your manners, young man.

457
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,721
Hey, don't you read the news?

458
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:16,348
The government,
they already finished investigating.

459
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,808
Even the president was there.

460
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,893
Took a picture
with the pottery and everything.

461
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,437
That's not all of it.

462
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,481
The currents are strong over there,
so they only wound up with a few.

463
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,692
Even the government gave up after a while.

464
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,153
There's still gotta be a ton left
in the mudflat.

465
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,281
Did you see them with your damn eyes?
Then how come you ain't digging there?

466
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,199
Shut the hell up.

467
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,076
Hey, wait a minute.

468
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,078
So here's the thing…

469
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,122
Digging 'em up ain't gonna be
easy or free.

470
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,499
How are you gonna pay for it?

471
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,002
Just quit fighting.
Giving me a headache.

472
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,005
Who the hell
does he think he is? Little punk.

473
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,968
So word already got out.

474
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,054
The government came to dig out
what they could.

475
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,389
So, what?
Should we bail on it, then?

476
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,891
No, not exactly.

477
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,809
<i>They just didn't bother keeping it quiet</i>

478
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,645
<i>'cause they don't think</i>
<i>it's worth the time and effort.</i>

479
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,647
<i>They don't see it as a gold mine.</i>

480
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,899
Well, that's good to hear.

481
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,860
Although,
Song's not completely sure either.

482
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:12,488
Yeah, that's the reason
why I'm still debating this.

483
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,864
<i>That doesn't mean we shouldn't do it.</i>

484
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,449
Let's say we dig around.

485
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,993
I think we can make 200,000. Let's do it.

486
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,620
Why are you suddenly so into this?

487
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,874
It's just…
…the coffee's pretty good here.

488
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,336
You're the first to praise Mokpo
for the coffee instead of the seafood.

489
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,338
Just saying.

490
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,547
Anyway,

491
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,342
we need to get as much cash
out of Song as we can.

492
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,512
- So finish up and hurry back.
<i>- All right.</i>

493
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,013
<i>What?</i>

494
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,224
Hey, I-I need to call you back later.

495
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,893
Hey, how long you been standing there?

496
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,145
What's got you so stirred
like you're guilty of somethin'?

497
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:49,066
-Why the hell were you listening in, huh?
-What's there to even listen in on, huh?

498
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,987
-If you've got time, treat me to some <i>hoe</i>.
-Why should I?

499
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,532
Is everybody from Seoul
as cranky as you are?

500
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,117
Forget it. Your loss.

501
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,203
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Fine. I-I'll get you some.

502
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,913
All right?

503
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,332
What do you got for me though, then?

504
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,001
You won't be wasting your money,
that's for sure.

505
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:09,962
Well, what's that mean?

506
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,674
The guys you talked to earlier,

507
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,510
the three of them want me
to keep an eye on you.

508
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,887
See who you're meetin'
and what you're talkin' about.

509
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,764
Gave me a thousand for the trouble.

510
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,724
-Why would they do that?
-Obvious, isn't it?

511
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,809
'Cause the pottery.

512
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,895
Looks like grave robbing's back in season.

513
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,022
Least, that's what
the rumor mill's sayin'.

514
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,316
How's that?

515
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,318
That should be worth the price of <i>hoe</i>.

516
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,406
Hey, Seonja.

517
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,866
What're you up to there, huh?

518
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:42,619
Dang. Look at you,
off foolin' around with some guy, hmm?

519
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,499
- Who's he?
- He ain't no one.

520
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,586
Yeah? So you were flirtin'
with no one then?

521
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,129
Shakin' your lil tail?

522
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,132
BEOLGU

523
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,467
-He's ain't from here.
-Flirtin'? Flirtin', my foot.

524
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,886
Just get walkin'.

525
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,889
Now why would I go and do that
when I came here for you?

526
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,181
Hey.

527
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,308
PILMAN

528
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,475
Where are you from?

529
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,521
-Ignore them. Just go.
-Hey, you're not goin' nowhere.

530
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:10,606
DOHUN

531
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,441
'Cause the boss ain't done talkin'!

532
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,526
What's going on?

533
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,196
Nah, nothin'.
There's nothing going on.

534
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,740
"Nothing," that right?

535
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,910
You rotten pricks
are pickin' a fight with my customer.

536
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,703
Go on, then. Get.

537
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,372
Hey, now.
We're not pickin' no fight.

538
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,625
We're just sayin' hi.

539
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,628
And what are you doin' out here?

540
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,637
Hey, word of advice.

541
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,640
Keep your hands off my girl, outsider.

542
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,268
- You could wind up dead.
- Hey, hey, Boss.

543
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,853
Let's get some coffee then, yeah?

544
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,271
Let's go.

545
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,400
- Ah, man. What a bitch.
- Come on. Let's go.

546
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:56,610
Pussy.

547
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:57,819
Ignore them, 'kay?

548
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,322
They're just a bunch of idiots.

549
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:08,914
These motherfuckers.

550
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,751
Now where could
he have run off to?

551
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,795
He left the store alone.

552
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,921
Is that Han?

553
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,353
Oh, Mr. Han.

554
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,982
- Oh!
- How are you?

555
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,984
- Gwanseok.
- Hi. What's goin' on?

556
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,068
MR. HAN

557
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,654
-You don't know where Song is, do ya?
-He's not here?

558
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,240
Oh, shoot. I'm here to see him too.

559
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,324
Oh, really?

560
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,535
Oh, well.

561
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,997
I'll see you…
…uh, next time then.

562
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,249
All right, take care. Bye.

563
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,294
Now, where the hell
did you go now?

564
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:10,809
ARE YOU MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN
CHEON TOMORROW MORNING?

565
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,269
"Chairman Cheon."

566
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,397
Cheon, huh?

567
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,487
HEAD OFFICE
OF HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

568
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,575
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

569
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,046
- You can keep the change.
- Thank you.

570
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,111
Sixth floor.

571
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,906
HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

572
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,410
Twelfth floor.

573
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,179
Gas prices went up by 4.275%.

574
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,973
Wow, it went that high?

575
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,392
Mm-hmm.

576
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:39,773
"214.5 won per liter,
and 251 won for premium."

577
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,902
Hmm. I think we might have to cut down.

578
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,155
Right.

579
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,865
In July, they're rising again.

580
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,202
-Better to stock up sooner.
-Ma'am.

581
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,878
-Ms. Yang, hello.
-Hi.

582
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,382
- Is the chairman inside?
- Yes. He's in his office.

583
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,466
Mr. Kang.

584
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,178
Oh, thank you.

585
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,145
I hear your mother's coming to visit.

586
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,356
- Oh, she is?
- What, she didn't tell you?

587
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,275
I hadn't heard.

588
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,986
It's spring now.
Take her to see some flowers.

589
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,070
Right.

590
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,660
Oh, hold on!

591
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:36,454
-Hello, Director Lee.
-Hello, Mrs. Yang.

592
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,456
Are you here to see the chairman?

593
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,542
- Yes. How are you?
- Good, thank you.

594
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,336
How are the apartments in Yeouido?

595
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,047
Good. They'll be finished within the year.

596
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,966
Land prices there are getting high,

597
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,718
and I hear a park is in the works.

598
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,262
That area is going to see
massive development.

599
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,932
-Good to see you.
-You too.

600
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,017
We should have lunch.

601
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,476
Love to.

602
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,163
Hello, Mrs. Yang.

603
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,124
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Yang.
- Hello, Mrs. Yang.

604
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,627
-Have you been waiting long?
-No, not at all. I just arrived.

605
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,962
- Let's go inside.
- Yes.

606
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,966
- I'm here.
- Oh, hi.

607
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,394
Hello, Chairman Cheon.

608
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,854
CHAIRMAN CHEON HWANGSIK

609
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,564
Oh. Sit down.

610
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,483
Okay.

611
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,402
- No, no. Do it this way.
- Mmm.

612
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,487
Here. Here.

613
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,755
Mr. Song.

614
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,467
What…

615
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:15,679
-Gwanseok, what are you doing here?
-Wow.

616
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,182
All these years of us being friends
meant nothing to you, did they?

617
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,268
What are you talking about?

618
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,104
The Sinan pottery.
What are they really worth?

619
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,316
Uh, how can I tell you for certain
without taking a good look at them first?

620
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,151
Come on, I know that's bullshit.

621
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,071
Word's already out.

622
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,073
400,000's chump change.

623
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,783
-Who the hell d'you think you're trying…
-Hey.

624
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,202
-…to take for a ride here?
-Shh! You should keep your voice down.

625
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,829
Get your hands off!

626
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,415
Look, listen. Let's go somewhere
and talk this out.

627
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,499
What's there to say?

628
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,751
- Just come on. Hey!
- Hey, let go!

629
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,422
Look, regardless of the situation,
it's not like I'm not using you for free.

630
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,924
Using me?
What am I to you, a tool?

631
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,551
Oh, please. Calm down.

632
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,054
Honestly, I don't know what
the ceramics are gonna be worth.

633
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,932
I'm taking a gamble here,
so it's not fair for you to accuse me.

634
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,518
How are you gonna sell them
to Chairman Cheon then?

635
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,313
- That's your plan, isn't it?
- Hey…

636
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,231
You already know about everything.

637
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,691
Mr. Song.

638
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:11,276
Just spill it.

639
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,654
After all the drinks
we've had over the years,

640
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,657
do you wanna burn the bridge
between us like this?

641
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,034
Fine. You're right.

642
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,998
The truth is, whether the pottery
is real or fake doesn't matter one bit.

643
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,833
Chairman Cheon's agreed to buy them all.

644
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,128
I've even laid the groundwork. I've
already sold him a few genuine pieces.

645
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,422
I've been working on this
for six months now.

646
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,923
About how many are you selling?

647
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,343
Don't know how many there are,
so whatever we can get.

648
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,053
What if we don't find that many?

649
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,722
I already have a plan for that.

650
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,890
What is it?

651
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,808
Welcome.

652
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,811
-Hey. This one good?
-Oh, here. Please take a seat.

653
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,105
- What would you like?
- Let's have <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

654
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,193
When I first heard
about the pottery in Sinan,

655
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,780
I planted some seedlings.

656
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,658
I'm getting 300 pieces ready
at a fish farm.

657
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,618
Six months
and few hundred barnacles later,

658
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:05,080
they could easily pass
for 200 or 300 years old.

659
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,042
So even if you come up short,
there's that?

660
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,251
Exactly.

661
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,463
So either way, there's always gonna
be enough to sell there.

662
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:18,968
Why not just sell those then?
You're scamming the man anyway.

663
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,136
Hey, now.

664
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,307
When you're scamming, what's the most
important thing you have to do, hmm?

665
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,643
You have to be sincere with them.

666
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,730
You gotta be able to look at them and say,

667
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,191
"This pottery's really from Sinan,
you know."

668
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:36,069
And you've gotta say it
straight from the heart.

669
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,657
Sure. You're not gonna feel guilty
about selling the fake ones?

670
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,908
That's easy.

671
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,577
I'll have the fake ones
and the real ones in one container.

672
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,037
Out of sight, out of mind, you see?

673
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:50,583
And you'll only put
the real ones on display then?

674
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,168
Exactly.

675
00:36:52,669 --> 00:36:55,880
Look here, when two people
sit down and gab face-to-face,

676
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:58,299
it's easy to tell
when they're trying to bullshit you.

677
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,677
Does it look like I'm lying right now?

678
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,473
Wow.

679
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:08,268
Please enjoy.

680
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,021
It's all 'cause I'm being sincere.

681
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:19,279
All right then.

682
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:21,823
Let's up the ante.

683
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,035
-What do you mean?
-I might have looked into it.

684
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,248
This could be big.
Whoever finds it gets to claim it.

685
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,960
Hey, you… Were you working
on this behind my back?

686
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,629
I'm ain't doin' this for a measly 400,000.

687
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,632
-I say we do this right, find some hands.
-Huh?

688
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,761
You can go small
if you wanna keep it for yourself,

689
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:44,971
or we can go for the big money together.

690
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,109
That's one million.

691
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,069
It'll be enough to get a boat,
hire some divers.

692
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,614
And that should cover travel as well.

693
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,160
And, uh, take this guy along.

694
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,244
He works for me.

695
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,371
He's a good kid. Mmm.

696
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,040
Mr. Song,

697
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,751
are you planting eyes on us?

698
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,004
Hey, if we're working together,
we gotta stay in close contact, don't we?

699
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,051
You were saying that you're 28,
am I right?

700
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:24,803
Yeah.

701
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,263
Well, Daesik, here…

702
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,974
uh, w-what are you, 30?

703
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:32,894
I'm 28.

704
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,733
He's, um, a good kid. Mmm.

705
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,778
You two are the same age.

706
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,363
You should get along, you two.

707
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,034
I'm Na Daesik.
Let's try and get along.

708
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,580
Ah.

709
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:56,334
Just so you know, this guy right here,
he knows how to throw a punch.

710
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:57,460
He competed in

711
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,295
the Jecheon County
Amateur Boxing Tournament.

712
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,673
I don't know what it is exactly,

713
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,509
but the look in his eyes
really gets under my skin.

714
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,012
That's not how you should
look at your boss, is it?

715
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,809
Oh, what the hell?

716
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,310
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

717
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,856
Hey, I'm Oh Heedong, and I'm above you.

718
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,691
Ow.

719
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,442
Why do you both have to be like this?

720
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,111
Oh, no, no, it's fine, it's fine.

721
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,280
I-I just need to rest
for one second, okay?

722
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:26,865
-Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-So…

723
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:28,449
…that guy, Cheon.

724
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,576
He has a thing for pottery?

725
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,414
It's not the pottery he's after.

726
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,504
<i>His family moved here from</i>
<i>North Korea after independence,</i>

727
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,965
<i>but soon, they realized</i>
<i>things were no better in Seoul.</i>

728
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,510
<i>The whole family took on</i>
<i>whatever work they could do to get by,</i>

729
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:51,014
<i>and during the war, they made</i>
<i>decent money selling American goods.</i>

730
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,057
<i>Cheon couldn't write,</i>

731
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,976
<i>but spoke English with the best of them.</i>

732
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,479
<i>He started an import business</i>
<i>after befriending American soldiers.</i>

733
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,525
And then some time after that,
he inherited his father's business.

734
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:05,528
That was Heungbaek Plastics,
which became the Heungbaek Corporation.

735
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,822
And it really took off, you know,

736
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:09,991
'cause everyone and their mother
needed plastic.

737
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,244
But as the business grew
and he hired more hands,

738
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,413
that's when a new issue reared its head.

739
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,081
What issue?

740
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,541
Well, he's the head of the company,

741
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,919
but every employee he hired
had way more education.

742
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:24,047
And what do you know, he couldn't
understand anything that they would say.

743
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,009
So what? Does he wanna
re-enroll in school or something?

744
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,011
Well, when his first wife died,
he remarried.

745
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,472
And his new wife,
her suggestion was to open a college.

746
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:35,850
Uh-huh, 'cause that was when there
was a whole thing with enrollment issues.

747
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:37,727
With enrollments?

748
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,020
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

749
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,023
Basically, the state said schools
could only accept ten students.

750
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,233
And wouldn't you know,
some chose to ignore that.

751
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:46,069
Then when the government pointed it out,

752
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,237
the schools said,
"Just let the students stay."

753
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:52,033
It was then Cheon's new wife saw this
as an opportunity to make quick cash

754
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,327
and badgered him into
starting a school right away.

755
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,245
With tuition fees and state funding,

756
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,623
can you imagine how much money
they can make?

757
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,750
Well, now,
there's a racket.

758
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,379
So Cheon started putting together
his college, but he needed something else.

759
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,297
"What about an antiques museum?"

760
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:07,966
That's why he needs antiques.

761
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,676
That's the interest in pottery, huh?

762
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:10,760
Exactly.

763
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,972
How impressive would he look
to have a huge museum right in his school?

764
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,391
Wow.

765
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:20,311
Well, after hearing all that, seems like
we got ourselves a good target here.

766
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,398
That aside,
the big challenge isn't Cheon,

767
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,816
it's that wife of his, really.

768
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,901
She's no ordinary lady.

769
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,778
For 132 workers,

770
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,613
that comes out to 264,000 won.

771
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,615
<i>She graduated from</i>
<i>a commercial high school</i>

772
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,784
<i>and joined Heungbaek Plastics</i>
<i>as a bookkeeper.</i>

773
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,121
<i>And it was her innate sharpness</i>
<i>that caught Cheon's eye.</i>

774
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,373
ESTIMATE - CHEONGSU
GENERAL HARDWARE AND SUPPLIES

775
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:42,959
Those numbers are off.

776
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,962
It should be 5,618,245.

777
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:49,382
Well, you see, we report lower numbers
for subcontractors each quarter,

778
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,426
then make up the difference
in the following one.

779
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,552
What's the reason for this?

780
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,179
That's just how we've always done it.

781
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,432
Then where are
the records of those differences?

782
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:00,852
Oh, that's…

783
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,730
It's fine. You can go.

784
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,190
Yes, sir.

785
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,407
Don't tell me.

786
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,658
You took that money?

787
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:19,662
Well, you need some slush funds, right?
If you're running a company, that is.

788
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,957
You're awfully good
at sneaking around.

789
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,668
Just focus on
getting the college running, okay?

790
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,589
When will I get approval
from the Ministry?

791
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,215
Well, I wish I knew.

792
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,634
They're just dragging
their feet at this point.

793
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:36,137
Sounds soon, though,
from the way they talk.

794
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,556
Well, I think a dinner
would go a long way.

795
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,809
Just sending some money
doesn't seem very sincere, does it?

796
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:44,771
Just be patient
a little longer.

797
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,607
We need to make ourselves
look good first, don't we?

798
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,900
You're talking about the museum.

799
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,444
If money's all we got,
they'll never approve.

800
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,113
It'll all go straight to pot,
and we can forget it.

801
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:56,532
All right.
Just let me be involved in this as well.

802
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,244
It costs a fortune to build a museum.

803
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,372
And we're not going to see any return,
so we should budget accordingly.

804
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:08,795
ORIENTAL ART GALLERY

805
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,466
That Daesik guy rubs me the wrong way.

806
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:16,969
I bet he and Song go way back, you know?

807
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,556
Guess Song's still holding things
close to his chest.

808
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,017
You know better than to trust that guy.

809
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,644
What do you think?

810
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,562
-About what?
-This job.

811
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:28,064
You've got a good instincts.

812
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,115
Wow, take a look at this.

813
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:39,617
All of these were found in Sinan.

814
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,578
They're displaying them
at a new museum in Gwangju.

815
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,331
The groundbreaking ceremony
is taking place

816
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,959
over in Maegok-dong, Gwangju, it says.

817
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,545
They've dug up
a thousand pieces already?

818
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,506
-Do you think there are any left?
-Are a thousand pieces

819
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,966
really that exciting?

820
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,009
Come to my factory then.

821
00:43:57,093 --> 00:43:59,011
We've got thousands of stoves.

822
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,057
See, with stoves,
the prices are fixed, aren't they?

823
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,268
With pottery, the sky's the limit.

824
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,646
So don't forget to take me along
when you go to buy them.

825
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,815
I can spot a fraud from a mile away.

826
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,777
How do you know
if someone's a fraud?

827
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,071
It's all in the scent.
They smell fishy.

828
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,159
Did your ex-husband
sell a lot of fish or something?

829
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,162
Not exactly, but you aren't far off.

830
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,831
He had a fishing vessel.
He would use it for cons.

831
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:31,043
This has to be the one that sank
in the Indian Ocean I bet, right?

832
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,378
I'm surprised you knew.

833
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,255
Well, of course I knew.

834
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:39,010
If he was able to scam you,
he's no ordinary grifter, is he?

835
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:42,263
I didn't get conned. He did.

836
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:43,347
What?

837
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,349
Oh, it's nothing.

838
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,060
Why are you asking
so many questions though?

839
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:50,897
- What are you jealous about?
- Jealous?

840
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,231
That's ridiculous.

841
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:55,943
Anyway, didn't you say they
were heading down today to Mokpo?

842
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:58,279
- Is that today? It's Thursday?
- Yes.

843
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,158
I think you should show your face there.
It's good for morale if nothing else.

844
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,869
Is that really necessary?

845
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,247
People even steal rice
from Buddha. Keeping a close eye is needed

846
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,249
with all that pottery there.
It's too tempting.

847
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,045
You have a point.

848
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,215
Where's Jeonchul, by the way?

849
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:19,967
Why do you wanna know?

850
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,807
SEOUL STATION

851
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,686
<i>The train to Mokpo</i>
<i>will be departing shortly.</i>

852
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,105
- Thank you.
- Next, please.

853
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:34,690
1 EXPRESS, PUNGNYEON
2 EXPRESS, JEUNGSAN

854
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,235
- Hi, can I get three tickets?
- Three for Mokpo?

855
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,077
Be careful with your gout.

856
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,120
No drinking. Not a drop. Got it?

857
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,122
Yes, sir.

858
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,376
Since you're working together,
try and get along, huh?

859
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,753
Can you stop poking his eyes?

860
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:57,964
Let's do our best.

861
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,800
Oh, come on, don't--

862
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,010
- We're off.
- Wait… hold on a second.

863
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,096
-Cheon is on his way here.
-He is? Why?

864
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,306
He said he wanted to meet you
before you go.

865
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,477
- Why the hell would he wanna do that?
- Once you get to Mokpo, here,

866
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,771
one of my friends is staying at this inn.

867
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,314
PEACE INN

868
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:18,192
He's from Gwangju.
He'll help you with the appraisal, okay?

869
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:21,070
Be sure to call every day now.

870
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,655
This is getting uncomfortable.

871
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:25,241
Look sharp. There he is.

872
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,832
Chairman Cheon, glad you could make it.

873
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,626
Well,
I heard your men were leaving today.

874
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,171
-I'm just here to wish them good luck.
-Oh, you didn't have to do all that, sir.

875
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,967
Oh, this here…
This is the man who's in charge.

876
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,428
- Oh. Hmm.
- I'm Oh Gwanseok.

877
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,763
It's a pleasure to meet you.

878
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,557
We've already met, haven't we?

879
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,105
Ah.

880
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,107
Uh, right.

881
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,901
And, uh, these are his assistants.

882
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,153
Say hello.

883
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,821
Hello, sir!

884
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,535
I also have someone to introduce.

885
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,996
You'll be working together.
This is Mr. Im.

886
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,583
- Im Jeonchul, hey.
- Huh?

887
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,626
He's tagging along with us?

888
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,712
- Yes.
- Mrs. Yang,

889
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:23,132
you were really that worried about us?
Uh, we already have a full team, yeah?

890
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,969
Well, he's a pottery expert, you see.
So I'm sure he'll be helpful on this trip.

891
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:28,679
Oh, I see.

892
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,391
Uh, can we, uh,
talk for a minute?

893
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:33,684
Y-Yes, of course, sir.

894
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,443
So what is it that you do?

895
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,320
I do pottery.

896
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,365
Yeah,
so what does that mean exactly?

897
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,285
I'm getting a little offended here.

898
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,870
I just do what I do, all right?

899
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,705
Anything else, none of your business.

900
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,290
I know I said he was an expert.

901
00:47:56,374 --> 00:48:00,211
In reality, he's just going on our behalf,
so he won't get in the way.

902
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,545
Just try to get along.

903
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,715
Great, now there's two guys, here,
who "won't get in the way," huh?

904
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,929
-How old are you?
-39, Year of the Rabbit.

905
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,098
Okay, I'm a lot older.

906
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,975
And you two, he's older,
so act accordingly.

907
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,145
Right. Uh, it's nice to meet you.

908
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,772
I'm Na Daesik, sir.

909
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,234
You too.

910
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,654
Nice to meet you.

911
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,578
And how do you know each other?

912
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,624
-Oh, this, here, is my nephew.
-What's your name?

913
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,795
Hey, she asked you a question.

914
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,715
You little shit.

915
00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:47,925
No, it's fine.

916
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,844
Just do what they say.

917
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,556
- Whatever job they ask you of you.
- Ma'am.

918
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,725
His name is Oh Heedong, ma'am.

919
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,727
Hey, go get another ticket.

920
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,648
Move it, kid.

921
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:04,942
Go. Go.

922
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,445
Hi there.

923
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,450
-Hey, Gwanseok, let's talk for a second.
-Hey, what's with all the secrets, huh?

924
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,034
-Hurry. Over here.
-What is it?

925
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,581
Once you get there,
there's another job to do.

926
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,168
What? What is it?

927
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,254
One for Mokpo.

928
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,310
These seats are empty.

929
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,072
- Oh, uh…
- Grab a seat anywhere.

930
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,330
Go read somewhere else.

931
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,500
- What was that?
- Move.

932
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:03,709
What are you doing?

933
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,336
What do you mean?

934
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:07,463
Hey, man.

935
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:13,219
The book you threw…
It just nearly hit me in the eye.

936
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,596
Hey, asshole.
Where's your fuckin' apology?

937
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,014
Just gonna stare all day?

938
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,517
Just apologize. Don't make a scene.

939
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,060
What was that?

940
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,606
-Apologize.
-Hey, sit down.

941
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,817
Sit your ass down.

942
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,319
He said to sit.

943
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,571
- You fucking…
- Hey.

944
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:34,323
Fucking son of a bitch.

945
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,492
I'm still waiting here.

946
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:38,827
Look, you ignorant asshole.

947
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,998
I threw you a book,
so read it or wipe your ass with it.

948
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,001
Unless you wanna throw down.

949
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:51,549
Hey. Ask around in Iri,
"Who's the baddest fucker in the city?"

950
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,386
What? You think I'm scared of a few scars?

951
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,764
You should take a good look
at this one right here.

952
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,848
You ever been shot?

953
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:04,061
Hey. Did your balls fall off,
you piece of shit?

954
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:07,565
Did you get what you wanted then?

955
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,900
I had a lot of work for him over here.

956
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,530
You told me we need
to keep an eye on them.

957
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,699
You're right. I did.
We could've sent anyone.

958
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,784
Why did you send Jeonchul there?

959
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,452
Hold on.

960
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,247
Why can't I send my own employee?

961
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:27,042
What's with this tone?
What's gotten into you?

962
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,044
Now, now, wait just a minute.

963
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,381
You always get so worked up
any time it involves him.

964
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,508
-What's going on there, huh?
-Nothing.

965
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:38,804
Jeonchul's my right hand, and you just
sent him away. Do you understand?

966
00:51:42,391 --> 00:51:44,977
-Kim, listen.
-Yes, sir.

967
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,313
I want you to be her right hand.

968
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,732
And do whatever she asks of you, okay?

969
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,816
Yes, sir. I will.

970
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,986
Anyway, the people that we met…

971
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,822
What a strong impression.

972
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,826
This isn't the kind of work
for soft guys, is it?

973
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,578
You're right.

974
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,456
I do hope they get along.

975
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,723
Assholes!
