00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,567
Kim, get me the receipts.

00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:28,695
- Yes, sir.
- Jungsook.

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,030
-Yes?
-Get me a cup of coffee.

00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,114
Oh, sure.

- Thank you.

12
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,621
The president needs
those financial statements.

13
00:01:20,956 --> 00:01:22,332
-Jungsook.
-Yes?

14
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,709
The statements.

15
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,836
Right.

if they've announced

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,355
where they're moving the capital to yet?

20

Daejeon, Cheongju, Yongmun, Cheonan,

27
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,165
-that's worth keeping an eye on.
-Yeah?

28

That's what I heard at least.

a new school couldn't hurt.

31
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,259
Well, I wonder…

32
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,228

- Excuse me.
- What can I get you?

45
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,350
Uh… I'd like some eggs and…

46
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,143
- This?
- I'll take two.

47
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,436
You want two eggs?

48
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,022
Uh… You hungry? Eat this.

49
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,900
I don't like eggs. They smell.

50
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,695
Uh… Would you like an egg, sir?

51
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,573
No, thanks. You can have it.

52
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:25,784
Uh… Hey, you want one?

53
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,331
Guess I'll just eat on my own.

-<i>Please make sure to take…</i>

58
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,676
Okay.

59
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,428
<i>Once the train has</i>
<i>come to a complete stop…</i>

60
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,907
Here you go.
Come on, let's go.

61
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,996
Damn, that was cramped.

62
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,331
Ah… There's that salt.

63
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,375
Smell that air.

64
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,628
It's really boiling
down here. Guess that's the south for you.

65
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:21,089
What's the plan?
We're going straight to the inn?

66
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,382
Yeah? Is that okay?

67
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,886
Yeah. Perfect. Mm-hmm.

68
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,178
Hey, Jeonchul.

69
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,056
Keep posing like that,

70
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,684
and the local gangsters might come
and kick your ass.

71
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,061
Come here.

72
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,774
Okay.

73
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,860
Obviously we're gonna draw attention here.

74
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,196
So listen.
Let's just grab the stuff and bail.

75
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,407
Sir.

76
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,618
Now that's what I like to hear.

77
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:51,453
Let's go.

78
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,248
Here's the address.

79
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,836
PEACE INN

80
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,129
"Peace Inn." This is it.

81
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,840
What kind of inn
is tucked away like this?

82
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,635
- Hello?
- Welcome in.

83
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,136
Hi, good afternoon.

84
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,140
Is there a Ha Yeongsu staying here?

85
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,643
Oh! Seoul folks, ain't ya?

86
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,561
I reckon he's over there.

87
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,812
Thank you.

88
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,695
Excuse me.

89
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,782
You in there?

90
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,158
Who is out there?

91
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,119
Oh.

92
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,414
-How are you? Are you Mr. Ha?
-That's right.

93
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,499
HA YEONGSU

94
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,043
Mr. Song should've told you
we were on our way. I'm Oh Gwanseok.

95
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,003
Would you look at that.

96
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,131
Y'all city folk look real badass,
don't you?

97
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,716
How much schooling did you get?

98
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,842
Huh?

99
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,302
School.

100
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,640
Well, actually I dropped out.

101
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,101
I could tell, looking at your face.

102
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,603
You can read someone like that
just by looking at their face?

103
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,105
Fuck if I can.

104
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,608
I'm getting some really bad vibes.

105
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,402
What sign are you?

106
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,612
-Huh?
-Your zodiac sign.

107
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,407
Year of the Pig, '35.

108
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,409
I was born in the Year of the Tiger,

109
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,953
the Month of the Tiger,
the Hour of the Tiger.

110
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,455
Even though the day was off,

111
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,457
I'm definitely a tiger.

112
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:22,585
Taking orders is the one thing
I couldn't do.

113
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,756
You see, not once have I ever
let anyone boss me around.

114
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,134
Don't believe it?

115
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:40,353
- This body, it's got a lot of history.
- Oh.

116
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,688
Jeonchul,

117
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,108
- weren't you hot?
- What?

118
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,152
You should probably cool off.

119
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,447
Right.

120
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,417
-Where's the tap?
-Uh…

121
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,630
Start unpacking.

122
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,632
-Where's the bathroom?
-O-Over there.

123
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,260
Uh… It's over this way, I think.

124
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,929
So how was the pottery first discovered?

125
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,557
Well,
when fisherman would go out to fish,

126
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,769
now and then, they'd get a piece
stuck in their nets,

127
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,896
- give 'em the heebie-jeebies.
- Huh?

128
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,065
'Cause back in the day,
when you die at sea…

129
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,026
<i>They'd send you off</i>
<i>with pottery?</i>

130
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,862
<i>Well, you still gotta eat</i>
<i>in the afterlife, don't you?</i>

131
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,406
<i>So they're buried at sea with everything,</i>

132
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,867
<i>- spoons, chopsticks, you name it.</i>
- Huh?

133
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,745
I can't believe this.
Just my luck.

134
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,123
<i>This one guy was just using it</i>
<i>as a dog bowl,</i>

135
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,876
<i>when one day, his brother,</i>
<i>a grade school teacher,</i>

136
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,629
<i>came over</i>
<i>and thought it looked it was valuable.</i>

137
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,715
-So he reported it to the county office.
-County? Why?

138
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,884
'Cause it looked important,
hence the county.

139
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:57,055
He must have figured it was valuable
and went after the reward. See?

140
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,307
- Mmm.
- Yeah. But what fucking reward?

141
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,226
They gave him jack shit.

142
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,063
Then the Cultural Heritage Administration
showed up to look at the bowl.

143
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,275
They could tell it was Chinese
and decided it was from the Yuan Dynasty.

144
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,612
Now, what's the biggest mystery?

145
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,531
Huh? Huh?

146
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,617
What is all this Chinese pottery
doing here?

147
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,245
Exactly.
Give me those cigarettes.

148
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,959
You see, back then,
China used to do trade.

149
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,502
In Japan,

150
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,628
JAPAN

151
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,712
Goryeo,

152
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:30,797
GORYEO

153
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,881
and India.

154
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,550
INDIA - CHINA

155
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,177
But there was no way
to sail straight from China to Japan.

156
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,221
Why? I mean, what did they have?

157
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,515
Not motors. They relied on wind.

158
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,767
But the wind don't blow your way.

159
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:47,564
That's why the Chinese, they stopped
at Sinan on their way to Japan.

160
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,648
SINAN

161
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,402
So then,
this was their stopover, right?

162
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,112
- That's right.
- Mmm.

163
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,657
And then one day,
the wind blew crazy strong.

164
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,411
And Sinan is known to be surrounded
by islands, right?

165
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,955
The currents are rough,
and the waves are high.

166
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,249
The wind was going this way and that way.

167
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,668
And then the boat they were on
smashed into pieces.

168
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,129
-Mm-hmm.
-Have you seen it, old man?

169
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,674
You don't have to see everything
to get the idea.

170
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,801
Do you have to look
before you wipe your ass?

171
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,761
You don't
'cause you already know it's there.

172
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,055
This is bullshit.

173
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:24,767
We're here to find the pottery,
not sit through a fucking history lesson.

174
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,020
Digging at the location of the pottery

175
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,397
could send you to an early grave,
you fool.

176
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,191
What did you just say?

177
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,318
You trying to put a curse on us
or something, you shit?

178
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,236
What's wrong with you?

179
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,322
Don't get your knickers in a twist.

180
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,032
I was just saying.

181
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,116
Hi, sir.

182
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,203
Yeah. Everything's fine.

183
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,370
HAESEONG STORE

184
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,415
It's like I'm in school.
I have no idea what they're talking about.

185
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:50,376
Yeah, uh, all right. Okay.

186
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,544
Take care.

187
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,675
- All right.
- Thank you.

188
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,927
Oh, yeah.

189
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,681
You can go ahead.

190
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,934
I'll be a while, I'm calling home.

191
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,020
Then do you mind giving me space?

192
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,482
I'll use the one at the inn.

193
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,537
Damn.
He was one good-looking fella.

194
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,374
-Who was?
-The young one I mean.

195
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,920
He's got fair skin
and a nice looking face too.

196
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,048
Yeah, but he's pretty ignorant
about the world.

197
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:41,135
Well, I was a real
Casanova too, you know, back in the day.

198
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,347
Oh, wow. What's this
"back in the day" all of a sudden?

199
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:54,899
Cheon residence.

200
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,359
Hi.

201
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,320
- It's for you. It's Jeonchul.
- Hmm.

202
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,658
Jeonchul, have you started?

203
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,743
<i>No, sir. Not yet.</i>

204
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,120
What's the hold-up?

205
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,206
We just got here, unpacked and
talked to some locals about the pottery.

206
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,500
<i>They're not acting</i>
<i>suspicious, are they?</i>

207
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,795
-They're not.
-Then the guy who's in charge,

208
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,631
looks like he knows
how to handle business.

209
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:20,800
You should try and get in with him.

210
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,094
- Yes, sir.
<i>- All right.</i>

211
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,681
Hey, hey. Go ahead
and get some athlete's foot cream, okay?

212
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,350
Sir?

213
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,978
<i> No, no,</i>
<i>I wasn't talking to you.</i>

214
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,229
<i>Keep an eye on them.</i>

215
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,064
<i>See if they pull any bullshit.</i>

216
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:36,858
Right.

217
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,609
They're money-grubbers, aren't they?

218
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,823
See, the clever ones, they always
got a trick up their sleeves, a big hand.

219
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,075
You understand?

220
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,494
And bitches and assholes,
they're all the same.

221
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,414
I'll keep that in mind.

222
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,374
<i>Well, don't get too hung up on it.</i>

223
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,835
<i>Just need you to get me results.</i>

224
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,756
Yes, I understand.
I'll call you later, sir.

225
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,761
Here you go. Keep the change.

226
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,849
You done with your call?

227
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,435
Thought I asked for some space.

228
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,937
I wasn't listening in, okay?

229
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,483
Look, you little bitch.

230
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,402
If I say give me some space,
that means fuck off.

231
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,156
Hey, I'm trying to be nice here,
you piece of shit.

232
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,657
So lose the fucking attitude.

233
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,452
Wow, I'm about to lose my mind here.

234
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,747
A dumbass like you doesn't
exactly have a mind to lose,

235
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,831
you stupid fuck.

236
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,375
If you keep pushing me,
then I'll cut you to pieces

237
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,752
and feed you to the fucking fish.

238
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,837
Oh, you're gonna feed the fish?
Where you doing that?

239
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,673
Do you know how many fish farms we have
in this country?

240
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,093
-You ever had oysters?
-You think oysters are fish?

241
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,552
Now I know you're a fucking idiot.

242
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,096
Wait, what?

243
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,639
Hey, good to see you.

244
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,724
Uh…

245
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,975
Thought you were in Seoul.

246
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,520
We-we just got here.

247
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,688
You should've come by
when you got in.

248
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,565
I want to hear about Seoul.

249
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,567
What? Was the café around here?

250
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,320
No, it weren't.
The café is over yonder there.

251
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,948
-What the hell?
-Heedong.

252
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,158
You didn't introduce us?

253
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,868
Oh, uh…

254
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,495
Your name is Heedong, huh?

255
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,498
Dang, if that ain't a Seoul name…

256
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,626
Remember your promise.
Don't forget it now, you hear?

257
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,462
I'll be off now.

258
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,050
Ah, shit.

259
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,886
You were already here?

260
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,971
Who is that?

261
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,222
Just a girl I met earlier.

262
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,057
So you have been here before?

263
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,142
For what?

264
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:39,147
Hey. You boys trying something here?

265
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,524
And watch who you call "boy," you asshole!

266
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,527
Keeps on running his damn mouth.

267
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,320
Really pissing me off.

268
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,406
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

269
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:51,951
Guess who's back.

270
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,703
Took ya long enough.

271
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,497
Oh, and just when I thought I was finished
with the dishes, you bring more.

272
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,791
- I can finish here.
- No, it's fine.

273
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,211
Just go clean up the washroom a little
before the boss bitches again.

274
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,338
- So hey.
- Hmm?

275
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,382
You know,
that guy from Seoul is back here.

276
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,718
Who? The third cousin?

277
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,512
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, what's he doing back here?

278
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,097
Think I caught his eye?

279
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:16,017
You're laughing.
I'm getting my feelings hurt here.

280
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,227
No, that ain't it though.

281
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,314
He was talking with another guy.
They were gonna throw down too.

282
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,149
What's he gonna throw down for?

283
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,235
He didn't look like
he was a sailor or nothing.

284
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,196
It's probably about the pottery.

285
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,198
What? Pottery?

286
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,617
You don't really need to know.

287
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,871
That little string bean never misses
a chance to mess with me.

288
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,873
Does she now?

289
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,001
I still think he's here for me.

290
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,461
You caught nothing out there?

291
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,296
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Ah, shoot.

292
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,548
You still gotta eat dinner, don't you?

293
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:50,885
- <i>I'm just gonna get some soju.</i>
- I'll join you.

294
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,679
-<i>You know the bar by the underpass?</i>
-Uh-huh. I know it.

295
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,140
-<i>I'll see you soon.</i>
-Yeah, yeah. I'll see you there then.

296
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,391
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay.

297
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:02,396
He got back from fishing just now.

298
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,690
He's pissed off
he didn't catch a single thing.

299
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,817
What's the captain's boat like?

300
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,445
Well, the boat's a ten-tonner.

301
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,447
But it's not his boat.

302
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,366
His pop's the captain of it.

303
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,035
But if you'd call Taesan "Captain,"
he'd like it.

304
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,453
Let's go.

305
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,041
- Hey, you're here.
- Hey.

306
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,668
Well, let's take everyone then.

307
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,835
They've got to eat too.

308
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,005
Yeah, yeah. Have it your way.

309
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,840
- Guys, let's go eat.
- Oh, okay.

310
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,551
- You doing okay?
- Yeah.

311
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,849
Dang, there's a whopper right here.

312
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42,019
Ah, you're already here.

313
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,688
- Hello. Come on in.
- Hi, hi.

314
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,648
Hey. Come over here.

315
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,568
I'll introduce ya.

316
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,403
This is Captain Hwang.

317
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,487
CAPTAIN HWANG

318
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,905
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

319
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,950
This here, Oh Gwanseok from Seoul.

320
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,452
This is the guy my good friend sent down.

321
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,747
These guys,
they're his juniors.

322
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:02,873
Come on. Say hi.

323
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,542
- Uh… Hello.
- Hi.

324
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,336
You didn't reel in much, I heard.

325
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,589
We haul up. "Reel in" is angler talk, see.

326
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:10,673
Mmm…

327
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,219
Uh… Nowadays,
you get a lot of croakers, right?

328
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,597
Right now,
it's all pomfrets, not croakers.

329
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,766
Hey, missus. Grill up some pomfrets.

330
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,685
Don't chuck the heads, just crisp them up.

331
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,021
-I eat them whole.
-Sure thing.

332
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,897
-Yeah.
-You guys can…

333
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,150
Uh… You can sit right over there.

334
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,484
Oh… Yeah.

335
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,570
- Thank you so much.
- Okay. See you later.

336
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,238
All right, let's sit down.

337
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,578
Who was that girl from earlier?

338
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,163
The truth is

339
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,832
I'm seeing this other girl in town
and that's why I've been here before.

340
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,251
What? You got a chick
all the way down here?

341
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,671
Yeah, when we broke up,
I couldn't get over her, you know?

342
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,424
Came down to see her,
but she had already moved on.

343
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,967
That's when I met the café girl.

344
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,095
Wow, you really are a piece of shit.

345
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,389
Did you start chasing
another girl already?

346
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,976
Look, you gotta seriously reflect on this.

347
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,686
Sit in that misery.

348
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:08,064
Trying to find out where you fucked up
and how, huh?

349
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,358
All that shit, you fucking manwhore.

350
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,859
You fucking…

351
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,322
Here. You ain't drinking today?

352
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,240
Nah, not right now.

353
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,408
Hmm…

354
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,496
- You trying to find pottery?
- Yeah.

355
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,874
Check it, Jeungdo and Dodeokdo is here.

356
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,126
There's a tidal creek in the middle.

357
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:33,714
And the water flows between
Jido, Imjado, and Sudo here like this.

358
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,508
It's deep, 20 meters or so.

359
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,301
That is deep.

360
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,221
- Wow. Twenty meters.
- Yep.

361
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,350
And with a deep creek comes
crazy currents, muddy as hell.

362
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,354
And when it becomes all muddy like that,
visibility is shit.

363
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,232
-Digging there is gonna be a bitch.
-Fridays are for drinking.

364
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,817
Get your ass in there.

365
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,443
Whoa, Taesan.

366
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,570
Hey. Did you just get back from fishing?

367
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,739
- Yeah, yeah.
- You got company here?

368
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,784
- These here are Seoul folk, you know.
- Ah…

369
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,245
Oh. What's this?
Look what the cat dragged in.

370
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,416
What is a city slicker
doing all the way out here?

371
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,378
Who knows what big city men
get up to? Have a seat and drink.

372
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,589
It's cool.
Y'all just keep having your discussion.

373
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,717
I'm gonna drink over here with these boys.

374
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,887
Sit.

375
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,514
Wow, we meet again.

376
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,517
I hope you don't mind if we sit here.

377
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,478
And if you do, you can let me know.
No problem.

378
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,981
- Here you are. Enjoy, all right?
- Thanks.

379
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,733
Dang, it's a pomfret.

380
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,444
Hey, Boss. Do you knock back a few drinks
with these guys?

381
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:38,237
Of course we should.

382
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,321
-Go get it.
-On it, Boss.

383
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,157
-And get a cold one.
-Yeah.

384
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,577
Seems like you haven't had pomfret before.

385
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,704
Do you even know how to eat it?

386
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,539
Uh… Where are the glasses, you idiot?

387
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,999
Glasses. Right.

388
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,502
Hey, get us a bottle
and some glasses too.

389
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,587
Yes, sir.

390
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,465
-You plan on drinking?
-How do you talk without a drink?

391
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,759
I don't drink when I'm working.

392
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,595
- Here you go.
- Mmm.

393
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,722
Mmm.

394
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:08,809
Anyway, what I'm saying is I think
you're wasting your fucking time here.

395
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,061
Even if you take a boat
out there and dive in,

396
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,980
you can't do it in a night.

397
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,734
So what?

398
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:21,906
Well, at first, you were paying me enough
to take you out there

399
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,908
and get some fresh air while I was at it.

400
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:27,286
That place, though, is a damn mess.
We can't do it.

401
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,040
What is this? I already made a deal
with your pop though.

402
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,458
You can't back out now.

403
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,584
Whatever.

404
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,378
I'm the one driving the boat
while he's laying there in bed.

405
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,923
What's the point in saying anything
to that sick old man?

406
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,132
Oh, shit!

407
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,384
Stop picking at it.

408
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,928
Enough of this.

409
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,180
Take your spoon and get a real bite,
why don't ya?

410
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,892
I'm really starting to lose my appetite
just watching you.

411
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,185
What are you, a kid?

412
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,442
What? What the fuck are you staring at?

413
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,737
Lose the glare, you little shit.

414
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,668
Y'all have had pomfret, have you not?

415
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:19,213
Have you tried it before?
Ah… It's so nice and savory.

416
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,548
See? I'm telling you.

417
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,883
It doesn't get any better
than this right here.

418
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,350
Hey, you do know how to eat it.

419
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,394
You're gonna choke. Slow down.

420
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,938
At least get the bones out
before you take a bite.

421
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,857
Nobody told you to eat like a sailor.

422
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,361
Got something you wanna share
with the rest of the class?

423
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,905
- Ah, fuck.
- Whoa, man.

424
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,115
That's a switchblade, yo!

425
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,701
Hot damn, Boss.
That's expensive as shit.

426
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,995
Hey, Beolgu. Check this out.
You push this right here,

427
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,288
and the knife flips out.

428
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,164
- Oh, really?
- Check it.

429
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,916
Whoa, look at that.

430
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,501
I've always wanted one of these.

431
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,044
Watch this.

432
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,379
You do this and then…

433
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,630
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.

434
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,048
The blade just shoots right out.

435
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,466
That's awesome, huh.

436
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,552
Hey, city folks.

437
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,722
Care to step outside?

438
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:13,517
What are you doing?

439
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,686
If you've got guests from out of town,

440
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,772
you're supposed to give them
a warm welcome, aren't you?

441
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,404
-Is this the Mokpo greeting?
-I think he's getting angry.

442
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,407
Dang, he's so pale.

443
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,622
If you wanna see the Chungcheong fist,
then go right ahead.

444
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,585
You've got one hell of a crazy look
in your eyes, you clown.

445
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,129
-We going out?
-Sure.

446
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,589
Eh?

447
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,049
Let's do this then.

448
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,675
- Dang.
- Come on. Let's go outside.

449
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,345
- You, outside.
- Come on guys, let's do it.

450
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,146
Make it quick.

451
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,861
Wow.

452
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,738
Dang, look at his footwork.

453
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,116
Let's go.

454
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,120
-You the boss here?
-Yeah, that's right, guy.

455
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,581
Yeah? Well, I'm a boxer, you fu--

456
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,627
-No way.
-Check out how awkward his stance is.

457
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,587
Where'd you learn to box?

458
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,215
Fucking asshole. Lose the knife.

459
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,508
What did you just say?

460
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,927
I said lose the knife, you fucking pussy.

461
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,513
-You son of a…
-You're losing your shit--

462
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,931
Quit it!

463
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,857
Quit what?

464
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,693
Quit what, huh?

465
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,113
Hey, what did we do exactly?

466
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,406
Nothing yet.

467
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,453
You're gonna need a few divers for this.

468
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,582
Don't worry about that, I'll handle it.

469
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,336
-What is it that you want?
-How 'bout half.

470
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,088
Half of what?

471
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,632
What do you think, man?
Half the pot.

472
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,137
You fucking kidding me right now?

473
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,849
Even if we dig up every last one, that
don't mean we can just cash in like that.

474
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,184
Gotta find a buyer with a lot of dough.

475
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:22,646
And you gotta be able to close the deal.
You're not the only one working here.

476
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,356
Look. What I'm saying is

477
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,151
without us,
this job completely falls apart.

478
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,112
One of us ain't any more important
than the others.

479
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:34,533
If you believe all it takes is rolling up
your pants, then well,

480
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,244
- knock yourselves out.
- Son of a…

481
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,584
Besides, only a handful of people
were there.

482
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,170
Not even the navy knew how to find it.

483
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,548
Had to go over to the prison to grab one
of the divers there to figure it out.

484
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,052
Not just anyone can find this shit.

485
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,261
MEASURING WITH EYES

486
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,847
So you're saying
our chance at failure is high?

487
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,098
That's right.

488
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,517
We could sell it ourselves
if we wanted to.

489
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,145
If we had the money,
we would dig it up ourselves too.

490
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,271
Wouldn't even need you.

491
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,903
Fine. All right.

492
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,321
We hear what you're saying.

493
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,532
Since you're so confident
you know how to sell what we'll find,

494
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,577
I'll give you 30% of all of it.

495
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,454
Thirty percent?

496
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,083
-Think I can't do it?
-The expenses for the job,

497
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,876
we'll handle all of it.

498
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,962
So if we haul in 100, I'm giving you 30.

499
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,672
Go sell them yourself.

500
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,805
I'm sure that there are big shots
down here in Mokpo for sure.

501
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,473
The only thing is that it's pottery.

502
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,392
So no matter the value,
people don't just throw money at it.

503
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,813
Except in Seoul. Seoul is the only place.

504
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,065
Seoul is the only place you can sell it.

505
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,235
And do you know how many it takes
to sell pottery there?

506
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:56,907
We need a captain, several workers,
a manager to oversee them.

507
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,202
We'll need divers to swim under.
And when they find the pottery,

508
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,123
we'll need an expert for the appraisal
a delivery guy and a broker to store it,

509
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,250
and a go-between for the buyer.

510
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,918
And who even knows who wants it.

511
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,255
They could be a trader
or some sort of politician.

512
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,133
Soon enough,
the middlemen will just keep increasing.

513
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,926
Then even if you get the highest price,

514
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,178
who knows how much
you're taking home though, huh?

515
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,766
After all that work,
you might score big, or get jack shit.

516
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,103
I'm glad you can actually sell it.
Go for it if you want.

517
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:28,897
But I wonder how much
you'll walk away with.

518
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,944
Beolgu. What are you doin' here?

519
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,529
- Sir!
- Oh, sir.

520
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,406
- Oh, sir. Good to see ya.
- Yeah, yeah.

521
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,575
Listen.

522
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,410
Park is gonna butcher a cow.

523
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,037
-Wanna head over there with us right now?
-Oh, the guy from Seongmigol?

524
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,122
- Really?
- Yeah.

525
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,207
Wow, I bet
he's having a party or somethin'.

526
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,876
- That's right, son.
- Right.

527
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:51,169
You guys go ahead. I'll catch up after.

528
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,464
What's the matter with him?
Why's he shirtless?

529
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:57,634
Oh, uh, yeah.
Uh, this fella always runs hot, you know?

530
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,345
I can spot bullshit from a mile away.

531
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,557
Hey, uh, you kids
aren't doin' nothing wrong, are ya?

532
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,183
Nah, it's not like that.

533
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,311
Don't worry about it and go enjoy.

534
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,438
- All right then. I'll see you later.
- Sure.

535
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,398
I'd love to come.
Do you think I could tag along?

536
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,525
Ugh, don't you have things to do?

537
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,902
Right. Good day, sir.

538
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,654
Chief constable there.

539
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,032
Him and I go back aways.

540
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,117
Good to have a guy like that
in your corner.

541
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,121
You animals
are really territorial, huh?

542
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,956
This fucking guy.

543
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,793
Oh, yeah?

544
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,966
Hey, go over there
and grab me a piece of wood.

545
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,051
Yes, sir.

546
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:42,638
How much we talkin'?

547
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,057
Million.

548
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,101
The most I could squeeze
out of the money man.

549
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,437
-A million.
-Yeah?

550
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,106
And if we're counting expenses
then double that. Two mil.

551
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,156
Think on it for a bit.

552
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,367
You know that's not pocket change.

553
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,205
What's there to think about?
This is straight-up bullshit, man.

554
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,463
If you get rid of the bastards
who are starting shit with my guys,

555
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,175
it's big money…
that two million.

556
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,474
- Right here, bitch.
- All right, city slicker.

557
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,892
-Let's go.
-Can tell by your breath, asshole.

558
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,102
Ready to get your ass beat, son of a--

559
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,604
What you gonna do, huh?

560
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,689
What are you doin'?

561
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,358
Hey, Honggi.

562
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:41,989
What's goin' on here?

563
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,324
SIM HONGGI

564
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,494
Let's see it.

565
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,999
<i>I pledge,</i>
<i>in front of the proud Taegeuk flag,</i>

566
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,335
-<i>allegiance to the Republic of Korea…</i>
-What the hell were you doin'?

567
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,296
-<i>…for the eternal glory of the country.</i>
-What's it to you? Handlin' business.

568
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,424
- <i>Liberty and freedom…</i>
- What'd you say?

569
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,801
- <i>…to the Republic of Korea.</i>
- Handling business?

570
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,557
-Where are y'all from?
-Seoul.

571
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,351
You know this guy?

572
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,436
Not a bit.

573
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,111
So what the hell's goin' on here?

574
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,573
- Doin' a shakedown?
- No, I told you.

575
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,867
Why are you on my ass so hard today, huh?

576
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,954
Watch who you're fuckin' talkin' to,
you stupid son of a bitch.

577
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,081
Forget I got a badge?

578
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,543
All right, I hear you.

579
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,295
I'll just send them on their way
and that's that.

580
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:39,546
No, I think not.

581
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,049
I think you are the one's who gotta leave.

582
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,260
This motherfucker's
workin' my last nerve.

583
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,762
Yeah?

584
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:49,639
You're talkin' pretty big.

585
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,185
What do ya think?
Should I just haul all your asses in?

586
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,316
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

587
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,235
We're going.

588
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,654
You should stop goin' around
causin' trouble.

589
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,115
Just take better care of my aunt, okay?

590
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,575
Son of a bitch.

591
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,036
Stay in your fucking lane, piece of shit.

592
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,621
You think you're making Uncle so proud,

593
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,539
- is that it? Shit.
- Come on, walk away, Boss.

594
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,124
What you fucking doing, huh?

595
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,001
Don't butt in when adults are talkin'…

596
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,129
-Hey, come on. Give it a rest, Beolgu.
-…you stupid little piece of shit. Fuck!

597
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,509
These bush-league gangsters
are acting like damn middle schoolers.

598
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,219
Stupid fuckin' idiots.

599
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,805
So anyway,

600
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:32,349
what are you doin' here from Seoul?

601
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,351
Well…

602
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,436
Hey, Honggi.

603
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,814
What's goin' on?

604
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,941
What's this?

605
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,819
Are these guys here with you?

606
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,197
Did somethin' happen?

607
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,658
What are you doin'
with people from Seoul, huh?

608
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,868
Now what makes you care so much
about my business

609
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,954
that you gotta interrogate me like this?

610
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,499
They don't look like
they're regular guys, that's all.

611
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,043
Okay, I've heard enough outta you.
Let's git.

612
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,797
All right, I'll be in touch.

613
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,469
What the hell
have you gotten yourself into now?

614
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:11,513
It's nothin'.

615
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,932
A whole mess of outsiders swarming in
and causing a scene.

616
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,809
-Put your shirt on, idiot.
-That seem like nothing to you?

617
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,562
-The entire neighborhood is staring.
-You're the one causing the scene.

618
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,982
Hey, why the hell are you guys
always taking your shirts off?

619
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,483
Little shits.

620
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,068
Ah, shoot.

621
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,362
He turned out to be an asshat, didn't he?

622
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,239
I had him pegged all wrong.

623
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,907
Greedy sumbitch, huh?

624
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,243
You had him pegged all wrong, that right?

625
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,328
I'll be… What's that tone?

626
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,540
If I knew he was like that
I wouldn't have brought him in.

627
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,417
Oh, yeah?

628
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,295
A guy who has spent
his whole life catching fish

629
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,297
and now he thinks he can sell pottery?

630
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:49,301
He didn't come up with that himself.
Someone put it in his head.

631
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,970
You implyin' I did that?

632
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,346
Implying? No.

633
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,265
Let me be direct.

634
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:01,605
Don't even think about contacting
Mr. Song again. You got that?

635
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,325
Y-Yeongsu really tried doing that?

636
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,577
Hey, that's just…

637
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,039
You can't trust
anyone these days.

638
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:22,542
From now on, I'm the only one you talk to.

639
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,586
This place is full of crooks.

640
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,005
Okay, so what's your deal
with the captain?

641
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,633
2.5 million.

642
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,176
2.5 million?

643
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,302
That's way too much.

644
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,930
It's not just the captain either.
This is gonna cost a lot.

645
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,390
We also have to find the guy
who knows where it all is.

646
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,478
We're gonna need another five mil.
On top of all the other costs.

647
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,272
- Five million?
<i>- Mr. Song.</i>

648
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:45,857
We don't really have a choice.

649
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:47,984
The water's pretty rough here,

650
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,903
and if these guys start acting up,
we're screwed.

651
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,698
Ugh, this is a real pain.

652
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,285
So all that aside, what am I getting here?

653
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,497
-What are you getting?
-Wait a minute.

654
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,416
You're not telling me to make do
with what's left over?

655
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,461
Hey, listen. The two of us
can work out the details later.

656
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,339
Look, I'm planting seeds
with Cheon right now, okay?

657
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,967
We're all gonna end this job a lot richer.

658
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,552
There's nothing I hate more
than beating around the bush.

659
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,137
I get it, I get it.

660
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:19,891
Anyway, look, Gwanseok,
I'm counting on you, hmm?

661
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,561
By the way, at the train station,
was Chairman Cheon serious about that?

662
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,230
<i>What do you mean?</i>

663
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,361
Im Jeonchul. Cheon wants him dead.

664
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,220
Hey, Seongcheol!

665
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,305
Hey.

666
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,601
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

667
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,187
- I wasn't expecting you.
- Hey.

668
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,274
You don't think you can
cook up more ceramics, huh?

669
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,068
-Well, which ones?
-The farming ones.

670
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,612
And how many are we talkin' here?

671
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,488
Look, can you do it or not?

672
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:17,449
This is all getting out of hand.

673
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,034
Hey, what's going on?

674
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,244
The cost keeps growing and growing and I…

675
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:27,042
I already gave Gwanseok a million won,
and now he's back, wanting another five.

676
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,835
Oh, wow.

677
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,212
Mighty big problem this is.

678
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,173
- Hey.
- Huh?

679
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,760
What if Chairman Cheon decides
to back out? What are you gonna do then?

680
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,387
Well, that's not going to happen.

681
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:42,307
But I guess, just in case,
I should think of something.

682
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,309
- Right.
- Mmm.

683
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,604
Having a backup couldn't hurt.

684
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,314
- The rest are in the storage.
- Oh.

685
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,066
Let me just finish up here first.

686
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,443
Sure, go on. Yeah.

687
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,700
Son of a bitch.

688
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,786
- Asshole. Wanna go?
- Get your hands off me. Okay, let's go.

689
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,287
- You ready?
- Let's do this, jackass.

690
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,830
Why do you have a knife, huh?

691
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,207
'Cause I just do. What?

692
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,500
And why would you reach for it?

693
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,044
Fuck was I supposed to do?
Sit there and take their shit?

694
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,755
You fucking idiot. You think
I kept quiet because I wanted to?

695
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,548
You dumb ass almost fucked everything up.

696
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,759
What's going on? What is it?

697
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,804
He went for his knife and got caught
because he's a dumb son of a bitch.

698
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,847
-Stop it.
-Even after they slapped me.

699
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,474
I said cut it out!

700
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,393
- Shit.
- Dumbasses.

701
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,144
-Take a shot.
-Go for it.

702
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,521
- Punch me.
- Punch me.

703
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,689
-Punch me.
-Punch me, bitch.

704
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,899
You can't do it, can you?

705
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,360
-Come on, you fuck. Hit me.
-I dare you, lil pissant son of a bitch.

706
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,070
-You're asking for it.
-Take your shot.

707
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,322
The hell was that?
What's your problem?

708
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,241
What? What the hell
is your fucking problem?

709
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,575
You little brat.

710
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,538
Oh Heedong, listen.

711
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,289
No more of this shit.

712
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,667
You don't make enemies
before you set sail.

713
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,920
Do that and who do you think
will become fish food first?

714
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,965
You know what the most important thing
is when you go out to sea?

715
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,634
It's trust, you fucking idiot.

716
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,261
Trust that they won't kill you.

717
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,555
You get tossed overboard
and you're finished, do you hear me?

718
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,016
So stop stirring up shit.

719
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,228
I've got a lot on my plate as it is.

720
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,445
Fuck this!

721
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,287
You're looking as beautiful as always,
Mrs. Yang.

722
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,539
Listen, Mrs. Yang.

723
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,708
About that favor I asked…

724
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,293
What was it again?

725
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,254
Well,
regarding my brother-in-law.

726
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,798
-Ah, for work.
-Yes.

727
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,301
Well, you see,
my husband and I have been busy.

728
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,886
I haven't brought it up yet.

729
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,970
MARILYN BOUTIQUE

730
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,474
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

731
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:51,019
I forgot. These are a Gimcheon delicacy,
<i>Joma</i> potatoes.

732
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,520
Right, set it there.

733
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:54,439
Okay.

734
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,608
Ah, and, ma'am?

735
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,571
This month's.

736
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,699
You know, I really do appreciate
you always being on time.

737
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,868
Oh, of course, it's the least I can do.

738
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,830
Well, Mrs. Yang,
I really hope you can help me out.

739
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,250
-Okay, I'll see you.
-Oh, ma'am.

740
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,045
Right,
just hand that to my driver.

741
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,421
Yes, ma'am.

742
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,507
Jin, I'm here.

743
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,176
- What are you doing in there?
- Hey! One minute.

744
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,303
- Then I'm gonna make a call.
- Okay!

745
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,307
All right.

746
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,852
Absolutely stunning.

747
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,856
- Let's go with this one.
- All right then. I'll take it.

748
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,025
Hi, dear.

749
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,401
Hi, where are you?

750
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:42,737
<i>Oh, I'm at the hair salon right now.</i>

751
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,740
Um,
have you heard anything yet?

752
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,575
No, I haven't heard anything.

753
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,078
Jeonchul always calls you though,
doesn't he?

754
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,706
All right, look, quit shopping
and go home then.

755
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,874
Hurry and finish up.

756
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,836
Okay, I'll head home soon.

757
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,420
- <i>When exactly?</i>
- Bye, take care.

758
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,047
Now. I'm heading home now.

759
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:02,674
Bye.

760
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,929
Ugh,
he just has to keep me locked up at home.

761
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,682
Even the monkeys at Changgyeong
have more freedom.

762
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,853
- Hey, did you collect all the payments?
- Mmm.

763
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:17,313
I don't know
if it's worth sneaking around

764
00:39:17,397 --> 00:39:19,107
for this kind of chump change.

765
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,442
You stack up that chump change
and you'll make it big.

766
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,903
How's that sailor husband
of yours doing?

767
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:25,238
Mm-hmm, he's in Mokpo now.

768
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,656
Mokpo, why?

769
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,201
Guess being a sailor
was always meant to be.

770
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,787
- Hmm?
- Wait a second. He hasn't called yet.

771
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:36,332
- I have to make a call.
- Of course. Go for it.

772
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,167
Welcome.

773
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,423
<i>Hello? How are you?</i>

774
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,425
Doin' just fine.

775
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,176
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

776
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,597
-Mmm.
-Wait, why do you sound so down?

777
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,390
Are they treating you okay there?

778
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,976
Yeah, everything's fine.

779
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,020
<i>You should stay</i>
<i>on yourtoes.</i>

780
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,022
<i>They're not ordinary guys,</i>
<i>that's for sure.</i>

781
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,523
<i>I know.</i>

782
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,610
- Think I should come down there?
<i>- Why would you come here?</i>

783
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,403
I don't know.

784
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,780
I could buy you all some lunch.
Don't you think that would be nice?

785
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:10,992
As if the chairman
would ever let you.

786
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,369
I guess you're right.

787
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,496
So everything's really okay?

788
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,124
I already said yes.
Why are you getting on my case?

789
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:21,002
- What's with the attitude?
<i>- Whatever. I gotta to go.</i>

790
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,465
- Ugh.
- Have a good day!

791
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,549
Bye!

792
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:28,843
What was that?

793
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,138
He's grumpier than ever now.

794
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,182
That means he's happy, right?

795
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,894
- Here. Mmm.
- Yes!

796
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,563
Can we get some food already?

797
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,856
Yeah, coming.

798
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:45,652
All right,
let's have a drink and let it go.

799
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,487
Here. Mmm.

800
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,578
-Daesik, why aren't you drinking?
-Oh, uh, I can't drink booze.

801
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,165
All right, guys. Tell him you're sorry.

802
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,625
For what?

803
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,253
You don't fight in front of your elders.
Quickly now.

804
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,923
My apologies.

805
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,634
For what? Guys are just like that.

806
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,055
Sometimes you throw insults,
and sometimes you throw punches, right?

807
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:18,393
I used to get into a lot of fights…
so I get it.

808
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,354
- Oh, it's here.
- Here you go. Enjoy.

809
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,272
- Thanks.
- Hey, can we get a refill

810
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,691
-on these sides?
-Bum a cigarette?

811
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,693
- Daesik, dig in.
- Oh, thanks.

812
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,446
And c-can you clear
these empty bottles, please?

813
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,074
Can't you wait to smoke
after you eat?

814
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,104
You wanna know how I got this scar?

815
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,939
Sure, man.

816
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:08,943
We were out in the water.

817
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,571
The foreign crew staged
a rebellion out there.

818
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,699
It was a mutiny, I guess you could say.

819
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,036
I really should've been more careful
in my younger days.

820
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,831
Instead, I got into a fight
with the captain, got shot.

821
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,254
Then the boat hit the reef
and took on water,

822
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,883
while my ass fell in the water
and got knocked out.

823
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,512
Luckily, I had a life jacket on,
the only reason I'm here.

824
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,725
I woke up on the shore,
barely clinging to life.

825
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:42,685
I damn near died that day.

826
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:48,149
What's your point?

827
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,820
You son of a bitch.

828
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,074
I've already faced death
once before out there.

829
00:42:57,617 --> 00:43:00,953
The thought of it,
heading out again to sea, I…

830
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,749
I'm scared. It's embarrassing.

831
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,752
But I'm scared shitless.

832
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,716
Heedong.

833
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,680
Listen. Let's not stab
each other in the back.

834
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:21,766
Okay?

835
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,403
So, the ship…

836
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,949
How do we know exactly where it sank?

837
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,828
Well, there's a guy
who knows where it sank.

838
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,121
He's a sailor.

839
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,541
He's the one the navy relied on
during their search.

840
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,251
Well, where's the guy hiding?

841
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,711
In prison.

842
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:52,922
Prison?

843
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,007
Without him, we're screwed.

844
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,261
We should have Captain Hwang pay him
a visit. They're friends, after all.

845
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,638
Wow.

846
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,393
- Close your mouth, will ya?
- Oh.

847
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:13,151
Man,

848
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,946
whole area from Yeongdeungpo to Jamsil

849
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,448
is going to have major developments.

850
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,618
So, the school…
Have you picked a location yet?

851
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,998
The thing is, I don't know if
I should wait till the area's developed.

852
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,792
You think the land prices will be patient?

853
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,669
They'll probably skyrocket.

854
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,090
How much will it cost?
The museum, that is.

855
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,717
Hey.

856
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,510
It won't be all that costly.

857
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,680
It's all for show.

858
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:46,726
Just enough to make me look good.

859
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:48,477
I'm not going to go overboard.

860
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,440
Right. If you have the funds,
Gangnam's right there.

861
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,692
Why would you invest anywhere else?

862
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,986
I told you I have ideas.

863
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,823
It looked to me like Song was set
on bleeding you dry and then some.

864
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,035
You really told him
you'd buy everything they found?

865
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:05,953
Well, I'll knock off the price then.

866
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:11,000
How about, instead,
you set a limit from the start?

867
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,752
How's that work?

868
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,503
What's the point of buying it all?

869
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:17,715
If you set a limit for how many pieces
you'll take for the museum,

870
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,468
they won't try any tricks. That simple.

871
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,470
What are you saying?

872
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,848
What if they throw in some fake ones then?

873
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,393
You really think
they would dare?

874
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:31,646
I wouldn't bet on it.

875
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:34,565
I'll meet with him then.

876
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,735
We've already got so many expenses.

877
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,321
Wouldn't being direct clear things up?

878
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,490
Who are you meeting?

879
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,910
Who else could it be? Mr. Song.

880
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:01,509
Hey.

881
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,844
Hold it tight.

882
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,306
- Tighter.
- Just like this. Let go.

883
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,687
So that's all of them, yeah?

884
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:14,647
Yeah.

885
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,857
That's another 200,

886
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,485
so it's 500 in total.

887
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,862
I'm gonna pass out.

888
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:25,283
I should get
at least a hundred million for this.

889
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:26,534
Still, though,

890
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:31,706
if you had some real pieces from Sinan,
wouldn't you feel better about all this?

891
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:34,208
Should I go to Mokpo myself then?

892
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:36,502
Don't do that.

893
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,047
Think they'd be happy
with you breathing down their necks?

894
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:42,758
Well, I want to see how it's going.
It's driving me crazy.

895
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,720
You've got to leave it up to fate now.
Let's go.

896
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:48,556
- Captain.
- Yeah?

897
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,224
- Let's head back.
- Okay.

898
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:52,893
Man, I'm exhausted.

899
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,605
MOKPO PRISON

900
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,237
- He's here.
- Thanks, man.

901
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:06,907
There he is.

902
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,617
How you holdin' up, Bokgeun?

903
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,369
LEE BOKGEUN

904
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,663
-Why are you here?
-I'm here to see you, bud.

905
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:14,165
How you doin'?

906
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,251
Well, I'm pissed.
The yellow croaker thing was a bust.

907
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:19,879
- It's bullshit.
- Fuck the yellow croakers.

908
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,881
There's gold buried in the sea.

909
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,716
Oh, for fuck's sake.

910
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:26,385
Why do you keep goin' on
about this treasure?

911
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:27,845
I don't know anything.

912
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,764
-Just go.
-Hey, just hear me out.

913
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,601
This fella here is from Seoul.

914
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,855
- The fuck brings you here?
- We're here 'cause we need you.

915
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,565
The spot, where exactly is it?

916
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,525
You just explain,
and I can piece it together.

917
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:43,361
You really think I'd tell you?

918
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,196
So you can run off with the gold?

919
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:48,240
You can't screw me over
just 'cause I'm in prison.

920
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,368
I-I ain't screwin' you.
You'll get your cut.

921
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:51,494
Fuck you, man.

922
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,120
Fuck you and your bullshit.

923
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,623
Hey, look, how about this?

924
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,792
Tell me where the ship sank.

925
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,127
I'll give you 200,000.

926
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,254
As soon as we confirm it, you'll get it.

927
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,672
Who is this?

928
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,216
You the big boss or somethin'?

929
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,259
-Nah, that's not it.
-Yeah, that's right.

930
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,137
Bullshit.

931
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,640
You think you'll be
the boss out there too?

932
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,725
Out there, we're the boss.

933
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:17,103
What do you know about the ocean?
Jack shit.

934
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,190
I can't explain it in words.

935
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,025
I need to see it with my own eyes.

936
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:24,402
- Only way it works.
- Come on.

937
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,529
You're makin' no sense.

938
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,823
How're you supposed to get
your eyes on it?

939
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,242
Get me out.
Otherwise, you're screwed.

940
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,120
If we had that kind of power,
why would we be here?

941
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:36,247
We'd order the navy to drain the damn sea.

942
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,541
Who else knows the location?

943
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,667
You can't be the only one.

944
00:48:41,544 --> 00:48:42,545
You're right.

945
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,547
Seokbae also knows where it is.

946
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:48,759
Oh, you're gonna have Seokbae
find the location for ya?

947
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:52,096
Go ahead and knock yourselves out.
I wish you the best of luck.

948
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,349
The navy dragged me out there
for a fuckin' reason.

949
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,435
Well, he was still
one of the divers though.

950
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,728
- He should know where it was.
- Yeah?

951
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:00,980
So go ahead.

952
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,191
I'm not telling you shit for 200,000 won.

953
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:08,654
Or you go to your boss
and ask for more cash.

954
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,906
Hey, I said I'm in charge,
you asshole.

955
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,324
Don't make me say it again.

956
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,666
<i>Out there, we're the boss.</i>

957
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,085
<i>What do you know about the ocean?</i>
<i>Jack shit.</i>

960
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,449
- You're here.
- Hey.

961
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:55,618
What's that?

962
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:59,205
I want you to go
to Seosan-dong with Captain Hwang.

963
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,332
There's a guy named Go Seokbae
somewhere around there.

964
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:05,002
-And who's that?
-One of the divers who found the pottery.

965
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,754
Ask him where the location is.

966
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,881
Take Jeonchul with you.

967
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,633
Nah, I'll take Daesik instead.

968
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,593
Daesik and I are going shopping then.

969
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,428
Take Jeonchul.

970
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,682
Oh, right.

971
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:22,353
<i> When you're angry,</i>
<i>ironing can help cool your head.</i>

972

IERONING CAN HELP A LITTLE

973
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:41,664
Fucking hell.

974
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:44,750
He lives in the boonies.

975
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:46,377
Whew!

976
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:51,632
You seen this guy, Seokbae, 'round here?

977
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,716
Seokbae?

978
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,344
Let's see here.

979
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,681
Seokbae… Is he Mr. Go's second oldest son?

980
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,724
Yeah, that's right.

981
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,768
Can you tell me where he lives then?

982
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,645
I just see him around here sometimes.

983
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,980
I don't know where he lives.

984
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,940
I get it. So where do you see him around?

985
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,150
Where are you folks from?

986
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,361
We're here from Seoul, all right?

987
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,530
Just point us in the right direction.

988
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,783
- Are you a detective?
- Hey, lady.

989
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,536
Quietly.

990
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,164
Right, I could tell
from just one look, I could.

991
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,709
You guys came lookin'
a few months ago too.

992
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,835
What's the matter?

993
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,878
-You still haven't found him?
-What did I just say?

994
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:31,922
Hey. Okay?

995
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,052
-Tell us where he is.
-I don't know where exactly.

996
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,888
Just go straight past this way,
and you'll see a stone wall.

997
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:42,141
I think he lives somewhere around there.

998
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,475
Thanks for that.

999
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,227
All right, let's go.

1000
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:56,363
That guy's a real asshole,
acting so rude to someone he just met.

1001
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,243
- Ugh.
- Hey, kid.

1002
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,330
Do you know
if a guy named Seokbae lives here?

1003
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:05,998
Wait, what'd you say?

1004
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,209
Seokbae. Go Seokbae.
Apparently, he lives around here.

1005
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,128
I can't think right now.

1006
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:16,216
Sorry, but I'm too busy right now,
so I can't help you.

1007
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,719
What, are you busy playing?
'Cause that's all I see.

1008
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,263
Hey, Pop! Run for it!

1009
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,681
- Hurry up! Run! Run!
- Get him.

1010
00:52:22,765 --> 00:52:24,141
- Oh, fuck!
- Seokbae!

1011
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,393
Wait, Seokbae!

1012
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,395
- Stop right there, punk!
- Move!

1013
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,522
I'm not a fucking cop!

1014
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,775
- Seokbae!
- I'm not a cop!

1015
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,321
Son of a bitch!

1016
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,413
Hey!

1017
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,585
My whole body hurts.

1018
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,505
Did you have to turn this
into such a hassle?

1019
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:56,840
I don't know anything.

1020
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,635
We're not here to get you.

1021
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,096
So just…

1022
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,431
Just tell us
where you found the pottery.

1023
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,516
GO SEOKBAE

1024
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,185
- Who are they?
- I'll explain it all later.

1025
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,815
Where'd you find the pottery?

1026
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,692
How the hell should I know that?

1027
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,153
I'd dig it up myself
if I knew where it was.

1028
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:20,406
You were the damn diver on the boat!

1029
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,615
How can you not remember?

1030
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,284
Ask the captain that took us there.

1031
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,621
I don't know shit about it.
I'm just a diver.

1032
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:29,415
Bokgeun could tell you where it's at.

1033
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,959
Ugh, you're fucking kidding!

1034
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,294
Bokgeun? And just who the fuck is that?

1035
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:37,881
Can't bust him out of prison.

1036
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,758
