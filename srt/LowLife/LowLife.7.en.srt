00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:13,096
One ticket to Seoul.

2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,848
- What the...
- I'm sorry.

3
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,476
Miss, you can't just cut
to the front of the line.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,228
I'm in a huge hurry here.
Can't you help me out?

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,272
Okay, I'm gonna have to have you
get back in line. They're all in a hurry.

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,565
Come on, please!

7
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,862
Could you just help me out this once?
Please?

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:32,241
Uh, you can let her go first. It's fine.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,124
Seoul! Seoul!

10
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,209
"WELCOME
SEOUL BOUND"

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,669
- Last bus to Seoul!
- Yeosu.

12
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,170
This is the last bus to Seoul!

13
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,172
- Please get on!
- Yeah, I see it.

14
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,966
-Bus to Yeosu departing soon!
-Last bus to Seoul!

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,176
Last bus to Seoul!
Please get on now!

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:55,555
Yeosu! Yeosu!

17
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,856
Check over there.

18
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,824
- Excuse you.
- Pardon.

19
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:34,469
This bitch, seriously...

20
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,728
Where the fuck are you?

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:54,740
Here, you can, uh... you can
put this on. Earlier, you're the one who--

22
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:58,201
- We're gonna take off now!
- Fine. I'll get off.

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,664
Shit!

24
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,044
- Sir, you really can't be doing--
- Shut the fuck up.

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,172
He's gone.

26
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,798
This bus is leaving!

27
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,593
I appreciate it.

28
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,776
Hey! Buddy, open the door!

29
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:35,072
This fucking bitch is putting us

30
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,865
through the damn ringer
with all this bullshit.

31
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,075
I'm fucking soaked.

32
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,243
Huh? Yeah?

33
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,538
Come here.

34
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,459
I said come here, bitch!

EPISODE 7, THE FIRST CASUALTY

38
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,526
-Good evening. Hi, sir.
-Evening.

39
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,153
- Please head inside.
- This is it.

40
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,530
Hey, stop!

41
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,241
-I'll get that for you.
-Finally, we're here.

42
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,325
Yeah, of course.

43
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,744
-Don't leave that in the car.
-Hello there. Evening, Mr. Lee.

44
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,538
- You been all right?
- Yes.

45
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,540
-Right this way, sir.
-You guys are here early.

46
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,083
-How are you?
-Yeah, hi. Let's head inside.

47
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,585
- Go on in.
- All right.

48
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,546
Thank you again, Mrs. Yang,
for inviting us tonight.

49
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,715
Mr. Lee, you came dressed to impress.

50
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,425
Your business trip to China, how was it?

51
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,427
It was great.
In fact, I have this for you.

52
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,012
Wild ginseng from a cultivator there.

53
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,263
Rare and one of a kind.

54
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,599
This means so much.

55
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,642
You should go inside,

56
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,770
- and see the chairman. He's there.
- Yes. Of course.

57
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,398
Am I the only one
who thinks it's off? We should check.

58
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,192
-I'll look into it right away, sir.
-Look at that.

59
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,068
-You should.
-It seems like everyone's here already.

60
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,945
Oh, good evening, sir.

61
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,782
Mr. Park.
Did I hear you talking about work?

62
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,159
Gotta at least pretend
that we're working

63
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,369
to stay on your husband's good side.

64
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,372
Go ahead downstairs. Forget about work.

65
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,459
- All righty, then. Let's head inside.
- Yeah, okay.

66
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,879
Evening. We're all here,
so let's head down together.

67
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,882
- Yes, sir.
- All right. Shall we? Let's go.

68
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,389
Hey, put the guests' jackets
in the closet.

69
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,600
-Why are they just lying around?
-Yes, ma'am.

70
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,437
Don't worry about
serving the dishes too quickly.

71
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,272
- And not too hot, okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

72
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,363
- Hello there.
- Oh, hello.

73
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:24,282
-Enjoy the food. I'll call you down later.
-Yes, ma'am.

74
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,617
And the girls?

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,453
-Uh, they should be here soon.
-Okay.

76
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,789
- Wow!
- This place is swanky!

77
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,749
- All right, this way.
- Lift, ladies.

78
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,501
-Don't drag your skirts.
-Right this way.

79
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,214
Be sure to watch your step, okay, girls?

80
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,133
-Look at this place!
-Oh, wow.

81
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,760
Uh, please wait here for a moment.

82
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,470
- It's beautiful.
- Lovely.

83
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:48,223
-Madam Go, hi.
-Thank you for having us here.

84
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:49,891
Which one's the prettiest?

85
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,476
This one right here.

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,561
Oh.

87
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,856
-You, sit next to the chairman.
-Okay!

88
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,233
- Right this way.
- Okay.

89
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,569
- Let's go, girls.
- Yes, ma'am.

90
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,238
- Make sure you hold up your skirts.
- Yes, ma'am.

91
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,868
- Hello. Good evening.
- Oh, wow!

92
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,871
- Hello!
- Nice to meet you.

93
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,334
All right. Go ahead and sit down, girls.

94
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,961
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay!

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,423
And you can sit right here.

96
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,217
- Hello.
- How are you?

97
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,844
All right, all right.

98
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,556
Loosen your belts and forget
about work tonight, okay?

99
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,143
If anyone walks out of here
steady on their feet,

100
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,855
I'm gonna take that as a sign
that I wasn't a very good host.

101
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,024
Let's dig in!

102
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,735
In that case,
I gotta take off my belt, don't I?

103
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,741
Come on, girls. Hurry and get
these gentlemen their drinks.

104
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,076
- Okay!
- All right! Okay.

105
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,746
For the chairman, no alcohol.

106
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,414
Given his age now, he has to be careful.

107
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,207
Oh. I'm sorry.

108
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,792
I guess my mind's still young,

109
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:02,172
but my body insists
on reminding me I'm not. What can I do?

110
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,424
How about a cup of water?

111
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,717
Of course, sir.

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,844
Probably have a good piss tonight,
won't I?

113
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,724
Okay, on that note,
everyone have a great time tonight.

114
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,100
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,645
- Thank you very much. Excuse me, then.
- All right. Yeah.

116
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,190
All right, Chairman Cheon,
how about a toast?

117
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,566
Oh, sure.

118
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,445
A toast to Heungbaek's
continued prosperity and rise

119
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,405
and national contribution.

120
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:31,576
- <i>Kanpai</i>!
<i>- Kanpai</i>!

121
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,168
Man, just look at that color.

122
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,712
This beauty's one of a kind.

123
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,047
Good stuff, isn't it?

124
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,882
It's better than that.

125
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,927
This here is great, the best of the best.

126
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,138
We're gonna need a lot of
basins. Is this really all we got?

127
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,474
This is all we've got.
What do you wanna do?

128
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,975
We can buy more in Mokpo.

129
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,437
No, there's a marine store here.
Just give me the money and I'll get it.

130
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:04,025
Six, seven, eight, nine, twenty.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

131
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,902
In total, we've got 27.

132
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,529
Eleven of the celadon,

133
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,573
11 of the porcelain,
and plates, we got five of 'em.

134
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,617
- Mmm.
- Check for yourselves too.

135
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,954
When you're done,
sign with your thumbprint, okay?

136
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,124
What is it?

137
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,920
Hey, listen. Let me have half.

138
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,340
You already know
I can sell them for the right price.

139
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,515
So what's the woman promising you?

140
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,560
-You can tell me.
-How much do you think you can get?

141
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,480
I can get 500
to a million apiece for those.

142
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,315
You'll get 300.

143
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,651
Hey, careful with that.

144
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:50,321
Come on, I heard that
some pieces sell for over 30 million.

145
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,533
That's all bullshit, don't you know that?

146
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,993
Thirty mil is a national treasure.

147
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,953
How many of those will we find?

148
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,956
And we'll all get arrested
if we screw up here.

149
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,836
Best you'll get is a million won.

150
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,213
I'm the expert, here. You know that.

151
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,007
How big of a deposit can you put down?

152
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,092
Ten million won.

153
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,678
Hey, Tiger, look at this.

154
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,848
That's not good enough.
Don't you see how many guys I have here?

155
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,062
Thirty mil, take it or leave it.

156
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,652
When do you need it?

157
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,281
Right now. We're outta time here.

158
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,537
Fine.

Oh, and also...

160

When you come by next,
bring the fake ones you cooked up, okay?

161
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,851
What is it?

162
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,564
Hey, come and help me for a sec.

163
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,608
Where are we going?

164
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,860
Beolgu. He's just lyin' there.

165
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,196
We need to get him to a doctor.

166
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,366
Cause if he bites it here,
we're all totally fucked.

167
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,326
-Right now?
-Yeah, now.

00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,765
Huh?

Listen, bud, we're gonna go
to the doctor's now.

I need you to pull yourself together.

Just look at him, man.

263
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,307
He's barely responsive.
He's startin' to stink.

264
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,808

Hey, he's up.
That'll make things harder. Shit.

270

-Oh, yeah.
-Wait, hey, hey. No, hold up.

301

00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,755
What's that? Is that Taesan?

320
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,340
Is he swimming in the middle of the night?

321
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,844
- Hey.
- Huh?

322
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,013
I gotta tell you something.

323
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,097
Oh, yeah?

324
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,183
Let's go inside.

325
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,730
What is it?

326
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,118
Where have you been?

327
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,913
You got a light?

328
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:30,956
You know I don't smoke.

329
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,126
Ah, fuck, they're all wet. Shit.

330
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,505
Did you take care of Beolgu?

331
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,847
Listen, I know we agreed
to split it equally.

332
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,349
That's not gonna cut it, though.

333
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,727
I mean, I'm the one doin'
all the dirty work.

334
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,897
It's just not fair.

335
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,108
Beolgu's share? I'll take that too.

336
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,091
So what are you doing here?

337
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,891
I came all this way
'cause I thought I should apologize.

338
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,478
Apologize?

339
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,023
The thing is, I lied to you.

340
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,529
I was never pregnant.
So you don't have to worry.

341
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,702
You're not pregnant?

342
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,540
I guess your uncle
didn't tell you about it.

343
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,295
Nothin' ever happened between us.

344
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,423
You were too drunk to even attempt
to do anything that night.

345
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,093
So don't worry about it anymore.

346
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,518
Why tell me, though?

347
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,982
Uh, you could've just kept up the lie.

348
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,405
I guess I'm no good
at fooling folks, you know?

349
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:39,293
Hey, thanks... for earlier.

350
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,671
If it weren't for you, I would've...

351
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,260
What made the two of you fight like that?

352
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,473
I don't know, just stuff.

353
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,058
You think he's...

354
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,561
You think he's okay?

355
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:05,361
You must be tired.
You should stay the night.

356
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,697
I should get back.

357
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,741
My boss will kill me
if I'm not there tomorrow.

358
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,077
How are you gonna do that?
It's night. There's no boats.

359
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,957
Sleep here and go back
in the morning, okay?

360
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,306
Listen,
I'll take care of everything, okay?

361
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:38,143
So don't worry about a thing. I promise.

362
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,816
Everything's gonna be fine, all right?

363
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:01,875
A YEAR OF UNSTOPPABLE
ADVANCEMENT

364
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,919
- <i>The preliminaries for...</i>
- Wow.

365
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,462
<i>...this year's Miss Korea pageant</i>
<i>have finally...</i>

366
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,922
Hey, man.

367
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,260
-I said hey!
-Hey, what the hell, guy?

368
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,846
What do you want? Just be quiet.

369
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,724
I'm wasting so much time
here with this shit.

370
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,600
Oh, really?
Should I get you some work, then?

371
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:20,853
If you just let me out,

372
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,230
I'll find the guy I need
and then be outta your hair.

373
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,649
Not likely to happen, you fucking gorilla.

374
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,819
Well, I could just rip you apart,
you piece of shit.

375
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,905
What the hell did you just say, big boy?

376
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:36,910
You didn't hear me? I could really
rip apart some pig skin, you know?

377
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,414
HOLDING CELL

378
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,878
Son of a bitch.

379
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,505
You must think
that cops are a real fuckin' joke.

380
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,590
Of course not.

381
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:52,301
Otherwise I wouldn't be here
on our cute date.

382
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,470
Just clean the piss pot.
It's startin' to stink.

383
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,140
Oh, for fuck's sake.
How long do I gotta stay here? Huh?

384
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,851
Let me just get Professor Kim and go.

385
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,063
Tell me somethin'.
What'd this guy do to you exactly?

386
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:09,109
What he did... The bastard,
he sold fakes to Ma.

387
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:10,652
Your mother's line of work is?

388
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:14,406
Antiques. She's got a store
in Busan that's named after me.

389
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,826
You're saying
this guy sold her fake pottery, then?

390
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,330
Yeah, I already told you.
He lied and said they were from Sinan.

391
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,708
-How much money was it?
-I don't know that.

392
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:27,336
With antiques,
it's whatever you can get is what you get.

393
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,755
I'm wasting time here.

394
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,925
Backwater fucks don't know shit.

395
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,219
Whatever you can get, huh?

396
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,682
BUSAN

397
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,772
Hello? Is anyone here?

398
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,775
Oh, good.

399
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,194
- Ms. Yang.
- Oh, Coach.

400
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:53,946
What brings you here?

401
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,197
They arrested Deoksan.

402
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,950
Mokpo's got him in jail. The police
won't let him out of there.

403
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,576
Mokpo? What's he doing there?

404
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,746
He was trying to catch this guy who
scammed me on an antiques deal.

405
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,124
Really?

406
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,668
Want me to round up some boys
and make my way over there?

407
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,378
Could you do that though?

408
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,713
If you're willing, well,
I've got enough cash here.

409
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,800
Nah. It's quite all right.
I've been meaning to go on a trip.

410
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,929
Oh, I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
Truly.

411
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>You wanted to talk to me?</i>

412
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,016
Yeah, yeah, I did.

413
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,395
Thing is, you see,
our boy Deoksan's in trouble.

414
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,897
I need some guys to
come to Mokpo and help.

415
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,941
Might be taking a few days,

416
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,069
don't really know what's out there,
so be ready for anything.

417
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,821
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- All right.

418
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,286
It's just you two? No one else is coming?

419
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,454
Yeah, one of them had to manage the store

420
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,665
and the other,
it's his dad's 60th birthday.

421
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,749
That right?

422
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,209
Man, that's not looking too good there.

423
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,627
I got the other one, I'm good.

424
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,170
That's cool, but, brother,
what's up with your neck?

425
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,714
If I keep it steady, it's doable.

426
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:54,923
Oh, yeah? Let's go.

427
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:00,512
We're gonna need some cash for the trip.
Let's make the rounds first.

428
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:04,600
Oh, but we just made the rounds.
You think that's all right?

429
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:08,020
Hey, let's try not to embarrass ourselves
while we're out there. Got it?

430
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,897
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

431
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,410
-Don't you need to get back to work?
-We don't get a lot of customers.

432
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,873
How did you end up
working there anyway?

433
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,751
My grandma got sick.

434
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,380
The hospital said
she had to have three surgeries.

435
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,926
I just finished middle school
and was working here and there,

436
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,470
so obviously I couldn't pay what we owed.

437
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,555
I was broke.

438
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,267
I knew I had to try and
do something for her, though.

439
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,356
Then one day the shrimp stall guy,
he introduced me to Ms. Jang.

440
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,485
She said she'd cover the whole thing.
I couldn't be more thankful.

441
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,905
That's how you started there?

442
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,201
I thought the job was
just making coffee, but I was wrong.

443
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:08,497
These old men came into the store,
got all handsy and groped me.

444
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,541
So I got the hell out of there.

445
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,044
Wasn't long before I got caught.

446
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:18,423
And when I did, that's when
she shaved my head. Beat my ass too.

447
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,885
That wasn't the last time you ran, though?

448
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,638
I lost count since then.

449
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,265
I was always such a pain in the ass.

450
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,851
She said I wasn't allowed
to talk to customers anymore.

451
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,853
Well, that worked out.

452
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,398
I'm smarter than you thought, aren't I?

453
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:44,866
The hell? Are you kidding me?
They can't be fucking serious.

454
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,288
How are we gonna get a thousand like this?

455
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,834
Everyone's wiped out.
What are we supposed to do?

456
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:59,006
Beolgu sure chose one hell
of a time to run off, didn't he?

457
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:02,134
How the hell did he run off in that state?

458
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,468
No idea.

459
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,053
Unbelievable.

460
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,265
Oh, by the way, Jeonchul,
he's got a fever.

461
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,768
-Jeonchul does?
-Man, he was throwing up all night.

462
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,895
Ah, shit.

463
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,873
Hey, is he okay?

464
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:37,669
He's completely out of it.
There's no way he can work today.

465
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,673
Daesik.

466
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:46,803
Hey, Na Daesik.

467
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,764
Hmm?

468
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,518
Are you still in pain?

469
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,813
Yeah, I think I'll need
a few more days before I can work.

470
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,523
It looks like you're okay now.

471
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,108
No, I'm not.

472
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,320
You sayin' I'm the kind of guy
who'll try to pretend to be sick

473
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,946
so he can bail on work?

474
00:31:11,912 --> 00:31:13,413
Feel good?

475
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,583
Oh.

476
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:20,253
Oh.

477
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,465
Get your ass on the boat.

478
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,141
Tuck your head in.

479
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,769
A little more. That's it.

480
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:45,946
Hey. Is it really a good idea
for him to do this?

481
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,657
We're all going in.
Daesik is no exception.

482
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,036
And Beolgu?

483
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,463
Hope I don't end up joining the mermaids.

484
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,444
Whoa, whoa! I'm-I'm losing balance!
I'm losing...

485
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,656
I'm okay. Thank you.

486
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,336
Excuse me.

487
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,006
Is anyone here?

488
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,810
Uh, hello? Is anyone home?

489
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,819
Oh. Uh... I'm sorry.

490
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,488
Heedong went out.

491
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,866
Could I leave this for him here then?

492
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,202
Sure.

493
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,665
Thank you.

494
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,009
Look, look. See? I told you.
I told you she's here.

495
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,719
You crazy little bitch.

496
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,555
Why the hell are you here?

497
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,059
I never thought I'd have
to drag my ass out to Jeungdo.

498
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,686
You're in trouble now.

499
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,271
You found me.

500
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:37,033
Daesik needs to get out.
He's been down there for an hour.

501
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,704
Just a bit longer.
He can go for two hours.

502
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,165
Yeah, that's for guys who are experts
at this. You know we're new here.

503
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,669
Yeah, we're all new at this.
So what? Who here's an expert?

504
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,380
Oh. Help him.

505
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,090
Oh, hey, he's up.

506
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,093
Hey, Seokbae, you did it!

507
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,095
- You got quite a haul, didn't you?
- Guys.

508
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,431
- It's a bit easier now, right?
- Good work.

509
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,765
Like hell it is.

510
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,851
You wouldn't be saying that shit
if you were going in.

511
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,645
I'm not doing any more today. I'm done.

512
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,606
And what about Daesik then?

513
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:10,358
He should be fine. I don't know.

514
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,819
- Shit.
- I'm exhausted.

515
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,551
He'll have to stay in bed for a while.

516
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,638
His blood pressure is
dangerously elevated.

517
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:43,433
Oh, what do I do?
Should I take him to the hospital?

518
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,685
You said he drank a lot last night?

519
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,145
Oh, yes, he did.

520
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:51,358
The company executives came over
to have dinner with us, and...

521
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,442
and...

522
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,738
Didn't I already mention to you
that he shouldn't be drinking?

523
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,158
Oh, no.
I've almost killed my husband.

524
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,827
I'm such a fool.

525
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:08,458
I just had to invite a singer who happened
to have a hit wartime song!

526
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,418
Usually after an alcohol overdose,

527
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,587
I recommend the patient rest
for a few days.

528
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,965
However, with your husband's
high blood pressure and heart condition,

529
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,467
this could be truly fatal.

530
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,637
Oh, what did I do?

531
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,306
I did this! I killed Hwangsik!

532
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,479
Well, then. I should go, Mrs. Yang.

533
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,147
Okay.

534
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,459
How big of a bonus did you get

535
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,504
when you picked the contractor
for the Yeouido complex?

536
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,299
Hardly any. Manager Yoon
tried to settle it with just one million.

537
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,218
I barely managed to grab two.

538
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,053
Still, that's good.

539
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,848
You've got to take
as much as you can when you can.

540
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,142
Speaking of, the former bookkeeper

541
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,561
is now trying to run
the whole company, isn't she?

542
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,188
She really is.

543
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,566
Well, I mean, her husband's
the chairman, right?

544
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,609
She's making the most of it,
that's for sure.

545
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,653
- To think she was a nobody.
- That's right.

546
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:22,365
All that aside,
I'm looking forward to you becoming CEO.

547
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,450
I'm counting on you.

548
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,785
<i>Don't get ahead of yourself, all right?</i>

549
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,247
<i>There's a lot of eyes on us.</i>
<i>We've got to be careful.</i>

550
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,328
HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

551
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,328
HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

552
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,126
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

553
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,754
Thank you for calling
Heungbaek Corporation. Yes.

554
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,478
Where did all the files go?

555
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,815
Oh. Mrs. Yang came by this morning
and cleared them all out.

556
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,526
She also said she wants to see you
in the chairman's office.

557
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:41,736
Damn it, what now?

558
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,824
Yes, yes.

559
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,824
Yes, yes.

560
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,242
Mm-hmm. Looks good.

561
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,000
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

562
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,585
Glad you're here.

563
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,128
What did you want to discuss?

564
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,881
Your spending's a little,
I would say, generous.

565
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,425
Sorry?

566
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,891
Uh, how can I help, Mrs. Yang?

567
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,437
How's the chairman?
Is he doing all right?

568
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,439
He overdid it with the drinks
and got sick.

569
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,733
He'll be out of the office for a while.

570
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:21,943
Hmm?

571
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,820
I looked at the personnel records.

572
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,030
You're all connected
in various ways, aren't you?

573
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,325
The chairman's hometown acquaintances,
his late wife's relatives...

574
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,413
Mr. Lee, correct me if I'm wrong,
but you were her cousin.

575
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,039
Uh, yes.

576
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,876
I know for a fact the chairman
felt sorry for his late wife

577
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,878
when he decided to bring you on.

578
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,046
It's a shame you're doing this to him.

579
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,882
I checked the books.

580
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,509
The three of you are taking what you want.

581
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:50,471
Ma'am, that's just a gesture
of showing appreciation.

582
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,141
I'd agree, except it's over 200 million.

583
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,767
You have to admit that's too much.

584
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,395
There's not a single company
that operates differently.

585
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,521
Every company does this.

586
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,524
Yes, everyone does this. Yeah.

587
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,861
Let me introduce you.

588
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,155
Namdaemun Police, Detective Choi.

589
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,991
Detective Choi Donggeun.

590
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,492
My offer's quite simple.

591
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:14,120
Do you want to cough up
all the money and get investigated,

592
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,539
or would you prefer quietly resigning?

593
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,625
The choice is yours.

594
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,256
There's a personnel announcement.

595
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,887
PERSONNEL STATUS CHANGES

596
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:34,349
Shit. They all got cut, didn't they?

597
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,643
Even Lee got the boot too.

598
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,394
-Oh, man.
-Right?

599
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,105
You think we're gonna be okay losing
all these important executives?

600
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,482
Important, my ass.

601
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:45,401
The chairman's in-laws, relatives,
they're all guys like that.

602
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:46,945
Well, that's true.

603
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,197
This is great news
for the general managers, I think.

604
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,241
- They can all finally move up the ladder.
- You're right.

605
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,118
They were doing all the work
for no credit.

606
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,203
Exactly.

607
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,704
- Fuck!
- What the hell?

608
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,208
That fucking bitch. I...

609
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,179
Here they are.

610
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:20,353
"Park Minguk, Yoon Deokho, Lee Jeongho."

611
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,315
He handed his money out like candy.

612
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:26,442
WITHDRAWAL - DEPOSIT - TOTAL

613
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,156
Now where are his seals?

614
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,241
Let's see...

615
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,416
They're missing.

616
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,844
You need to open the windows.

617
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,638
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, it's rank.

618
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:02,103
How's he been? Has he slept all day?

619
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,731
Yes, and he hasn't been eating anything.

620
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,403
- You can go.
- Yes, ma'am.

621
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,165
Honey, can you hear me?

622
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,544
The passbooks in the safe,
what did you do with the seals?

623
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:31,090
I looked everywhere
but I still couldn't find them.

624
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:33,593
Where are they? Hmm?

625
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,598
Oh, my.

626
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,352
What's wrong? Are you in pain?
Need your meds?

627
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,522
Well, what is it? What do you need?

628
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,316
You have to say it.

629
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,325
Just sleep then.

630
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,995
I've still got a lot to do.

631
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,208
I feel like I'm going crazy these days,
trying to clean up your mess.

632
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,033
That's fucking disgusting.

633
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,878
Man, another one might be
kicking it at this rate. Shit.

634
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,214
How're we gonna get any work done?

635
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,383
Hey.
You want some <i>miyeokguk</i>, man?

636
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:04,684
Can we go somewhere quiet?

637
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,437
-Why?
-I need to talk to you.

638
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,815
We can talk here.

639
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,069
Do you really know
what you're doing, uncle?

640
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,781
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

641
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,366
We're all gonna die at this rate.

642
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,327
Two of our men are sick, so what the hell
do you expect us to do?

643
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,912
Well, are you gonna dive in the water?

644
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:27,373
Course I am.

645
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,334
Watch your fucking mouth, kid.

646
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:39,844
Jeonchul.

647
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,305
You're diving tomorrow.

648
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,558
I still don't feel that good.

649
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,895
I've had enough of this shit.

650
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,646
We're shorthanded as it is.

651
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,983
Don't you feel guilty for making us
do all the work?

652
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,572
Tomorrow, you and Heedong
are diving in, so be ready.

653
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,823
And I'm going in after.

654
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:06,829
Heedong.

655
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,707
Come here.

656
00:45:14,503 --> 00:45:16,547
That coffee shop girl was here.

657
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,174
She left something for you.

658
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,138
Shit.

659
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,935
Excuse me, sir, you know where the girl
who was staying here went?

660
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,770
How the heck should I know that?

661
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,897
She just beat it without saying a word.

662
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,827
Taesan, you son of a bitch!

663
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,913
You call yourself a man? Huh?

664
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,459
Die, you bastard. Fucking die, bastard!

665
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,712
Just fucking die, you piece of shit!

666
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,338
What are you doing?

667
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,674
What are you doing? Get off me!

668
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:45,052
- Just don't.
- I'm going to kill that motherfucker!

669
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:47,305
How could you do that,
you piece of shit?

670
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,098
- Stop it.
- Let go of me.

671
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,058
Let go of me, Dohun! Fuck!

672
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,061
- You'll wake everyone up.
- Let him go.

673
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,229
I said let him go.

674
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,106
Just let him go.

675
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:06,324
Do whatever you want.
I'm not gonna fight you.

676
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,289
Why'd you do it, huh?
You gonna kill us too?

677
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,708
If one of us gets fucked up
like Beolgu did...

678
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,710
...will you toss us in the drink too?

679
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:19,462
Huh?

680
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,801
Fuck. What the hell do you think
we're even doing this for?

681
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:28,137
Just to make some petty cash?

682
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,890
- You think that's it?
- You fucking idiot.

683
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,770
The hell you asking me that? Huh?

684
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:40,358
If you're done throwing a fit,
go and try to get some rest.

685
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:42,735
We got a long day ahead.

686
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,447
Taesan. Tell me.

687
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,326
What are you planning to do
with his share?

688
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,626
-What's that?
-Beolgu's pay.

689
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,505
None of us are gonna take that.

690
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,759
That's his mother's, all right?

691
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,345
Swear to me that you'll give it to her.

692
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,972
Then I won't spill a word.

693
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,349
Okay?

694
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,236
Fuck me.

695
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:37,081
Heedong, if you panic,
you'll have trouble breathing.

696
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,251
So just stay calm.
We'll keep your air flowing.

697
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,545
- Got it.
- You vent the air like this,

698
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,922
so you can sink down lower,
and to come back up...

699
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,006
I said I know!

700
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:49,135
Tuck your head.

701
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,928
You little shit.

702
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,639
Be careful!

703
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,600
All right, turn it.

704
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:57,768
Turning.

705
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,085
That's it.

706
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,313
The boy's a natural.

707
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,588
I can't see anything.

708
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,294
What's that?

709
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,559
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

710
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,769
Oh, shit! What's going on?

711
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,815
What the hell? The current's going crazy!

712
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,067
We're on top of a damn tidal channel.

713
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,237
When the tide goes out, it rushes
at seven to nine kilos per hour.

714
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,322
Hot dang, just look at it.
