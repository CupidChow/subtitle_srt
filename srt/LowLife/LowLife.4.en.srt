1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,013
Ooh, what have we got here?

2
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,390
All the assholes
in one place, huh?

3
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,809
What the heck? The Professor?

4
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:21,522
I was wondering who that was.
It's Mr. Ha of Gwangju.

5
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,065
Ah, fucking hell.

6
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,983
Hey, Seokbae.

7
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,278
What? I thought you were locked up.

8
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,030
What are you doing here?

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,574
I rushed over thinking
you'd be here sniffing around.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,201
How'd you get out?

11
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:37,246
Now how the hell does
any of that concern you?

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:39,206
Stop wasting your time out here.

13
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,250
Go have a glass
of whatever it is you like to drink.

14
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,919
I mean, since you're here
and you know the spot already,

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,921
why don't we just
kill two birds with one stone?

16
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,757
Hey, you're desperate enough
to pull these kind of tricks?

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,260
What tricks? And who's desperate?

18
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,845
You know what hoops I had
to jump through to get him out of prison?

19
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,180
You think you can just freeload?

20
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:58,350
Well, we could just
drop down there ourselves over and over.

21
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,143
We're bound to find something.

22
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,438
Then go ahead and dive right on in.
What are you waiting for?

23
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,690
You watch yourself.

24
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,610
When this is over… As soon as
this is over, I'm kicking your damn ass.

25
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,114
You laughing?

26
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,449
All right, let's not do this here.

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,286
Let's go to Jeungdo and have a talk.

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,954
What's there to even say?

29
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,414
Then should we just stay here?

30
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,249
We should figure this out.

31
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,419
Fine.

32
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,922
Guess we'll come up with something
once we start talking.

33
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,465
Hey, let's go.

34
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:33,051
Right, let's go to Jeungdo!

35
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,761
Okay.

36
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,847
- You little piece of shit.
- We'll see you there.

37
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,724
- Just you wait.
- All right.

38
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,767
Let's move out.

39
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:43,895
Shit.

40
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,192
BASED ON THE HOOLIGANS BY YOON TAE HO

EPISODE 4, FEAST WITH THE ENEMY

43
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,295
JEUNGDO

44
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,218
Dang, Jeungdo.

45
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,179
- It's been a minute.
- It has, Boss.

46
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,056
You been before?
It's my first time here.

47
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,142
Right. This is where Sangbok lives,
isn't it?

48
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,145
Oh, yeah. You're right.
Sangbok does live here.

49
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,064
Ah, man. How come we never come out here?

50
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,651
Hey, Seokbae.
Let's just head to your shed.

51
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:16,154
- It's a bit of a mess.
- Hold on. Where are we going now?

52
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:18,448
He's got some drinks in his shed.

53
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:20,325
You really think it's the time for that?

54
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,328
Just chill out. We don't bite.

55
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,998
Ugh, shit.

56
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,627
You can survive a night in
a tiger's den if you keep your eyes open.

57
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,631
Still, this place is crawling
with hustlers and scammers.

58
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,634
All right, enough outta you already.

59
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,594
- Get your hands off me.
- Come on.

60
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,471
Hey, so, what's the move here?

61
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,850
What do you think?
We gotta come to a deal.

62
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,103
I mean, we can't let them have it.
So should we just take them out?

63
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,274
Are you crazy? What kinda stupid shit…

64
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,362
So, I was wondering, how'd you get out?

65
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:01,158
Why? You thought you'd just get
to relax and have all the fun on your own?

66
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,035
Have fun? You can get
the hell outta here with that shit.

67
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,037
I've kept my head down.

68
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,167
Wow, this is nice.

69
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,173
Here you are. Enjoy.

70
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,806
Seonja, did you grow up around here?

71
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,311
Well, I was born in Beolgyo,
but I spent most of my time here in Mokpo.

72
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,229
So what's in Seoul then? Why there?

73
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,816
Don't really know
if I wanna tell you, if I'm being honest.

74
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,236
Anyway, what made you
wanna go back to Seoul?

75
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,364
A job thing.

76
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:44,242
But seriously, why Seoul? Just say it.

77
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,789
Okay, truth is…

78
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,460
I'm actually into fashion,
and design, and all kinds of outfits.

79
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,712
I wanna try and get a job
at a clothing factory there.

80
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,756
Oh…

81
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,717
Check it out. This one was all me.

82
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,345
What do you think? Not bad, huh?

83
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,472
That'll only sell
in the countryside.

84
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,061
Whatever.

85
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,313
People around here say I have
a good fashion sense.

86
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,275
Don't worry. When I get a house,
you can be my housekeeper.

87
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,110
You're being an asshole.

88
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,696
I thought we were friends or something.

89
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,165
-Where's this from?
-I just found it.

90
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,211
Just found it. Sure you did.

91
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,714
Holy crap, this is silk.

92
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,592
This is swanky as hell.

93
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,053
But I'm curious,
what are you giving me this for?

94
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,348
-If you don't want it, gi-give it back.
-No, you already gave it to me.

95
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,432
You can't take it back.

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,270
Wow, it's so pretty!

97
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,897
Dang, it's nice.

98
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,860
What if… what if someone calls the cops
because I look so fancy?

99
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,572
How do I look?

100
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,240
Well…

101
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,827
What kind of reaction is that?

102
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,788
Ugh, I think I look great.

103
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,624
Let's try it like this.

104
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,877
How's this?

105
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,341
Hey, Seokbae. Hit the lights.

106
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,261
Man, I don't even know
what we're doing.

107
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,433
Wow, look at that.

108
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,643
-Whoa.
-Huh, not bad.

109
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,062
Dang, Seokbae,
you're loaded man.

110
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,315
What exactly is this place?

111
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,401
Well, mostly,
I just use it for storage.

112
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,944
I'll swing by now and then…

113
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,822
…kick back and relax, you know.

114
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,949
Those chickens over there?

115
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,035
Yeah, the neighbors
take care of them for me.

116
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,954
Hey, if you wanna talk,
why don't we head inside first?

117
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,331
Hang on.

118
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,126
We're all going inside to talk?

119
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,297
Well, I don't think we all have to.

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,675
Instead, let's stick to the three of us.

121
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,843
Yeah, why not?

122
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,804
If we all chime in,
we're never gonna get anywhere.

123
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,557
Be our guest. After you.

124
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,227
Now that's damn funny.

125
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,480
Since when have I
been your guest?

126
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:22,400
When you're visiting, what else
would you be? The host?

127
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,569
You two go on ahead.

128
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,321
Nature calls.

129
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,406
- Right now? Come on, man.
- Excuse me.

130
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,868
-Hey, where's the toilet?
-Uh, it's over there.

131
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,079
Okay, got wipes? Or anything?

132
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,872
There's straw rope.

133
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,083
A straw rope? Fuck…

134
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,429
Hey, you got anything to eat around here?

135
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,598
I'll go take a look.

136
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,184
Thanks, I'm about to starve
to death here.

137
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,894
Hey, what you got?

138
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,689
I know I got kimchi and rice somewhere.

139
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,570
You three.

140
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,572
I wanna have a word.

141
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,168
I have to be honest.

142
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,631
Really can't believe you boys
would just stab me in the back like this

143
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,049
over some bits of pottery.

144
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,969
Tell me what the hell I did
for you to treat me this way.

145
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,472
I bought y'all drinks,
got y'all jobs, and got you your cut!

146
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,518
- So how could you do this to me?
- What's that supposed to mean?

147
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,187
You were the one
who ditched us first. Forget already?

148
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,564
Yeah, exactly.

149
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,774
You started working
with Seokbae instead of us.

150
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,193
-What were we supposed to do?
-The money ain't a lot.

151
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,779
They're giving me crumbs.
How am I supposed to split it?

152
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,698
Seokbae's got a kid to feed.

153
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,867
- Whatever, man.
- Am I wrong?

154
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,078
Look, I didn't forget about y'all.

155
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,663
Got it all worked out in my head.

156
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,998
That so?

157
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,791
Then how much you getting?

158
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,918
You cheeky little bastard.

159
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,880
How much are you getting?

160
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,131
I can't tell you.

161
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,134
Afraid that's a secret.

162
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,219
A secret?

163
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,138
I'm sure it is.

164
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,183
Just use your heads for a second.

165
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,186
Once they dig up all that pottery
and leave, guess who's still here?

166
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,937
Think you'll never see me again?

167
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,525
Once we bring in a fat haul,
who will I be drinking with?

168
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,902
I do everything with you.

169
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,362
It's true, isn't it?

170
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,407
Well, in that case,
why don't you tell us first?

171
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,909
Screw you then, motherfuckers.

172
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,912
You have no damn loyalty.
Forget I said anything.

173
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,583
He's giving us half, okay? You happy?

174
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,344
-What does that mean?
-Exactly that.

175
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,263
Everything we find here…
Half the market price.

176
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,265
How does he know how much that'll be?

177
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,851
He's a professional, of course he'd know.

178
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,394
Does he have that kinda cash?

179
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,067
Uh, the thing is…

180
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,403
…something's shady about that guy.

181
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,573
Some bad vibes.

182
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:23,164
Damn, that hurts. Shit.

183
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,459
Let's go. Come on.

184
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,474
Oh man, they're all whispering
like little kids out there.

185
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,811
They were spilling everything
as far as I could tell.

186
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,897
-What do we do?
-Let's just cut the bullshit and be clear.

187
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,732
Why don't we work on different days?

188
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:54,112
We can flip a coin, or roll dice,
or play cards. Whatever you wanna do.

189
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,197
And the winner gets to pick.

190
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,907
Why go through all that?

191
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:02,412
We already know where it is.
Just lend us the diver, it's that simple.

192
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,830
Don't worry about the money,

193
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,039
I got you covered.

194
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,875
Look, you're underestimating us.

195
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,878
If we keep our eyes peeled
in Bangchuk-ri waters day and night,

196
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:12,088
of course we'll find it sooner or later.

197
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,174
We'll all get nothing
if we fight over this.

198
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,300
Do you realize that?

199
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,887
I've got someone lined up
in Seoul who's willing to buy all of it.

200
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:22,640
After that, we break it down.
Then we can determine the cut per head.

201
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:26,144
My guy's Japanese,
so it'll be easier to sell.

202
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,813
And I got a guy in Gwangju, all right?

203
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,190
And the thing with my guy is…

204
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,568
…if I say it's a hundred,
he'll pay a hundred. No questions asked.

205
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,652
Yeah?

206
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,113
The guy I've got would point
at the shelf and go,

207
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,325
"Give me everything from here to here."
I could even slip in fakes.

208
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,453
Think you're the only one?
I always sell out my stuff too.

209
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,872
All right, just forget it.

210
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,249
Whatever happens out there,
I'll handle it on my own.

211
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,626
Hey, hey, wait.

212
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,170
Why don't we do this?

213
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,300
We can't get all
those ceramics out by ourselves.

214
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,510
Hiring more people
might mean word getting out.

215
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,512
And since we already know each other…

216
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,182
…let's just do this together.

217
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,517
Okay, but how do we divide it all?

218
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,728
We'll just have to split it all evenly.

219
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,064
- Mm-hmm.
- You think that'll work?

220
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,192
The pieces aren't all worth
the same thing. You can't split that way.

221
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,444
We got two experts right here, don't we?

222
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,072
Appraise the ceramics
and we'll figure it out after that.

223
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,992
Sorry. Since my buyer's
in Japan, I'll need quality pieces.

224
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,413
Come on, I'll need quality
pieces too if I wanna sell anything.

225
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,875
Did I say you didn't?
Look, nice try, but this won't work.

226
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,168
Water and oil don't mix.

227
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,380
Hey, you're not gonna walk outta here
in the middle of our conversation.

228
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,548
We've got nothing more
to say to each other.

229
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,717
-I'm the one holding the key.
-What key?

230
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,135
You don't even know where the spot is.

231
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,512
-Let go.
-You shit.

232
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,972
I said let go.

233
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,099
Are you a thug, huh?

234
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,228
This is stupid.

235
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,107
- Oh, damn it.
- Shit.

236
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,067
Son of a bitch.

237
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,318
Hey! Let's go!

238
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,861
Damn idiots.

239
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,738
Shit.

240
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,033
I knew this would happen.

241
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,327
Fine, let's do it your way!

242
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,914
I'll be watching you like a hawk, okay?

243
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,083
I'll be sticking to you
like white on rice.

244
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,376
Let's see how you like that shit.

245
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,545
Can you believe
this stupid fucking asshole?

246
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,463
The fuck you just say, bitch?

247
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,966
- You wanna talk shit, huh?
- Keep your damn shirts on!

248
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,428
You gonna take your pants off too?

249
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,013
All right, let's stop it here.

250
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,181
Call it a night for now.

251
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,934
Clear your heads
and talk about it tomorrow.

252
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,605
All right, then.

253
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:38,318
Ah, crap. I don't know if we can find
a place to stay.

254
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,322
- Why'd they take off their shirts?
- It's a long story.

255
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,742
Kid's always running hot.

256
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,681
Oh, shit. Gotta hold it in…

257
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,310
There I go.

258
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,359
Oh, shit.

259
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,404
Work with me.

260
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,115
Why the hell, would you sneak up on a man

261
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,118
who's clearly taking a piss?

262
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,788
Just join us and we could get it all.

263
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,790
We wouldn't have to split the pot so much.

264
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,917
I'll pretend I didn't hear anything.

265
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,251
Ah, come on, man.

266
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,628
I'll cut you a good deal.

267
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,590
How's 30% of the profits sound? Damn, 30%.

268
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,425
- I said no.
- Wow.

269
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,844
What are you trying to pull over there?

270
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:55,853
Thing is, you're not even asking
the real question. It's pretty obvious.

271
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,188
What's that?

272
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,358
The fact that we're talking out here
instead of in prison.

273
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,944
I'm still supposed to be locked up.

274
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:06,823
You can ask me all you want.

275
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,699
I'm afraid my lips are sealed.

276
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:19,293
Well, well. I wonder
what Mr. Big Shot from Seoul is up to now?

277
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:33,224
THE SUNKEN TREASURE OFF DODEOKDO

278
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,074
Oh…

279
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,035
You're still up, Mrs. Yang?

280
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,704
Hi, you're awake.

281
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,498
Would you like something to eat?

282
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,877
No, it's okay.
I won't be up much longer.

283
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,545
Hmm, okay.

284
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:03,963
Good night, Mrs. Yang.

285
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,529
Hey, wake up.

286
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,866
Hey now, get up. I'm going to work.
Aren't you gonna see me off?

287
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,829
Ah, shit.

288
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,956
Ow, my head hurts.

289
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,335
You were drinking like a fish last night.

290
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,296
What? Where are we?

291
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,506
In my room. Where do you think?

292
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,799
Don't say you forgot.

293
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,345
Wait, did I sleep here?

294
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,557
Do you remember what I said last night?

295
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,353
Um, was it about that Busan guy?

296
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,230
You remember. Well, that's good.

297
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,524
That must mean
you remember your promise too, right?

298
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,943
What do you mean?

299
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,071
Uh, do you only remember
whatever you want to?

300
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,907
You said you'd talk to the madam,
and help me move to Seoul.

301
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,325
Wha… Really?

302
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,119
Uh, you said there was
a clothing store I could work at.

303
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,537
You knew a big one over in Jongno.

304
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,207
-How am I getting you work?
-How the hell would I know?

305
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,003
Uh, wait, where are my clothes?

306
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,966
Hey.

307
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,009
Did we do it last night?

308
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,638
What? Don't tell me you forgot it all.

309
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,683
After you started getting all handsy
with me like this, we had sex, yeah.

310
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,726
Ah, shit. You're kidding.

311
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,645
Uh, was there anything else?

312
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,313
Yeah, you kept talking a lot.

313
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,066
It only takes a few drinks
for you to turn into a motormouth.

314
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,027
Hey listen. Don't repeat anything I said
last night to anyone, for your own good.

315
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,362
You get me?

316
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,030
I don't know what you're talking about.

317
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,907
Just forget everything
I said last night, okay?

318
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,952
I was just, you know,
talking shit to get into your pants.

319
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,412
Shit.

320
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,667
Hey, did…
did he say anything about pottery?

321
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,544
- The Busan guy?
- No, he didn't.

322
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,630
But he definitely had a gun in his bag.

323
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,758
Gun?

324
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,802
Like, what kind of a gun? Like a pistol?

325
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,596
Yeah, it looked real fancy.

326
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,642
Seonja, tell your boyfriend
to eat something and sober up.

327
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,688
Where you off to, cutie-pie?
There's food for you.

328
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,440
Ah, shit.

329
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,235
Damn it…

330
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:34,030
Shit.

331
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,781
It's cramped in here.

332
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,908
Fuck.

333
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,204
Shit.

334
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,707
I'm surprised you let him sleep
in here, though.

335
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,168
I thought you couldn't stand men.

336
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,128
I might've played a little trick on him.

337
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,379
What'd you do?

338
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,048
He kept talking about buried things,

339
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,175
so I buried a little something.

340
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,885
Yeah, I bet you had fun

341
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,179
burying that little something something
last night.

342
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,473
Let's go eat.

343
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,226
Oh, shit.

344
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,189
Ah, shit.

345
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,732
Ma'am? Ma'am!

346
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,276
-Hey.
-Oh, boy, why didn't you come sooner?

347
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,196
- Everyone's already gone out.
- Where'd they go?

348
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,490
Didn't they go to Jeungdo?

349
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,242
Jeungdo?
W-When's the next boat heading there?

350
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:23,037
Well, to get out that way,
there's only two boats a day.

351
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,331
And the morning one left a while ago.

352
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,792
Don't know
if there's a second boat in the afternoon.

353
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,877
Uh, why'd I do that?

354
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,712
I shouldn't have drank.

355
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,717
Yeah. He went to catch the boat?

356
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,972
Guess he'll take the next one.
All right, ma'am. Thanks.

357
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,227
That idiot said he'd be here yesterday.

358
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,562
Well, it ain't like we can watch him
round the clock anyway.

359
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:50,439
It'd be better
if we had Bokgeun here, though.

360
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,441
Ain't there
a way to flip him?

361
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,612
Also, how did Kim get him out?
I mean he was locked up.

362
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,698
He's got connections all over.

363
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,033
I bet he knows someone
on the inside.

364
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,203
We should just kick their ass.
We outnumber these idiots with Heedong.

365
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,540
What's wrong?
Your blood boiling again?

366
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:12,128
Well, what if we all just worked together?

367
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,589
Hey, how're we supposed
to split the money then, huh?

368
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,842
Why split it?
Just take it and bail.

369
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,512
What's the point in trying
to split it when we can take it all?

370
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,473
Wow, I like the way you think.

371
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,058
You're not as dumb as I thought.

372
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,521
Well, that's not a bad idea.

373
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,951
Hey, yeah.

374
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,830
What brings you here?

375
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,707
Uh, what the…

376
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,126
Hey there.

377
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,461
Professor Kim.

378
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,422
Here, do you like melons?

379
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,216
Could I have a word with you?

380
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,931
I should tell you,

381
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,142
before we came down here,

382
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,770
we placed
some pieces underwater.

383
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,401
So, how many pieces are there?

384
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,863
Well, it's sure to be
a lot more than what we dig up out there.

385
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,365
And, with your expert appraisal,

386
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,202
we could easily pull one over
on our buyer in Seoul.

387
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,162
So you don't lift a finger…

388
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,164
And you still cash in, huh?

389
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,332
Right.

390
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,877
'Cause no one needs to die for these ones.

391
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,464
In that case, you're raking
in all that cash by yourself.

392
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,883
You can flip
that money several times over.

393
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,803
How we handle our sales,
that's our business.

394
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,472
I'm here to try
and figure out something else, all right?

395
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,556
Our impasse.

396
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,101
You sure know how to wheel and deal.

397
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,564
All right, which are you taking?
The ones you farmed?

398
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,449
Let's include all the farmed pots.

399
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,410
Then we'll divvy it up.
Evenly, after costs.

400
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,415
And those guys?

401
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,294
Nah, they're not part of the deal.

402
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,089
I mean, they're your guys.
You can handle it.

403
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:23,259
Wait. Wait a minute.

404
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,721
Tell me, how are we gonna do this?
You, me, and…

405
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:28,931
The Tiger.

406
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,808
- And the Tiger?
- Three ways.

407
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,144
And whoever's working for us,
we handle on our own.

408
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,647
What do you say?

409
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,734
Pretty damn good, huh?

410
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,614
What is it?
Do you want it in writing, sir?

411
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,410
Writing? Don't be silly.

412
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,703
We're just digging salvage.

413
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,332
All right, let's do this.

414
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,348
Hello, sir. Welcome.

415
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,643
-Hey, it's been a while.
-Yes, sir.

416
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,021
-Right this way to the chairman.
-Wow.

417
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,023
It's a fine day.

418
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,734
Here. It's fully stocked.

419
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,402
Oh, I couldn't.

420
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,070
Thank you so much, Chairman Cheon.

421
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:31,118
So, uh, have you been out
for drinks much these days?

422
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,287
No. Hardly ever.
Only when I see you.

423
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,247
There's not enough time in the day for me.

424
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,833
Oh, but you're taking care of the country.

425
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,585
You have to find time for yourself.

426
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:42,046
By the way, um… What was it again?

427
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,423
-What?
-You mentioned starting a school?

428
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,510
Oh.

429
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,348
Well, you know, it's so chaotic out there.

430
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,975
I just hold on to that one lifeline.

431
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,311
Uh-huh. What do you mean?

432
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,481
Well, of course I'm talking about you.

433
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:04,026
Because you're the only one
I can count on these days.

434
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,655
Ah, geez. You're making
it sound bigger than it is.

435
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:11,992
Oh, and also, I'm building a museum,
right there at the school.

436
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,536
A cushy position for you after retirement.

437
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,164
Settling down on campus
wouldn't be so bad.

438
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,707
Museum, huh?

439
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,501
What kind of museum is it?

440
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,461
You know about the ship?

441
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,964
The treasure ship that sank off Sinan.

442
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,258
Well, I sent some people there,
to go and bring up the relics.

443
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,677
That means you're breaking the law.

444
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,930
Do you know how many times fisherman
have pulled them up already?

445
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,267
- Somebody's got to buy them.
- Well, in that case, um…

446
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:40,854
Would you mind setting aside
some pieces for me to take?

447
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,107
-What?
-Americans, you know.

448
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,567
They're obsessed with everything oriental.

449
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,195
I mean, give them a gift of that caliber,

450
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,905
I swear they'll go head over heels.

451
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:52,408
- Over the moon, even.
- I see.

452
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,951
I'd love it if you could set aside

453
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,078
a good deal of it.

454
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,830
There's a lot of hands
I'm gonna have to shake.

455
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,708
I'll set aside
the very best pieces I can find.

456
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,793
Ah, the drinks are hitting just right.

457
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,461
Oh, here. Cheers.

458
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,216
Look,
we've got too many people here.

459
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,010
We have to figure out
who's getting on the boat.

460
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,220
Why can't we
just take two boats out there?

461
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,681
We can't 'cause of the locals.
Let's take one boat.

462
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,765
Why?

463
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,893
Back when they first
pulled it up, no one really gave a shit.

464
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,521
But then, last year the navy showed up.

465
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,189
That got people's attention quick.

466
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,150
They put up a watch post,

467
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,569
so if we take two boats out,
we'll get caught.

468
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,320
So only one boat, that's for sure.

469
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,448
Next, we'll need guys
who are gonna dive in the water.

470
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,825
So then, how many people
are we talking here?

471
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,787
If all of us get on,
we won't have room for the pottery.

472
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,999
Uh, are you guys yapping
the whole time or what?

473
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,709
Only one of us should be the leader.

474
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,335
All right, then. I'll talk.

475
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,047
No, no, no, no. For this one,
I should do the talking.

476
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,548
Remember, I'm a professor.

477
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,384
But I've got the most experience
selling these things.

478
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:54,928
Well, if we're talking man power,
I've got the most guys.

479
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,097
Listen up, the second
I make a call,

480
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:00,059
a whole group of guys
will come running. You can bet on that.

481
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,479
You don't think I have guys?
I'll make a call.

482
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,481
Stay out of this
before you say something dumb.

483
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,815
Hey, let's just cool down.

484
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,817
Why don't we just go
and get a bigger boat?

485
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,445
-That ought to fix this, right?
-I already told you we need a small one

486
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,155
'cause anything bigger
will get us caught out there!

487
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,740
Hey, hey, hey. Be quiet.

488
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:19,453
Professor Kim. Hey, you too.
Let's have a talk.

489
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:24,041
Ugh, what the hell is this shit?

490
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:31,632
Hey, I don't wanna do this.
Let's all be adults.

491
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,718
That's real rich from the guy
who is always trying to pull something.

492
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,553
Look, we can't all get on the boat.

493
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,515
You two are pottery experts.
You're not cut out for this.

494
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,643
I'm not cut out
for this, am I?

495
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,603
I've been raiding tombs for 30 years.

496
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,648
Great, but when we're out there,
we need guys who can haul pottery.

497
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,525
Do the appraisal when we get back.

498
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,653
Yeah, 'cause you won't pull
a fast one on us and stash it away?

499
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,404
You think I don't see your angle here?

500
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:58,992
All right, sure.

501
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,788
Once we're on this boat, we get out there
and we all do what we have to do.

502
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,581
- Understand?
- Don't order me around.

503
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,917
I know what I'm doing.

504
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,295
- You better not slack off.
- Hey, Uncle.

505
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,965
What the hell happened?

506
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,883
Uh, what…
what's going on here?

507
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,220
- We're doing it together.
- What?

508
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,805
The pottery, what do you think?

509
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,348
Oh, hey, kid.

510
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,101
I tried hitting on that coffee shop girl,

511
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,103
but she shot me down right down.

512
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,773
Man, that chick's got the softest hands,
though, doesn't she?

513
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,608
- Damn it.
- Wha…

514
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,360
- What are you doing?
- Hey,

515
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,988
- what do you think you're doing?
- Hey, Heedong.

516
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,866
Is this guy usually this nuts?

517
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,827
Come on. What's your problem?

518
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,621
- Whoa. What the hell?
- Get down.

519
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:45,706
You piece of shit!

520
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,250
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hey, come here.

521
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,878
What?

522
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:52,421
That guy's carrying a gun.

523
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,506
Seonja said she saw it in his bag.

524
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,427
-Hey, pick up my shit.
-Wait, this whole time you were with her?

525
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,595
Come on.

526
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,223
I told you to be careful, you little shit.
Not go around town flapping your mouth.

527
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,768
- Damn it.
- You need to get your shit together.

528
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,692
Look, before we all get on.

529
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,236
I need to check everyone's pockets.

530
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,240
And who the fuck are you?

531
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:22,451
Who the fuck are you
to go through my shit?

532
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,620
Hey…

533
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,413
Well, look what we got here.

534
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,498
- Son of a bitch.
- Hey, give it here.

535
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:33,378
If you have any useless crap like this,
let me see it.

536
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:36,214
I got these nail clippers
right here.

537
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,050
Are these okay to bring?

538
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,843
They're not, give it here.

539
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,386
Really?

540
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,805
Anything sharp or jagged, take it out now.

541
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,099
No, there's no fucking way
this is gonna work.

542
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,560
We got too many cooks in the kitchen.

543
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,604
Fuck!

544
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,608
The hell's his deal?

545
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,735
Look, I spent years
on deep-sea fishing vessels.

546
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,948
Once a boat goes out on the water,
the laws of the land don't apply.

547
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,616
Does that mean chaos?

548
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,327
Not quite. 'Cause we got
the captain there.

549
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,371
The captain's word is the law!

550
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,581
If we head out to sea like this,

551
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,333
it's gonna be a fight
over who's in charge.

552
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,586
He said stop and he said go.
It'll be a total shit show out there.

553
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,172
He's got a point.
We're gonna need a leader.

554
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,425
I say someone who knows
the sea should take the lead.

555
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:21,843
He's right.

556
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:26,264
We ended up with a bigger crew,
but we have to work together out at sea.

557
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:29,434
We'll need a boss.
One who can really make that happen, yeah?

558
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:30,602
All right, then.

559
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,646
Let's go ahead and pick the boss.

560
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,648
Let's do it then.

561
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,900
Hi, I've been meaning to ask.

562
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,900
Hi, I've been meaning to ask.

563
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:40,696
Is there any chance
some pieces could be high-end?

564
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,030
"High-end," you mean, uh…

565
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,366
I need them
as a gift for someone.

566
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:48,078
I'll need around 30.
The finest ones you can source.

567
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,329
Uh, but…

568
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,790
Chairman, would this be included
in the five million?

569
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,459
Of course not.
This is a whole different thing.

570
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,753
<i>So make sure you get the best ones.</i>

571
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,840
Oh, of course, Chairman Cheon.
I'll scale things up a bit.

572
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,174
Okay then.

573
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,639
Uh, has Jeonchul called recently?

574
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,683
No.

575
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,935
It's been a while since he reported in.

576
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,564
They could've started working.
You can't make calls out at sea.

577
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,609
So then, you're scaling things up?

578
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:22,654
Yeah,
we had to change course.

579
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,574
And what made you change your tune?

580
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:30,037
Assemblyman Kim agreed
he's going to back me, 100%.

581
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,416
He's got a lot of palms to grease,
so he asked if I had anything good.

582
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,500
Anything good?

583
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,544
Gifts military officers would like.

584
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:41,840
These Americans,
they go crazy over oriental ceramics.

585
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,301
That's good news.

586
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,472
Really? The museum idea was
so repulsive to you. What changed?

587
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,349
Well,
this is great if it helps us grow.

588
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,436
But don't you think we can
do a lot more than this?

589
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,687
How so?

590
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,107
Once word gets out, his bosses
and superiors will also want in.

591
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,650
Stock up on ceramics.

592
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,153
That way we can make real money
from the start.

593
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:07,783
Since we need
pieces for the museum already,

594
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,703
we might as well profit
while we're at it, yeah?

595
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:12,788
Precisely.

596
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,457
A museum's not going to draw attention.

597
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,293
I mean we just need to put
a few real ones in the front.

598
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,629
The rest we can put to greater use.

599
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:25,550
You sure got a damn sharp mind
for things like this.

600
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,346
Now…

601
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,306
Here's everything you need to know.

602
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,810
I'm the guy who'll always
find a way to get a piece of the pie.

603
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,604
When it comes to money…

604
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,231
…I'm like a moth to a flame,

605
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,482
I just can't help it.

606
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,027
They always ask how
I'm so good at sniffing out jackpots.

607
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:48,365
So I tell them, "It's not money
that has a smell, it's people."

608
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,451
And speaking from experience,
everyone here reeks.

609
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,536
Y'all reek.

610
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,496
Y'all reek of money.

611
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,290
Our goal is to ensure that
this is fair and just.

612
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:01,419
All the while trying to get
the greatest payout we can get.

613
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,463
Now, the key here

614
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,259
is gonna be excavating first
and splitting the shares later.

615
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,677
Let me say one more thing.

616
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,179
Well, the reason I should be
in charge here

617
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,597
is 'cause I was born to do it.

618
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,142
Even when I was in prison,
I was in charge.

619
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,227
And obviously I'm the boss here now.

620
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,398
And I bring out
the greatest energy in people.

621
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,942
Like, uh, you do this, you do that.

622
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,861
Roles. I hand those out.

623
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,450
Seongcheol.

624
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,870
What are you doing out here?

625
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,665
Listen, Cheon? He's grabbing the reins.

626
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,959
Oh, yeah?

627
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,420
Not exactly sure
how he wants this race to play out.

628
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,714
But one thing's for sure,
he definitely wants to run it.

629
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,593
I wonder what got into
that stubborn old man.

630
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,178
I have no idea.

631
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,471
Maybe he saw
the Grim Reaper in his dreams,

632
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,765
or maybe it was
the gift to his wife that did it.

633
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:58,143
What do you mean? What'd you give her?

634
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:00,437
You don't need to know.

635
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,065
Hey. The guy that Cheon wants me
to give the pottery to…

636
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,651
I think he's a big shot,
at least from what I heard.

637
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,196
We should probably give him
one of the pieces from Sinan.

638
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,572
That's not a problem.

639
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,117
Celadon or white porcelain, just give him
whatever he wants, done deal.

640
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:18,371
By the way,
how much did you promise Ha Yeongsu?

641
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,456
What do you mean?

642
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,583
He'll want a bigger slice
for a bigger a haul.

643
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,792
Okay, look.

644
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,086
Does he have any money or any guys?

645
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,380
Does he do anything
besides just sit there?

646
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:31,176
Maybe not, but Ha Yeongsu is
the only appraisal expert you got.

647
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:33,511
What if he tries something?

648
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,931
Nah, he doesn't have
the guts to do that. No.

649
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,183
He's a small-time grifter.

650
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,393
If I throw him a little extra,
he'll fall in line quick.

651
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,895
Also,

652
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,105
there was this guy, Kim, in Daein-dong.

653
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,024
He was a Saemaul leader.

654
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,235
He'd sit in on
all sorts of big discussions

655
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,111
at the table with President Park.

656
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:54,032
He and I go way back, you know.

657
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,283
Let me see…

658
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,119
What elementary school did he go to…

659
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,538
Was he in Daein-dong then?

660
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,083
Im-dong sounds right though.

661
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,877
Or maybe Ilpyeong Elementary, was that it?

662
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,129
What's your point? Just get to it.

663
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,799
Ah, well, so anyway…

664
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,425
What I'm trying to say is…

665
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,638
I was wondering if it was necessary
or if it was just a waste

666
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,306
for me to tag along with y'all.

667
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,934
Then why don't you stay at the inn
and you can appraise all of it later.

668
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,436
But sitting around drinking
and waiting out the clock,

669
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,731
well, that doesn't seem wise.
Now that would be a waste.

670
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,318
If you look around we got
experts out the ass. Go back to Gwangju.

671
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,071
Well, I came all this way,
so I don't want to leave with nothing.

672
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,241
Obviously, in this life,
we're born with empty hands,

673
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,702
and in death, we leave with empty hands.

674
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,203
However, I'm involved now,

675
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,914
so my conscience tells me
I have to contribute in some way.

676
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,791
It'd be the right thing to do.

677
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,962
Man, the Gwangju Tiger really
has a way with words now, doesn't he?

678
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:50,880
I could tell just by looking,

679
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:54,676
the instant
anyone here tried to take control,

680
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,845
no one else would abide or accept it, see?

681
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,055
So, with that in mind,

682
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:04,394
I ask for your support as I take it upon
myself to bear this heavy responsibility.

683
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,106
As the only one here
without conflicting interests,

684
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,567
I'd appreciate if
y'all would consider for this--

685
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,986
Well, we're gonna have fights
no matter who we choose.

686
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,990
-Got a solid point.
-Wait, is this your first time out at sea?

687
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,826
I took a boat out
to raid some tombs in Aphaedo.

688
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,828
You wouldn't believe it,
absolutely terrible.

689
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,539
If it's that awful,
why put yourself through it?

690
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,416
Nothing succeeds without toil.

691
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,377
And now it's become one
of my most cherished remembrances.

692
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,880
I don't know if
this is the right call or not.

693
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:34,758
Trying to avoid a puddle
but stepping in dog shit.

694
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,469
I would like to remind y'all once again,

695
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,971
that I'm purely acting
in everyone's interest.

696
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:42,057
Could I get a round of applause?

697
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,475
Should I go on?

698
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,518
I could do this all night.

699
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:47,729
Yeah, that's more like it.

700
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,106
Why, thank you.

701
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,862
All right, listen.
There are a lot of people, so be careful.

702
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,657
And make sure that
the weight on both sides is equal.

703
00:35:58,740 --> 00:35:59,741
"THE FIRST BOSS
HA YEONG-SU"

704
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,243
Go ahead.

705
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,205
I'm the boss and my word is law,
all right?

706
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,165
Hey, take this.

707
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,209
Hey!

708
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,504
Bokgeun, you're the one who knows
where it is, so we need you up front!

709
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,048
- Here, take this with you too.
- Don't talk to me.

710
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,758
I know what I'm doing.

711
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,511
Don't you think it'll sink
if everyone gets on?

712
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,222
You two stay here.
Heedong and I will check it out.

713
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,306
Are you sure?

714
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,183
We're just gonna go
and check out the spot.

715
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:28,061
Hey. One of you guys should come too.

716
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,232
Hey, give it.

717
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,568
Excuse me, coming through.

718
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,862
- All right, hurry up.
- Get on already.

719
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,073
Captain Hwang! Let's head out!

720
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,409
Oh, man.

721
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,662
This is killing me! How much longer?

722
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,790
Just a little bit further now!

723
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,792
That's Dodeokdo over there!

724
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,919
Yeah!

725
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,295
That's Sodando!

726
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:57,382
Daedando! Naegaldo! Oegaldo!

727
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,843
What's wrong?
Is there a problem here?

728
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,928
Damn it, can you just give me a second?

729
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,305
I was locked up for too long,
it ain't easy.

730
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:05,807
You can't forget where it is!

731
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,143
Man, this is rough as shit.

732
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,521
The current's so strong, of course
the navy couldn't haul it all out!

733
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,148
We're barely moving!

734
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,525
This boat's seriously a piece of shit!

735
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,361
Yeah, I know.
I don't think this boat's going to cut it!

736
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,155
Ah, fuck this.

737
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,782
Somebody's going to end up dead
before we even find this shit.

738
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,034
What, down there?

739
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,619
- Here?
- Are you sure?

740
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,788
- Yeah, hey. Stop!
- Hey, cut the engine already!

741
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,707
We'll drift away if we just do that.

742
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,795
I should be able to see, uh,
the head of Naegaldo and the tail of, uh…

743
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,714
and the tail of Oegaldo from here!

744
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,549
Ah, come on. Fuck!

745
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,176
Does he even know where it is?

746
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,969
-This motherfucker.
-Hey, you dumb asshat!

747
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,096
You're going right back
if you don't find it!

748
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,640
Fuck me!

749
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,392
It's right around here!

750
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:52,187
What the fuck.
It all looks the same.

751
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,069
Huh?

752
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,743
Hey!

753
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,912
There!

754
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,247
- Wait, are you serious?
- It's there?

755
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:13,500
-Yeah! I'm sure! There!
-Hurry, quick drop the anchor!

756
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:16,044
Hurry up! Come on.

757
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,173
Throw it down.

758
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,593
Hey, Seokbae, get ready now!

759
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,056
Oh, hey, Seongcheol!
Hey, Seongcheol.

760
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,725
Here, here, here, here.

761
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,064
So, I talked to Cheon
and set up a meeting with the big shot.

762
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,899
Who is it?

763
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,109
The politician, Kim Myeonggu.

764
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,988
I'm meeting him in a bit at a restaurant
for lunch, and you should join us.

765
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,114
Who else is going?

766
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,826
I think just him.
He wouldn't want anyone seeing this.

767
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,329
Cheon really made a huge decision
this time around.

768
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,123
I mean, the fact that he's leaving
this client and deal to me says a lot.

769
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:56,042
It looks like you and Cheon
are in bed together

770
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,460
for the time being, aren't you?

771
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,338
Ugh, gross! Why would you
put that image in my head?

772
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,048
Geez.

773
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:57,562
-Oh! Hey.
-Oh, hey!

774
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,772
Did you find anything?

775
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,900
-Are we in the right spot?
-Nothing down there.

776
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:04,819
You checked the whole area down there?

777
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,779
I mean, I looked everywhere.
Nothing but dirt.

778
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,449
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Sure you know where it is?

779
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:13,077
Seokbae,
you should try searching over here.

780
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,830
Hey, man, you want me
to search the whole sea floor?

781
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:19,208
Look, damn it.
This here current is strong as all hell!

782
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,793
I'm telling you, it's around here.

783
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,295
Come on, try over this way.

784
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:25,048
Hey, you're not the one diving,
you son of a bitch.

785
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,258
-Just swim that way.
-Ah, hell with this.

786
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:28,676
I'm exhausted, man.

787
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,136
Search the whole area!

788
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,641
Damn it.

789
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,729
Hi, I'm sorry I'm so late.

790
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:40,813
- Oh.
- No, it's okay.

791
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,106
My meeting ran long.

792
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,069
- So sorry.
- Don't worry about it, Mr. Kim.

793
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,572
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm Song Gitaek, an antiques dealer.

794
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,783
Oh, wow, the pleasure's mine.

795
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,368
- Kim Myeonggu.
- Hello.

796
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,745
I'm Han Seongcheol. I work as a potter.

797
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,538
- Right. Pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

798
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,916
- All right. Let's sit down.
- Yes, of course.

799
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,171
I know you have a really busy schedule,
so I appreciate you meeting with us today.

800
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:10,468
-Mr. Kim, would you like your usual?
-Yeah, sure. I'll have the usual.

801
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,095
You too. Go have dinner.

802
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,014
From what I hear,

803
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:17,392
you two gentlemen have
a lot of great pieces.

804
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,810
Right, yes, yes.

805
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,730
I must admit we do have some fine pieces
in our collection, Mr. Kim.

806
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,566
All right, well, are any of them
worth taking a look at?

807
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,818
Yes, of course.

808
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,195
I got this one that's
extremely valuable and unique.

809
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,197
It carries the true essence of Goryeo--

810
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,282
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

811
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,909
Hey…

812
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,162
Guys like me, we wouldn't get it
even if you explained it.

813
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,333
Just go ahead and choose the ones
that are the best of their kind.

814
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,461
Mmm. Well, what are you looking for?

815
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,797
An obvious showpiece.

816
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,881
Hmm?

817
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:52,427
You know, something that gets you to go,
"Wow! That's a masterpiece."

818
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,346
If that's the case,
then I have this piece here.

819
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,807
I really hope this one's to your tastes.

820
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,019
It's white porcelain from
the Joseon dynasty, and it's very rare.

821
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,148
If you look here, you'll see,
it's got a really magnificent color.

822
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,774
What do you think?

823
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,112
This is exactly what I don't want.

824
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,116
It could have
an orchid painted right here.

825
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,953
Or maybe some other kind of flowers,
you know?

826
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,998
This is just plain white. It's no good.

827
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,960
Mr. Kim,
how about something like this?

828
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:33,926
This here is
a Yuan-dynasty-made water dropper.

829
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:38,431
Wow, this is great.

830
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,809
How nice.

831
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,562
Look at this pattern!

832
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,355
Just beautiful.

833
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,530
Are you insane? What were you thinking?

834
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,617
Looked like he was about to walk out
if I didn't do it.

835
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,453
Even if things were going that way,
you can't show him a fake.

836
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,330
I can't deal with you right now.

837
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,290
You saw it in there.

838
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,168
He couldn't even tell what was real.

839
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,754
Isn't this better for us?

840
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,005
What do you mean?

841
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,258
What if all they can find are just
plain pieces from Sinan, what then?

842
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:17,053
-Hmm.
-Now we know what he likes.

843
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:21,474
We should focus on
farming ones that are decorated like that.

844
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,227
Mm-hmm.

845
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,836
- I can't take this.
- Boss man.

846
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,171
-What?
-What are you doing?

847
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:36,007
To hell with this boss shit.

848
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,092
I don't want it. You be the boss.

849
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,635
Nah, I'm good.

850
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:42,263
Ah, at least
the water's calmed down a little.

851
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,099
It's only like this for a bit.
It's gonna get rough again soon.

852
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,936
The sun's setting.
Once he's up, let's call it a day.

853
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,731
-Uh-huh.
-You fucking bastard!

854
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,274
What the hell is this, huh?

855
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,653
I got your ass out of prison
and you can't even find it, piece of shit.

856
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,699
- Don't rock the boat.
- Gross.

857
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,174
Hey, you were right!

858
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,387
- We're gonna be rich!
- Take it!

859
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:28,017
You have to be careful!
Here! Don't drop it, careful!

860
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,478
Hey, that's
a good-looking piece right there.

861
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,439
Come on,
I wanna look at it too! Let me see it!

862
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,693
- Over here!
- Hey, is he okay?

863
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:40,655
Wow. Now this is the real deal.
The real deal.

864
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,616
- Did you see a lot? Did you?
- I couldn't really tell.

865
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,618
-What?
-I couldn't see that well.

866
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,828
-Can I see?
-Hey, careful.

867
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,498
We've got to get a pump as soon as we can.

868
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,582
Like, for diving?

869
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,252
Yeah. It supplies air
to the helmet diver.

870
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,380
You keep it on the boat,
and pump air down through a hose.

871
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:01,050
Oh, so one goes down with an air tank, and
the other guy goes down with the helmet?

872
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,386
Yeah, we'll go in with the helmet,
we'll go in with the air tank--

873
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,054
-And you'll go in!
-Yeah, and I'll go in.

874
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,681
-And I'll go in!
-And you'll go in! Exactly!

875
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:10,434
Everyone's going in! Come on,
man. It's too tough to dive alone.

876
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,145
- Ah, hell nah!
- All right, all right! Back to Mokpo!

877
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:15,564
-Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
-Let's get all the stuff ready to go!

878
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,986
We found the goddamn pottery!

879
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,285
<i>We went back to Mokpo</i>
<i>and started getting ready for the job.</i>

880
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,746
<i>We mixed up the two groups and divided</i>
<i>the tasks so no one would try anything.</i>

881
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,374
Ow!

882
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,711
<i>Seokbae, Beolgu, and Jeonchul</i>
<i>handled the diving gear and pump.</i>

883
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,547
<i>While Daesik and Bokgeun took care of</i>
<i>the ropes and nets</i>

884
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,048
<i>for hauling everything up.</i>

885
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:44,552
<i>Captain Hwang was in charge of</i>
<i>fuel for the boat and food for the trip.</i>

886
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,556
<i>Uncle Gwanseok, Professor Kim,</i>
<i>Mr. Ha and I handled everything else.</i>

887
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,766
<i>To make it fair,</i>
<i>we split things down the middle.</i>

888
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,476
I want to sleep in my own room.

889
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:56,272
We have to stick together
before we go to Jeungdo.

890
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,941
Let's just grin and bear it, Professor.

891
00:47:00,276 --> 00:47:01,902
What are we doing for food?

892
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,696
We'll just have to eat out.

893
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,949
Loose lips sink ships.
And too many drinks will get us talking.

894
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,326
Let's cook our own meals.

895
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,077
We're gonna have to buy groceries.

896
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,875
I can't really cook.

897
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,754
Come on now. How can a grown man
be afraid of a little cooking?

898
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,882
Let's go. You're with me.

899
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:25,843
- Go.
- Shit.

900
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,554
My legs.

901
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,475
All right, let's see.

902
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,353
- How much is this?
- Oh, these are fresh.

903
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,855
These ones here, how much for three?

904
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,233
Those ones?
I'll let them go for 100 each.

905
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,651
So just 300 won.

906
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,987
How about I give you 200?

907
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:46,405
Come on, you're kidding?

908
00:47:46,489 --> 00:47:49,367
I'd rather throw them out
instead of selling them at that price.

909
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,327
Hey, come on now. Barter.

910
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:55,456
<i>Mr. Ha, who was born</i>
<i>in the year, month and hour of the Tiger,</i>

911
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,667
<i>was like a predator out hunting</i>
<i>even when shopping for groceries.</i>

912
00:47:59,168 --> 00:48:02,004
One, two, three. I'll go somewhere else!

913
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,049
<i>He was very meticulous with his work.</i>

914
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,010
<i>He had a specific plan</i>
<i>for what to cook and in what order.</i>

915
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,679
You take the fish heads
and put them on one side.

916
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,393
You gotta quit smoking.
We're cooking here.

917
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:17,937
Ah, man, what the hell?

918
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,563
Red light, green light!

919
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,567
- Hey, slow down.
- Careful.

920
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:25,694
<i>The kids' shoes</i>
<i>are already worn out?</i>

921
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,155
Yeah, they're busted in the front,

922
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,949
<i>so now their toes are sticking out.</i>

923
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,285
It's always something or other.
They should be studying

924
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:34,620
instead of running around.

925
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,956
And here I am busting my ass.

926
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,458
What are you doing? Do you just
let them go out and play all day?

927
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,876
Enough of that.

928
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,254
Our baby girl,
her hospital bill was pretty high.

929
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,339
-<i>What should we do?</i>
-How much?

930
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,925
Five thousand won, including the medicine.

931
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:51,804
What could possibly cost 5,000 won?
You trying to make us broke?

932
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,473
I did it for her. Our daughter's sick.

933
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,767
I need you to figure it out.

934
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,019
Don't make things harder for me
while I'm working.

935
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,146
Bye.

936
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,988
I have another long call.
You wanna go first?

937
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,781
It's all right. Go ahead.

938
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,202
Geez, raising kids is no joke, huh?

939
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,789
Are you married?

940
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,709
I wouldn't really call it that.

941
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,044
Sometimes you're with someone,
sometimes you're not,

942
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:25,963
and that's how the cookie crumbles.

943
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,301
-By the way, where did you say you teach?
-Oh, well…

944
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,095
I only did it for a few years,

945
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:37,141
and to this day, people still call me
the professor, so I just go with it.

946
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,267
So which university?

947
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,060
What's it matter to you?

948
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,521
Would you even know if I told you?

949
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,649
It was just some school.
Why are you prying?

950
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,866
Professor, my ass.

951
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,034
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

952
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,661
Even if we were to use fakes,
they wouldn't last.

953
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,163
<i>We'll need genuine pieces either way.</i>

954
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:02,124
So I need you to find those as soon as
you can, especially decorated ones.

955
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,251
All that aside,
you need to send more money.

956
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,836
This is gonna take more than a few guys.

957
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,713
How much more
are you asking for here?

958
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:10,549
Will you stop being cheap?
Just send me a good amount.

959
00:50:10,633 --> 00:50:12,301
There's a couple of guys
I need to keep quiet.

960
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,179
Listen, I've only got so much cash
I can give you.

961
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,389
Anything more
and I need to get it from Cheon.

962
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,891
And I'll need a good reason to ask.

963
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,519
That's on you to figure out.
'Cause we're outta time here.

964
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,314
Wow, you're asking for money
when you don't even know where it's going?

965
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,358
<i>Who's gonna deal with the consequences?</i>

966
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,817
It's for the excavation.

967
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,362
It's costing a lot more
than everyone thought it would.

968
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,949
I thought you said you would cover it.
The excavation costs were on you.

969
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,825
I'm completely in over my head here, sir,

970
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:39,203
and that's why I'm reaching out
to ask you to help us both.

971
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,831
And in return, I'll put pieces aside that
I think the Assemblyman would like.

972
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:45,167
Well, that was already a given, you know.

973
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,796
You wanna send money
to people you can't keep track of?

974
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,298
- <i>What the hell are you thinking?</i>
- Well, it's just…

975
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,801
The thing is I can't really
explain everything in detail right now…

976
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,221
Forget it. I can't send it
if I don't know where it's going, okay?

977
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:58,514
<i>End of discussion.</i>

978
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:02,893
Then the second request you made
at Seoul Station, I'm sure you remember.

979
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:07,690
Unfortunately, he says
he won't do it unless he's paid first.

980
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,570
Oh, that's, uh…

981
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,824
Uh, let's talk tomorrow.
We'll work it out. Mmm.

982
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,535
What was that?

983
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:22,162
Well, that was Song calling.

984
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:27,459
Apparently, the guys he sent,
they keep pestering him for more money.

985
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,296
I'll go check on them myself.

986
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,340
Why would you go there?

987
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,594
I'll take Kim and Park, I won't go alone.

988
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,888
There's something fishy about it,
so I want to take a look.

989
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:48,022
Wouldn't it be great if I went
to see if they really need the money

990
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,231
and then give it to them?

991
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,775
And like I said, I won't be alone.

992
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:57,906
Then, while you're at it,

993
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:03,662
go check out the lands in Suwon,
Daedeok and Yeongi too if you can.

994
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:05,205
Wait, you're actually letting me go?

995
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,626
Would you mind if I visit the sea?

996
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,337
The new capital's
going to be administrative.

997
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:14,715
So I should take a look
before things get heated.

998
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,844
So you're sending me
to scout the land instead of the pottery?

999
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,972
Forget it if you don't want to.

1000
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,390
Uh…

1001
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:26,894
Of course I do.
I'll go scour the whole entire area.

1002
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,482
Ah, seeing everything,
it'll take a few days.

1003
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,784
Where the hell's Professor Kim?

1004
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,869
Bring him out here this minute
or you're dead.

1005
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,163
Oh, the professor,
that little weasel bastard,

1006
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,665
he just scuttled off into the night?

1007
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,792
If you can't bring him
in front of me right now,

1008
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,543
then at least take back your trash

1009
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,420
and give me back everything
you took from me that day!

1010
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,464
I just sell pottery here, that's all.

1011
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,216
I was just sitting right here.

1012
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,343
It was the professor
who was doing all the talking.

1013
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,428
Geez, do you think
I'm a beggar or something?

1014
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,889
Why would I scam you
in order to make money, huh?

1015
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,392
Wow, lady, I'm surprised you can
keep a straight face

1016
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:09,269
after selling that trash to me.
Give me my stuff right now!

1017
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,481
Listen, junior, you better learn.
When it comes to antiques,

1018
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,150
the best thing you can do
is accept that you're gonna get scammed.

1019
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:18,070
What do you think, you're the only one
who's ever been made a mark?

1020
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,240
Wow, I'm shocked, you idiot.
You think that makes it better, huh?

1021
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:22,449
Who's the real idiot?

1022
00:53:22,533 --> 00:53:25,244
-The con artist or the conned?
-Fine, let's do this then!

1023
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,870
All right, let's do this.

1024
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:29,331
Kim, where is he?

1025
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:32,918
- Oh, no.
- So?

1026
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,378
-You ready to talk?
-What are you doing?

1027
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:38,215
Or should I break another one?
Bring that bastard here now! Shit!

1028
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,717
Please! Just go!

1029
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,385
Just shut it!

1030
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:43,512
You better bring that asshole here
right now!

1031
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,596
DEOKSAN ANTIQUE SHOP

1032
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,567
Hey, Ma.

1033
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,527
You celebrate your birthday
or something, huh?

1034
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,531
Shit, they're all busted. Fucking hell.

1035
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,829
I might be a shitty son, yeah?

1036
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:12,082
Still wish I got an invitation
to this party, you know?

1037
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,292
Listen.

1038
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,795
Go find and bring Professor Kim here.

1039
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:20,215
You do that and I'll talk to your dad
about getting you a boat.

1040
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,551
Hey, Ma, you serious?

1041
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,012
Dang, even the tightwad can change, huh?

1042
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,639
Mokpo's where he's at.
Small fishing village there.

1043
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,768
Bring him back in one piece, you hear me?

1044
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,394
Got it.

1045
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,646
Hey, tightwad.

1046
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,731
Tightwad!

1047
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,733
You gotta keep your word, all right?

1048
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,568
Okay?

1049
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,738
Tightwad.

1050
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,287
Where did you get
this trash? Damn, man.

1051
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,789
Take a look at the edges.
Make sure they aren't ripped.

1052
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:55,459
This thing's old as hell.
It's been through it.

1053
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,627
It's nothing but rips.

1054
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,670
Here.
I think this will do, right?

1055
00:54:58,754 --> 00:54:59,755
Let me see.

1056
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:04,301
Yeah, looks good. So how many dives
can you do in one day?

1057
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:06,261
Ah, with that nasty current,

1058
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,514
think I could do a couple,
then I'll be burnt out.

1059
00:55:08,597 --> 00:55:12,601
A couple?
Guess we gotta get it right, every dive.

1060
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,478
The helmet divers can
load up these here nets,

1061
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,563
and we'll pull 'em out, all nice and easy.

1062
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:20,025
They already did another excavation,
and I bet they pulled out a ton.

1063
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,694
-And there were looters too.
-Is there anything there then?

1064
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,489
Everything the navy salvaged,
all of it was junk.

1065
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,533
The real ones are still there,
buried at the bottom.

1066
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:32,204
That area was flat, whole thing
was all solid mud stretching a kilometer.

1067
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,790
-So how do you get it out of the mud?
-Use your hands.

1068
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,292
You gotta do it slowly and it'll come out.

1069
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,504
Well, we gotta wrap this up
before they start excavating again.

1070
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,464
Should I talk to Honggi?

1071
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:45,008
And ask when they're coming back?
What do you reckon?

1072
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,760
I bet he won't tell us.

1073
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,221
Well, at least he still
listens to you, doesn't he?

1074
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,641
And to think that asshole
used to be my lackey

1075
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,309
back when we were all in school together.

1076
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:57,145
But ever since he became a fucking cop,
he acts like we're idiots.

1077
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,689
If I ask him a favor,

1078
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,232
I gotta sit through a two-hour lecture.

1079
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,442
-You should still ask.
-Hi, this is the Peace Inn.

1080
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,194
If the dates overlap, we're fucked.

1081
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:07,531
Mr. Oh Gwanseok?
You've got a call.

1082
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,740
- Yeah.
- Here.

1083
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,160
Thank you.

1084
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,496
Hello? This is Oh Gwanseok.

1085
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,123
Mr. Song.

1086
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,042
Huh?

1087
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,377
His wife's coming?

1088
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,087
Yeah, all right.

1089
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,006
I'll get her myself then.

1090
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,090
Sounds good.

1091
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:27,384
Who was it?

1092
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,885
Song called.

1093
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,138
Cheon's wife, she's coming here.

1094
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,807
-You serious?
-She'll be here tomorrow afternoon.

1095
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,184
We have to
push the schedule back a little.

1096
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,314
Look here. Who's so important
that you're pushing the schedule?

1097
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,442
You don't need to know. Back to work.

1098
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,860
Hey, care to repeat that?

1099
00:56:48,864 --> 00:56:53,744
THE NEXT DAY

1100
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,704
It just had to rain while I'm here.

1101
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,925
Oh, damn. Well, that blows.

1102
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:15,932
Damn it. Oh, what the hell?
Son of a bitch.

1103
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,604
Ma'am, he's here.

1104
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,067
Hi there.

1105
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,030
Welcome, ma'am.

1106
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:32,366
Oh, you came to pick me up?

1107
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,494
It just seemed like
the proper thing to do.

1108
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,621
- Lead the way.
- Yes, let's go.

1109
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,333
Hey, man. Can I borrow a match?

1110
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,793
Sorry, I don't smoke.

1111
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,127
Uh, have you got a light?

1112
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,299
Are you from Busan?

1113
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:53,095
Why? Why are you asking?

1114
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,013
I just noticed your accent, that's all.

1115
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,524
Just go ahead and keep on walking
like you were gonna, little guy.

1116
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,609
Son of a bitch, better watch yourself.

1117
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,611
What'd you say?

1118
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,116
I said, watch yourself, fat ass.

1119
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,578
Go ahead and let me know
when you're done talking

1120
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,205
and I'll drop your ass in one hit.
