EPISODE 10, A HELL OF A MESS

4
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,828
121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126,

5
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,998
127, 128, 129, 130…

6
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,674
Where did all the other pieces go?
Someone explain it to me.

7
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,635
There's supposed to be at least 500!

8
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,721
Where did you stash them?

9
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,266
-Hey, Tiger.
-Yes, sir?

10
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,018
Oh, uh…

11
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,603
-What?
-Where are the rest?

12
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,480
Gwanseok knows. You should ask him.

13
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,942
He moved them all by himself with a truck.

14
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,321
Come on, you think you can
get me to buy that awful lie?

15
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:55,532
-I can see right through you.
-We wouldn't lie to you. You know that.

16
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,785
Damn straight.
We don't need to know all of that.

17
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,705
We know what was in the haul and,
in the end, that's all that matters to us.

18
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,957
That's the biggest load of shit
I've ever heard.

19
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:06,084
Damn it.

20
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,171
I really didn't want to do this,
but I guess I don't have a choice.

21
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,673
What's with this kid?

22
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,718
Daesik, hey, what are you doing?

23
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,220
It's okay. I got this. Let me handle it.

24
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,348
Wait. No, Daesik.

25
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,184
All right, no cheap shots.

26
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,187
Well, let's go then, one on one.

27
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,396
Oh, shit.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,523
Hey, I didn't know this kid was so funny.

29
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:29,816
So what do you want to do?

30
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,819
It's fine. Let him do whatever he wants.

31
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,113
Hey, Skull.

32
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,198
Yeah.

33
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:40,327
- Okay.
- Hey, Skull?

34
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,870
Then let's see what you've got.

35
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,246
This oughtta be quick.

36
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,666
Oh, look at that!

37
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:46,833
What the hell is this?

38
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,127
-You got some fancy footwork?
-All right.

39
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,880
Get in there already.

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,426
- Whoa, hey, whoa. Hey!
- Come on.

41
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,844
What are you, a damn grasshopper?

42
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,596
-Let's do this.
-Pick yourself up.

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,683
Is this some kind of joke?
He told me he was a boxer.

44
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:05,686
Well, it's been a while since I had
to bust out these moves, you know?

45
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,978
Little rusty.

46
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,564
- Let's go again. Let's go.
- You're like a baby.

47
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,819
-Come on, fight.
-Just finish it already.

48
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,031
Get in there.

49
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,493
Hell yeah!

50
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,954
-Whoo!
-He's pretty good.

51
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,498
These hands too fast for you?
You can't hit what you can't see.

52
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,543
Skull, you gonna let
this punk kick your ass?

53
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,047
That's what I'm talking about!

54
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,340
-All right!
-Finish him off!

55
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,676
-The hell?
-Get your shit together!

56
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,262
Hey, over here.

57
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:47,769
Oh, man.

58
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:49,187
-What are you doing down there?
-This fucking guy…

59
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,647
Taking a little nap, huh?

60
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,274
Shit.

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,485
I got this. I got this. Shit.

62
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,786
Wow!

63
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,707
Good work, Daesik. Go get him again.

64
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,863
-Taste good?
-Yeah, it's the best. Thanks, Dad.

65
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,657
-This is great.
-This bulgogi is delicious, Dad.

66
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,576
- You took your meds?
- Yeah.

67
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,911
Cough's gone.

68
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,580
- Here, eat up. There's plenty more.
- Thanks, Dad.

69
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,916
- Hey, chew your food. Here.
- Okay.

70
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,880
Look at you.
You can't pass a test to save your life.

71
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,715
But, boy, you really can stuff your face.

72
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,802
Chew your food.

73
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,305
-You gonna eat?
-I still need to finish.

74
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,389
Go ahead and eat.

75
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,769
Did you pack enough clothes?
Make sure I have shorts.

76
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,271
-And plenty of underwear too.
-So, hey.

77
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,149
When is this project going to end?

78
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,279
It's hard. Raising the kids all by myself.

79
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,456
Here.

80
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,626
Just take it.

81
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,628
Oh, wow.

82
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,296
What? Where…

83
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,715
-Where did you get this?
-Settle down.

84
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,134
- Oh, honey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

85
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,344
Hey!

86
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,054
What are you doing?
Not in front of the kids!

87
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,265
Come on now. Who really cares?

88
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,517
-Baby, money!
-Hey, don't!

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,935
Your father's bringing home the big bucks!

90
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,895
-Wow! We're rich! We're rich!
-We're rich! We're rich!

91
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,438
Quiet!

92
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,606
Not while we're eating.

93
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,025
What do you kids even
know about money?

94
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:02,571
Honey, it looks like you made
a ton of money there.

95
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,448
I'm not done yet.
But I'm getting pretty close.

96
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,534
Just a bit more.

97
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,703
Then we can hold our heads high.

98
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,164
You know? We'll buy a house,
send the kids to college.

99
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,666
Open a store.

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,418
Gonna make it all worth it.

101
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,464
-Honey.
-Huh? Wait, what?

102
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,633
Oh, I'm sorry.

103
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,720
I didn't realize how hard
you were working,

104
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,555
and I complained so much.

105
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,473
Quit it. Just eat. Hurry and eat.

106
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,477
-I gotta make a call, so keep it down.
-Okay.

107
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,812
-Good grief.
-Okay.

108
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,731
All right, kids.

109
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,941
Let's be quiet so that your dad
can make his call.

110
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,109
Okay.

111
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,654
Oh, don't scarf it down.

112
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,006
Get up.

113
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,010
What, you gonna tap in?

114
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,803
Yeah, good.

115
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,516
There a bug in here?

116
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,268
Thought I heard something.

117
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,823
- Whoa, hey, hey.
- There it is.

118
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,285
- Get up now. Hey, don't--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

119
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,787
You're going to kill him!

120
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,246
Hey, hey, hey!

121
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:38,750
All right. That's it!

122
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,297
Oh!

123
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,884
Hey,
he's not dead, is he?

124
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,595
- Hey, wake up… Come on, breathe.
- Should we help him?

125
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,763
- Get up!
- Wake up.

126
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,682
-Lift him.
-Yeah, get him up.

127
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,183
-All right.
-Careful.

128
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,351
-Easy!
-Careful.

129
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,977
What do we do?

130
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,146
- Hey, wake up, son.
- Yeah, get him up.

131
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,650
- That's what I'm talking about, ah!
- What do we do?

132
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,443
You motherfuckers!

133
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,320
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bokgeun.
-Whoa, whoa!

134
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,073
- What the fuck?
- You sons of bitches.

135
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,784
You want me to blast you? Huh?

136
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,244
Five million won!

137
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,038
Hey, we were looking for that.
Talk about luck.

138
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,123
Give it here.

139
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,791
You wanna try and test your luck?

140
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,710
Get the hell out.

141
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,920
I loaded only five rounds in that gun,

142
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,382
and I already fired four. One more bullet.

143
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,720
Okay? You're gonna get one shot off
and then get torn apart.

144
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,513
- Well, that one shot is you then.
- Whoa!

145
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,098
- Easy.
- You shit stain.

146
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,060
Whoa! Hey, settle down.
Let's not be rash, yeah?

147
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,814
Bokgeun, let's not do this, all right?
Just hand it over--

148
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,486
Were you gonna shoot?
You crazy son of a bitch!

149
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,034
Hey. I already told you.

150
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,871
That if you do something I don't like,
then I'd smash your damn brains in.

151
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,041
So I'll ask this question only once.

152
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,792
Where are they?

153
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,839
They're hidden in a shed.

154
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,674
Where's the shed?

155
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,470
Mu…

156
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,930
Mua…

157
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,557
They're in Mokpo, okay?

158
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,518
It's all there at the port.

159
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,485
-Geez!
-Watch his arm.

160
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,903
-Damn it.
-Stay down.

161
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:34,741
It's there. We loaded it all
in a truck to move it.

162
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,743
I don't know.

163
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,496
I got a feeling you're trying
to trick us here.

164
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,498
Hey, Tiger.

165
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,751
What? It's the truth.

166
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,920
Why spill the beans?

167
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,963
Where's the truck then?

168
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,048
Well,

169
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,883
in a corner of the dock.

170
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,469
It's somewhere out of sight.

171
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,347
-It's on the truck over there.
-Hey, Tiger.

172
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,476
Come on. Why do you keep asking me?

173
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,066
All right.

174
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,362
Get to work. Load up everything
that's still here, then we'll head out.

175
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,322
-You guys are tagging along.
-Us too?

176
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,908
That's right.
What happens if this is a big lie?

177
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,371
What are you waiting for?
Get a move on. Load that shit!

178
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,664
- Come on.
- Hurry up!

179
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,748
All right. I heard you.

180
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,083
- Move your asses!
- Come on!

181
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,544
-Hurry up.
-Okay, we'll go. We'll go load it up.

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,173
Honey, honey.

183
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,598
Not waking up now, is he?

184
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,977
It's a busy day though.

185
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:50,650
The chairman's doing well now.

186
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,070
He came into the office yesterday,
scarfed down a bowl of cold noodles.

187
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,155
He even read the news.

188
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,656
Oh, really?

189
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm glad to hear that.
I'll stop by to see him later then.

190
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:03,454
Ah, he's not in today though.
I'll let you know when he comes in again.

191
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,623
I can give him a call if he's at home.

192
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,544
Actually, um,
he's a bit tired still.

193
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,964
Mrs. Yang,

194
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,632
people are paying a lot of attention.

195
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,261
I'm sure. It's the chairman
who makes all the decisions,

196
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,637
and we walk him through it all.

197
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,016
But of course he signs off on everything.

198
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,601
And also, Mr. Kang?

199
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,685
Right.

200
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,861
I heard you like mountains.
Correct me if I'm wrong.

201
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,988
This is a gold recreation of Mount Inwang.

202
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,785
Are you serious, ma'am?
I can't accept this right now.

203
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,007
- That's it. Yeah. A little more.
- Shit.

204
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,967
- I think I almost got it.
- What?

205
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,219
Yeah!

206
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,471
-Wait, I got it. Are you out?
-Yeah, that's it. That's it.

207
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,889
- Are you out?
- Did you do it?

208
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,766
There! I'm free.

209
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,142
-Oh, shit. Hey!
-Get us out now.

210
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,269
Daesik! Come here
and untie this. Get us out too.

211
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:10,021
Just hang on a second.
I gotta make a call.

212
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,689
Fuck that! Get your ass back here
and cut the ropes.

213
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,857
Fucking damn it!

214
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,361
I'm not gonna let those fuckers
take everything we killed ourselves over!

215
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,780
So shut your damn mouths for a second,
you little sons of bitches!

216
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,365
- Hey!
- Hey, what about us?

217
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,741
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey!

218
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,412
Ugh, those fucking selfish little idiots!

219
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,998
Fuck! What the hell is going on here?

220
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,337
Oh, shit.

221
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,178
Hey, Honggi.

222
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,972
You're pretty early today.

223
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,307
Hey,

224
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,394
I was gone for a couple of days.
You weren't even worried?

225
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,980
Actually, I was out too.
Went home for a funeral.

226
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,315
Asshole.

227
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,321
Shit.

228
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,617
Hey, where the hell were you?
You were AWOL.

229
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:10,123
Yeah, I was.
And it didn't even concern you?

230
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,875
Yeah, well, you didn't leave
a suicide note or anything.

231
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,212
Anyway, what's the matter with your neck?

232
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,048
Did you fall down while drunk?

233
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,301
I guess I'll just go
and kill myself for real.

234
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,469
Did something happen?

235
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,222
Just forget it.

236
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,517
It's my fault for expecting anything
in a dump like this.

237
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,935
Ow, ow, ow, shit.

238
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,228
Should I rub your shoulders?

239
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,813
Shut the hell-- Oh!

240
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,525
Oh, shit. Damn.

241
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,281
Hi, Sanjeong-dong Precinct.

242
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,576
Honggi, here.

243
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,540
This is Sim Honggi.

244
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,333
I'm calling from Jeungdo.

245
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,253
Professor Kim rolled in here from Busan
with four goons and they cleaned us out.

246
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,380
Hold on. Who is this? What are you saying?

247
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,840
<i>Ah, Jeungdo, man!</i>

248
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,760
Remember when you needed to piss and
I told you I would hold your dick for you?

249
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,344
Fucking son of a--

250
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,306
Okay, so what?
What's going on?

251
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,141
All of it is gone!

252
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,227
They took it! They took everything we got!

253
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:17,315
<i>I'm telling you, Professor Kim showed up</i>
<i>with some thugs and stole all the pottery!</i>

254
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,399
When?

255
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,860
<i>They left this morning, so they</i>
<i>should be at the Mokpo port by now.</i>

256
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,529
You gotta hurry over there before
we lose everything we've worked for!

257
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:27,283
- I hear ya. Damn it!
- What the hell?

258
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,036
- There was a robbery.
- Huh, what?

259
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,788
-Where? Where did… What?
-I can explain it all later.

260
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,331
Hey, come on.

261
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,457
Move your ass!

262
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,376
Wait, you asshole!
Where did it happen? Hey!

263
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,009
You hauled a lot of shit out here.

264
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,094
Pop it open.

265
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,563
Wow.

266
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,399
-Yeah, it's all pottery.
-How about that?

267
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,693
Why don't we just take the truck then?
Let's go.

268
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,529
You're trying to jack
the whole damn thing?

269
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,030
- Huh?
- I won't let ya.

270
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,907
-There's some lines you just don't cross!
-Whoa, hey.

271
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,120
You can always go fish up a few more.

272
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,580
So what's with all the whining
I'm hearing?

273
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,832
Hey, old man.

274
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,626
The keys. Hand them over.

275
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,299
Just take half, man, please!

276
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,386
Shut the hell up. Let's go.
You guys ride in the back.

277
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,014
Are you okay?

278
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,728
There's a boat too.
That's where the rest of it is.

279
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,480
What the hell? The engine won't start.

280
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,941
Well, can you fix it?

281
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,609
How the hell should I know?

282
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,070
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck me.

283
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,866
Hey, what the hell is this?

284
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,287
It was barely holding itself together
when I drove here so maybe it gave out.

285
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,247
Damn it.

286
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,331
Hey, Tiger.

287
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,250
Something funny here, you piece of shit?

288
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,335
It serves you right.

289
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,254
I couldn't have planned it better myself.

290
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,630
Is that right?

291
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,135
-How about you get behind it and push?
-What do you mean?

292
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,596
The truck's not running,
so you're gonna push it yourself.

293
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,097
Get your ass over there!

294
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,765
Ugh, fucking hell, man.

295
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,144
What did you learn about the loan shark?

296
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,271
Granny Park,
a North Korean woman in Myeong-dong.

297
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,982
She grew her business
skimming from the Americans.

298
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,610
Even the heaviest hitters
have to get on their knees and beg

299
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,528
if they're looking for a loan.

300
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,946
- Seriously?
- Yes.

301
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,533
They say she can whip up billions
if she taps into her network of money.

302
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,453
Outdoing the Bank of Korea.

303
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,205
That's right.

304
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,250
Granny Park. What does she like?

305
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,337
HANYANG PAWNSHOP

306
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,635
- Are you sure it's here?
- Yeah, second floor.

307
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,053
Oh, careful right there.

308
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,474
Uh, I think it's around here.

309
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,936
She's in this dump,
but rolling in billions?

310
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,104
-Are you sure she's going to like that?
-That's what I heard.

311
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,522
I asked around to make sure.

312
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:04,774
Okay.

313
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,150
Oh, here we are.

314
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,195
EVERYONE WELCOME
HAEWOL FIRM

315
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,661
Excuse us, hello there.

316
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,204
Oh, who are you?

317
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,333
Ah, right. This is the wife
of Heungbaek Corporation's chairman.

318
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,253
And, well, we're hoping to meet owner, uh…

319
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,380
Oh, this way, if you would.

320
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,464
Thanks.

321
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,887
- There's a guest. Someone from Heungbaek.
- Huh?

322
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,223
Are you serious?

323
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:47,316
- Told you to be on time, didn't I?
- Good afternoon.

324
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,027
- I got here early.
- On time means on time.

325
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,862
That doesn't mean early.

326
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,907
You should always arrive
exactly on the dot.

327
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,034
Right.

328
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,623
Here, I brought
some sweets I heard you like.

329
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,750
Here you are.

330
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,085
Some Japanese hard candy.

331
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,215
-Oh.
-Oh, and also, we have these too.

332
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,760
And there's a whole bunch more in the bag.

333
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,264
So,

334
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,726
it seems my husband
has borrowed a lot from you.

335
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,396
He's getting back on his feet now.
So please give us a little longer.

336
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,483
Your husband… I heard that he was dead.

337
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,445
Who would say that?

338
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,281
The chairman's doing
quite well these days.

339
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,326
He's healthy as ever.

340
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:42,163
What, you're worried if he dies,
I'm gonna come and collect, is that it?

341
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,458
We're fine as long as
you pay the interest on time.

342
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,919
And I've got collateral.
So what's the worry?

343
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,674
I called you 'cause I heard
the bank's pulling out what they invested.

344
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,220
Now why would they ever do that?
That's not true.

345
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,848
Who would tell you
such a crazy rumor, I wonder?

346
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,397
Banks need loans just like everyone else.

347
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,566
You aren't fooling anyone.

348
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,236
When your husband's back at work,
you can visit again.

349
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,834
Here.

350
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,671
- We almost done?
- Yeah.

351
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,758
All right.
Load it in, nice and neat.

352
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,636
Whoo-whee! Look at that,
this big-ass boat's filled up now.

353
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,513
Listen here, you jackass.

354
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,390
That's my father's boat, got it?

355
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,266
Hey now, Uncle.

356
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,395
We're family.
You really think I won't bring it back?

357
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,939
-Not very nice of you.
-You little rat bastard.

358
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,401
I know I remember you tellin' me
that wives and boats are off the table.

359
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:57,321
Can't you tell I feel
bad enough as it is? Just cut it out.

360
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,199
If you guys are all done, let's get going.

361
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,201
Yeah, let's go.

362
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,869
Busan's a straight shot outta here.

363
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,456
Come on. Hey, give me a hand here.

364
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,916
You serious?

365
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,711
I said help me out! Hurry up!

366
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,090
Hot diggity, listen to her purr!

367
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,176
All right. Let's get it moving, man.

368
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:26,726
Oh, hey, you thievin' bastards!
Man, I hope that damn boat sinks.

369
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,228
See ya!

370
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,355
YONGJIN

371
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,275
Wanna slap that smile
right off Kim's face. Fuck you!

372
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,403
Home stretch, boys!

373
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,659
Why did you cook up those fakes?

374
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,953
In case this whole thing was a bust.

375
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,667
That assmonkey better bring it
back without a scratch on it.

376
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:55,129
Oh, I forgot.
I shouldn't be hoping it sinks.

377
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,213
Yeah, no shit.

378
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,473
Where the hell is he?

379
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:11,520
Oh, Mrs. Yang, over here. Yeah. Hi.

380
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,190
I'm sorry for being so late.

381
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,442
Don't worry about it.
Please have a seat.

382
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,444
You came here alone?

383
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,906
Uh, I'm sorry.
Heedong must be running a bit late.

384
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:23,657
Coffee, please.

385
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,163
I wanted to ask you, how's the chairman?

386
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,875
He was walking around until last night,
now he's back in bed again.

387
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,959
Oh, dear.

388
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,711
Things keep getting harder at his age.

389
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,005
Terrible, really.
I hope he gets better quick.

390
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,592
The pottery, how many pieces do you have?

391
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,012
Four hundred pieces just about.

392
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,015
Why don't we move them to Seoul?
I'll find storage for them.

393
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,517
Well, there's a problem.

394
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,813
Next week, the government's starting
their third salvage operation there.

395
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:56,357
We're running out of time
and the workers are angry.

396
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,485
They're not willing to get on the barge.
Not until they see their money.

397
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,365
How long do you think
until they're there?

398
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:08,160
They're starting next week,
so I'd say five or six days.

399
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,328
Around that.

400
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,790
We're hauling up
almost 100 pieces a day now,

401
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,709
so we can still pull up around 500 pieces.

402
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,170
How much money do you need?

403
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,214
Five million.

404
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,050
As soon as possible.
That should be enough.

405
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,387
All right, I'll make sure you get it.

406
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:28,889
By the way,

407
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,851
you and Jeonchul,
you had some issues out there.

408
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,146
Me and Jeonchul?
I don't know what you mean.

409
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,898
That's what he said when we talked.

410
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,109
He insisted that he was being targeted
by you for some reason.

411
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,944
- Huh?
- Said if someone tried to claim his death

412
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,029
was an accident, that it wasn't the truth.

413
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,364
Wait. What?

414
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,325
Why would he say
something like that to you?

415
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,202
I thought we were getting along great.

416
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,414
My husband has always been jealous.

417
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,749
He'd go wild when I spent time
with younger men.

418
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,251
He would fly off the handle.

419
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,378
Jeonchul was a target of this.

420
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,590
-I'm not sure.
-You're quick-witted,

421
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,174
so you understand, don't you?

422
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:06,844
Jeonchul's death is suspicious.
I'm sure you're aware.

423
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,307
And the company is about to go under.

424
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,226
If the lenders take back the money,

425
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,978
I don't see how we can afford anything.

426
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,691
I'm really in need of your help, Mr. Oh.

427
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,569
What the fuck…

428
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,696
The chairman took out a huge loan.

429
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,032
You should try and get a meeting
with the loan shark.

430
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,992
See if you can wipe out our records.

431
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,791
And if I wipe it, then what? Huh?

432
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,837
Well, then you and I
can split the profits.

433
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,883
Because the other moochers
don't matter. Hmm?

434
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,775
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

435
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,449
Oh, yeah.

436
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,702
-Were those all the fakes you got?
-Why?

437
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,954
Why do you think?

438
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,039
We've got to cover what we lost here.

439
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,626
If you've got any extras,
we should pad out what we're selling.

440
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,211
Why the hell is my stuff gotta cover that?

441
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,672
Who gives a shit whose it is?
It's not like it's real!

442
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,382
You're being ridiculous, Tiger.

443
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,550
Well, it's not. Tell me I'm wrong.

444
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,760
Are you serious?

445
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,136
What are you all doing here?

446
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,263
The station was wide open. Where were you?

447
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:35,099
I was checking the port, all right?

448
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,934
I heard Professor Kim was there.
Tell me what happened.

449
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,687
The Professor came around
and cleaned us the hell out.

450
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,397
He had these thugs from Busan.

451
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,816
And listen to this.

452
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,736
Sangbok, that little fucker had
the damn nerve to take my damn boat.

453
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,154
Sangbok's with those guys too?

454
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,407
You get your fuckin' hands
on that asshole and I'm gonna…

455
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,908
I'm chopping him up like a pomfret.

456
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,076
Where and when was this?

457
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,329
Well, this was…
What's it been, about 30 minutes?

458
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,999
- Uh-uh-uh.
- Yeah, they're headed for Busan,

459
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,834
You gotta catch 'em. Haul your ass!

460
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,836
These stupid motherfuckers, they're dead.

461
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,757
Honggi, wait.

462
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,260
-Stupid…
-Hang on, what are you doing?

463
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,970
-What the shit?
-Hey, you're coming with me.

464
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,388
- Ah, seriously?
- What?

465
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,681
Hey!

466
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,474
Don't let them get away!

467
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,559
What the hell?

468
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,853
Where's he going with that rifle
all of a sudden?

469
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,314
Are you eating my food?

470
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,276
Wait, who are you?

471
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,664
Hello?

472
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,876
Is anyone here? Oh.

473
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,094
Didn't expect you to be alone.

474
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,472
I heard someone from Heungbaek
was on the way,

475
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,141
so I sent the boys to go eat some lunch.

476
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,852
Oh, yeah?
You didn't have to do all that.

477
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,897
What's this about then?

478
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,234
You know,
earlier, the chairman's wife was here.

479
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,319
Listen.

480
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,905
Tell me.

481
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,033
How much has Heungbaek taken out
in loans from you so far?

482
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,035
Why would you want to know that?

483
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,330
Mrs. Yang is running the company now
and wants me to ask.

484
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,999
What about the chairman? What's he doing?

485
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:28,212
Well, the chairman, given his age,
she figured he could use a little help.

486
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,881
If you don't mind,
I wanna take a look at the records.

487
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,134
It's not chump change, you know?

488
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,886
You don't get what you're asking to see.

489
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,430
Hey, hand them over.

490
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,974
I won't be able to do that, I'm afraid.

491
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,937
Get the chairman's authorization.

492
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:48,524
Look, he sent me here.
So he already knows. I talked to him.

493
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,903
My, thought he was bedridden and sick.

494
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,281
I mean he's doing well enough to
send me here. We went over everything.

495
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:01,662
You're saying the chairman sent you
to check the records?

496
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,996
Yeah.

497
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,082
See, that doesn't make any sense.

498
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:12,005
I wonder, why would he do that?

499
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:15,175
I told you he sent me here,
damn it.

500
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:19,012
You wanna hear the same thing twice?

501
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,641
Want to know why
it makes no lick of sense to me?

502
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,770
'Cause he's the one…

503
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,149
who has all the money.

504
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:36,697
What you're requesting of me
doesn't sound like him at all.

505
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,494
Who really sent you here?

506
00:27:45,831 --> 00:27:47,749
The chairman's wife, wasn't it?

507
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,224
Sorry, sir.
Are you all right?

508
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:10,606
This drug. Dr. Kim prescribed me this?

509
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,317
I'm not really sure.

510
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,240
What I'm thinking is

511
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,370
his wife is trying to pull one over
on him, which will get her killed.

512
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,956
She's playing a dangerous game.

513
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,669
You have no idea
how meticulous that man is.

514
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,133
Look at me.

515
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,472
You don't wanna fuck with me. Huh?

516
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:49,311
I'm gonna burn this place down

517
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,731
if you don't gimme the records right now!

518
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,691
He got out of bed on his own?

519
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,862
Yes,
he's about to head out to the office.

520
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,536
All right, thanks.

521
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,043
Are you kidding right now?

522
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,006
At the company,
a bookkeeper girl worked there.

523
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,635
She was a smart little thing.

524
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,472
Always giving the chairman the eye,

525
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,808
laying the charm on as thick as she could.

526
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,395
When he got really sick,
she came over to visit.

527
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,314
Took on bedpan duties.

528
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:37,651
He was grateful,
but scared of her at the same time.

529
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,361
What the fuck are you talking ab…

530
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,781
Just gimme what I asked for. The records!

531
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,783
Then my sister died.

532
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,372
And, suddenly, that bookkeeper girl
took her place as his wife.

533
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,290
You stupid piece of shit!

534
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:54,501
-Tell me what was in that medicine.
-What?

535
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,295
He took your meds and left the house!
He's well enough to head into the office.

536
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,798
I don't understand how he could do that.

537
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,882
Care to explain it to me?

538
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:03,635
I mentioned at the start that
the pills wouldn't kill him right away.

539
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,388
<i>Medically safe is slower.</i>

540
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,723
<i>We're not poisoning him.</i>

541
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,061
Unbelievable.

542
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,195
Fuck this shit!

543
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:27,451
They're all idiots.
All of them are useless fucking idiots.

544
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,079
She was
the new lady of the house,

545
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,791
so I quickly packed up
and moved outta there.

546
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,797
-What'd you think?
-It was pretty good.

547
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,466
-It was all right.
-It was good!

548
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,343
But the thing about us Northerners,

549
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,096
we've got big hearts.

550
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,015
He didn't just toss me aside.

551
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,810
The government was cracking down
on private loans.

552
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,605
And the banks, well,
he couldn't trust them at all.

553
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,399
He said only family had his trust.

554
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:05,072
I've been handling his finances,
ever since that day. Understand?

555
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,242
That means that…

556
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,704
What the…

557
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,707
-Who the hell are you, huh? Stay back.
-Whoa! What the fuck?

558
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,084
- Don't come any closer.
- What?

559
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,502
- You're fucking crazy.
- That's right.

560
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,629
I am fucking crazy, you assholes.

561
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,214
Come on. I fucking dare you.

562
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,174
- You think I won't do it?
- Damn, okay.

563
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,218
Yeah, I'm fucking crazy. Try me.

564
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,886
Try me you, fucking assholes!

565
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,973
What?

566
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,267
<i>It's me, Granny Park.</i>

567
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:37,646
Yell at me like that again
and I'll hang up the phone.

568
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,274
Oh, hi.

569
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,985
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.

570
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,070
What's going on?

571
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,531
"What's going on?"

572
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,907
Oh, right.

573
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:51,159
I sent someone there earlier.

574
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,870
He's gonna burn the building down.

575
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,832
I think you should come and get him.

576
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,625
Come on!

577
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,418
Come on, motherfuckers!

578
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,504
NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS

579
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,504
NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS

580
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,589
MAY, COUNTERESPIONAGE
AND ANTI-COMMUNISM MONTH

581
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:07,134
ANTI-COMMUNISM, ANTI-SPY

582
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,188
Oh, sir, there you are.

583
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,232
- Good to see you.
- Hi. Are you on your way out?

584
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,401
Actually, I came out to meet you.
I heard you were here.

585
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,570
You didn't have to.
Why don't we talk inside then?

586
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,239
Right, sounds good. So, what's going on?

587
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,324
Man, it's a long story.

588
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,466
You're here.

589
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,927
You can take a seat.

590
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,409
She's just arrived, Chairman Cheon.

591
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,287
She's sitting right in front of me.

592
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,165
Would you please tell her what I told you?

593
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,000
<i>Very well.</i>

594
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,504
CHAIRMAN CHEON HWANGSIK

595
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,886
Find out
what kind of drug it is.

596
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,848
Sir.

597
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,895
Was that him?

598
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,272
So…

599
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,359
You don't know who I am, do you?

600
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,528
Who are you?

601
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,407
I'm the younger sister…

602
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,952
of the chairman's late wife.

603
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:03,333
You may have married the chairman,
but it wasn't official.

604
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:07,087
Papers were never filed.
There's no proof, legally.

605
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:12,759
I understand. It probably
slipped your mind after a few years.

606
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,974
After all your efforts,
when he dies, you get nothing.

607
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,898
You should be sweet,

608
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,276
while he still thinks you're sweet.

609
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:35,907
You realize the chairman
can throw you out anytime he wants, right?

610
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,870
So, you might as well
keep on taking good care of him.

611
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:42,539
Who knows?

612
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:48,169
Once the chairman's dead, he might just
leave you with a tiny room to stay in.

613
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,380
Let them leave.

614
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,142
Come on. Get up.

615
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:10,859
Let's go.

616
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,872
Whoa!

617
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:26,750
Are you all right?

618
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,043
Let's talk about this tomorrow.

619
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,378
You go ahead.

620
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,798
Uh, so, ma'am, when can you…

621
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:36,426
I'll get it to you.

622
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:38,970
I'm sorry, but it's urgent.

623
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,514
I'll give it to you! I'll give it to you!

624
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,020
Mrs. Yang.

625
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,438
What?

626
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,606
What now?

627
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,361
Are you all right?

628
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,050
YONGJIN

629
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,245
Well, son of a bitch.

630
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,331
What? Is there an issue here?

631
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,833
No, there isn't.

632
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,835
How much is that worth?

633
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:55,130
Well, let's see.

634
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,508
Good shape overall. Well preserved.

635
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,343
I'd say a million or so.

636
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,928
-A million won?
-Yeah.

637
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,388
-You serious?
-Yeah.

638
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,432
What about all of these together,
how much is that?

639
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,059
Well…

640
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,353
There's 500 here,

641
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:13,523
Let's say some aren't worth that much,
so factoring all of that,

642
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,191
that what would that be…

643
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:16,317
Two hundred, I'd say.

644
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,402
-Really?
-Yeah.

645
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,320
200 million? We hit the jackpot!

646
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:20,822
We can get a new gym at this rate.

647
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,490
-Can't we, coach?
-That's right.

648
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,784
Now we won't have
to go collecting anymore!

649
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,620
-We can just focus on our training!
-That's right, kid.

650
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:29,706
Hey.

651
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:33,168
Would it be worth the same
to someone like my Ma, you think?

652
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,586
Why wouldn't it?

653
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,629
I don't know.

654
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,007
Seems too clean, doesn't it?

655
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,594
-I mean, it's kinda weird.
-Hey, hey, hey. Be careful with that, huh?

656
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,306
It can break real easy because
it was underwater forever, so be careful.

657
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,183
-Really?
-Yeah!

658
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:00,278
-It didn't.
-Oh, well…

659
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,821
Guess some of these are pretty sturdy.

660
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,657
Look, man. Even I can tell
this is some fake shit.

661
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,742
Hey.

662
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:10,246
Anyone who looks at it could tell
that it's the real deal! Come on.

663
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:15,210
With this stuff, how much you price it at,
that's the real skill, you know?

664
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,378
I'm gonna bring in some Japanese buyers.

665
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:21,090
Talk up the price with 'em nice and high,
push 'em to close.

666
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,967
And that's it! Yeah?

667
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,094
All right?

668
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:27,514
Huh?

669
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:32,936
Anyway, I wanted to ask,
you guys are wrestlers, right?

670
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,314
I heard that
everything in wrestling was staged.

671
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,776
And that even if you get caught
in a chokehold, it doesn't hurt at all.

672
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,446
How about a personal demonstration?

673
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,448
Uh, that's okay. I didn't say--

674
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,075
- Hey, stop it!
- So tell me,

675
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,035
-does it hurt?
-Stop it! Stop it!

676
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,288
Asshole.

677
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,665
You think only you know pottery?

678
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,460
Look at this shit. It's all fucking fake.

679
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:58,711
Are you sure?

680
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:03,675
<i>Drop anchor. Drop anchor!</i>

681
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,885
-Huh? Wha…
-What?

682
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,345
What the hell?

683
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:08,429
What the hell is that?

684
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,765
Is that the Coast Guard?

685
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,772
<i>Vessel Yongjin, stop immediately.</i>

686
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,817
Cut your engine. Cut your engine now!

687
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,610
Damn it, go faster!

688
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:24,779
If you want faster, get out and push.

689
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,951
What the hell, is that the police?
Did they report us?

690
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,203
Hurry! We need to get rid of the pottery.

691
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,998
If they catch us,
we're definitely going to prison, man!

692
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,749
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, shit!

693
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,585
- Why are we going so slow?
- Come on, faster!

694
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:40,211
Shit, I'm so screwed.

695
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,135
Listen here, cut the engine now!

696
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,846
I said stop, you motherfuckers!

697
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,639
-We're so fucked.
-Hey, come on. Come on!

698
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,142
I don't think we're outpacing
the Coast Guard!

699
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,936
Well, then go this way.
Go around! Go around!

700
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,731
-Oh, man. I'm screwed here! I'm fucked!
-Hurry, hurry! All the way!

701
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,073
Oh, man!
They're not supposed to go that way.

702
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,992
What's the issue?

703
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,911
Your dumbass wouldn't understand.

704
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,717
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

705
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,801
What do we do?

706
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:35,934
Oh, shit!

707
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,186
Why are we stopping? We can't stop here!

708
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,855
Hey! Come on!
I'm pulling as hard as I can, you asshole.

709
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,943
Pull it harder then! They're on us!

710
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,152
-We'll get caught.
-Damn it!

711
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,531
I think something stuck down there.

712
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,414
Oh, man. We're really fucked.

713
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,751
Back up! Back up! Back up!

714
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:02,961
-Back up?
-Back up!

715
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,629
Fuck me. It's a farm, isn't it?

716
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,130
- Back up.
- Shit.

717
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,882
- Do something.
- Ah, shit!

718
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,343
- Back up you piece of shit!
- Hurry! Pull!

719
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,428
Damn it!

720
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,057
Hey! Hey!

721
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,184
Smoke's coming out
of the engine! What do we do?

722
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,479
Damn it! Come on, you piece of shit.

723
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,608
- Deoksan!
- Hey, Deoksan!

724
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:28,027
Hey, hey! Coach! Coach!

725
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,029
Hey, are you okay? Deoksan!

726
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:31,864
Coach! Deoksan's down!

727
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,242
What are we going to do?

728
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,036
- Help! There's a fire!
- Over here! Over here!

729
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,456
Damn, man.

730
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,624
Pull up to it.

731
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,001
I'm sorry?

732
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:46,421
Damn it, I said pull up to it. Don't you
see all the fucking pottery there?

733
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,923
Ah, move it!

734
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,676
-Do you know how much that's worth?
-All right! I heard you, shit.

735
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,177
Fuck's sake.

736
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,765
-Help us, please!
-What the hell is this?

737
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,475
-Help!
-Oh, shit!

738
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:00,977
Shit!

739
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,062
Whoa, Honggi!
What are you doing?

740
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,399
Let's get this over with,
you pieces of shit.

741
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,942
Is Deoksan all right?

742
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,278
-Hey! What the hell?
-We're here!

743
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,613
Don't move!

744
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,366
Get the pottery first, assholes.

745
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,578
-Don't just stand there! Get the pottery!
-Forget the pottery.

746
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,288
We gotta get them out of there first!

747
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,414
You stupid fuck!

748
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,000
Do what I say
and grab the fucking pottery first.

749
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,585
Move it!

750
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,379
Stand still, you Busan fucks. Don't move.

751
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:30,798
I'll blow your damn heads off
if I see you move an inch.

752
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,675
Get everything in those basins!

753
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:35,344
-Get on it, you sons of bitches!
-Hey, hey. Pass them over!

754
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,180
I said move your fuckin' ass now!

755
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,891
-Come on, hurry up!
-Shit!

756
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,394
Hey, just get the whole thing
over here, you idiot!

757
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,689
-Don't even think about it, asshole.
-Fuck!

758
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,360
Fucking bastards.

759
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,987
Honggi! Fuck, man!

760
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,239
That's enough!
Park, get back over here now!

761
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,784
I'll fucking kill you
if you move.

762
00:42:57,867 --> 00:42:59,660
The gun. Where is it? Shit!

763
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,746
Get that shit over here,
you stupid motherfuckers!

764
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,220
Honggi, are you all right?

765
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,347
Honggi!

766
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,603
Shit! Shit! What do I do?

767
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,316
Oh, shit!

768
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,651
Back up!

769
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,653
Back up! Back up now!

770
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,987
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

771
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:40,827
Fuck me.

772
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,955
Shit.

773
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,850
Well…

774
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,435
Okay, tough guy.

775
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,770
I got you what you wanted.

776
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,522
Seonja's getting out of here.

777
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,401
Wait, Seonja.

778
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,406
Take care of yourself, girl.

779
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,493
Thanks for everything, Jongmal.

780
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:23,578
Take care too.

781
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,123
Make sure you watch out for her, you hear?

782
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,207
Let's go.

783
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:30,835
Hey.

784
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,255
Gonna pay for the stuff
you broke the other day?

785
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,761
Rotten son of a bitch.

786
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,763
Wait just a minute.

787
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,140
Where are we going now?

788
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,561
Seoul.

789
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,354
Really?

790
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,483
There's just one thing
I have to take care of first.

791
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,091
Nice truck.

792
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,010
How did you manage
to get your hands on it?

793
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,970
Well, there's nothing money can't do.

794
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:26,474
Oh, man!
You got money pouring out everywhere.

795
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,976
You still had some
after you gave her all that?

796
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,563
Yeah, I might've skimmed
a little extra cash off what I owed.

797
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:34,649
No way. How much?

798
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,234
About a quarter mil.

799
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,613
That's great! Now, that's skimming!

800
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,533
Is that the reason
you threw it on the table all cool?

801
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:47,036
-So she couldn't count it all?
-Exactly.

802
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,871
That's why when Jongmal
and you were sobbing,

803
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,249
I was just standing there
shaking like a leaf the whole time.

804
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,126
Is that right?

805
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,129
I'm sorry for making you scared.

806
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,260
So, anyway,
what are we coming out here for?

807
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,554
Treasure. Jackpot.

808
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:07,682
Jackpot?

809
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,142
Everywhere I look,
it's nothing but salt ponds.

810
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,728
We're here.

811
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:14,897
We are?

812
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,951
Uh, what is this place?
