00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,023

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,235
<i>The American wrestler</i>

5
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,696
<i>by locking Kim Il's face and body</i>

6
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,699
<i>But Kim Il came right back swinging.</i>

7
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,493
<i>Known for his powerful headbutts,</i>

8
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:36,662
- <i>he was finally able to…</i>
<i>- Kim Il.</i>

9
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,746
The headbutt master.

10

BUSAN

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,000
Now you might be askin',

12
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,670
how the hell did he get so good
at usin' his head?

13
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,088
Tell us, Coach.

14
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,007
Rikidozan
got him on his knees,

15
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,177
held his head still,
then smashed it with a baseball bat

16
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,555
and cracked it
with a brick. All right, stupid?

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,182
That's what makes you a legend.

18
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,977
-You really mean it?
-You're damn right.

19
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,271
Get ready.

20
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,274
Wrestlin's all about how good
you can take a hit.

21
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,901
Hold your ground.
Better lock your chest, yeah?

22
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,278
You're not getting punched.

23
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,738
You're taking their fist
and smashing it with your body!

24
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,286
All right.

25
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,496
Again! Come here, big boy…

26
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,253
It doesn't matter if you bleed, all right?

27
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,172
Getting bloody's just a part of it.
You think you really want this?

28
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,594
Do you mean,
if I do this I can train under Kim Il?

29
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,720
You kidding me?

30
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,888
Boy, you got a long,
bloody road ahead of ya.

31
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,768
Get moving!

32
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,272
What you walkin' for?
I said run, you idiots.

33
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,608
You gonna drag your ass all day?
Ya gotta stay flexible…

34
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,152
…or you'll snap out there.

35
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,487
You got this kid! That's it. Move!

36
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,579
Hey, do you have our money,
or are we tearing this place apart?

37
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,082
Listen, I'm not making any money,
so cut me some slack.

38
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,752
-What do you want me to do?
-What do I want?

39
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,337
How about you give us what you owe us?

40
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,964
You spent the money you borrowed
and now you're tellin' a different story!

41
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,342
All right, all right.

42
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,426
Shit.

43
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,178
Just lay off.

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,686
This is it?

45
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,607
Yeah. We wrung that out of him. Barely.

46
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,610
I don't think we can cover one month
of the rent with this.

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,487
I'm gonna need you to make this right

48
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,489
and haul some more crates
at Jagalchi Market.

49
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,573
Yes, sir.

50
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:37,991
Left face.

51
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,995
Go.

52
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,957
Pick it up, you idiots!

53
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,167
Yes, sir!

54
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,752
Let's go!

55
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,961
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

What's goin' on here?

63
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,260
Uh, we were just asking for directions.

64
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,846

66
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,980
What brings you here from Seoul?

67
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,692
My husband is, in fact, the chairman
and these two men are my chaperones.

68
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,030
So, then, what's your story?

69
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,491
I came all the way from Busan
to catch a scammer.

70
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,952
Sounds like y'all
are here for different reasons,

71
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,704
so what was the staring contest for?

72
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,374
Our friend here has no manners,
so I was just setting him straight.

73
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,044
Look, standin' around
in the rain, lookin' all shady,

74
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,129
is gonna scare the locals around here.

75
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,382
We don't need no trouble,
so just go on your way. Okay?

76
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,343
Wait, have you seen him though?

77
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,094
- Seen who?
- This guy…

78
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,764
He's got a Busan accent,
I'm sure you'd remember him.

79
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,266
Mokpo brings in people
from all over the country.

80
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,519
You think a Gyeongsang accent
would stand out around here?

81
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,064
No, listen. Not a Gyeongsang accent,
a Busan accent.

82
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,524
Can't you tell the difference?

83
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:16,691
You fucking bastard.

84
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,776
Whoa!

85
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,694
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to here?

86
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,571
Come on, get your hands off, all right?

87
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,533
Where the hell are you grabbin' me?
What the hell is this, huh?

88
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,496
Just finish up
what you're doing and go. Got it?

89
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,580
Yeah.

90
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,668
Next time you bump into me,
I'm taking your big ass in.

91
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,046
So do Jeolla cops make
a habit of taking you in for nothing?

92
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,548
Scary place.

93
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,967
If you want to, we could just go now.

94
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,927
Ooh. Oh, man.

95
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,345
Giving me chills.

96
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,015
All right, then. Let me through.

97
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,018
- We should go too.
- Right.

98
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,854
Officer.

99
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,314
All right, this way.

100
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,870
Here we are.

101
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,251
Uh, these are the guys we're working with.

102
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,847
-Quite a big project now.
-Yes. Shall we talk inside?

103
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,056
Mm-hmm.

104
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:43,612
Picking up after her like a
dog, and here I thought you were the boss.

105
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,405
Fine, let's go in.

106
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,616
Let's keep it simple.

107
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:51,119
I don't need everyone.
Just Jeonchul and Mr. Oh.

108
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,081
Hey.

109
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,667
-Get some beer. I could use a drink.
-Okay.

110
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,503
Also, get us a couple
of rooms at a nice inn while you're at it.

111
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,588
Sure.

112
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,841
Oh, and make sure the rooms are apart.

113
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,093
Got it.

114
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,730
You can really make money off of this?

115
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,400
Yes. I wasn't sure at first either,
but it looks like we hit the jackpot.

116
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,027
This seems real big.

117
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,196
How much are we talking here?

118
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,782
Uh, for the rare ones,

119
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,327
what I heard them say…
…is over ten million a piece.

120
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,411
Ten million won?

121
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,789
That's right. I guess last year
they caught some looters

122
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:39,292
and the pieces they brought up
were worth a hundred mil.

123
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,753
Hmm, I read about that as well.

124
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,215
So then someone from Busan got involved?

125
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,050
That weaselly looking guy outside.

126
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,177
They call him Professor Kim.

127
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,388
He's a big shot in this field apparently.

128
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,931
How are you splitting the money?

129
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,141
We're splitting the haul

130
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,852
and then we're gonna pay
all our guys equally.

131
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,939
Do you mind calling him in here?

132
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,273
The weasel?

133
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,733
Yes.

134
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,152
- Sure. Okay.
- Step outside, would you?

135
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,989
And, uh, call in Mr. Ha
while you're at it.

136
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:12,867
Well, you going?

137
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,160
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

138
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,870
I'll step out.

139
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:23,753
Thanks. Have a good one.

140
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,672
Thank you. See you again soon.

141
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,551
Mmm! Oh, fucking hell, that's good! Mmm.

142
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,435
Hey ma'am. Is there
a decent inn around here?

143
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,146
Well, the best one's
round the corner.

144
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,605
What was the name of it again?

145
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,482
Oh, Eonnyeon's Inn, that way.

146
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:48,695
I think I heard some people say it's nice,
but I wouldn't know.

147
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,697
Eonnyeon's? Got it.

148
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,615
Ah, right.

149
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,492
Can I get some beer to go?

150
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,078
- How many?
- Uh, three bottles.

151
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,164
-And something to eat as well.
-'Kay.

152
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,248
Damn, you don't have any--

153
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,750
Come on, lady.

154
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,835
Throw him some anchovies
and send him on his way.

155
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,337
I'm tired of listenin' to his squawking.

156
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,176
What you lookin' at?

157
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,932
- How much do I owe you?
- 200 won.

158
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,395
They say people from all over
the country gather here.

159
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,314
I guess Seoul folks are no exception.

160
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,318
But that sissy accent…
It's making me get a migraine.

161
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:32,697
I'm serious,
I can barely hold it together.

162
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,240
Here.

163
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,242
-Thanks.
-You can bring back the cloth later.

164
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,796
Gorilla piece of shit…

165
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,465
Just breathe.

166
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,758
Not worth it.

167
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,807
Anyone here?

168
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,933
Yeah!

169
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,726
Oh, boy.

170
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,354
You got any rooms, lady?
I'm gonna need two of 'em.

171
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,442
Yeah. How about these two rooms here?

172
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,945
Can I take two on the sides
and skip the center one?

173
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,614
So you want two
that ain't next to each other?

174
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,450
Is one of them cleaner or nicer
than the other?

175
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,077
They're all nice and clean.

176
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,245
Try that one there.

177
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,455
Okay.

178
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,501
ROOMS FOR RENT

179
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,295
My husband is the chairman of Heungbaek.

180
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,422
We're the one's funding Mr. Oh's project.

181
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,758
So she's your boss in Seoul.

182
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,594
No, I'm not his boss.

183
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,847
We're the ones relying on his help here.

184
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,266
- We appreciate your work.
- It's my pleasure.

185
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,021
So I heard you're all here
for the same reason

186
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,440
and you've already agreed
on how to split the profits.

187
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:50,567
Uh, that's right.

188
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,735
I think we could do something better.

189
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,738
Because as it stands,
it feels like you're all losing out.

190
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,533
If you do the math,
it feels like it's not adding up.

191
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,951
Do you disagree?

192
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,287
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't worth it.

193
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,332
Of course, but you
won't make any money until you sell them.

194
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,128
The ceramics you find here, they won't be
as easy to sell as you think.

195
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,338
It'll be hard for you
to get the right price.

196
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,258
Respectfully, you don't know
what you're talking about.

197
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,636
This right here, it'll sell
for whatever I say the price is.

198
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,804
You proved my point.

199
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,098
You don't realize that it's your attitude
that will set you back.

200
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,935
Hey… …look, lady.
Don't underestimate me.

201
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,354
I don't go after something unless it pays.

202
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,357
Do you know how many ceramics
I've sold to Japan already?

203
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,819
Bet I could set up a row
of high-rises with that cash.

204
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,321
Then why haven't you done so?

205
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,285
Well, so, uh,
what exactly are you proposing here?

206
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,705
Let's make it easy.
I'll buy everything you find.

207
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,792
You'll buy it all?

208
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,171
Yes. 100,000 won a piece.

209
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,174
I'll pay that regardless of whether
or not they might have any value.

210
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,051
And in return, you'll help me sell them.

211
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,844
Hang on.

212
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,888
Tell us your idea.

213
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,933
If you're able to get
the ceramics authenticated as genuine,

214
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,268
I'll give you an additional 20 percent.

215
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,437
We can find our own buyers.

216
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,732
And if you get a good price point
yourselves, I'll give you thirty.

217
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,694
If you manage to find 1,000,
well, that's 100 million.

218
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,365
That's 30 each if you split it three ways.

219
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,618
That's good money without having
to find your own buyers.

220
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:25,286
Wait.

221
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,580
I'm curious.

222
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,540
If you don't mind me asking.

223
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,585
What's in it for you exactly?

224
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,131
Just one good ceramic could go
for 30 million right?

225
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,760
If just ten of the thousand
hit the jackpot, I'll break even.

226
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,179
And if you were to help me
get them appraised,

227
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,764
you'll get your 30 million won,

228
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:49,185
and on top of that, an extra 20
or 30% of the sale price.

229
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,145
I know the people who can pay that much.

230
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:53,273
Wow, your way of making money

231
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,484
is on another level here.

232
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,319
It takes money to make money.

233
00:12:58,403 --> 00:12:59,904
Or so they say.

234
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:04,409
Uh, by the way, how will we get
1,000 with one boat?

235
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,203
Pardon? You're doing this with one boat?

236
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,832
Any more and we would draw
too much attention.

237
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,333
We're not playing around.

238
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,335
It's best for you to go big and move fast.

239
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,921
With this many people,
you should take two boats.

240
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,549
Uh, the police would notice two boats.

241
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,720
Suppose I'll have to pay them off, then.

242
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,807
Out of all of you here,
does anyone know an officer?

243
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,891
Ah.

244
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,269
- The captain?
- He's right there.

245
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,520
One moment.

246
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,443
-Get in here.
-What'd you say?

247
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,694
Hey, these expensive?

248
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,571
- Deal me out.
- Right.

249
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,406
They sure look like it.

250
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,825
Come on.

251
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,371
So, your cop friend. You trust him?

252
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,541
- Wait, who?
- What do you mean who?

253
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,545
Honggi? That guy and I,
we go way back.

254
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,548
Do you think you could arrange a meeting?

255
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,677
Well yeah, if I call he'll come runnin'.

256
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,764
Uh, why a meeting?

257
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,684
I was just hoping
I could treat him to a meal.

258
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,234
- Sweet and sour pork's up.
- All right.

259
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,990
- Please enjoy.
- Wow. Thank you.

260
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,409
Are the rooms settled?

261
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,535
Yeah.

262
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,621
-And the beer?
-It's in her room.

263
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,917
-What inn are they staying at?
-The hell is this, 20 Questions?

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,502
Come on, guys. Let's eat.

265
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,921
- Table three.
- Okay.

266
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,133
Whoa… Oh.

267
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,473
Sir.

268
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,352
Hey, man.

269
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,229
Fucking idiots.

270
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,647
Huh?

271
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,399
Now that the missus is here,
things sure feel different.

272
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:02,944
Come on. Let's go.

273
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,908
The guest of honor.

274
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,993
Hello again.

275
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,204
So, what exactly am I doing here?

276
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,373
Good. We already know each other.

277
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,334
- Please have a seat.
- Ugh, what's the deal?

278
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,838
Ah, just hold your horses man.
Taesan's on his way here.

279
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,173
Hey, Honggi. You're here.

280
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,175
Come on, sit down.

281
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,469
Please. Join us.

282
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,012
What the hell is this?

283
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,557
Nothing. We just wanted
to have a chat over some food.

284
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,267
All right then.

285
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,726
I'll leave y'all to it.

286
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,277
Over here!

287
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,237
Can we get more pickled radish here?

288
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,198
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

289
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,742
What do they pay you for?
Get the man his pickled radish.

290
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,870
Right.

291
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,998
Outsider, how's your meal?

292
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,792
<i>Jjajangmyeon</i> taste all right?

293
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,296
Do those hands of yours do
anything or are they just for show, huh?

294
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,383
So, you Seoul folk don't know this,

295
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,511
but you gotta season your <i>jjajangmyeon</i>.

296
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:14,348
If you don't drown it in vinegar…
…it don't taste right.

297
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,601
Hmm? You gotta add some real weight to it.

298
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,061
Otherwise it's too bland.

299
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,690
It's always day in and day out
with this shit for you motherfuckers!

300
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,734
Oh, shit.
He's getting mad, isn't he?

301
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,360
What a clown.

302
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,571
Look, just knock that shit off already.

303
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,575
What the hell? This shit again?
Give me a break.

304
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,286
I don't want things to get ugly,
so just cut it out.

305
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,246
Oh, yeah?

306
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,082
You little bitch.

307
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,459
Who the hell do you think you are

308
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,920
- fucking talking to me like that?
- Don't fucking touch me.

309
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,421
Fuckin'--

310
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,801
- Hey!
- You fuckin' piece of…

311
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,845
Son of a bitch!

312
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,932
Ah, piece of shit. Come on--

313
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,229
- You motherfucker.
- Piece of shit.

314
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,231
- Knock it off!
- Fucking asshole.

315
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,941
-I'm gonna fucking kill you.
-Knock it off!

316
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,318
- I'll kill you, you little bitch.
- Let's go, boss.

317
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,072
You better fuck off
before I lose my shirt.

318
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,823
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Let's go, Boss.

319
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,325
- Get the fuck outta here. Go on.
- Let's go.

320
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,868
Ah, fuck this!

321
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,082
Yeah! Fuck you, son of a bitch!

322
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,959
- No, fuck you!
- Enough, Heedong.

323
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,086
It's over.

324
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,968
Hello!

325
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,345
Anyone here?

326
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,680
Yeah!

327
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,476
Can I get a room?

328
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,939
Well, if you want a room,
that's the only one that's available.

329
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,108
Which one? The middle one?

330
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,317
Yeah.

331
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,861
All right, then. I'll take it.

332
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,996
-You got beer? I could use a drink.
-We don't got beer.

333
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,832
You're kiddin' me, what kinda inn
doesn't carry any fuckin' beer?

334
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,041
Damn it.

335
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,304
Geez, you've had a lotta booze already.

336
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,639
Get some rest now.

337
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,692
I know doing this is awkward,
but we all need to be on the same page.

338
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,445
If you start feeling uncomfortable,
just say when.

339
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,905
Otherwise I'll keep going.

340
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,700
I have plenty.

341
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,620
So please just let me know
when this feels right.

342
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,208
All right, then. That's enough.

343
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,837
Already?

344
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,047
Are you sure that's enough?

345
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,633
Taesan, tell me.
What exactly are we doing here?

346
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,094
Hey now. What's the matter with
the lady tryin' to show some goodwill?

347
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,181
Don't take this
the wrong way.

348
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,308
We want you on our side.

349
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,603
But if you don't want to do this,
then we'll find someone else who does.

350
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,771
I see.

351
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,023
What exactly do y'all do?

352
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,069
We're… Well we're just here
to find something in the sea.

353
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,695
-The pottery?
-Yeah.

354
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,199
And frankly, does anything
in the ocean truly belong to anyone?

355
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,786
You know what they say,
"finders keepers," right?

356
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,956
Hey, so look. You're my guy,
that's why I'm askin' you.

357
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,293
I ain't askin' you to cover up
some mess or anythin'.

358
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,753
So just help me out here, man.

359
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,924
You just need to do two things
and you'll get paid.

360
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,843
One. You can turn a blind eye
while we're working out there,

361
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,430
and then, two, you keep
the Coast Guard off our back.

362
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,973
Two things.

363
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,726
-He's got ties with the Coast Guard.
-Oh.

364
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,104
Do they still stand guard though?
Haven't seen 'em recently.

365
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,273
They rotate shifts,
but they're always there.

366
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,443
Well, could you at least keep them
distracted while we're working?

367
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,278
That sounds simple enough, right?

368
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,697
Hey, now.

369
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,991
Handling some guards
ain't no big deal or nothing.

370
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,126
All right, then. I'll do it. I'm in.

371
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,129
But… …if this all goes tits up,

372
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,507
all of you are getting booked
on charges of bribing a police officer,

373
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,175
and conspiracy too.

374
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,847
And this money…
it'll all go straight into evidence.

375
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,641
Are we clear?

376
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,728
-Yes.
-If you're good with that,

377
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:33,107
write down your ID number, and, uh,
throw another stack in there.

378
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,072
And if it all goes to plan,
I'll throw in two more bundles.

379
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,157
Let's work hard.

380
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,033
Uh, it's this way.

381
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,123
It's this room and that one.

382
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,334
There's someone else here.

383
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,670
Uh, they weren't here earlier.

384
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,131
If it's a stranger,
then it's fine with me.

385
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,509
That room over there is yours.

386
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,936
Damn.

387
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,522
Are you kidding me with this shit?

388
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,983
Uh, she said this was
the best one she had.

389
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,320
There's no light in the bathroom.

390
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,368
It's getting late.
You should all get some sleep.

391
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:31,415
Uh, ma'am, will you be
comfortable enough to sleep here?

392
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:34,251
Nothing's ever as comfortable as home.

393
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,670
If you need anything, I'm a call away.

394
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,880
Mmm.

395
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,555
Good night, ma'am.

396
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,851
Let's go.

397
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,655
You see, then she says to me after I take
my pants off, "Why's it that color?"

398
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,034
Did you get her settled in?

399
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,244
Yeah.

400
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,746
- Is her bed warm enough?
- What?

401
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,831
The covers.

402
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,835
-I'm not sure.
-Go make sure she's comfortable.

403
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,506
Wait, hold up.
What the hell is going on here?

404
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,344
You little fucks.
You gotta be kidding me with this shit.

405
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,722
-When you went to Seoul, what did you do?
-Shit.

406
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:32,309
Hey, how is it any of your business?

407
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,311
You're not the boss.

408
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,730
You need to figure out
which side you're on, you bastard.

409
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,149
Quit scurrying around like a fucking rat.

410
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,193
You motherfuckers.

411
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,780
What crawled up his ass?

412
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,574
- Fuck!
- Huh?

413
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,117
What's going on?

414
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,661
It's nothing.

415
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,542
Go get some morning coffee ready
for the lady.

416
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,752
- I gotta do that now too?
- Heedong.

417
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,629
We've gotta do our best.

418
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,443
Ma'am, it's Jeonchul.

419
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,781
You there?

420
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,951
Oh, shit.

421
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,287
The hell are you doing?

422
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,624
Who are you?

423
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,377
Why are you sneaking around
at night like a damn rat?

424
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,257
It can wait. I'm sorry. Have a good night.

425
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,051
What…

426
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,680
Did he seriously wake me up
in the middle of the night with this shit?

427
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,159
Whoa!

428
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,121
Sorry about that.

429
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:19,375
Don't be upset.
I swear I didn't see anything.

430
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,962
Shit.

431
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,256
Backwater town can't be bothered
to put a damn light in the toilet.

432
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,552
Oh! You're that woman from earlier.

433
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,435
Okay. What the hell
is that bitch's problem?

434
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,938
She's so stuck up and shit.

435
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,964
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

436
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,683
Seonja.

437
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,810
Hey. What brings you here?

438
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,771
I, uh… Think I can get a pot of coffee?

439
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,357
Why do you need coffee
in the middle of the night?

440
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,277
I've got a guest. It's for the morning.

441
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,654
Coffee, my ass. You just came to see her.

442
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:32,781
I'll leave you to it.

443
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,620
Man, it must be someone special.
How much do you need?

444
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,205
Whatever's normal.

445
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:46,211
-Is that…
-What do you think? It's pretty, no?

446
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,047
Yeah, it suits you.

447
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,049
Hey, you wanna know somethin' funny?

448
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,010
I was just talking to Jongmal about you.

449
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,054
What about?

450
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,431
Well, you know. This and that.

451
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,891
You say anything?

452
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,561
Stop your worryin'.
I didn't say a word about your work.

453
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,230
Listen. Well, uh…

454
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:10,611
It's just, the other night,
I wasn't exactly thinking straight.

455
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:14,823
Which night was this?

456
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:18,160
Uh, you know… the one at your house.

457
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,913
So that's what's got you worried.

458
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,791
I'm not worried, it's just, I'm…

459
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,251
The thing is…
I'm later than usual.

460
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,961
Late? For what?

461
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,464
Don't you know how girls have
that time of the month?

462
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,008
What are you talking about?

463
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,010
What do you think?

464
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,763
Let me spell it out for you.
I think I'm pregnant.

465
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,474
What?

466
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:16,718
<i>What do you think?</i>

467
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,596
Let me spell it out for you.
I think I'm pregnant.

468
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:26,270
- Man, I'm thirsty.
- Huh?

469
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:29,273
You're that guy I saw from earlier.

470
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,151
You sneaky son of a bitch.

471
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,946
Didn't know she was
such a damn wildcat, man.

472
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:42,244
What? Let me guess.
You're checking her bed springs too?

473
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,665
-The hell's going on?
-Whoa.

474
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,294
That sleazy woman's got the whole block
lined up for her sweet ass, huh?

475
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,339
What are you doing here so late?

476
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:57,467
-My uncle told me to bring her coffee.
-Which one's your uncle?

477
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,555
Seoul or Busan?

478
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,682
Seoul.

479
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,146
Told you to watch yourself, didn't I?

480
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,733
Was that what it was? I'm not sure--

481
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,944
- Shit.
- You son of a bitch.

482
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,863
- You wanna fuck with me?
- Fucking bastard.

483
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,072
- Asshole!
- Go back inside.

484
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,699
Keep running your mouth,
you big piece of shit!

485
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,243
-You stupid motherfucker.
-Keep talking, you son of a bitch.

486
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:26,872
- Oh, my God! What's going on?
- Stupid bastard! Son of a bitch!

487
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,624
Not so tough now, you fucker.

488
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,083
Get the police!

489
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,922
Son of a bitch!

490
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,892
Oh, shit.

491
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,645
You big fuck!

492
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:53,649
Son of a bitch.

493
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,962
You piece of shit!

494
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,516
Fuck you.

495
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,769
Fuck you!

496
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,398
You… you fucking asshole.

497
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,716
What is this?

498
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,509
Hey, you!

499
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,846
What the hell did you do here, damn it?

500
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,641
Do you see this blood?
They swung on me first.

501
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:13,103
You were harassing me
with your dirty looks.

502
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,439
Okay, I've heard enough.

503
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,232
We'll talk at the station. Hands.

504
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,528
Fine. But tell me…

505
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,865
Professor Kim is here.
I need to know where he is.

506
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,868
Who the hell's that?

507
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,370
He scammed my ma
out of her hard-earned cash,

508
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:31,830
and I was told he was here.

509
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,457
I gotta bring him back to Busan.

510
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,045
What?

511
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,547
You know him, huh?

512
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,593
You'd be better off
letting me take the guy.

513
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:53,101
What do you think?
Can you hold him for a little while?

514
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,817
All right, let's go.

515
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,112
Hey, man.

516
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,825
When he eventually stabs you in the back,
I know you're gonna remember me.

517
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,209
Are you all right?

518
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,630
You should go
see a doctor in the morning.

519
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:27,928
Heedong, you should stay here.
Keep watch over her.

520
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:30,055
It's been a rough night.

521
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,766
It's just, I got hurt. So, uh…

522
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,479
Can I talk to you, Uncle?

523
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,150
Well, now that the loud
one's gone, what else could happen?

524
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,486
- You should all head back.
- Okay, but…

525
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,197
Ah, shit.

526
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,580
Are you stupid? You've already
fucked things up after a week?

527
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:58,500
You think you have time
to be messing around with girls?

528
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,710
I drank way too much.
I don't even remember.

529
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,838
I told you not to drink, didn't I?

530
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,756
Shit.

531
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,883
Fuck.

532
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,094
I'll take care of things
with your coffee girl.

533
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,929
The chairman's wife needs you.

534
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,640
- No.
- Hey.

535
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,642
This is the most important thing
to us right now.

536
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,227
I said no!

537
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,146
Are you… Hey, Heedong.

538
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,573
What are you yelling for at this hour?

539
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,741
Hey, I wanna ask you something.

540
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:34,452
In Busan, did you pull some shady shit?

541
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,079
- Why do you ask?
- Just answer me.

542
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,706
Would anyone want to chase you here?

543
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,251
Someone say something?

544
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,225
All right. Today,
we're kickin' off the real work at sea.

545
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,768
Make sure to eat something good.

546
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:02,522
That's right. You sure know
how to set your priorities, don't ya now?

547
00:33:02,606 --> 00:33:03,815
Let's go then.

548
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,735
I know this place round the corner
that does great <i>yeonpotang</i>.

549
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,446
-You gotta get the boat ready.
-What, my boat?

550
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,949
Now that the Coast Guard is handled,
we're taking your boat out there.

551
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,994
That's right. The waves are too strong
for the little boat.

552
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,162
All right.

553
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,415
I'll catch you all later.
I'll see you around twelve o'clock.

554
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,168
- Where are you headed?
- Seeing off the chairman's wife.

555
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,922
Enjoy your lunch.

556
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,967
I'll see you guys at the dock later.

557
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,308
There's five million in here.

558
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,477
- That should cover it.
- Whoa.

559
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,104
Thank you very much.

560
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:47,275
My men can get treated in Seoul,
so that's fine. And that thug?

561
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,363
Well, he's locked up at the station.
I don't think we have to worry about him.

562
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,490
And what about the professor?

563
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,535
Well if his connections to the market
in Japan are legitimate, I'll keep him.

564
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,246
If not, I'll hand him over to the thug.

565
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,123
But if you were to cut him loose,
then he's very likely to spill everything.

566
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,709
Of course.
I'll handle it with the utmost care.

567
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,420
Don't worry about my husband.
I'll have a word.

568
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,588
Thank you.

569
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,716
Right.

570
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,887
I appreciate the gesture,
but no more gifts, please.

571
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,182
Useless gifts are just extra baggage.

572
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,560
Right, got it. Here. For you.

573
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,355
-What's this?
-A souvenir.

574
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:27,482
The first ceramic
that we were able to recover.

575
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,276
- The one from yesterday.
- Oh.

576
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,195
Please let me know
as they start coming in.

577
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,738
And keep up the good work.

578
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,073
We'll do our best, ma'am.

579
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,371
Safe travels.

580
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:49,379

I-Is there a Seonja who works here?

584
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,222
Really? Again?

585
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,432
Hey, Seonja.

586
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,517
This gentleman is asking for you.

587
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,437
Why are you looking for her? Who are you?

588
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,648
Wait, are you my third cousin's daughter?

589
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,234
We spoke on the phone.
Oh Gwanseok.

590
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,111
Oh, wow. Would you look at that?

591
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,488
I haven't seen you
since you were a little babe.

592
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,158
Yeah, I barely recognized you
there for a second.

593
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,534
Uh, who are you?

594
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,869
Hi. I'm Heedong's uncle.

595
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,832
Listen, is it okay
if I borrow her for a while?

596
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,297
Hey mister,
how much did you pay my boss,

597
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,341
that she's okay with me leaving like this?

598
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,636
Don't even ask.

599
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,137
She drove a hard bargain.

600
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,556
She really cleaned me out.

601
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,351
Is Heedong coming?

602
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,810
Yeah, he's on his way.

603
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,732
My stomach.

604
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,903
I don't think the food here
is agreeing with my gut.

605
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,030
Can we swing by the doctor's?

606
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,698
Geez, that's rough.

607
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,950
- Let's hurry then.
- Yeah.

608
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,995
Oh, there it is.

609
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:07,707

I was here before.

00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,020
You were worried for nothing.
She's not pregnant.

634
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,314
-What?
-She says they never slept together.

635
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,949
Excuse me.
Could you give us a moment alone?

636
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,496
Shit.

637
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,541
Hey.

638
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,587
Why'd you tell Heedong you were pregnant?

639
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,381
I wanted to move to Seoul.

640
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,049
You little sh…

641
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,927
You didn't think you'd get caught?

642
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,722
I'm sorry.

643
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,516
I'm really sorry.

644
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,770
I don't believe this.

645
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,526
Nothing happened today.

646
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,407
Where'd you even learn to pull this shit?

647
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,703
Here, buy yourself something nice.

648
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,164
Just take it.

649
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,182
Fucking idiot.

650
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,200
The chairman is at the factory
in Yongin right now.

651
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,493
Would you like to head there?

652
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,954
No. I would like to stop by Jongno.

653
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,623
You boys should go see a doctor.

654
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,126
- We're fine, ma'am.
- Just go while you still can.

655
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,047
And if the chairman asks you, tell him
things were really rough down there.

656
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,968
Lots of big guys coming at you
everywhere you looked. You got that?

657
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,637
Ma'am.

658
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:13,852
MARILYN BOUTIQUE

659
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,694
- They don't go together.
- Oh, okay.

660
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,321
- Hey, girl!
- Good afternoon.

661
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:28,283
I'm tired.
I just got back from Mokpo.

662
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,576
What's in Mokpo?

663
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,287
I wanna show you something. Come here.

664
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,414
What's that?

665
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:36,332
They got it in Sinan.

666
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,043
What is it?

667
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,920
-Oh, it looks ancient.
-Does it?

668
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,464
Are these barnacles right here?

669
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,717
Mmm. They found it under the sea.

670
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:47,677
Really?

671
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,597
Well, that aside, can I borrow some money?

672
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,308
-Well, how much?
-Can you do 50 million?

673
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,102
I don't have that kind of money.

674
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,645
Can you give me 10 million?

675
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,607
You're getting involved
in some big business.

676
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,109
What can I do?
Gotta keep the chairman happy.

677
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,863
Wow, isn't he a lucky guy?
Has a wife who can rake in the cash.

678
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,615
Can I make a call?

679
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,825
You know you don't have to ask anymore.

680
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,922
Good afternoon, do you have a minute?
This is Chairman Cheon's wife, Jungsook.

681
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,470
What's wrong? Is it too little?

682
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,097
Hold on.

683
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:36,309
I admit, I'm a little confused, ma'am.
Why are you suggesting this?

684
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,978
It's not a suggestion.
I'm changing the deal, right now.

685
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,813
Since you came back from Mokpo,

686
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:42,774
you seem different.

687
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,109
I bet you must've seen
something worthwhile.

688
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,570
Well, one has to be flexible
in their thinking.

689
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:49,989
Remember what the chairman asked?

690
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:51,908
For us to secure and find genuine pieces.

691
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,911
And to do that,
we need to manage what we find.

692
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,956
You can handle that however you want.
Just let go of the ones from Sinan.

693
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,584
With all due respect,
cutting us out of the deal like this…

694
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,295
It isn't exactly fair to us.

695
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,382
They only get value
after we appraise them.

696
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:10,009
If you try to sell them yourself,
you won't get far.

697
00:41:10,093 --> 00:41:12,178
I've already lined up
a few other appraisers,

698
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,806
and nothing good comes
from having too many cooks.

699
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,100
Damn it.

700
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,519
If we're all done here, gentlemen,
I'll just be on my way.

701
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,853
Wait, but--

702
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:24,649
And from now on, everything Sinan,
people and ceramics,

703
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,359
they all belong to me.

704
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,864
- No, wait…
- Uh, w--

705
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,075
Finally, there he is.

706
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,788
Damn, it must've been
one hell of a send-off then.

707
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,665
We've just been sittin' on our asses here.

708
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,542
Sorry about that.

709
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,168
Are we all ready to go?

710
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:45,795
Hours ago, man.

711
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,339
What about you? You ready to go?

712
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,258
Yeah.

713
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,260
It's all taken care of.

714
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,096
-And the boat?
-Right here.

715
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:58,516
Man, bigger is better. Isn't that right?

716
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,309
Let's head out.

717
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,397
Watch your step.

718
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,606
Geez.

719
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,114
YONGJIN

720
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,163
Now that we switched boats,
you got something to do.

721
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,539
What do you mean?

722
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,791
You don't have to dive
now that you're steering, so that's good!

723
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,668
I can still go in if you want.

724
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,755
-It's not like I'm scared of it.
-Uh-huh.

725
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,048
Sure.

726
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,927
Hey guys, we're almost there!
Look for the buoy!

727
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:36,095
Look for the buoy!

728
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,347
There it is!

729
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,518
All right. We're close.

730
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,190
Hey, Bokgeun, drop anchor!

731
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,400
Drop the anchor!

732
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,870
Look, the tide's about to change.
We gotta get goin' here!

733
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,330
Okay. Get ready, fellas!

734
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,248
Who here knows how to dive?

735
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:07,710
- Well, Seokbae's the expert.
- Bokgeun, can't you do it?

736
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:10,421
- I've never done it before.
- Fucking idiot.

737
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:14,175
All right, who's up?
Who's going first?

738
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,551
I thought you were.

739
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,512
Nah, I'm goin' in with the air tank.

740
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,098
Beolgu. You're up first, got that?

741
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,974
Nah, I'm not doin' that shit.

742
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:23,893
All right, enough, we're all taking turns!

743
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,021
Yeah, you're all takin' turns.
So quit your whinin'.

744
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,273
I don't wanna go. I ain't doin' it.

745
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,858
Also, why the hell am I first?

746
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,238
Hey, get in there.

747
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,199
How you gonna send someone
who barely knows the water?

748
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,952
-Besides, you grew up by the sea.
-Just jump in there!

749
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,912
Wow.

750
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,456
We got a whole boat
full of useless assholes.

751
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,500
If you're not goin' in, why are you here?

752
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,377
We'll go back to Jeungdo and drop you off.

753
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,505
Here you go, put this on.

754
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,758
The water's freezing down there.
You're gonna need it.

755
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,176
Forget it.

756
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,594
You serious?

757
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,889
All right, fellas. Gather round.

758
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,267
Fine.

759
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,145
If you look inside,
you see that button right there?

760
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:09,147
You press into it
with your head like this,

761
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,609
it'll release the air inside of your suit,
and your ass will sink straight down.

762
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:17,155
And if you ain't pressing it for a while,
you'll start floating right back up.

763
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,116
Press it in to go down,
leave it alone to float.

764
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,909
Simple, right?

765
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,412
Wait, uh, what was what again?

766
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:28,666
- Man.
- Keep your shoulders up.

767
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,626
Why's it gotta be so heavy?

768
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,670
Keep going. It has to be tight.

769
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,589
Shit.

770
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,966
- Ah, fuck.
- There, sit. Slowly does it.

771
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,886
- Easy, easy now.
- Damn it.

772
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:41,637
Here. Tighten this too.

773
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:44,849
Hey.

774
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,852
- Try working the pump.
- Okay.

775
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:52,440
Seokbae,
is the air coming through?

776
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,442
Yeah. It's working fine.

777
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,987
- Hey. You better keep going.
- Okay.

778
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,114
Don't worry about it,
and just be careful.

779
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,202
- We'll pump like crazy.
- You gotta go down slowly, all right?

780
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,288
- I got it, okay.
- Here, tuck your head in.

781
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,456
Tuck your head in.

782
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,666
Heard you the first time. Shit.

783
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,210
Careful, careful. Hey, careful.

784
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,670
Keep your head tucked. Easy, easy.

785
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,423
There. Yeah, that's good, that's good.

786
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,383
We're turning it now.
Keep your shoulders steady.

787
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,345
That's it. There you go!

788
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,729
-Go on, kid.
-Careful not to get the hose tangled.

789
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,189
- Yeah.
- You're doing great!

790
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:35,524
- Fuck.
- You heard him.

791
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,320
Ah, there he goes.

792
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,505
Shit. I can't see a damn thing.

793
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,474
Where is it?

794
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,909
Oh… Damn it.

795
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,655
How long can you stay
down there with one tank of air?

796
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,907
- Twenty to 30 minutes.
- Huh?

797
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,577
The water's 20 meters deep here.

798
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,580
On the way up,
he'll need to stop to decompress.

799
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,582
-What does that mean?
-Yeah, you're good.

800
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,042
Decompression, you see…

801
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:20,463
it's stoppin' at around 5 or 6 meters
for a few minutes and waitin' there.

802
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,632
Otherwise if you don't,
you'll get the bends and you'll die.

803
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,969
So we actually have even less time
to work than we thought.

804
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,056
That's why we've got the air hose,
so we can send two guys,

805
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:32,641
but that's just as dangerous… Hey!
You need to hold that light, and tight.

806
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,726
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

807
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:41,942
All right!

808
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:52,495
Hey.

809
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,164
Beolgu.

810
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,127
Hey.

811
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,213
Hey. Hey!

812
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,091
Huh?

813
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,928
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

814
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,265
Wait, Song,
you're really going to Mokpo?

815
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:14,600
"TEMPORARILY CLOSED"

816
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,227
Should I just sit here
and let her screw me?

817
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,311
"ORIENTAL ART GALLERY"

818
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:21,148
You saw the way she's trying to play this.
We don't stand a chance against her.

819
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,858
No, I don't accept that.

820
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:26,278
I don't want scraps, I want my share.
It's gotta be fair or nothing!

821
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:28,155
That mentality isn't helping us.

822
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,409
We should quit while we're ahead.
I think it's time we cut and run.

823
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,619
The reason I sent those guys
down there in the first place

824
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,162
was to hit it big, all right?

825
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,247
Oh, yeah?

826
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,124
And how much money would you need
to hit it big?

827
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:39,375
How should I know?

828
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,086
Why do you keep trying to drag me down?

829
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,047
It's not that.
It's the situation we're in.

830
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,133
Let's just go
before things get even messier.

831
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,717
I can't do that. I have to see it.

832
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:51,178
I have to see what she saw
with my own eyes.

833
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:54,432
Hey, what's the point of doing that?
Let it go, already!

834
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:55,683
Let go of me!

835
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,359
Hey. What's the first rule of antiques?

836
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,903
What are you going on about now?

837
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,906
The first and only rule.

838
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,159
Whoever gets their hands on it,
it's theirs!

839
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,502
Hoo-whee,
I knew you wouldn't last long.

840
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:26,297
Wow. You're holding up better
than I thought.

841
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,800
- Hey!
- Come on!

842
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,263
- Damn it. Shit.
- Damn, I'm gonna puke again.

843
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,433
Now I wanna throw my guts up!
Damn, that's gross!

844
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,021
You guys, you guys, over here.

845
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,607
What, what, what? What is it?

846
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,275
The hell's goin' on?

847
00:49:47,443 --> 00:49:48,819
Help me pull it in!

848
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,615
Something must've happened down there!

849
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,824
Shit!

850
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,659
- What?
- Hey!

851
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,411
Hey! He's up! He's up!

852
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,705
-Get the rope!
-Rope, get the rope! Throw it!

853
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,165
- Hold on!
- Get him up!

854
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,333
Come on, let's get him up. Hurry.

855
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,959
-Hurry! Hurry!
-Tie it around!

856
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,503
- What happened?
- Shit.

857
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,757
-Hey. Wrap it under his arms, okay?
-Shit.

858
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,551
- Okay, go!
- Pull it! Pull, pull, pull!

859
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:14,887
- Here, let me help.
- Keep pulling!

860
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,057
- Hurry!
- Pull!

861
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,226
- Hurry, come on.
- Pull up!

862
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,895
- Pull!
- Keep going.

863
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,483
Take this.

864
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,194
- Oh, shit!
- Look at his eyes. He's gone.

865
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:33,656
- What's wrong with his eyes?
- Shit, you gotta be kidding me.

866
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,366
- Hey, boss. Come on, wake up.
- Shit!

867
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,409
Let go. Stop. Stop.

868
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:39,662
Did you see any ceramics, huh?

869
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,413
Did you… Did you see the ship?

870
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,958
-Shit.
-The bastard's completely out of it!

871
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,626
Are you kidding me?
What the fuck's wrong with you?

872
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,711
He looks like he's about to die!
