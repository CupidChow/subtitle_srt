1
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,972
Hey, can you step on it?

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,891
Stepping on it won't get us there
any faster.

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,018
What would we do if the car breaks down?

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,235
There. It's right there.

5
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,070
Okay.

6
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,139
<i>We're seeing her</i>
<i>tomorrow at 2 o'clock.</i>

7
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,226
-Let's go home, yeah?
-You go ahead.

8
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,519
I'm just gonna make a call.

9
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,646
Don't show up late and hung over.

10
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,523
-See you then.
-Yeah.

11
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:12,948
Hey, Uncle.

12
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,409
Yeah?

13
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,036
Say hi to Auntie for me. And the kids.

14
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:19,663
All right.

15
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,048
Heedong.

16
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,594
You motherfucker!

EPISODE 11, THE LAST ORDER

20
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:01,473
Shit.

21
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,646
Ah, shit.

22
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,415
Fuck me!

23
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,005
What?
What happened to all the pottery?

24
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,134
-Tell me what the fuck you did with it.
-Where is it?

25
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,969
- Where the hell is it all?
- Oh, come on.

26
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,722
I'm already pissed enough as it is.
What the hell are you all doing here?

27
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,349
Don't fuck with us, man.

28
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,769
You were planning on stiffing us outta pay
and skipping town, weren't you?

29
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:50,147
- Hell did you just say?
- You fucking bastard.

30
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,691
You kept telling us over and over
to trust you!

31
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,902
You worked us like dogs, and now,
what, you're going to skip out on us?

32
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:56,987
Hey, come on.

33
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,530
You're a real piece of fucking shit,
asshole!

34
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,408
All right. For fuck's sake.
Knock it off already.

35
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,035
Can't you idiots see
that we were robbed blind here?

36
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,621
You were robbed? Well,
who the hell took it then?

37
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:12,043
That fake professor. He and some thugs
got here and cleaned us the hell out.

38
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,546
- The Professor?
- Sounds like that Professor Kim.

39
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,256
- Get off me!
- That's a load of bullshit.

40
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,675
Last night, I saw you packin' up
a bunch of boxes.

41
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,720
That's 'cause those thugs
were making us do it, don't you know?

42
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,556
If we were gonna run,
we would've been outta here long ago.

43
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,183
Damn it.

44
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,684
-Wait, our money.
-All that work.

45
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,604
Where is it?
Who the hell's gonna pay us now?

46
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,064
Where's that guy from Seoul at?

47
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,025
Where's the guy who said
he was gonna pay us?

48
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,403
Don't move, all of you!

49
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,821
- What?
- Don't move!

50
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,698
Hey! I said, don't move.

51
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,160
Step aside.

52
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,790
Looks about right.

53
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,458
Hey, arrest everyone here!

54
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,336
Hey! On what charges, huh?
What do you mean?

55
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,338
The guys on the boat already sold you out.

56
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,048
Get them out of here!

57
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,009
Hey! Get them out of here! Move it!

58
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,554
I said, move!

59
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,601
Hey! Don't let that guy run! Hey!

60
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,685
Grab that guy!

61
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,022
Hey! Stop him!

62
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,733
Shit! Move it!

63
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,076
Oh, damn it. What the hell is this?

64
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,994
Quit moving, you son of a bitch!

65
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,454
You thought you could make a break for it?

66
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,705
I'm sorry! Ah!

67
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,500
I know this is hard
for you to hear, Mrs. Yang.

68
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,087
You miscarried,
likely because of your age.

69
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,054
Mrs. Yang.

70
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,600
Here's your breakfast.

71
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,814
-Did the chairman finish eating?
-Yes, he's getting washed.

72
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,401
Do you think he's mad still?

73
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,653
He hasn't said anything.

74
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,822
Why? Did you two argue?

75
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,367
No, we didn't. Marriage is just like this.

76
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,370
Fighting over every single little thing.

77
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,539
You'll see once you're married.

78
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,709
When I settle down and get married,
I'll keep him on a tight leash.

79
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,712
If he even looks at another girl, I'll
just snap his leg in half like…

80
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,214
Pow, pow, pow.

81
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,299
You're dismissed.

82
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,175
Just let me know when he leaves.

83
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,261
All right.

84
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,852
NAMHAE MARINE SUPPLIES

85
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,572
Sir, we made it.

86
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,782
- Hey.
- Oh.

87
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:48,950
Where are we?

88
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,994
We're in Mokpo obviously.

89
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,871
- <i>Our next story…</i>
- Didn't even stop to take a leak.

90
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,247
-<i>Police announced they…</i>
-What do I owe you?

91
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,832
<i>…apprehended a group that looted artifacts</i>

92
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,627
<i>from the Sinan shipwreck</i>
<i>off the coast of Mokpo.</i>

93
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,128
- What the hell? Turn that up.
- Oh, come on.

94
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,047
<i>…they intercepted the group</i>
<i>as they attempted to smuggle out</i>

95
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,257
<i>illegally salvaged cultural artifacts.</i>

96
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,844
<i>While in pursuit,</i>
<i>a fire broke out on the fleeing vessel,</i>

97
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,179
<i>causing it to sink.</i>

98
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,390
<i>There were six people aboard.</i>
<i>All are considered missing.</i>

99
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,767
<i>Additional members of the group</i>

100
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,145
<i>were also arrested at their base</i>
<i>of operations on Jeungdo.</i>

101
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,939
<i>Among them was a man</i>
<i>identified as Lee Bokgeun,</i>

102
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,902
<i>who had previously been arrested last year</i>
<i>during another illegal salvage operation…</i>

103
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,237
Man, what a damn mess.

104
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,449
I wonder what's for supper.

105
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,620
I wanna know what Honggi was doing.
He dragged Mansu there too.

106
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,789
How should I know?

107
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,958
He grabbed a rifle, bolted outta here
like there was a house on fire.

108
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,712
What the hell? The asshole
didn't show up for work earlier.

109
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,506
Can't reach him at his house either.

110
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,840
Is that right?

111
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,593
Find Mansu yet?

112
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:52,806
We got four dead.
Mansu and one other are still missing.

113
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,057
Who were the four that died?

114
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,768
According to their IDs,
they're from Busan.

115
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,437
What the hell do you think
they were doing all the way out here then?

116
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,648
To loot artifacts.

117
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,983
But I'll defer to the Coast Guard.

118
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,153
- Can I bum a smoke?
- Sure.

119
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,449
<i>Hello?</i>

120
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,118
Uh, Mrs. Yang, hi.

121
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,744
It's Oh Gwanseok speaking.

122
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,829
Oh, hi.

123
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,834
Listen. Uh… I was calling to tell you,
we have a bit of a problem.

124
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,460
What's wrong?

125
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:27,257
We were moving everything, all the stuff
we got, and the boat just capsized.

126
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,303
I-I I don't… How did that…

127
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,222
<i>I don't know all the details.</i>

128
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,267
They were moving it
and… …and, uh…

129
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,563
the boat sank and it seems
some of the men died.

130
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,857
No, I… Look, I don't care who died.

131
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,984
What about everything we found?

132
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,361
Well, the thing is
the boat caught on fire.

133
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,407
It all sank. Pottery's gone.

134
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,577
You're a fucking moron, aren't you?
What the hell do you mean, "It all sank"?

135
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,913
<i>You've done nothing</i>
<i>but lose everything and kill people!</i>

136
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,540
Things are bad enough
with my husband awake

137
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,709
and now I have to deal with your failure!

138
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,252
<i>I'm coming down myself.</i>

139
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,588
Do whatever it takes to find it all.
Are we clear?

140
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,304
This bitch is crazy.

141
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,388
Hey.

142
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,765
Yes?

143
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,269
Get my bag.
I'll be out of town for a few days.

144
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,854
Mokpo? Is that right?

145
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,564
Mm-hmm.

146
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,484
Pack me some comfortable clothes.
And underwear.

147
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:28,985
Yes, ma'am.

148
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,910
Fucking hell. We're all screwed.

149
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,036
Daesik.

150
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,039
Oh! Oh, you're back!

151
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,291
Hey, what… What's with your eye?

152
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,628
Well, Professor Kim
showed up a couple of nights ago,

153
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,296
and that asshole wasn't alone.

154
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,840
The thugs he had with him beat
the shit out of me and tied me up too.

155
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,425
Kim showed up here?

156
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,428
Yeah! Not only that,
he took every fucking thing we had found.

157
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,556
I know they headed over
to Captain Hwang's boat,

158
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,767
but what happened after,
I'm not really sure.

159
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,019
What about the Jeungdo shed?

160
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,105
Don't even get me started on that.

161
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,273
The fuzz walked in
and rounded up everyone.

162
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,943
The whole thing was a total shit show.

163
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,320
The police even arrested
the villagers there!

164
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,741
Still though,
I'm glad I ran into you.

165
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,451
Oh, where's Heedong?

166
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,203
Hey, hold on!

167
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,539
- I gotta go back. Back to Seoul.
- What?

168
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,165
-Oh, seriously.
-Hey, wait. Wait up.

169
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,000
-So… so, then what's the new plan?
-Look.

170
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,128
It's obvious everything's
gone to shit, all right?

171
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,713
So try and avoid the cops
and save your own ass.

172
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,008
-What about my cut?
-How the hell should I know?

173
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:35,760
-Fucking idiot.
-What? That's bullshit. What…

174
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,638
- All right. Just go.
- Hey, come on, man. What the hell.

175
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,225
Gwanseok. What the fuck?
Gwanseok, you asshole.

176
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,853
You son of a bitch! Fuck you, man!

177
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,523
You fucking rat! Son of a bitch!

178
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,417
Tell the chairman I'm going out of town
to visit a friend.

179
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,918
I'll be gone for a few days.

180
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,086
Okay.

181
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,057
What?

182
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,857
We're from the National Police.
Charges got filed.

183
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,275
What?

184
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,153
It's all here, ma'am.

185
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,237
"ARREST WARRANT"

186
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,572
A warrant for the chairman.

187
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,115
Is he at home right now?

188
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,491
Wait. What's this about?

189
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,327
Seems the chairman was falsifying records,

190
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,621
plus disguised bestowals
through executives,

191
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,290
falsified loan reports
violating debt freeze measures,

192
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,376
and also ten wrongful termination claims

193
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,921
that a few of his former executives
made against him.

194
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,422
You're the chairman's wife?

195
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,508
What? Oh, no.

196
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,678
Are you not Mrs. Yang?

197
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,265
Not at all…
…I'm actually a friend of hers.

198
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,808
I was just visiting.

199
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,394
- Thank you.
- Okay.

200
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,855
Hope you have a good day!

201
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,237
- Let's head inside.
- Yes, sir.

202
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,197
Oh. No, wait! Please wait!

203
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,407
You can't just barge in like that!

204
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,451
Please, I said wait!

205
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,170
Wait.
You can't just open that…

206
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,506
What's going on here?

207
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,424
Who the hell are you people?

208
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,761
The National Police Headquarters sent us.

209
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,681
National Police? What brings you here?

210
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,140
And who are you?

211
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,225
Right.

212
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,229
Namdaemun Police, Detective Choi Donggeun.

213
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,233
Well, we're with a warrant
on suspicion of tax evasion.

214
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,317
Tax evasion?

215
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,070
All right, well, how much are we talking…

216
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,655
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't a lot.

217
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,826
Check the safe and the study too.
As well as the cabinets and the closet.

218
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,035
-Yes, sir.
-I'll check the study.

219
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,370
What the hell is this?

220
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,789
I can't believe it.
I mean, what do we do now?

221
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,791
Give me a second.

222
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,626
Hey, hey, you. Yeah.

223
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,586
Where's the chairman's wife?

224
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,463
- Oh, I'm not sure.
- Wait a minute.

225
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,257
You know the chairman's doctor, right?

226
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,385
-You mean Dr. Kim Byeongseok?
-Yeah, that's him. That's the guy.

227
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,636
What hospital is he at?

228
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,929
Yulseong Hospital.

229
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,180
- Yulseong?
- Yulseong?

230
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:28,433
Let's go.

231
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,518
All right, yeah.

232
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,187
- Hello? Cheon residence.
- Shit.

233
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,149
-Can I speak to Mrs. Yang, please?
-<i>No one's home right now.</i>

234
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,525
Not home? Then where is she?

235
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,193
I said, nobody's here right now.

236
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,653
Oh, okay, okay then.

237
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,989
In that case, tell her it's urgent.

238
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,866
Tell her that Song called,
Song from Insa-dong.

239
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,200
Things are crazy right now.

240
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,327
The police are here
and they're tearing the place apart.

241
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,662
Why are they there?

242
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,831
They told me that the chairman
did something illegal.

243
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,375
Hey, lady. Who are you on the phone with?

244
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,710
<i>No, I…</i>

245
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,545
Are you still there? Hello, ma'am?

246
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:01,299
What's going on?

247
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,011
Looks like things are going crazy
over there too.

248
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,389
I think something's gone wrong
with the Chairman now.

249
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,184
Oh, geez. The chairman's our backer.
Not good.

250
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,602
So now what?

251
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,812
You've gotta be kidding me with this shit.

252
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,857
Still haven't heard from Gwanseok.
And we got robbed in Jeungdo.

253
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,901
We just might be fucked here, man.

254
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,028
Let's go to Muan
instead of just sitting here.

255
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,988
We've got to check
if the pottery is missing or not.

256
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,406
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- Let's go.

257
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,034
Hang on now. If we're clearin' out,
we're gonna need a truck.

258
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,827
Wait. Why do we need a truck?

259
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,162
Hey, Madam Jang.

260
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,914
You seen Park, the truck driver, lately?

261
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,165
Park?

262
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,792
He's usually here in the afternoon.

263
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,503
In that case,
let's just grab any car and go.

264
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,838
- We're burning daylight here.
- All right.

265
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,715
- Oh, and Hwang?
- Yeah?

266
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,384
-There's something I wanted to ask you.
-What are you doing?

267
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,803
- Wait. What?
- Yeah. It's… Uh…

268
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,639
You know, the guys who came
from outta Seoul?

269
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,059
The taller one, real pretty looking.
You know the one, don't you?

270
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,686
-Hey, you thinking that's…
-That's, uh… Heedong?

271
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,939
Where is he at?
I wanna kill him for what he's done.

272
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,690
Why? What happened?

273
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,985
You're not gonna believe
how much that asshole swindled me!

274
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,446
He took Seonja for this much.

275
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,823
You see this.

276
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,908
Looks like a million won here, doesn't it?

277
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:11,536
I counted it myself, it's 800.

278
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,747
That little shit
skimmed 200,000 off the top!

279
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,124
Heedong was here?

280
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,416
That's what I said!

281
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,378
He came here yesterday and threw
a temper tantrum while taking Seonja.

282
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,463
Oh, that asshole's raising
all kinds of hell around town.

283
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,340
Everywhere you look, it's a damn mess.

284
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,883
What are we still doing here?

285
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,343
-Yeah, let's go.
-No, wait just a minute.

286
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,053
-No. What are you doing?
-Gimme a minute I said.

287
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,721
-Who are you calling? Huh?
-Shit.

288
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,268
Ah, come on. We've got no time to waste.

289
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,480
Hey, it's Tiger. Yeah, you awake?

290
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,193
Do me a favor. Rent a truck from Park
and get your ass to Muan.

291
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,988
Yeah. We talked about this already.

292
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,949
Oh, and also,
come with muscle and weapons.

293
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,411
Yeah. Anythin' you can use
to kick ass with, all right?

294
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,997
And step on the damn gas. Okay?

295
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,498
- Let's go.
- Hurry, hurry.

296
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,184
YULSEONG HOSPITAL

297
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,857
Get rid of everything here.

298
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,568
Actually, instead of that,
take everything here and burn it at home.

299
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,778
-Even your notes?
-Yeah, burn it all.

300
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,489
And listen.
I'll call you when you can come back.

301
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,574
What?

302
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,035
They'll find out about our illegal
treatments if they just dig a little.

303
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:35,870
Stop right there.

304
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,207
What'd I just say! Don't move!

305
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,292
What do you think
you're trying to pull here?

306
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,420
You Chairman Cheon's doctor?

307
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,256
Sorry?

308
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,426
You and his wife gave him
the wrong drugs, yeah?

309
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,929
I don't know
what you're talking about--

310
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,722
Shit.

311
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,974
Wow, let's check this out.

312
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:00,186
So you were all cleanin' house here,
huh? Getting rid of the evidence?

313
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,605
Wait, Detective. I think you're confused--

314
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,856
Shut your mouth!

315
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,692
If you got something to say,
say it at the station.

316
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,985
-Take him away.
-All right, let's go.

317
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,320
Y-You've got it all wrong.

318
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,322
-Just shut up!
-No, it's not--

319
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,074
- Hey.
- Hey, bring her too.

320
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,368
- Let's go. Come on.
- Hey! Shut the hell up and move.

321
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,246
I don't know anything…
Okay, I get it.

322
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,710
- Man, you're really something.
- What do you mean?

323
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,547
You know. The way you got
those assholes to take the fakes.

324
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,218
Now how the hell did you come up
with that right then and there?

325
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,554
That was damn genius.

326
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,765
Listen, after everything we went through,
no way I'm just gonna roll over.

327
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,018
You're damn right.
No way he's takin' our pottery.

328
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,938
"Our pottery"? What are you saying?

329
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,815
Why? Is something wrong?

330
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,484
I thought you were only getting paid
for the work you've done already?

331
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,319
-Huh?
-You fuckin' kiddin' me?

332
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,697
You think we'd be goin' through
all this for a check?

333
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,616
What are you, an idiot?
Course each of us is gettin' a share.

334
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,119
Was that the deal
you made with Gwanseok?

335
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:02,290
Look, you think I'd get blood
on my hands for some chump change?

336
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,876
Say that again and I'll chop
your hands up. Put 'em in my seafood.

337
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:07,920
What do you mean, "blood"?

338
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,215
Just pretend you didn't hear.

339
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,762
Anyway, what are we gonna do
if Gwanseok has really ripped us off? Huh?

340
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:24,020
In that case,
we fuck everything up.

341
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,034
Ugh, what did I tell you?

342
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,328
The lock's all busted!

343
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,746
- Ah, shit.
- That bastard broke in!

344
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,789
- Open it.
- What the fuck.

345
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,000
Yeah, used a hammer on it, for sure.

346
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,969
- Shit.
- Fuck me, just look at this shit.

347
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,222
He took everything. He took it all.

348
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:04,602
Fuck, we did all the dirty work,
for someone else to cash in.

349
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,811
Look, still a few here.

350
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,105
He didn't take everything.
More over here too.

351
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,566
These are all junk.
Not worth anything.

352
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,235
Look at that.
All scratched-up and chipped.

353
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,863
Damn.

354
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,949
Wait a minute.

355
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,995
Hey, this one ain't bad.

356
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,790
This one looks good.
I think it could sell.

357
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:28,542
Look here. Is this one worth anything?

358
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,211
Oh, yeah, nice.

359
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,005
That one's good. Condition's all right.

360
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,465
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

361
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,050
Let's gather what we can
and get out of here.

362
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,718
-We need to find Gwanseok.
-Sounds good.

363
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,178
-All right.
-Hey, that crate there.

364
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,180
Uh-huh.

365
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,973
Let's move it all over here.

366
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,934
- Over here. It does.
- This one looks good too.

367
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,646
- Oh, come on. What now?
- Is that Gwanseok?

368
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,898
Hey, Gwanseok, is that you?

369
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,406
Kim. What are you doing here?

370
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,657
Hey.

371
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,786
You shouldn't be so handsy
with someone else's things.

372
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,497
What are you talking about?
None of this belongs to you.

373
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,625
You tried to steal our shit,
and now you're…

374
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,254
What the hell?

375
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,423
Something ain't…

376
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,092
Oh, shit.

377
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,721
-Fuck. You asshole…
-You motherfucker.

378
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,181
Yeongsu.

379
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,349
- Hey.
- Wait.

380
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:12,480
Do it. I know that was your last bullet,
you son of a bitch.

381
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,649
Let's go, you motherfucker…

382
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,495
Wait.

383
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,913
Wait a minute.

384
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,582
Now, hold on.

385
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,542
Thanks to your quick thinking,

386
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,420
I ended up with a boat
full of fakes, didn't I?

387
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,423
There were actually
some real ones in there.

388
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,758
Yeah?

389
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:45,221
Well, I'm afraid
they're at the bottom of the sea now.

390
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:49,975
And here you are,
digging through the trash that was left.

391
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,228
H-Hey, hey, hey. Just put that down.

392
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,064
And just take everything here, all right?

393
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,857
Take a deep breath.

394
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:00,069
I-I-I-I'm not even here.
I didn't see anything.

395
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:04,740
Fine.

396
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,451
All right.

397
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,298
Did Ma feed the cows
like she was supposed to, you reckon?

398
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,926
Sure she did. I'm betting it's fine.

399
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,763
The hell's that smoke?

400
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,057
Shit, man. Looks like a fire.

401
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,560
That's where Yeongsu
told us to meet, ain't it?

402
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,436
I reckon it is.

403
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,815
What's with this dumbass?

404
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,067
Hey, hit the horn.

405
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,325
Hey, back the fuck up, asshole.

406
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,956
This fucking guy.

407
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,377
Hey, that car,
I think it came from over there.

408
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,171
You think?

409
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:06,427
Oh, shit.

410
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,308
Look at that. It's a Busan plate.

411
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,602
What's he doing
all the way out here?

412
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,230
Were you just over there?

413
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,315
I wasn't.

414
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,817
Bullshit. You sure about that?

415
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,945
You wouldn't know anything
about that fire, would you?

416
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,450
You say fire? Oh, you're right.

417
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,119
Will you look at that?

418
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,623
Hey.

419
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,707
Yeah?

420
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,086
Shit.

421
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,006
Hey, why don't you get out
of the car. Huh?

422
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,217
What's the problem, fellas?
Let's not do this.

423
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,728
Hey, sir! Behind you! Over there! Look!

424
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,610
Get the fuck outta the car right now.
I ain't asking again.

425
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,320
-What the…
-Don't fuck with me.

426
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,280
Get your asses outta here!

427
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,074
Back up, assholes!

428
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,825
Crazy son of a bitch!

429
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,747
Whoa! Shit!

430
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,682
Oh, I'm fucked!

431
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,940
- Where's my gun?
- You crazy fuck.

432
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,817
Come on asshole, open up.

433
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,860
Fucking bastard.

434
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,158
HEUNGBAEK CORPORATION INC.

435
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,036
Keep it running.

436
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,080
Wait, again?

437
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,499
I need to sleep!

438
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,876
You're killing me. Seriously!

439
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,676
Sorry about that.

440
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,892
The chairman's office
is on 12, right?

441
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,562
Uh… Yeah, I think so.

442
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,564
You didn't make sure?

443
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,025
Uh… No, I'm sorry.

444
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,403
The chairman's on the sixth floor.

445
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,280
Oh, really? Sixth floor.

446
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,205
Appreciate it.

447
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,385
Hey. Who are you? Hey.

448
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:54,470
Chairman Cheon.

449
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,013
-Sir! It's Oh Gwanseok!
-Are you crazy?

450
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,348
- Get the hell out of here!
- Mokpo. You sent me there.

451
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,433
Don't you remember?

452
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,601
-We met at Seoul station!
-Get out.

453
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,187
Get off me.
Get off. Sir.

454
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,813
- Get the hell off!
- Fucking asshole.

455
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,190
Hey.

456
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,614
I heard you were having trouble
with your health, sir.

457
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,240
Glad you're better.

458
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:17,493
Uh, so, Chairman,

459
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,788
the police are on their way up,
so I'm gonna cut to the chase.

460
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:25,542
There's a gold mine.
An absolutely huge fortune down in Mokpo.

461
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,797
Easy pickings. I just…
I just need some help with funds.

462
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,343
We know what we're doing now.
In one week, we can get it all pulled out.

463
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,304
How'd it go with Jeonchul, though?

464
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,016
-Sir?
-Did you take care of it like I asked?

465
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,519
Uh, yes, I took care of him.

466
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:46,105
I guess nobody told you yet.

467
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,815
How'd you take care of it, then?

468
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,818
He drowned, sir. An accident while diving.

469
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,320
I'm certain no one will find him.

470
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,240
We made sure of that.

471
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,701
So he finally met his fate.

472
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,496
The sorry bastard.

473
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,545
Sir, we don't have time for this.
The police are on their way.

474
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,838
One more job.

475
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,465
You think you might be up for it?

476
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,342
What is it?

477
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,553
I need you to take care of my wife.

478
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,596
If you do,

479
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:24,393
whatever you still got,
I will take it all.

480
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,772
- It's here, sir.
- Hey!

481
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,608
Cheon Hwangsik.

482
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:38,031
You, sir, are being placed under arrest
for tax evasion and embezzlement.

483
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,993
Do it.

484
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,498
Is this really necessary?

485
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,501
Just take him.

486
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,044
Let's go.

487
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,057
Listen.
I won't stay in there long, all right?

488
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,435
I'll talk to you once I'm out.

489
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,859
Take this clown as well.

490
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,361
Yes, sir.
All right. Let's go.

491
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,329
<i>Heungbaek's Hwangsik has been arrested.</i>
<i>Following his arrest,</i>

492
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,915
<i>the police conducted a search</i>
<i>and seizure at his home.</i>

493
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,833
<i>Cheon is currently being investigated</i>

494
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,587
<i>after authorities were tipped off</i>
<i>about possible large scale tax evasion.</i>

495
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,965
<i>In addition, Cheon is under suspicion</i>
<i>for using company executives</i>

496
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,009
<i>to create billions in slush funds</i>

497
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,596
<i>as well dispersing company shares</i>
<i>to siphon off massive profits.</i>

498
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,264
I guess that's it.

499
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,850
-It's all over.
-<i>…he violated the August 3 debt freeze</i>

500
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,894
<i>measures</i>
<i>by falsifying private loan records…</i>

501
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,356
Hey, you should ask
that politician to help you?

502
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,858
He must have dirt
he wants to get rid of too!

503
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,446
The company's drowning in debt.

504
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,533
Trying to buy land for the school
was a mess from the beginning.

505
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,496
Now that the loans are frozen,
we can't even pay what we owe.

506
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,707
Now our partners are going to drown too.

507
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:14,795
It's over. Everything is.

508
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:19,841
I'm so sorry. How could this happen?

509
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,888
Oh. Who's calling at this hour?

510
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,894
Hi, I'm sorry, can I call you back later?

511
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,356
Give me one second.

512
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,608
It's for you. Come pick it up.

513
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,569
Hurry. It's Heedong.

514
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,577
<i>I need you to take care of my wife.</i>

515
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:53,583
<i>If you do, whatever you've still got,</i>
<i>I will take it all.</i>

516
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,839
Oh Gwanseok, you're out.

517
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,717
Out? Why?

518
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,386
You're released. You can go now.

519
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,470
I can just go?

520
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:06,680
Oh, what? You want to stay?

521
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,809
Oh, no, no, no. Hey, whoa,
whoa. Ah, thank you very much.

522
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,977
I'll see you guys later.

523
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:19,401
So, uh, what's going on with Cheon's wife?

524
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,737
Well, we're still looking for her.

525
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,157
Why? Something you wanna say?
You know something we don't?

526
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,159
I don't know anything.

527
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,287
Why's that?
She doing something shady?

528
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,915
Well, apparently, she and Cheon's doctor
were messing with his meds.

529
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

530
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,836
But that's not really our business.

531
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,713
That's a whole separate case.

532
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,423
- What were they up to--
- Hey, let's go.

533
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,550
- Just go.
- Come on. Tell me.

534
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,261
Just uh… okay.

535
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,514
MAY, COUNTERESPIONAGE
AND ANTI-COMMUNISM MONTH

536
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,446
What do I do now?

537
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,043
Get in.

538
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,214
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite you.

539
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,381
Get in.

540
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,933
All right. Where do you live?

541
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,768
That's none of your business.

542
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,605
What now?

543
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,482
Hmm?

544
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,734
Uh…

545
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,530
Let's go.

546
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,602
Who are you?

547
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,188
I should be asking you that.

548
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,441
Ah. Coffee shop girl.

549
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,360
She's a friend.

550
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,241
She's gonna buy our pottery.

551
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:32,909
"Our pottery"?

552
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:36,246
Yeah. Is there a problem here?

553
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,293
No, let me see it then.

554
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,112
Wait, is this real?

555
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:11,239
What, you think that's fake?

556
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,284
But didn't all the pieces sink?

557
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,493
What do you mean?

558
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:18,330
Your uncle called.
Told me the pottery was in the ocean.

559
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,916
He said
the boat that was carrying it went down.

560
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:23,585
What are you saying?

561
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,253
This is everything we dug out.

562
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:38,516
Either way, I'm not taking it
until it's been appraised.

563
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,103
I'll take the truck, get them looked at
tomorrow. I'll pay you after that.

564
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,605
No way, you pay first.

565
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,273
Appraisal comes first.

566
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,525
Forget it then.

567
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,778
You're not the only one
I can sell this to.

568
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,949
You'll be arrested.
This stuff can't be sold in our country

569
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,327
because it's a national treasure.
I have connections to politicians.

570
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,703
I'm good.

571
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,124
It was all over the news,
so the cops know about it.

572
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,292
You need me to sell it.

573
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:09,172
I owe you a million, right?
That should cover it.

574
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,674
Let's go.

575
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,178
You're going to disappoint your uncle.

576
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,264
We're not partners anymore.

577
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,934
Look. Give me the pottery,
and I'll sell it.

578
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,435
And we'll split the earnings in half.

579
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,980
Pay first or I'm out.
Those are the terms here.

580
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,482
You think I'm lying?

581
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,651
Yeah.

582
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,244
I wouldn't lie to my child's father.

583
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,886
You live here?

584
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,806
Yeah.

585
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,269
There's 20 million in there.

586
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,902
It's about time
you started living a decent life.

587
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,370
That's where she's hiding out.

588
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,914
Get the job done.

589
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,459
Why not just do it yourself?

590
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,839
It's what the Chairman wanted.
I'm just following orders.

591
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:37,761
I imagine killing is not all that easy.

592
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,014
Especially someone like her.

593
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,058
It isn't, is it?

594
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,567
Don't even think about running.

595
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,946
'Cause I'll be watching.

596
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,000
What are you doing?

597
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,211
What's this?

598
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,884
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

599
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,429
We need to get out of here now.
Say nothing to the kids.

600
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:03,555
Just pack a suitcase.

601
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,349
Only pack what's important. Got it?

602
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,768
-Why, what's going on?
-Listen, just do it!

603
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:12,188
As soon as I get back we're out.
Understand?

604
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:13,982
Yeah.

605
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,483
Here.

606
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,651
Keep it safe.

607
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:19,988
I'll keep it safe.

608
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,322
I'll be right back.

609
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,442
- Could you give us the room?
- Sure.

610
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,627
YANG JUNGSOOK

611
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,837
THE PATIENT IS 2 WEEKS
AND 3 DAYS PREGNANT

612
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:24,761
Well, uh… how do I know it's mine?

613
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:27,722
You really are the worst.

614
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,265
Don't worry.

615
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,518
It's not like
I'm asking for anything here.

616
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,562
I can take care of the kid alone.

617
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,775
And just think about it.

618
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,235
I paid for everything.

619
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,488
And now you're saying it all belongs
to you? Doesn't sound fair.

620
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,283
- All right.
- Sit down.

621
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,787
-I've got nothing else to say here.
-I said, sit down!

622
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,505
This is just a deposit.

623
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,884
After it's sold,
I'll be glad to pay the rest.

624
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,931
That much you can do, right?

625
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,184
It's not like
I'm asking for a handout. Hmm?

626
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,023
I haven't slept in days.

627
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:23,027
I'm angry.
It's all so hurtful and upsetting.

628
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:28,283
I need that pottery at all costs.
I'm hopeless without it.

629
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,372
Look, I'm sorry.

630
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,165
I'm gonna forget what you said tonight.

631
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,836
You did help me when I needed it.

632
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,259
You can have the pottery,
just give me another 10.

633
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,470
There's a few hundred million worth
just sitting in that truck, take it.

634
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,140
I mean, you said
you knew how to sell it, right?

635
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,017
So what's 10 million?

636
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,230
All right.

637
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,358
One question.

638
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,111
You really never had feelings for me?

639
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,492
I know what we were.
You still never imagined a future?

640
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,829
The future wasn't something
I thought about.

641
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,956
Now there's someone
I want to take care of.

642
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,041
Who?

643
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,043
The girl outside?

644
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,588
Stupid boy.

645
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:26,591
You don't have a clue how the world works.

646
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,012
Yeah. I realized I like things that way.

647
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,015
MARILYN

648
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,937
Holy moly.

649
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,982
I know it's a store in Seoul,
but dang it's fancy as heck.

650
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,686
Well, well, well…

651
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,232
All my favorite people in one place.

652
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,819
Hey.

653
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,239
You couldn't do any better than this?

654
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,334
All right, now.

655
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,879
Heedong.
You and Mrs. Yang get in the truck.

656
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,715
Why?

657
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,092
Gotta finish what we started.

658
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,885
The three of us.

659
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:55,346
We're not going anywhere.
Let's just do this here.

660
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,431
Mrs. Yang.

661
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,975
You know you're wanted by the police.

662
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,560
You sure you want to stay here?

663
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,524
Earlier today, I saw Chairman Cheon.

664
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,361
They arrested him, you know?
I'm sure you do.

665
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:13,406
And the police?
They're dying to know where you are.

666
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,745
They could show up here any minute,
so get in the truck.

667
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,496
We can talk on the way.

668
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,125
And where would you be taking us?
You're kind of scaring me.

669
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,044
"Scaring me."

670
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:27,962
You'll see when we get there.
You can drive.

671
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,259
I'll finish this quick.
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

672
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,220
Be careful.

673
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:40,600
Give it a rest.

674
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,643
Let's go.

675
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,482
Call the police if I don't return.

676
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,108
Mm-hmm. Just be careful, okay?

677
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,277
Let's go.

678
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,572
Over here.

679
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,791
Hey, help her up.

680
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,672
All right.

681
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,724
Ma'am, should we follow them?

682
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,518
Let's go.

683
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,480
- You can catch up after.
- Right.

684
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,785
Hey, Mom. Where are we headed?

685
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,495
No questions. Just get dressed.

686
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,627
Honey, is that you?

687
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,716
My…

688
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,885
Who are you?

689
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,346
Oh, hi. There was a hiccup
with the delivery earlier.

690
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,098
What? Oh…

691
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,523
Where are you headed?

692
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,526
Nowhere.

693
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,792
Why are you taking us so far uphill?

694
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:32,879
You'll know when we get there.

695
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,259
Wow, Oh Heedong.

696
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,721
You know you've really gone
and disappointed me this time.

697
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,639
But you know what, I get it.

698
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,808
I know why you did it.

699
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,687
You're not a kid anymore, Heedong.

700
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,149
You gotta do what you think is right,
so who am I to say anything.

701
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,484
This is it.

702
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,361
After this, we're done.

703
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,489
Good luck out there.

704
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,788
8033RD BATTALION
RESTRICTED ACCESS

705
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,629
Stop here.

706
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,008
All right, let's get out.

707
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,178
Fresh air.

708
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,597
Okay.

709
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,349
Uh…

710
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:28,226
Are we even allowed to be here?

711
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,436
Course we're not. Here.

712
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,938
- Oh! What?
- Right this way.

713
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,482
Uncle! What are you doing?

714
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,775
Stop, let go!

715
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,026
- All right.
- What's going on?

716
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,986
- Stay back.
- Uncle, wait!

717
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,238
Mrs. Yang.

718
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,406
You killed yourself here tonight.

719
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,451
Your husband got arrested,
and your company's crashing.

720
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,828
Your life got too hard,
and you decided to end it.

721
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,830
-What?
-Are you crazy? What are you doing?

722
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,540
-Stop.
-Stay back Heedong! You hear me?

723
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,125
You think I'm bluffing? Huh?

724
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,460
-Wait, wait. Uncle, please.
-Come on.

725
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,795
Try me, you little shit.

726
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:56,879
Calm down.

727
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:58,339
No, stay back! Stay back!

728
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,674
All-All right. All right.

729
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,385
Why are you doing this?

730
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,678
Let's just talk it out.

731
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,180
Talk? About what?

732
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:08,724
You still don't get it, do you?

733
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,019
You thought
Jeonchul's death was suspicious.

734
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,896
You're right.

735
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,233
Your husband ordered it.
Guess what else he ordered me to do?

736
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,735
You can't mean…

737
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:20,820
Come on.

738
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,989
He wanted to get rid of you,

739
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,283
- just like Jeonchul!
- Wait!

740
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:29,870
One of the factory sites is mine
under law.

741
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:35,084
If you let me go now, it's yours.
I'll transfer the title to you.

742
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:41,799
You're still not done yet.

743
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,177
My husband doesn't know.
I've got land and money stashed away.

744
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,346
I'll take the pottery too.

745
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:49,598
Get the pottery out of your fucking head!

746
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,143
'Cause that's all ours? All right?
You get it?

747
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,938
-All right, I get it.
-Shit.

748
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,648
Can you…

749
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:02,361
Can you say how much you're getting?
How much is he paying?

750
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,113
That's none of your business.

751
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:07,158
I'm just curious.
How much did he say I'm worth exactly?

752
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,868
-Just shut up, it's none of your business!
-No, stop!

753
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,953
Wait! I can…

754
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,123
I can match it. Double. No, I--

755
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,250
Triple what you're getting now.

756
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,919
Just kill that asshole instead.

757
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,797
Look, I'll pay you right now.

758
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:28,346
I mean it. I've got the money!

759
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,641
The company's dirty money, I got it.
All the slush funds.

760
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,394
Uh-huh?

761
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,482
Go on.

762
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,900
Get on with it

763
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,778
Come on.

764
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:48,449
Don't even listen to her shit!
She'll say anything to save herself.

765
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,825
The hell are you?

766
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:52,578
The chairman sent me with a message.

767
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,122
He has a position at the company.

768
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,916
As soon as he gets out,
you can work there!

769
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,501
Shit.

770
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,337
He said he'll buy the pottery,
anything you want to sell to him.

771
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,505
That's a damn lie!

772
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,925
You already know what he's like.

773
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,593
He'll only throw you away,

774
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,637
like he did with me.

775
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:13,808
What the…

776
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,393
Don't do this uncle, please!

777
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:22,233
Hey. What the hell is this shit?

778
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,777
That girl admitted
to stealing the chairman's assets!

779
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,904
We're taking the pottery as collateral.

780
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,155
Get the hell out!

781
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,162
What are you doing? Push her off now!

782
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,716
Heedong.

783
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,801
Damn it.

784
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:55,182
- Get out, you son of a bitch!
- Shit.

785
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:34,722
Shit.

786
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,902
Stop right there!

787
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,778
And just where do you think you're going?

788
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:40,704
Uncle. Uncle.

789
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,668
Ah, shit.

790
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,549
-Uncle.
-Are you okay?

791
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,050
Yeah.

792
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,135
Ah! Get a rock! Rock!

793
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,554
Wedge it under the tire!

794
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,975
Oh, fuck!

795
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,061
- Come on!
- There.

796
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,230
Move. Move, move.

797
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,701
Ah, shit.

798
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,249
What are you… Huh?

799
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,794
Hey, what are you doing?

800
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,798
- Just hang on.
- That's too dangerous!

801
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,008
Just hang on.

802
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,470
Come on, let's just go.

803
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:40,180
-Here, take this!
-Uncle.

804
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,435
Just get down, it's not worth it!

805
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,061
Heedong,

806
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,564
didn't I promise that
I would get you a huge house.

807
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:49,940
Forget about that, you gotta get down!

808
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,650
Please, Uncle!

809
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:06,498
Heedong.

810
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,510
Uncle!

811
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,909
Oh, shit.

812
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,669
Uncle!

813
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,839
Uncle!

814
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,759
Uncle!

815
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:27,955
Seonja…

816
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,338
Excuse me?

817
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:38,799
What the… What?

818
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,134
Hey, are you all right?

819
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,678
Sir! Do need help, are you hurt?

820
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,432
<i>In the end, the pottery went</i>
<i>back to where it belonged.</i>

821
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,059
<i>From the bottom of the sea to the soil.</i>

822
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,187
<i>Back where it was meant to be.</i>

823
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,106
Stay with me!

824
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:55,733
<i>Same as us.</i>

825
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,658
JUNGANG INN

826
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:05,826
Jungsook.

827
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,454
You sure this is okay?

828
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:11,790
It's okay.

829
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,252
They wouldn't look for me here.
Not in a place like this.

830
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,232
At least there's a TV in the room.

831
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,568
It's a real mess, though.

832
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:43,947
Let's turn it on then.

833
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:45,657
So we can watch the news.

834
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:49,244
You won't see anything good.

835
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,913
You should rest.

836
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:56,919
Oh, hey. Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?

837
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,754
No, I should sleep instead.

838
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,215
I'll see you in the morning then?

839
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,425
Mmm… All right.

840
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,344
Good night.

841
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,565
Where is she?

842
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:02,776
I dropped her off at the inn.

843
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:04,987
She's sleeping now.

844
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,196
Room number?

845
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,282
Hey.

846
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:10,450
Did the chairman himself make this call?

847
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,412
Don't make me ask again.

848
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,665
Number nine.

849
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:21,670
Time to give her a proper farewell.

850
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,714
Yes, sir.

851
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,263
Oh. Hi, Mr. Kim.

852
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,931
Sorry for the late night call.

853
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:34,766
It's me Yang Jungsook from Heungbaek.

854
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:36,143
<i>Yes. Hello, Mrs. Yang.</i>

855
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:39,062
You saw the news already, I bet.

856
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,064
I was hoping I could ask you a favor.

857
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:42,983
I'm in a bit of a tough spot right now.

858
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,067
<i>What favor?</i>

859
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,488
I need an American visa
as soon as possible, you see.

860
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,533
Of course I'll pay you for it, so…

861
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,621
Uh… Mr. Kim?

862
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,539
Are you there, hello?

863
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:32,157
1 YEAR LATER

864
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:39,289
APPRAISAL

865
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,751
Hi, sir. Welcome.

866
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:46,838
-Good afternoon.
-Yes?

867
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:48,298
I've got a piece to sell.

868
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,633
What have you got there?

869
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,851
This is… Where did you get this?

870
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,478
I got this one from Sinan.

871
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:04,481
Yeah, but how did you
get your hands on it?

872
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,942
I thought
the government was watching this.

873
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:09,444
I guess some looters left it behind
or somethin'.

874
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,864
Okay… Well, then… This is worthless.

875
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:15,534
What? This is supposed to be worth a lot.

876
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,786
The thing is you'll get caught
if you try to sell it.

877
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:21,289
The pottery's government property.
The cops will grab you.

878
00:58:21,373 --> 00:58:24,376
If you had taken it anywhere else,
they would've called it in.

879
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,961
You should count your lucky stars.

880
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:27,921
The truth is

881
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,923
I'm a police officer.

882
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:32,718
So you're a cop?
That mean you won't get nabbed, huh?

883
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:36,304
Buddy cop or not,
you don't realize how serious this is.

884
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:39,641
Get outta here. I'm not gettin'
myself arrested. No way, sir!

885
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:40,726
Wait.

886
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,271
You had a boy, yeah?

887
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:45,939
Deoksan?

888
00:58:47,149 --> 00:58:49,276
What? How do you know?

889
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,319
Look. I've tried to sell this all over.

890
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,030
Listen. Nobody wants to touch this now.

891
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,366
I came all the way here because

892
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,453
I knew your son,
and he told me about your store.

893
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,371
That boy.

894
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:04,082
You came to my store from Mokpo for that?

895
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,376
Fine. Leave it here.

896
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,295
I can't promise you anything.

897
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,214
Check in a month. Six weeks.
We'll see if it's sold.

898
00:59:11,298 --> 00:59:12,758
I appreciate this, ma'am. I mean it.

899
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,136
Hey, wait a sec.

900
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,766
What about Deoksan?
What's the story there?

901
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,101
Can you tell us anything?

902
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,896
-Were you involved in that at all?
-I wouldn't know.

903
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,635
Hi, it's Granny Yang!
How are you doing, sir?

904
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,137
The reason I called…

905
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,973
Oh… Chairman have I got good news for ya.

906
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:07,229
Well have you heard about
the sunken treasure off Sinan's coast?

907
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,898
Oh, my goodness.

908
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,067
Crazy people like this still exist?

909
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,318
What's that, sir?

910
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:18,406
Sinan, you know that treasure ship that
sunk off the coast there.

911
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,952
Look. Even the poor villagers got
dragged into digging for treasure.

912
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,036
"SINAN RELICS BRINGING DISASTER"

913
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,120
Interesting.

914
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:25,914
Seonja.

915
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,458
-You're from Mokpo, right?
-Yeah.

916
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,001
You know about the treasure ship there?

917
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,672
I'm not too familiar with it.

918
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:38,260
"Local residents were looting the site
when a coast guard boat arrived.

919
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,846
And they abandoned a diver underwater
causing his death.

920
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,597
The deceased diver's family,

921
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,475
including his sister, her husband,
and his wife's brother,

922
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,519
are now wanted as accomplices.

923
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:50,856
The entire family is in ruins."

924
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,525
I think
I read something similar last year.

925
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:56,778
Right. There was a boat that sank
with some looters on it.

926
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,155
Nobody wants to work
for a living anymore.

927
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:00,907
We're living in crazy times.

928
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:05,203
Sir, the fabrics, do you think
I should take them to the factory today?

929
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,415
Mmm… Is that
the new pattern from yesterday?

930
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,041
-Yes.
-Yeah, send them over.

931
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,752
Oh. Let them know though,
the client's really thorough.

932
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:13,879
All right.

01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:19,217
HAECHANG TAILOR SHOP

934
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,264
- Hello there.
- Hi.

935
01:01:25,307 --> 01:01:26,683
I'm here to get something tailored.

936
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:29,102
Uh… What's it for?

937
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,229
A suit. Something stylish.

938
01:01:31,313 --> 01:01:34,024
Well, everything I make is stylish.

939
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,902
All right, this way, please.
I need to take your measurements.

940
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,280
Oh, wow.

941
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,574
Look at these shoulders, this is great.

942
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,909
Let's see here.

943
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:47,495
I'm thinking dark colors. Maybe
some stripes will look really sharp too.

944
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,664
Get me my tape measure.

945
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:51,374
And uh…
bring the catalog as well.

946
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:52,626
Yes, sir.

947
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,128
One moment, please.

948
01:01:57,297 --> 01:01:58,882
Are you okay?

949
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,134
Yeah, it's nothing.

950
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,511
It's not nothing.
What's wrong?

951
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,311
Uh… One moment.

952
01:02:55,939 --> 01:02:58,900
I've got shoes here!
Come buy some shoes!

953
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:00,819
Oh, hey. Look at you guys!

954
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:02,779
Come and take a look at these shoes I got.

955
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,072
How much are these?

956
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:06,449
Read today's news.

957
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,410
Read the news?

958
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:11,287
Read the news. Buy a…

959
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:13,707
Uh… Sir, could you buy a paper?

960
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,333
-How much?
-It's 20, sir.

961
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:16,418
-Twenty won?
-Yeah.

962
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,503
Here, keep the change.

963
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,296
-Much appreciated!
-Yeah, all right.

964
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,465
Read all today's news, only 20 won!

965
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,136
You never read the paper,
so why'd you get it?

966
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:27,220
Hey.

967
01:03:29,681 --> 01:03:31,683
Wow, look at all these people.

968
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:34,102
Seems like
everybody in the country moved to Seoul.

969
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:35,603
Huh?

970
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:38,148
What is it?

971
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,483
-Cheon got out.
-Who?

972
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:41,943
"CHEON HWANGSIK GRANTED PAROLE"

973
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,528
He was going to buy our pottery.

974
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,572
Wait, that lady's husband?

975
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,948
Yeah.

976
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:49,617
Growing up, I always heard that
the wealthy don't have to do time

977
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:51,036
like the poor folks do.

978
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:54,748
So where are we goin'?

979
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:56,207
To see someone.

980
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:57,292
Who?

981
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,544
Han introduced me to this guy.

982
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,255
I guess when it comes to antiques,
he's top dog.

983
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,049
Ain't you done with that though?

984
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,967
It ain't pottery, I reckon.

985
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,055
Not funny.
I've been tryin' to shake the accent.

986
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:16,269
LOW LIFE

987
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,924
A SERIES DIRECTED BY KANG YUNSUNG

988
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,427
GYEONGJU

989
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:50,595
Damn it.

990
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:51,888
Man, I'm exhausted.

991
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:57,018
Ah, shit. At this rate,
we'll be digging forever.

992
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,106
Who said Gyeongju's full of treasure
if you just dig?

993
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:05,693
What's this?
There's something in the way here.

994
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,654
What? That's granite I reckon.

995
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,989
Yeah, you're right.
It looks like the cornerstone.

996
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,449
All right, let me see.

997
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:16,538
Why the hell is a cornerstone
buried in a yard?

998
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,581
Dang, that ain't your average rock.

999
01:05:18,665 --> 01:05:20,542
Know what the real estate guy told me?

1000
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,670
He said that way back when,
there used to be a palace here.

1001
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:28,091
Shit. Of all the places we could've
picked, why did it have to be this one?

1002
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,760
I reckon
they didn't want to draw attention.

1003
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:36,432
Why do I hear yammerin'
when I should hear diggin'?

1004
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,102
Here.

1005
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,354
Is that a silky? Holy shit!

1006
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,148
I'll go boil it up.

1007
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:44,607
This really all you've done?

1008
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,609
Well, there's a lotta rocks here.

1009
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,570
That's bullshit.

1010
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,738
Keep at it.

1011
01:05:50,822 --> 01:05:52,532
Yapping ain't gettin it done.

1012
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,577
<i>Good evening, Korea.</i>

1013
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:58,913
-Sir, we're making chicken soup.
-<i>Welcome to the nation's top news stories.</i>

1014
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,790
You want some soju?

1015
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:05,086
<i>Chairman of the Heungbaek Corporation,</i>
<i>Cheon Hwangsik has been released today.</i>

1016
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:08,298
Hey, sir. The ground's full of rocks.
What do you want us to do?

1017
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,550
<i>The Chairman argues that</i>
<i>worsening health conditions…</i>

1018
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,719
Dig around the edges
without chipping them.
