1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,560
She told me
not to contact you, but...

2
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,354
how could I not?

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,023
You should say goodbye
to her one last time.

4
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,570
She had tuberculosis.
We tried all sorts of things.

5
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,988
A month of herbs and such.

6
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,074
Three-beggar ticks and purslane.

7
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,368
All of it, shit.
None of it made a difference.

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,787
Relax, where's the fire?

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,664
Have a drink
and catch your breath.

10
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,874
And how was it that you found me?

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,921
Well, the telephone company,
I called and asked,

12
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,131
and they gave me
your new telephone number.

13
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,262
"NOT DELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED RECIPIENT"

14
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,139
"SONG GITAEK
RETURNED TO SENDER"

15
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,767
Take it easy. Whoa, geez!

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,186
Is this deep enough?

17
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:04,231
Yeah, that'll do.
Just smooth it out now.

18
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,691
Okay.

19
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,530
Yeah, that's right.
That's Yejin's boy.

20
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,912
So, how did you and Yejin end up meeting?

21
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:21,290
It was because of him.
That's how I met her.

22
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,127
Through Jecheon County Amateur Boxing.

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,796
The kid I was coaching got sick
and couldn't fight.

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,425
4TH JECHEON COUNTY MAYOR'S CUP
AMATEUR BOXING TOURNAMENT

25
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,469
Come on!

26
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,555
Put 'em up!

27
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:45,188
Hey! Get him!
Uppercut! Uppercut, yeah!

28
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,567
Yeah!

29
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,572
Let's go, kid.
Let's get you some water.

30
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,826
You ready to get up there? Hmm?

31
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,619
Just try and focus on--

32
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,913
What's going on? You nervous or what?

33
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,790
I must've ate something bad, Coach.

34
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,917
You gotta be more careful.

35
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:08,587
- Hey, Coach, I'm...
- What?

36
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,298
-I don't think I can fight right now.
-Hey.

37
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,467
Wait, c'mon, just...

38
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,095
Hey, how are you going to
pull your pants down

39
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,597
with the gloves on?

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,681
Oh, boy.

41
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,267
Next fighter, blue corner. You're up now.

42
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:25,103
Where's the fire?
Could you give us a minute?

43
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,438
Should I disqualify him?

44
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,856
Ah, come on.

45
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,110
Maybe it's crazy...

46
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,281
Do you think I could
replace him for the fight?

47
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,334
<i>There was just</i>
<i>something about the look in his eyes.</i>

48
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,252
<i>Like he was a martial arts master.</i>

49
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,720
<i>The kid had long limbs,</i>
<i>good reach, real grit.</i>

50
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,393
<i>So how'd it go?</i>

51
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,401
<i>That was his first time</i>
<i>in the ring.</i>

52
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,153
<i>One punch knocked him out.</i>
<i>I thought he died.</i>

53
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:18,073
- One. Two.
<i>- He was up against a tough opponent.</i>

54
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,199
What?

55
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,159
<i>Then I met his mom,</i>
<i>and one thing led to another.</i>

56
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,745
<i>He's a sweet kid.</i>

57
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,124
<i>Called me Dad right from the get-go.</i>
<i>He's got a good heart.</i>

58
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,044
But even still, seems like
he never really felt at home.

59
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,295
"5 YEARS LATER"

60
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,631
He moved into the gym
after I married his mom.

61
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,342
With me in the house,
it was probably awkward.

62
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,721
I get it. It's not easy
living with a stranger

63
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,223
when you're a grown man.

64
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,152
I see a lot of empty bottles.

65
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,695
He can really put it away.

66
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,406
Eating and drinking, that's all he does.

67
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,034
He's gone into debt over it.
That's how much he loves his vices.

68
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,672
So how old is Daesik now?

69
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,091
The boy is 26.

70
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,760
His mother and I got married
around five years ago.

71

You...

73
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,656
You know who I am, don't you?

74
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,450
Yes.

75
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,912
Then come live with me in Seoul.

76
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,664
Okay.

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,293
And from now on,
you need to stop drinking.

78
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,546
Yes, Father.

EPISODE 6, THE PLUNGE

82
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,161
All right, next diver.
Jeonchul, you're up now.

83
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,999
You're fucking kidding me.
Are you serious?

84
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,710
Did you see what just happened?
And you want me to go in?

85
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,628
Why don't you get in there, then?

86
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,839
You little assmonkey.

87
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,720
- What's his problem?
- I guess it's you two, then. Who's first?

88
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,808
Oh, man.
No one wants to go in. They're scared.

89
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,269
- Here! Over here!
- He's got it.

90
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,729
-He's got it!
-What? Oh.

91
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,022
- Right here.
- Where?

92
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,231
-Over here.
-Bring it in.

93
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,317
-Come on! Look.
-Hey, come here.

94
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,236
-Just one?
-Hey, here.

95
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,446
Careful, don't drop it.

96
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,197
Be careful not to break it!

97
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,616
- Here we go.
- Come on.

98
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:48,909
Yeah!

99
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,286
Wow, this is it right here!

100
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,954
It was tough getting it out.

101
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:54,414
It was really lodged there in the mud.

102
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,416
-Let's take off these barnacles.
-Hey, hey!

103
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,501
-You'll ruin it. Give it to me.
-Oh? No?

104
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,378
-It needs to be desalinated.
-Easy.

105
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,297
Hey, did you see
a lot down there?

106
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,091
Don't even ask. Ugh!
I could barely see with this current.

107
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,301
When the current stopped,

108
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,219
I was able to get it out,
but I had to haul ass.

109
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,096
This is the only one you found?

110
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,683
Well, thing is I felt a few more
while I was down there, so we're good.

111
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,019
Why did you bring just one with you
when you could've grabbed them all?

112
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:18,605
We don't have time for this shit!
Get back in there!

113
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,065
Wait... I should go again?

114
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,859
I can't.
Not with the current this strong.

115
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,945
-And it's only getting stronger.
-Get a rope right now! Come on, move it!

116
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,280
- But...
- Tie it around yourself.

117
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,615
- Don't worry, all right?
- What?

118
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,034
Get down there and get more.
One piece won't cut it.

119
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,828
No fucking way.
I can't do this alone! Ah, shit!

120
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,747
Wait! Why are you giving me that
when I said I can't do it?

121
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,831
Just quit your yapping

122
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,167
and get your ass down there already
like I'm telling you to!

123
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,794
-No, I...
-By now you could've pulled up

124
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,797
at least another piece!
Ah, shit.

125
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,466
Tell me how we're supposed to get
a thousand at this rate!

126
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,135
We can't even cover
the cost of labor with this shit.

127
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,014
Did we drag our asses all the way out here
just to get one fucking ceramic out?

128
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,391
Fuck.

129
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,643
What are you waiting for? Get going!

130
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,814
Come on, man. You trying to kill a guy?

131
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,691
I will kill you
if you don't get down there!

132
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,150
Ugh, shit.

133
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,570
I said, I can't do this alone!

134
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,115
Ugh, fuck this, man.

135
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,201
<i>My uncle was right.</i>

136
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,328
At this rate,
we probably wouldn't break even.

137
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,347
Is he gonna
stay down there all night?

138
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,225
The sun's almost down,
what's taking him so long?

139
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,144
Here.

140
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,312
No, thank you.
Those things are bad for you.

141
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,189
Are you going to
keep backing out?

142
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:47,569
You gotta go in there first, man.
There's a thing called seniority.

143
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,405
What's that got to do with it, though?
We should stick to the order.

144
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,490
You shit, why am I going next?

145
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,285
What? How the hell should I know?
You should ask him, he's the boss.

146
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,873
Look, I'm asking you to go in first, man.
I'm scared of the water.

147
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,585
I don't even eat seafood, you know?

148
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,796
You fucking asshole!
I'm not asking you to catch fish.

149
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,298
He's up!

150
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,008
- He's back?
- Where?

151
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,718
Dang, he got drifted
all the way over there.

152
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,887
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What is it?

153
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,555
The current's strong, isn't it?

154
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,639
How'd it go?

155
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:20,060
It's like I said,
I'm blind as a bat down there.

156
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,353
-Ugh, shit.
-That means it's a bust, you guys.

157
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,981
- I think we should head back.
- Damn.

158
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,486
Ah, damn it. All that
for just one lousy little...

159
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,071
Let's call it!

160
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,999
- Sorry to bother you.
- Evening, sir.

161
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,878
There wouldn't happen to be
an Oh Gwanseok staying here, would there?

162
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,298
Oh, dear. The bunch of them left
for Jeungdo already.

163
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,133
-Jeungdo?
-Yeah.

164
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,971
Oh.

165
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,559
- All right, careful getting off, guys.
- Here we go!

166
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,105
Here, be careful with it!

167
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,314
Take my hand.

168
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,985
- It hurts. My back.
- It's a high step.

169
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,698
Ugh, fuck, why the hell is this so hard?
This is gonna take forever.

170
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,826
I'm sick of hearing
y'all complaining.

171
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,954
Tiger, gimme a cigarette, would you?

172
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,915
Captain Hwang.

173
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,875
You got him.

174
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,256
Can you find more divers?

175
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,508
I'll see if I can.

176
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,094
Rice planting season's over,
so there's guys who need work.

177
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,055
We need those ladies who dive for seafood.

178
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,642
Men or women, that don't matter.
We just need as many as we can get.

179
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,687
- It's killing me.
- He's really not looking good.

180
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,861
Why's he like that?

181
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,696
He got the bends.

182
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,905
What's the bends?

183
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,949
When you dive too deep...

184
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,578
I don't know, man.
Just something that happens.

185
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,044
Good, good, good.
Go easy when you pour, okay?

186
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,464
Gently. Easy, now. And get more water.

187
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,425
- How much more?
- Here.

188
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,969
You want it to be deep enough
to fully cover it.

189
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,388
So this is okay? Isn't this freshwater?

190
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,848
Has to be freshwater.

191
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,434
That's how you get the salt out.

192
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,811
It can take a while, even up to a year.

193
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,023
- Up to a year?
- Otherwise, it'll crumble to pieces.

194
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,402
It's as delicate as a newborn right now,
so we have to work carefully.

195
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:38,281
We'll have to get all the barnacles off.
But I gotta say, it looks great.

196
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,452
Fuck, imagine if there were a ton of these
just waiting for us down there?

197
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:48,333
Hey, try having some of this.
Here. It's <i>miyeokguk</i>.

198
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,174
Don't eat the solid bits.

199
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,675
Just try and drink the broth.

200
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,511
This'll get him better?

201
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,679
Beats me.

202
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,641
We don't got any medicine here,
but he needs to eat something.

203
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,685
Oh, man.

204
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,356
Spit it out if it's too much. Yeah?

205
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,274
It's just... It's just...

206
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,194
Beolgu.
What went on down there?

207
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,364
I kept trying to breathe.

208
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,660
-There was no air.
-You couldn't get any air?

209
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,163
The hell? I was pumping
so damn hard. Shit.

210
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,751
I was trying, but...
...but I couldn't breathe...

211
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,714
Then I don't know...

212
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,467
Could the hose have any holes or leaks?

213
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,177
That'd be bad.

214
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,638
If the hose has holes in it,
the divers are as good as dead down there.

215
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,266
Ugh, shit.

216
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,060
We have to make sure. Go get the hose.

217
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,437
-C'mon, let's go.
-Just bring the whole thing over here.

218
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,189
- Okay.
- Yup.

219
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,448
Nice and slow, all right?
Nice and slow.

220
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,742
Easy, now. Easy.
Keep pumping that thing, okay?

221
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,995
- What?
- Let's see.

222
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,792
Oh! Oh, there it is. I found it!
Here. Oh, man.

223
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,085
Hey, mark it there.

224
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,420
Tie this around it.

225
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,630
Man, why'd you bring
a leaky-ass hose?

226
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,883
Don't stop pumping.
We gotta find all the leaks.

227
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,469
My arms are gonna fall off.

228
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,805
- Look, there's another one!
- Oh, come on.

229
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,391
Son of a bitch.
This coulda killed any one of us.

230
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,060
You fucking idiot, what're you doing
bringing this shit?

231
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,021
I just grabbed what they used before.
How would I know?

232
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,857
Hey! Stop that. That's enough.

233
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,941
Just drop it.

234
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,445
We'll go to Mokpo and get a new one.

235
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:41,946
That's enough.

236
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,577
Well, anyway, we could've died
if it wasn't for you.

237
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,664
I've seen this before,
I used to work on a boat.

238
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,499
You can't fix this thing.

239
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,626
Really? What tonnage?

240
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,338
Deep-sea fishing vessels.
Mostly on the Indian Ocean.

241
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,216
Sounds tough, but you did always
have the look of a sailor.

242
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,719
Hey, Seokbae. You got any booze here?

243
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,887
I got <i>cheongju</i> here.

244
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,598
Yeah, go get it, then.
Let's get fucking hammered.

245
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,224
Maybe you should go easy.

246
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:13,019
How are we supposed to work
without it? Ain't that right?

247
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,063
Men of the sea bond over drinks.

248
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,358
You're damn right.

249
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,778
What about food? You got anything to eat?

250
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,571
You saw outside. Cock-a-doodle-doo.

251
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,323
Hey, hey! No, we're not doing that.

252
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,741
Why the hell not?

253
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,952
Why're you even raising them
if you're not gonna eat 'em?

254
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,246
Well I-I just...
Those are just, uh...

255
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,124
Hey! Wait! I said don't. No, wait. C'mon!

256
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,293
-It's quick.
-No, they're not for eating. Hey!

257
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,586
- Don't you dare!
- Let's do it.

258
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,382
Those are Siamese hens out there!
For eggs! Hey! Get your hands off! Hey!

259
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,634
-I said don't eat them!
-It's okay.

260
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,803
I'm sad about this too. I'm here with you.

261
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,476
I just think it would
really help if you put in a good word.

262
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,396
I bet if you did then finding a job
for Beolgu would be a piece of cake!

263
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,982
Honggi, you'll do this for your auntie.

264
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,194
Remember when you fell down the stairs
at my house in third grade

265
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,071
and cracked your head open?

266
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,698
I saw it from the kitchen,
so I ran over to where you were lying

267
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,450
with a handful of <i>doenjang</i>.

268
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,411
Blood was everywhere, so I rubbed
that stuff right on your head!

269
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,580
He was bleeding like crazy that day,

270
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,791
and his neck was all crooked too,

271
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,627
and his eyes they were all rolled back.

272
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,170
Oh, my.

273
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,841
I was beside myself.
My heart was pounding.

274
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,551
Your auntie stayed calm, though.

275
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:29,095
She came right over
and smacked that paste on.

276
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,849
I got nerves of steel, that's right.

277
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,685
All right, enough.

278
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,147
Thing is, I'm a civil servant.

279
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,108
If something goes wrong
while I'm pulling strings,

280
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,734
I won't be the only one going down.

281
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,362
Oh, you think I would...
I won't say a word!

282
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,615
Who would I even tell that to?
I wouldn't do that.

283
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,826
That aside though,

284
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,703
let's talk about the crates
at Uncle's store.

285
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,121
Yeah?

286
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,707
So, why is it that you keep moving
those crates to the shed next door?

287
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,043
Well that's just, you see,
the neighbor, he said--

288
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,296
You all have had some
big fights though, right?

289
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,883
The shop owner, he's always
complaining to us, you know?

290
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,135
Says he's gonna burn them
if you leave them there.

291
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,513
I don't know what his problem is
that he would say all that.

292
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,100
See? You should cut it out
with all the tricks.

293
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,394
Just at least try and play fair.

294
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,731
Always trying to pull something in secret.

295
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,317
What do you mean by tricks?

296
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,238
That hurts, Honggi.

297
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:33,159
How can you say something awful like that
to your dear aunt, huh?

298
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,789
- All right, I heard you. Huh?
- Good.

299
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,750
I'll give a call
to the company then, okay?

300
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,543
But I can't promise anything.

301
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,548
Honggi! Why would you...

302
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,301
There's no need for all that.

303
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,595
I'm so sorry.

304
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,933
That condescending jerk.

305
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,185
Thinks he's some hot shot.

306
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,645
That little bastard.

307
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:17,995

some more firewood for kindling.

311
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,215
Hey, quit goofin' around
and grab some firewood, you guys.

312
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,008
All right, yeah, man.

313
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,680
We'll need it
for heating too, so bring a lot!

314
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,181
I said I got it.

315
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,100
We're definitely
gonna need more.

316
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,978
Come on, can't you just do it
without me needing to nag you? Ugh.

317
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,229
Not these kids.

318
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,400
Now this... This is a real feast.

319
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,527
I used to make a killing
off some easy marks, man.

320
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,362
"A JACKPOT ITEM
FOR MINIMAL INVESTMENT"

321
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,239
Once I got five million won for a piece.

322
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,241
-Five million for one?
-That's right.

323
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,077
Wait, I didn't know
jackpots like that even existed.

324
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,245
Here, guys, eat up.

325
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,830
<i>Chawan</i>, It was a <i>chawan</i>...

326
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,206
A TEA BOWL WITH A LID"

327
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,000
...and holy shit, it was one of a kind.

328
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,837
As soon as I laid eyes on it,
I snatched that shit up.

329
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,921
I'm serious.

330
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,756
Who's buying
a <i>chawan</i> for five million?

331
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,425
You guys should eat this.

332
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,343
- Are we out of drinks?
- Ah, it's hot.

333
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,428
-Hey, Seokbae.
-What is it?

334
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,762
You got any more booze stashed away?

335
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,306
- Oh, man.
- That's all I got.

336
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,392
Then go knock on some doors
and get us some more.

337
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,313
Ah, man. It's all old people around here.
They're not gonna have any drinks.

338
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,732
- Why not?
- Come on, lay off the drinks.

339
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,151
We gotta go back out there
and work tomorrow.

340
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,613
- Hey, we're just getting started.
- Fucking drunks.

341
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,364
- Daesik.
- Hmm?

342
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,408
You're going in first.

343
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,911
Don't forget,
that's what you said, you swore.

344
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:45,458
Ugh, geez. I gave you my word, didn't I?

345
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,795
Hey, Jeonchul. Who do you think
you are? You're first tomorrow.

346
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,257
- Ugh, come on. Relax and have some soju.
- Ah, shit...

347
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,675
Why?

348
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:58,929
Heedong,

349
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,432
what are you doing with your cut?

350
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,684
Buy a house.

351
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:04,852
What kind of house?

352
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:10,149
Something big,
with a nice little lawn and a dog.

353
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,278
Gwanseok, what about you?

354
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,530
What will you do with your cut?

355
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,658
That ain't none of your business.

356
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,451
What about you, Captain?

357
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:25,414
Gonna buy a big boat
and fish for tuna in the Indian Ocean.

358
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,125
Come on, why put yourself
through all that?

359
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,836
You should just sail around
and take it easy.

360
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,589
What would you do if you hit it rich?

361
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,637
What would I do? I'd use
that money to buy my mom a house.

362
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,683
She worked her butt off
on a farm her whole damn life.

363
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,018
Still got nothing to show for it.

364
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,729
I want to take care of her.

365
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,065
Get her a house.

366
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,442
A nicer farm with some cows, too.

367
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,945
That's the dream, isn't it?

368
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,905
Daesik, hey, what are you doing, man?

369
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,615
I gotta piss.

370
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,911
- Hey, go over there. Over there.
- Damn it.

371
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,205
Seriously, dude?
What the hell are you doing?

372
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,916
-You're crazy.
-Whatever, I gotta take a leak.

373
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,836
-Hey, go do it over there, dumbass!
-Ah, c'mon, man. Use the damn bathroom.

374
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,546
-What the hell are you doing?
-What?

375
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,340
Ah, shit!

376
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,926
- Are you serious?
- Come on, man!

377
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,803
- Come on!
- Put that thing away!

378
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,014
Look at you fucking small timers
trying to get a quick buck.

379
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,558
None of you are shit.

380
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,274
Ugh, that son of a bitch is
a fucking animal when he's drunk.

381
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,903
Were you always afraid of the sea?

382
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,866
I told you, I almost drowned a while back.

383
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,077
I'm only here 'cause of Chairman Cheon.

384
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:46,871
I would've left already if I could.

385
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,418
The truth is being out there is rough.

386
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,755
On a boat anyone can
turn on you, just like that.

387
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,798
I keep my eyes wide open.

388
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,218
Do you have to stay, though?

389
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,428
You should just go.

390
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,347
Are you serious?
Have you been listening to me at all?

391
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,058
Could talk to the chairman's wife.

392
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,688
Fuck me.

393
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,654
Hey.

394
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,116
Nah, forget it.

395
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,330
-Hey.
-What's up?

396
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:35,586
Y'know, the chairman's wife
and I actually used to be married.

397
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:37,880
What?

398
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,509
When the ship sank,
she thought I sank with it.

399
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,719
Figured I was dead.

400
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,222
Eventually she remarried.

401
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,098
Can't even be mad at her.

402
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,433
I was gone for like...

403
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,353
12 fucking years. Shit.

404
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,191
So why're you working for Chairman Cheon?

405
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,861
She says the old man is gonna die soon.

406
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,114
And after he croaks, it'll all be ours.

407
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,282
So what can I do?

408
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,287
Then outta nowhere...

409
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,542
Cheon sends me down here
to work with you guys.

410
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,212
I've got pretty good instincts
for this shit.

411
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,882
Something shady's going on here.

412
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:25,928
Heedong,

413
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,348
I don't wanna die out here.
Help me make it out.

414
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,978
If you do, I'll get you that house
you wanted with the backyard.

415
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,355
I give you my word.

416
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,571
Come on, let's get another drink.

417
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,255
Okay, sir. You're good to go.

418
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,923
Thank you.

419
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,023
Hello.

420
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,650
Good evening, ma'am.
What can I do for ya?

421
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:27,364
Well, my friend, she works here.
And we are her guests, okay?

422
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,158
Who invited you?

423
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,619
Hmm? Our friend.

424
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,038
I think he's asking for her name, though.

425
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,248
Oh. Seonyeong.

426
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,792
Seonyeong.

427
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,629
I said that she works here.

428
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,255
She's the auctioneer!

429
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,966
-Can I get your ID?
-Hmm?

430
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,510
- Just give it to him already.
- Ah.

431
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,971
Who does he think he is,
asking for ID.

432
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,473
Yours too, Jungsook.

433
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,599
Mine too?

434
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,393
- Me?
- Yes, both of you.

435
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:57,603
-Okay.
-Yeah.

436
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,194
How do you know
about this place anyway?

437
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:09,073
One of my regulars works here.
Her husband's an American soldier.

438
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,491
I see.

439
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,120
Oh.

440
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,541
Seonyeong.

441
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,211
Sorry. So glad you could make it tonight.

442
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,297
Seonyeong, you look beautiful!

443
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,341
I got this dress
at your store the other day.

444
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,927
I know. It was made for you.

445
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,638
You look fantastic.

446
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,307
Oh, this here is
the Heungbaek chairman's wife.

447
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,685
It's so great to meet you.

448
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,438
You too. So this venue,
what is it exactly?

449
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,148
A US Army assembly hall.

450
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,776
And sometimes
they'll hold these auctions here.

451
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,278
Many Americans
are interested in pottery as well.

452
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,197
- I see.
- Wow, I didn't know!

453
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,532
Here.

454
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,242
Seonyeong, here you go.

455
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,495
The Sinan one?

456
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,288
It was in the sea. Not easy to find.

457
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,000
- This way, please.
- All right.

458
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,219
I'll start the appraisal process.
You can go on ahead.

459
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,303
-Okay.
-Thanks, Seonyeong.

460
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,222
-Sure, I'll see you in there.
-Sounds good.

461
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:18,976
Hi, come on in.

462
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,979
This is from Sinan.
Please take a close look at it.

463
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,564
- I'll have a look in a moment.
- Okay.

464
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,774
- Shall we head in?
- Uh-huh.

465
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,197
Wow.

466
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,282
Oh, my...

467
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,242
Jungsook. Look at that.

468
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,995
Ooh.

469
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,455
This is a big deal, isn't it?

470
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:43,042
-Yeah, I know.
-Ms. Yang, is that you?

471
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,460
Well, if it isn't Mr. Kim.

472
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,628
I didn't expect to see you.

473
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,505
You can say that again.

474
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,507
I had no idea you were
interested in this sort of thing.

475
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:53,093
No. Not at all.

476
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,971
I just came by to say hi
to the commander here,

477
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,890
and I figured,
I might as well take a look-see.

478
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,391
I see.

479
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:02,269
This is my close friend.
I should introduce you two.

480
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,313
- Hello there.
- Yeah, hello.

481
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,734
Well, all right, then.
Enjoy yourselves, ladies.

482
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,486
Thanks.

483
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:11,987
Who was that?

484
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,115
That was Assemblyman Kim Myeonggu,
my husband's backer.

485
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:16,617
Oh.

486
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,370
- Where do you wanna sit?
- Well, how about over there?

487
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:22,164
- Sure.
- Okay, go ahead.

488
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,334
5,200.

489
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,087
Is anyone going for 5,300?

490
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,798
Do I have 5,300 dollars?

491
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,674
Is no one going to bid higher?

492
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:34,927
No one?

493
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,765
Number nine. 5,200.

494
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:44,103
That's the highest bid.
Then we're going once. We're going twice.

495
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,355
Okay, sold.

496
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,815
5,200.

497
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,609
-Sold for 5,200 dollars.
-Do you know how much that is in won?

498
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,070
One dollar comes to 480...

499
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,407
That's 2.5 million?

500
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,910
Wait, really? That hunk of junk?

501
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,495
Who would have thought?

502
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,920
That's the one I'm looking forward to.

503
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,840
Now, the next item is Chinese pottery.

504
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:14,299
Chinese pottery.

505
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:17,970
This pottery's from
the 14th century Yuan Dynasty in China.

506
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,264
It was found off the coast of Sinan.

507
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,475
As you can see, there's very little wear
and no damage.

508
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,729
It's in great condition.
The color and shape are well preserved.

509
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,774
This piece is a rare
and excellent representation

510
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,776
of the pottery of its time.

511
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,488
So then, let's start the bidding
at 3,000 dollars, shall we?

512
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,367
-Do I have anyone with 3,000?
-3,000? 1.5 million...

513
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,661
It seems this item is very popular.

514
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,705
All right, how about
we raise the bid on it, then?

515
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,541
3,200? 3,200.

516
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,627
Who's next? 3,500.

517
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,129
Do I have 3,500?

518
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,047
3,500.

519
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,968
Wow. All right, then.
Anyone bidding 4,000?

520
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,637
4,000. 4,000 dollars.

521
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,930
Anyone? For 4,000?

522
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,017
Okay, let's go to 4,200.

523
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,810
Do I have 4,200?

524
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:11,064
4,200 do... Okay, we have 4,200 dollars.

525
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:13,734
Is anyone going for 4,500?

526
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,070
Do I have 4,500 dollars? 4,500.

527
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,658
RAINY GOMORYEONG

528
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,194
You're still up.

529
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,531
Now where have you been all day?

530
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,992
I had a meeting with the girls.

531
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,496
Why did your meeting
run so late into the night?

532
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,416
We lose track of time
catching up with each other, silly.

533
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,586
But what are you doing
out of bed so late like this?

534
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,714
-Thought you weren't feeling good.
-How's the pottery search going? Any luck?

535
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:19,216
They found one in fact.

536
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,177
It's in great condition
for having been underwater.

537
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,222
Well, where is it?
Why didn't you bring it with you?

538
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,350
They said something about how
they have to desalinate it?

539
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,603
All that aside, it looks like
it'll bring in a lot of money.

540
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,652
I guess that depends
on if the Americans like it.

541
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,531
I'm sure
they're going to love it.

542
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,324
I'm pretty sure.

543
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,789
Hey, guys! Get up.
Hurry! It's late already, let's go.

544
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,086
- Oh, shit.
- My head's killing me. This fucking sucks.

545
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,505
Hey, hey, rise and shine.

546
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,382
Told you to go easy on the booze.

547
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,843
Daesik, get up.

548
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,679
My foot. It hurts.

549
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,763
Let's see it.

550
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,977
Do you have gout?

551
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,772
Yeesh, he can't even walk,
let alone dive.

552
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,109
Shit,
we're already short handed as it is.

553
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,446
Daesik. You okay?

554
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,072
You're supposed to dive today.

555
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:26,241
Fuck. Don't touch me.

556
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,826
Jeonchul.

557
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,747
Looks like you're diving in first today.

558
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,874
You know we're all taking turns
going in the water,

559
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,918
so don't try to weasel out of it.
Got it?

560
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,337
Ow, what the...

561
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,048
Get ready.

562
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,925
Hwang and I are gonna go to Mokpo
and get a new hose.

563
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,178
Take good care of Daesik.

564
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,598
Geez. Fucking idiot.

565
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,808
I can't do it, okay?

566
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:56,146
When I even think about diving,
I feel like I'm suffocating.

567
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,357
Hey, you worked
on a ship before.

568
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,027
At least you've got some experience.

569
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,155
Do you really have to throw in
some hopeless rookie first?

570
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,115
That's so fucking pathetic.

571
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,619
- Hurry up.
- Yeah.

572
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,182
The big bad sailor's
wettin' his pants in there.

573
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:35,310
Damn, that wind.
I don't know if we can make it to Mokpo.

574
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,105
What do you mean? They won't sail out?

575
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:40,690
Nah, not like this.
The boat'll capsize.

576
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,860
Every day we waste
is money down the drain.

577
00:31:44,361 --> 00:31:46,196
We can still check it out.

578
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,744
Thanks.

579
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,747
Hey, Gwanseok!

580
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,335
- Man, I'm glad I caught up with ya.
- What are you doing here?

581
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:04,047
What am I doing here?
Listen, I need to talk to you.

582
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,340
I'm heading out. Can it wait?

583
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,760
I just need a minute with you.
It's not like you're leaving this second.

584
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:11,263
Hey. I'll hold the boat,
you guys talk it out.

585
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,348
- All right, I'll see you there.
- Okay.

586
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,142
What is it?

587
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,148
Listen.

588
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,693
Are you with me or are you with Mrs. Yang?
Just give it to me straight.

589
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,903
Where the hell is all of this coming from?

590
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,614
You know what that woman said?

591
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,116
After her little trip down here,

592
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,410
she said that everything from Sinan
is hers now.

593
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,621
Gwanseok, talk to me.
I'm about to lose my mind here.

594
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:37,831
Where do you stand on this?

595
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,583
Oh, for fuck's sake.

596
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:44,254
Hey. Did that woman win you over?

597
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,632
Tell me somethin'. You rich?

598
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,009
What are you asking?

599
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,304
Do you have enough money to cut her
out of this? That's what I'm asking.

600
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,599
Look here, okay? Putting money
over people is just bad business!

601
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,350
And to cut me out? It's not right!

602
00:32:57,434 --> 00:33:00,061
See, with her,
all of this is gonna be simple.

603
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:03,148
She's just gonna buy everything.
Anything at all, no exceptions.

604
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,025
That's exactly what I promised you.

605
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,486
I mean, things got really messy there
for a second. All these guys got involved.

606
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:11,031
And then she just came in
and cleaned everything up.

607
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,992
That's real nice. While she cuts me
out of the whole deal?

608
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,620
You're missing the point entirely.

609
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,707
You can still get paid
if you stop and listen for a second.

610
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,168
Then enlighten me on just how exactly.

611
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,212
You know the fake ones you got?

612
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:28,215
You can give them to us
and we can sell them to her.

613
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,260
That way you can get rid
of all of the replicas, right?

614
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,182
So bring 'em all over!
I'll mix 'em up so she can't tell!

615
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,143
And then I'll get a great price for ya.

616
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,436
Are we good now?

617
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,148
Wait. Are you gonna keep your word?

618
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:48,401
Look at me. Look me in the eyes.
Am I lying?

619
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,112
You mean it, right?

620
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:53,073
I'm on your side, Song.

621
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,157
All right, then.

622
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:57,244
- I can't believe you don't trust me.
- I got it, okay, okay.

623
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:59,913
Gwanseok, thank you.
I really appreciate this.

624
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,624
Oh, right. Before I forget.

625
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,636
What's this now?

626
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,555
It's five million.
It's from Chairman Cheon.

627
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,351
It's for Jeonchul, not the pottery deal.

628
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,065
If you can't do it,
I'll return the cash to Cheon.

629
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,317
Let me know what you wanna do.

630
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:32,654
Come on, take it.

631
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,038
His foot is a damn mess,
that's for sure.

632
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,958
Who knew he had gout?

633
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:49,671
That's why I told him
to lay off the drinking.

634
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,093
This is no good.
Mokpo's got a doctor or a clinic, right?

635
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,470
-Yeah.
-Listen.

636
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,810
He's not doing too hot either.
Let's take him too.

637
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,437
Did he get hurt?

638
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:12,861
How did he get like that?

639
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,989
He went into the water with a busted hose.

640
00:35:23,705 --> 00:35:25,957
Can I talk to you outside
for a minute?

641
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,472
Come here.

642
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,100
What are you thinking of doing?

643
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,478
What?

644
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,397
His face is all gray.
He might not make it.

645
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,526
And if he dies out here,
then things will get worse.

646
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:57,447
And Mokpo's
out of the question now.

647
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,908
There's no way to help him, is there?

648
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,751
You could just dump him out in the sea.

649
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,712
In the sea?

650
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,590
People die,
that's just how life goes.

651
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:19,552
But if he dies here and they find out
about it, we'll all take the fall for it.

652
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,347
Just think about it.

653
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:26,351
Hey. How did you end up
with this many people?

654
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,311
Don't even ask.

655
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,690
Things got all messed up and shit.
Now everything's goin' wrong.

656
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,982
Ah, geez.

657
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,193
Good grief.

658
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,448
You better be measurin' it right.

659
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:43,118
Don't screw around,
'cause I'm gonna be checkin' your work.

660
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,787
Right,
and you'll pay me pennies too.

661
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:01,052
What's the matter?

662
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,562
Listen...

663
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,442
When you're out fishing...
sometimes there's accidents, right?

664
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,068
Yeah, things happen.

665
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,364
How do you normally handle it?

666
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,783
What, do you...
call the police and report it?

667
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,368
Of course, you gotta.

668
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,330
We can cover it up if it's iffy, though.

669
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:34,794
What, cover it up? You can do that?

670
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,258
Uh, guess that depends on the situation.

671
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,845
So what is the situation?

672
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,391
Well, let's say one of us
gets in some kind of accident out there.

673
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,102
Think you could cover that up?

674
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,354
I get it. Somethin's up again.

675
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,318
You gotta give me details
if you want my help.

676
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,528
Okay? Okay.

677
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,913
Just between us.

678
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,164
No shit.

679
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,667
If you're worried
I'm gonna talk, just forget it.

680
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,296
The truth is,
there's another reason I'm here.

681
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,881
A job I gotta do.

682
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,301
There's a mark I gotta take out.

683
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,636
Who is it?

684
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,721
Jeonchul.

685
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,391
Hmm.

686
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,353
They told you to kill Jeonchul?

687
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,605
Yeah.

688
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:42,362
Ain't that some shit...
That don't feel right.

689
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,450
I mean, the two of us
drank soju together and everything.

690
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,537
Listen, I didn't come here
to make friends, you know that.

691
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,622
We gotta do what we're paid to do.

692
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,709
It ain't so simple,
takin' someone out like that though.

693
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,628
I know.

694
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,841
If you're gonna do it...

695
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,888
I would think the best shot
would be while he's diving.

696
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:09,973
Okay. How?

697
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:12,642
Well, the hose
could get tangled or somethin'.

698
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,154
How much do I get?

699
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,035
If it's done clean, then...

700
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:35,081
A million, straight.

701
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,884
And you better pay it straight.

702
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,136
This is about someone's life.

703
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,220
Of course.

704
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,224
If you go runnin' your mouth,
I'll feed you to the fish.

705
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,184
Got it.

706
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,312
Hmm.

707
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,648
Mmm.

708
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:03,067
Mmm.

709
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,210
The waves have calmed down.
We can head out.

710
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,295
Mmm.

711
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,716
All right, we need to set
the diving order.

712
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,092
Gather around.

713
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:31,220
Ugh, come on.
What we gotta go do that for?

714
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:33,181
We're all getting in the water anyway.

715
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,141
I want y'all to listen up.

716
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,936
The one with the hose
will be sweeping the floor,

717
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,980
and the one with the tank
will dig up what the first guy found

718
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:45,026
and bring it up to the middle, to where
a second guy with an air tank is waiting.

719
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,446
And that guy will shuttle the pottery
back to the boat. Got it?

720
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:51,157
Going back and forth
like that is too exhausting.

721
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,369
I'll stay at the top 'cause my back hurts.

722
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,622
Wait a second. You know my knees
are fucked. I can't kick very well.

723
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,248
I should be up top.

724
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,334
Damn, what a load of bullshit.

725
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,962
Listen up, assholes.
This is how the old saying goes.

726
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,881
There's an order and hierarchy
you follow when it comes to age.

727
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,759
Who the hell you think you are
trying to call all the shots round here?

728
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,885
I should be at the top.

729
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,763
Quit yapping and listen.
Just do what I tell you to do.

730
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:14,847
Seokbae!

731
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,100
- Hey.
- Are you ready to go?

732
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,643
Yeah, we're ready.

733
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,229
- You got the hose?
- It's on the boat.

734
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,774
All right, everyone, let's go!
We're heading out!

735
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:28,778
- Jeonchul, get ready.
- Come on. Let's grab the gear.

736
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,697
Everyone, let's get going.

737
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,365
Hello, how you doing? Good?

738
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:41,791
We're here!

739
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:42,875
- All right!
- Okay!

740
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,877
All right, all right!
Everyone, get ready to go!

741
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:45,962
"YONGJIN"

742
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,339
Let's do this quick.
Guys, get your tanks on.

743
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,383
- Yeah, hurry, hurry.
- Get ready to dive.

744
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,094
The current's sure looking great today!

745
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,471
You're right!
The water's nice and calm, huh?

746
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,016
But you still gotta be careful!

747
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,185
Jeonchul.

748
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,937
Get ready to dive.

749
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,481
I'll do it.

750
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,984
- No, Jeonchul's going first.
- I said I wanna go.

751
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:10,069
- For fuck's sake.
- Hey, forget it.

752
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,612
You think anyone can dive?

753
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:13,865
It just looks easy 'cause we're doing it.

754
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,829
You should just pay me a little extra.
I'll get 'er done.

755
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,415
- I appreciate this.
- Yeah, yeah.

756
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,209
Then you two get on the damn pump.

757
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:28,504
Let's move it over there.

758
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,298
One, two, three, lift.

759
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,760
Hey. Hey, over here.

760
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,387
- Bring that over here. Grab that end.
- Go help them.

761
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,307
Be careful not to get
the air hose tangled, okay?

762
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,726
Don't let it get tangled.

763
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,522
Beolgu...

764
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,275
He's gonna die, isn't he?

765
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,986
Yeah, well, there's bubbles
in his lungs, so he's basically a goner.

766
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,071
So...

767
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,198
think you can handle it?

768
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,828
Hold on.

769
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,789
That's a whole 'nother issue.

770
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,793
We're in deep shit if he dies on us.
We gotta take care of this now.

771
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,090
Damn, you're right.

772
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,508
So how, then?

773
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:14,884
I guess...

774
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,680
I know a spot we can dump his body at,
where no one will find him for a while.

775
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:27,980
No one will report it, right?

776
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,527
He's a lost cause even to his family.

777
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,445
They'll throw a party when he's gone.

778
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,365
The whole neighborhood will show up. Shit.

779
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,958
Daesik. Wake up now.

780
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,420
Rise and shine.

781
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:55,007
If you sleep all day,
it'll mess up your schedule.

782
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:58,094
My foot hurts so bad. What did...

783
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,392
All right, rest.

784
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:07,103
Getting some good sleep
should help with the gout.

785
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,772
Keep your eyes closed. Just rest.

786
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:13,151
My foot... My foot feels...

787
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,195
I know. It must hurt so much.

788
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:17,947
You poor thing.

789
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,284
Get some rest, sleep it off.

790
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,164
I hope we find
more of 'em today.

791
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,332
Oh, geez.

792
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,459
Give it a good sweep, all right?

793
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,589
Let's get up there, then! Here we go!

794
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,174
Ready?

795
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:41,304
-All right.
-One, two, three! Go!

796
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,278
Huh?

797
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:09,475
Oh, oh! We've got a bite!

798
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,102
- Pull it up!
- Yeah!

799
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,146
-Keep going.
-Slow down! You need to slow down!

800
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,941
- Yeah!
- Easy, there! Easy!

801
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,403
It's coming up,
it's coming up!

802
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:22,947
-All right, I got it.
-We got it! Hell yeah!

803
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,742
-Easy there. Easy.
-Hey! Drop the cigarette and help out!

804
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,911
I've been working my ass off,
so I deserve a break.

805
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:31,539
To hit the jackpot,
we all gotta hustle here!

806
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,541
Come on, put your backs into it!

807
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,918
- Attagirl!
- Be careful not to break it!

808
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,003
Careful! Careful!

809
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,797
Hot damn, look at that!
What a beauty. We hit it big.

810
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,716
Careful!

811
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,260
- Now we're getting somewhere.
- Wow!

812
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,512
Would you look at that?
That's the jackpot!

813
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,765
- Put it over there.
- Guys, keep pumping, all right?

814
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,146
EMERGENCY ROOM
YULSEONG HOSPITAL

815
00:46:58,816 --> 00:46:59,817
INJECTION ROOM

816
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,236
- We're all done here.
- How is he?

817
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,364
His blood pressure has been
all over the place since last week.

818
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,991
Is he still taking his medication?

819
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,951
Yes, of course. He doesn't miss a day.

820
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,957
His blood pressure is
dangerously high. Over 200.

821
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:19,003
It might be because
he's got so much on his plate.

822
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,921
His heart doesn't sound
too good either.

823
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,007
You know he has a heart condition.

824
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,468
Do you know of
any good hospitals overseas?

825
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,095
He could go into cardiac arrest
if he travels abroad.

826
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:29,722
Flying is out of the question.

827
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:33,476
Overseas? That's ridiculous.

828
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,311
I'll be careful and watch what I eat.

829
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,106
Thanks for taking a look, Doctor.

830
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,525
Not at all, Chairman. You take care.

831
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:44,362
You should go on ahead. I have
a few questions I want to ask the doctor.

832
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:45,446
Mmm, okay.

833
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,865
-You're headed to the office, right?
-Oh, of course.

834
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,703
And, sir, please come by
more often.

835
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:55,998
All right, have a good day.
Thank you.

836
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:57,833
"DR. KIM BYEONGSEOK"

837
00:47:57,917 --> 00:47:58,918
Hi.

838
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,463
So then...

839
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,256
Could we go over it in more detail?

840
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,176
How bad is it?
Is there any hope for recovery?

841
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,971
Given his age, recovery will be slow.

842
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,308
So he'll need to take it easy with work.

843
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:15,768
And no more drinking.

844
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:19,688
That's unfortunate.
He loves his drink, that man.

845
00:48:19,772 --> 00:48:22,274
I absolutely forbid it. It could be fatal.

846
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:24,235
You can't let him drink.

847
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,449
It's been so long.

848
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:33,536
I regret that we didn't have dinner
after you came back from your trip.

849
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,414
Yes, that's why
I'm planning another dinner.

850
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,917
I was thinking my house,
with the chairman, we could eat together.

851
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,378
Yes.

852
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:46,048
The ten executives
that got promoted recently,

853
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:47,925
you should invite all of them.

854
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,009
Yes.

855
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,262
Ah, what's your favorite liquor?

856
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,181
Of course.

857
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:56,434
I mean, you just traveled abroad.

858
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,477
Right. I'll have plenty of whiskey there.

859
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:02,064
It's no trouble, no.

860
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,607
Don't worry about it all.

861
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,193
Yes, sure.

862
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,195
All right,
I'll talk to you soon, Director.

863
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,870
You're all hardworking big shots.
You deserve to unwind a little.

864
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,712
Oh, I'm spent!
I can't do another one, I'm done.

865
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,047
And look, it's gonna get dark real soon.

866
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,883
We hauled up a lot.

867
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,926
Okay, we're done. Let's go!

868
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,762
-Got all the pots there?
-Yeah, let's stop here.

869
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:36,474
Let's go! I've had enough of the sea.

870
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,893
Yeah, I'm ready to get outta here.

871
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,769
Bokgeun, raise anchor.

872
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:42,271
Start the boat!

873
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,899
- All right. Good work, everyone!
- Let's go!

874
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,400
You guys did great.

875
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,319
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>we actually got some real work done.</i>

876
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,403
Good work, everyone.

877
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,198
<i>In the end this wasn't a job</i>
<i>we could do with a small crew.</i>

878
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,868
<i>I didn't get it before. But I do now.</i>

879
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,288
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

880
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,288
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

881
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:09,715
Of course, I promise.

882
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,927
Put a stamp on it.

883
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,932
How's this?

884
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:31,070
Are you lying on the floor
because you got your heart broken?

885
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,405
- Jongmal.
- Yeah?

886
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:36,200
What do you think Ms. Jang's doing
all the way in Gwangju?

887
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,662
It's a memorial thing
at a relative's house.

888
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,581
Then she probably won't come back today.

889
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:44,959
Probably not.
I don't think she has a ride.

890
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,963
- Jongmal.
- Yeah?

891
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,340
I actually have to go somewhere, okay?
Cover for me, would you?

892
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:52,800
What?

893
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,677
Wait, you're skipping out again?

894
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,638
Come on. Hey!

895
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,368
GOOD LUCK COFFEE SHOP

896
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,288
- Hey, come back soon, all right?
- Okay.

897
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:26,500
In one ear and out the other.

898
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,752
Ugh, whatever. I don't care.

899
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,381
Any boats heading to Jeungdo?

900
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,676
Jeungdo, huh? I'm not sure.

901
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,720
"FIRE STRIKES WITHOUT WARNING,
LET'S ALL STAY ALERT"

902
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,556
Excuse me, sir. Are there
any boats heading to Jeungdo?

903
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,224
Jeungdo?
You missed the last one.

904
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,145
Hey.

905
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,607
-You're going to Jeungdo?
-Yeah.

906
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,861
I'll give you a ride.
I was actually heading that way myself.

907
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,321
Are you sure?

908
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,781
Oh, geez, thank you.

909
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,408
Watch your step when you get on.

910
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,368
-Okay.
-Okay, go ahead.

911
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,373
I got it, so go ahead and hop on.
Keep going.

912
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:26,352
Hey, you're the waitress
at Good Luck Coffee, right?

913
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:28,437
So then, what brings you to Jeungdo?

914
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:31,565
Heading out there to see someone I know.

915
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,025
Right, so who is it?

916
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,944
What, you think Jeungdo's
some dinky little island?

917
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,238
Who you meeting and where you going?

918
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:42,159
Can you hurry up and take me
to where the folks from Seoul are at?

919
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,410
Which folks are those?

920
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,496
The ones that came from
Seoul and Busan, don't you know?

921
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,416
Ah, that's those looters you mean, right?
What are you seeing them for?

922
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,503
Ugh, wh-what's with the 20 questions?

923
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,880
Can't you just take me there quietly?

924
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:58,467
What? I'm burning my own gas
and giving you a free ride.

925
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,885
I can't even ask some questions?

926
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,642
Hey, can I take you on a date?

927
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,271
You wanna get murdered?

928
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,068
Sure. I'd be happy
to die in your arms, sweetheart.

929
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,030
Now come here.

930
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,119
What are you doing? Get over here.

931
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,455
Hey, if you don't listen to me,
I'll kill you.

932
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,748
I said, come here!

933
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,503
Attagirl. Nice and slow.

934
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,380
If you're not careful,
you'll crack your head.

935
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,842
Hey, don't be scared now. I'm good at it.

936
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,513
Here, right here.
Let's do this quickly and go.

937
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,140
Come on. Hurry.

938
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:49,059
I said, hurry up.

939
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:50,227
What?

940
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,938
Wha... What the hell are you doing?

941
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:55,607
I'll just swim over there.

942
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,736
Listen, you crazy bitch,
where do you think you are right now?

943
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,654
We're in the middle of the ocean.

944
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,239
What?

945
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:11,165
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

946
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,084
Hey! Are you out of your mind?
You trying to get yourself killed?

947
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,836
Grab my hand! Grab it!

948
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,422
Come on, grab my hand now!

949
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,175
You nutjob! Just...
Just get back on the boat!

950
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:27,389
Fine, I promise I won't do anything,
so just get on! For Pete's sake!

951
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,641
Damn it!

952
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:33,812
You'll get swept away and die out there!

953
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,399
Oh, man.

954
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:40,110
Look, you're a total nutjob,
you know that?

955
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:43,489
You know, I heard crazy things about you.

956
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,908
Let's just calm down
and I'll take you there.

957
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,660
Damn, you scared the shit out of me.
