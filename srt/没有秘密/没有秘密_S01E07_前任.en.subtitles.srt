1
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,801
FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:56,806
KIM JEONG-HEON

3
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,808
THE DAY WE GOT MATCHING GLASSES

4
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:08,610
8 YEARS AGO

5
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,659
JEONG-HEON, WOO-JU

6
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,168
Coming.

7
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,965
Oh, is Jeong-heon home?

8
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,513
I'm his mother.

9
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,183
Hello.

10
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,061
Here.

11
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:48,358
Oh, right. I don't live here.
It's our anniversary today,

12
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,277
so we decided to stay in
and have a steak dinner.

13
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,696
It's fine.

14
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,991
It's cute and cozy here.

15
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,163
I tried calling him on my way here
but he didn't pick up.

16
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,290
I see.

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,336
I'm not one of those overbearing mothers.

18
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,254
Right, I know.

19
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,801
JEONG-HEON
WHERE ARE YOU? YOUR MOM--

20
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,889
Jeong-heon rarely calls me first

21
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,225
but he called me a few days ago.

22
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,690
He said he wanted to get married.

23
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,698
WHERE ARE YOU? YOUR MOM'S HERE

24
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,785
I haven't even introduced myself properly.

25
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,913
I'm On Woo-ju.

26
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,967
Yes.

27
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,553
Oh, right. Yes. Got it.

28
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,807
Choi Yu-yeong.

29
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,810
I didn't think
she was the type to run away.

30
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,979
-She's really gone?
-She's gone.

31
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:08,980
What about Woo-ju?

32
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,233
She said she could be hiding somewhere
and went to look for her.

33
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:16,237
Do you think we can bring in
one of the finalists?

34
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,700
We can't leave the spot vacant
because Yu-yeong had such a big presence.

35
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,537
We can't, unless we can put
the filming on pause for a bit.

36
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,831
We've already gone over budget.

37
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,999
COUPLE'S PARADISE

38
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,880
You thought Ki-baek and I
would choose Yu-yeong,

39
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,632
so now that's gone down the drain.

40
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,013
The outcome is predictable
with Cho-hui alone.

41
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,182
You need someone
to challenge his first love

42
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,852
for Kim Jeong-heon to complicate things
and form a love triangle, right?

43
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:48,770
That way,

44
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,065
you can use Kim Jeong-heon's face
in your teasers and in the end too.

45
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,486
Just say what you want to say
instead of beating around the bush.

46
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,947
I've got an idea.

47
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:05,203
There's someone who will
definitely ignite a spark in my eyes.

48
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,171
On Woo-ju.

49
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,060
That is crazy talk.

50
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,562
I say it's crazy to leave
the situation as is.

51
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,941
Who cares about his first love
if he's not into anyone else?

52
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,860
-She's just another new girl.
-What do you suggest we do?

53
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,487
Have a writer come on the show?

54
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,324
It'll cause controversy.
People will think the show was rigged.

55
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,367
I can't handle that.

56
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,994
Of course, it'll cause problems,

57
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,288
so we should handle it in advance.

58
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,793
Remove her name from the credits
as head writer and from the crew.

59
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,211
She'll be one of the girls.

60
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,214
Ha-young, you're a writer too.

61
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,508
How could you suggest that so easily?

62
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,303
You can't make
a rational decision right now,

63
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,470
so I'm doing it for you.

64
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,222
Ha-young.

65
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,140
I'll do it.

66
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,601
Not you too.

67
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,396
Yeon, we can't let this show
go down the drain too.

68
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,523
How many people do we have on the team?

69
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,901
I'd rather have my name removed
to make a great show

70
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,112
than fail and hear that
I've lost my touch.

71
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,326
Everyone who should know this is my show
already knows it.

72
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,168
This was totally unexpected,
so we ask for your understanding.

73
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:43,092
Everyone on the production team knows
how serious you've all been about this,

74
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,221
so the last thing we want is
to see it all go to waste.

75
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,599
This will be in the show too, won't it?

76
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,517
That's why they're filming this, right?

77
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,311
Can't we just keep it as is?

78
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,272
Why Ms. On, of all people?

79
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,691
That's--

80
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,943
She and I dated in the past.

81
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,203
Yes, Ms. Ma.
Sorry for calling you so late.

82
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,371
The show is all about seeing how you react

83
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,832
when faced with your past love

84
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,169
and someone you like now, you know?

85
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,672
She's a part of my past
but she could be someone else's present.

86
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,841
I think it could be interesting.

87
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,390
It'll generate a lot of buzz.

88
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,644
-Right, Cho-hui?
-Yeah.

89
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,313
But it seems like a risky move.

90
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:39,107
A writer appearing on the show?

91
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,818
She'll be removed from the writing team,

92
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,779
and we'll revise everything she worked on.

93
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,950
It'd be boring to leave the spot vacant
but if someone totally new joins,

94
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,787
it could cause a headache,
and we don't want that.

95
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,498
It's not a bad idea.

96
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,666
It sounds fun.

97
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,251
I'm all for it.

98
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,047
-What? It's better to keep things as is.
-Be quiet. Just say yes.

99
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,013
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,432
For what?

101
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:18,521
For not being able to take care of you
as the writer when I dragged you here.

102
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,939
I'm not a kid.

103
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,941
You don't need to take care of me.

104
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,944
I gave you some pointers
to help you survive

105
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,280
the wild variety show jungle

106
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,990
but I can't do that anymore.

107
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,286
What's with that scoff? I'm dead serious.

108
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,539
Well, thanks to you,

109
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,624
I now feel pretty confident on set,

110
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,753
and I feel like people are opening up
to me as well, so I'm happy.

111
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,632
See? It's all because I taught you well.

112
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,260
I already know I owe it all to my tutor,

113
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,846
so you can stop boasting.

114
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,811
You know this is no joke, right?

115
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,647
They squeeze you and hang you out to dry.

116
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,317
People in showbiz
aren't called jerks for nothing.

117
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,946
I don't think we're that bad.

118
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,535
Let your pupil give you some pointers too.

119
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,665
If you feel nervous
in front of the camera,

120
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,171
close your eyes, and for three seconds,
think of what made you happiest recently.

121
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,426
It's what I used to do
when I presented the news.

122
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,973
It looks like you're taking
quite the risk to do this,

123
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,060
so I hope it all goes well.

124
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,647
All right?

125
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,815
Good night then.

126
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,994
-Okay, guys.
-All done.

127
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,539
-Yes, chef.
-There we go.

128
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,835
Louis's special kimchi fried rice.

129
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,047
Ta-da! Bon appétit.

130
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,217
Wow, it looks delicious.

131
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,010
You're the best, Louis.

132
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,180
It's lovely kimchi fried rice
filled with Louis's love.

133
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,229
Seong-jun, do you like kimchi fried rice?

134
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,450
Thank you.

135
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,328
Thanks for the food. I'm digging in.

136
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,371
-Let me.
-Yes.

137
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,040
Oh, thank you. Enjoy.

138
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,834
Hold on. Ms…

139
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,088
I mean, Woo-ju.

140
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,423
Yes?

141
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,675
Could you pass me the tissues?

142
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,385
-Tissues?
-Let me.

143
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:55,803
Here you go.

144
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,306
Min-gu, don't forget
to replace the tissues--

145
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,728
Oops, I mean…

146
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,284
Thanks for the food.

147
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,286
All right.

148
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,955
-Oh, let me. I'll serve.
-It's okay. I got this.

149
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,290
All right.

150
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,877
-I'm sorry!
-Oh, no.

151
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,255
It's all right.

152
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,883
I'm fine. It's okay.

153
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,386
Use wet wipes.

154
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,929
-Thank you.
-No problem.

155
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,184
What's the matter with her?

156
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,478
She couldn't look more awkward,

157
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,730
she faces the camera every 30 seconds.

158
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,737
But we got one useful shot.

159
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,738
What?

160
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,368
Let me.

161
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,750
I'm sorry!

162
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,752
Are you all right?

163
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,379
I'm fine.

164
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,756
It's okay.

165
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,717
I mean, look at those two.

166
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,139
Woo-ju, you can do it!

167
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,018
You'll now play a game
to decide your partners.

168
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,604
The guys will pick
one of the girls' belongings.

169
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,689
Choose one that speaks to your heart.

170
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,068
-All right, go.
-Wait.

171
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,403
-I'll go first--
-I'll go.

172
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,445
Can I go first?

173
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,863
Great.

174
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,310
What is this?

175
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,397
Anyone know what it means?

176
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,737
Then I'll go for this one.

177
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,453
Good luck with Cho-hui.

178
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,630
Have some food and then play.

179
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,892
DO NOT CLIMB

180
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,528
All right. If you're done,

181
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,280
we'll now head over to the beach.

182
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,576
You'll team up with your partners
and play this game.

183
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,702
Let's go!

184
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,370
Let's go.

185
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,314
The couple that comes in first
can go out on a date.

186
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,482
Get ready!

187
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,610
Be careful.

188
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,905
I've always wanted to do this.

189
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:45,950
We're ready.

190
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,587
Go!

191
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,173
Hold tight!

192
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,640
-It's stuck. Come on.
-Hurry.

193
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,475
Hold on, wait.

194
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,353
Let's go!

195
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,198
Let's go a little faster.

196
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,703
Hold tight.

197
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,341
-Come on. Quick!
-We've caught up with them.

198
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,801
We're here.

199
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,344
Let's go. Come on.

200
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,680
Get down!

201
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,099
-Hurry!
-Knees on the ground.

202
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,434
Get down!

203
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,644
Let's go, come on!

204
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,855
I have a better idea.

205
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,773
-Where?
-Lift me!

206
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,567
Get on my back.

207
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,860
-Okay.
-One, two, three!

208
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,738
-Lift me up!
-That worked.

209
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,782
To your right.

210
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,452
Hurry!

211
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,129
-We won!
-We did it!

212
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,388
We won!

213
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,018
She's so cute when she's excited.

214
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,186
What?

215
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,145
What?

216
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,192
We won!

217
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,368
ONE DATE
BY COUPLE'S PARADISE

218
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,210
I'm sure the production team
gave us this so we could go on a date

219
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,170
but you want to use it on your own?

220
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,966
I get it. I understand.

221
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,511
I understand you don't want to go
on a date with me. All right.

222
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,804
Thanks for understanding.

223
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,682
But I can't let you take this for free.

224
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,893
I haven't done anything yet.
I need this to do something.

225
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,187
Well, I need this for a reason.

226
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,655
Well, then…

227
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,867
Why are you so obsessed with games?

228
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,078
People call me
Ms. Game Addict of Sangam-dong.

229
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,330
But do we have to do this in the sun--

230
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,252
Did you just slap me?

231
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,546
I got one on your face.

232
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,202
Well, I'm sorry.

233
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,996
I really need it.

234
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,307
Hey.

235
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,812
Oh, your mother wants to see me?

236
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,024
I can't really talk right now.

237
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,736
I'll call you back later. All right.

238
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,325
Gu-won.

239
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,911
Have you called your mom?

240
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,538
-Yes, she said she'd pick us up.
-Mom!

241
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,584
Goodness. Look at that. I knew it.

242
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,045
My gosh.

243
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,380
Hey, sweetheart. You must be exhausted.

244
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:12,758
Why did you bring--

245
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,345
Ask me why I'm here,
and I'll stitch your lips together.

246
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,014
You're always shabbily dressed on set.

247
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,266
You're going on a TV show
looking like this?

248
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,352
At least you're not in a wrestling belt.

249
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,313
Shabbily dressed? Come on.
My clothes are expensive.

250
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,150
I shouldn't have told you.
I just didn't want you to be shocked.

251
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,111
I'm already in shock.

252
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,697
Hey, get changed first.

253
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,616
No, do something about your hair first.

254
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,379
What?

255
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,800
Weren't we going to the beach?

256
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,678
We are. That's why I rented these.

257
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,471
Let's go.

258
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,978
You know that Ki-baek is
on a date with Cho-hui, right?

259
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,981
Yes.

260
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,025
You two won that date ticket together.
Aren't you hurt?

261
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,488
No. I totally understand.

262
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,739
I'm not hurt at all.

263
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,075
You're not hurt? Really?

264
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,912
After trying so hard to win the game?

265
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,709
I'm just the type to give my best
in everything I do.

266
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:33,463
Our feelings are so unpredictable.

267
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,548
You know?

268
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,010
But I was quite surprised
by Ki-baek's choice.

269
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,762
When you guys were playing
the game earlier,

270
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,641
the look in his eyes
when he gazed at you was genuine.

271
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:52,191
I guess he wanted
a date with his first love.

272
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,540
Ki-baek, we got enough shots
of the scenery,

273
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,417
so just keep this distance.

274
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,546
Cho-hui, hold tight.

275
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,089
What?

276
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:19,885
What's he doing?

277
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,929
-What is he doing?
-Ki-baek!

278
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,347
Hey, I-na. Go faster.

279
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,349
Seriously?

280
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,185
The left foot, left, left!

281
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,118
Why did you do that?

282
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,038
So we could be alone.

283
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,479
Why did you do that?

284
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,732
Do what?

285
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,776
Choi Yu-yeong.

286
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:19,861
You have a boyfriend.

287
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:24,825
What do you mean? Oh, Ki-baek?

288
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,870
The food vlogger, Je I-su.
Isn't he your boyfriend?

289
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,248
I overheard you guys talking on the phone.

290
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,875
No, he's not.

291
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,879
I know a guy who's Je I-su's close friend.

292
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,382
He said I-su has a picture of you two
as his phone wallpaper

293
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,551
and told him you're his girlfriend.

294
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,052
Cho-hui.

295
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,388
Please keep it a secret.

296
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,727
I can't.

297
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,610
What do you want then?

298
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,029
Get lost.

299
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,656
Drop out of the show.

300
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:11,246
If you don't, you're screwed.

301
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,957
I'll go public with it.

302
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,923
You have no right to kick out anyone.

303
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,344
You could've resolved it
with the help of the production team.

304
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,347
But Yu-yeong lied first.

305
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,640
That's wrong, you know.

306
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:34,936
All I did was tell her
what she did was wrong.

307
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,440
Ki-baek!

308
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,609
Your mic isn't working.

309
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,658
The people making this show,

310
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,285
you may not know this,

311
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,289
but they're pouring their hearts
and souls into it.

312
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,792
What you did could've destroyed it.

313
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,294
Are you bummed that Yu-yeong left?

314
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,004
Because you liked her?

315
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:03,715
No.

316
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,095
Don't you have feelings for her?

317
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,138
No, not at all.

318
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,977
So it's not me,
and it isn't Yu-yeong either? Then…

319
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,232
The show is all about seeing how you react

320
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,527
when faced with your past love
and someone you like now, you know?

321
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,572
She's a part of my past,
but she could be someone else's present.

322
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,282
I think it could be interesting.

323
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,080
I made a misjudgment.

324
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,416
It was On Woo-ju.

325
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,669
Seriously, no more.

326
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,380
Don't do anything.

327
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,885
Hey, sorry.

328
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,971
You must've been confused
at the crossroads.

329
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,515
-Thank you.
-That was great.

330
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,558
Thank you.

331
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,864
I bet you think
I made another selfish move.

332
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,701
I told them we dated in the past,

333
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,579
without considering
whether you'd be okay with it.

334
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,420
I admit I wanted to spend
more time with you.

335
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,673
I saw the situation as my chance.
But more importantly,

336
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,512
seeing you running around
like a headless chicken on set at night

337
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,556
broke my heart.

338
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,268
Even if we broke up because you hated me,

339
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,980
and even if it'd make you hate me
even more, I had to do it.

340
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,817
So hate me all you want.

341
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:47,903
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,117
I know why you did it.
And I don't resent you.

343
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,080
I have to go.

344
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,304
Hello.

345
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,147
Mister, is that good?

346
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,358
Nobody eats chicken breast for its taste.

347
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,817
Then why do you eat it?

348
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:29,778
To prevent muscle loss.

349
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,966
Mister, this is really nice.

350
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,301
How about we swap?

351
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,930
I can't give you this. I need to eat both.
If not, I'll lose my muscle mass.

352
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,309
Hey, Un-baek.

353
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,770
Why are you still here? Go home already.

354
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:06,022
It's not like I'm here to play.

355
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,275
Hello!

356
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,986
Hey, kiddo.

357
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,490
What are you doing here?
Did you come here alone?

358
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,535
I came with my grandma.
I'm here to see my mom.

359
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:19,995
Your mom, I see.

360
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,080
Wait. Mom?

361
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,458
My mom works for a TV network,
so she's always really busy.

362
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,170
Right, you said your mom worked in TV.

363
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,633
Then by any chance,
is your grandma a hairstylist?

364
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,592
That's right.

365
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,512
You're the landlady's daughter's son?

366
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:40,765
Hey.

367
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,352
By any chance, is your mom's name O--

368
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,312
Mom!

369
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,147
Gu-won!

370
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,359
This is my mom.

371
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,361
She's the captain here.

372
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,576
-Hey, Gu-won.
-What's wrong?

373
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,411
-What--
-Going around alone is dangerous.

374
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:02,370
Okay?

375
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,498
Were you hanging out with them?

376
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,416
No.

377
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,046
That man kept talking about Ms. Loss.

378
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,505
What?

379
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,926
But this guy and I are pretty close.

380
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:21,639
Oh, I've seen him a few times
in the neighborhood. That's all.

381
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,225
Now I know he's your son.

382
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,356
Thank goodness.

383
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,691
Thank goodness, my ass.

384
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,697
What's wrong?

385
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:39,949
What?

386
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,328
Ms. Loss.

387
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,957
All right, let's see.

388
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:54,881
Woo-ju.

389
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,808
This one's pretty.
It'll look great on you.

390
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,685
Oh, really? Thank you.

391
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,482
Why did you hide that
you're Jeong-heon's ex-girlfriend?

392
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,279
Oh, that.

393
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,281
I wasn't trying to hide it, per se.

394
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,909
I liked you better
as On Woo-ju, the writer.

395
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,161
Yu-yeong probably felt the same way.

396
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,456
Pardon me?

397
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,351
Yeah, I'm in front
of the meeting hall. Hurry--

398
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,020
Isn't that Kim Jeong-heon?

399
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,440
My goodness. This is crazy.

400
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,985
No. I shouldn't embarrass Woo-ju.

401
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,155
I must keep my composure. Be graceful.

402
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,491
I'm a fan of yours.

403
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,912
I'm touched to see you in real life.
I'm touched.

404
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,956
Hello, thank you.

405
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:10,915
Wait.

406
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,793
May I get your autograph?

407
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,337
Then I'll brag about it
for the rest of my life.

408
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,214
Well, ma'am, I'm sorry.

409
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,592
He's in the middle of a shoot right now.

410
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,676
Ma'am?

411
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,053
Yes, sure thing.

412
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,472
Got a pen?

413
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,224
Here.

414
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,686
I'd love one right here.

415
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,163
Thank you.

416
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,958
-You go on ahead first.
-What?

417
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,710
-Go ahead.
-All right.

418
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:02,550
Well, it's nice to meet you.

419
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,677
-Aren't you--
-Mom.

420
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,305
Hey, Woo-ju.

421
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,057
This is my daughter.

422
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,684
Oh, you two must know each other.

423
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,397
Yes. Can I introduce myself to her?

424
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,527
Mom, come with me.
I think you gave me the wrong suitcase.

425
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,029
Wrong suitcase? What do you mean?

426
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,364
Hey, what's wrong?

427
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:35,124
How do you feel
now that you've met her again?

428
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,126
It's hard to explain.

429
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,878
She's lovely.

430
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,046
She makes me so happy.

431
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:41,172
She lit up my heart.

432
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,509
A lot of time has passed
but she hasn't changed one bit.

433
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:48,346
People don't change easily.
It's situations that change.

434
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,223
I hate that word itself.

435
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,933
Ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend.

436
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,103
Ex, ex-something. I think it's so lame.

437
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,940
I don't care if she's his first love.
It was before we met, so who cares?

438
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,985
But why did they break up?

439
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,530
I'm more curious about stuff like that
than how couples met.

440
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:08,449
The basic rules are the same as Jenga.

441
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,619
Each player will remove a block
and ask the question written on it.

442
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,538
I see, we'll play Drunk Jenga.

443
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,291
So is this like
the Jenga version of Truth or Dare?

444
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,878
It's game over once the tower falls.
The one who made it fall must drink.

445
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,838
Same thing if you don't want to answer.

446
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,797
All right, then.

447
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,302
Is Woo-ju still getting ready?

448
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,967
She should've told us
she was going to dress up.

449
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,554
-Should I take this off?
-You barely have any clothes on as it is.

450
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,192
My turn.

451
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,741
For this one…

452
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,204
I should ask someone who's honest.

453
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,290
FIRST IMPRESSION

454
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,542
Tell us your first impression
of all the girls.

455
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,549
First off, you, Hae-ri.
I thought you looked like a meerkat.

456
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:53,638
You were extending your neck so you could
look around and check out the others,

457
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,683
like a little spy. I thought it was cute.

458
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,810
That's so true.

459
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,228
And as for you, Hui-seon…

460
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,525
I don't remember. I'm sorry.

461
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,403
That's fine. I understand.

462
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,863
And Cho-hui was…

463
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,368
She was pretty.

464
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,747
We met in the broadcasting room
in the early spring,

465
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,749
and she was wearing a duffel coat.

466
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,795
She was laughing at Jeong-heon's joke.

467
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,387
As for Ms. On…

468
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,560
Poop?

469
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,565
Poop?

470
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,108
What kind of poop?

471
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,235
I think I'm better than poop.

472
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,611
Right? Me too.

473
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:55,700
Perhaps, that day changed my life.

474
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,544
Woo-ju.

475
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,297
Do memories have power?

476
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,594
Memories? No, they don't.

477
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,680
But

478
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,851
the experiences you gain
while building those memories do.

479
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,438
It means you know
that much about the person.

480
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,663
Who will you go out with tomorrow?

481
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,333
Me?

482
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,585
I haven't decided yet.

483
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:50,505
Then can I make a pitch?

484
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,636
Someone's popular!

485
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:02,433
I totally sensed the tension just now.
What's going on here?

486
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:03,893
A love triangle?

487
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,108
Interesting. Hey, Seong-jun.

488
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,360
Who's the prettiest here?

489
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,405
This is Truth or Dare,
so I can only tell the truth, right?

490
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,032
Pass.

491
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:20,535
Next.

492
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,787
Louis, make up your mind right now.

493
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,123
Cho-hui is not interested in you at all.

494
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,918
It's so hard.
I can't figure out what my heart wants.

495
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,838
What is this, supply without demand?

496
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,348
We can ask anything we want
if we get the X block, right?

497
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,451
Why did you and Woo-ju break up?

498
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,503
Well…

499
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,430
Because of my broken microwave.

500
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,394
This broke again.

501
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,107
Man. Hey, Woo-ju.

502
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,318
It'll just be a moment, all right?

503
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,485
Just a moment.

504
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,287
All right.

505
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,872
That worked.

506
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,708
Oh, man. I'm starving.

507
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,212
Why aren't you eating?

508
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:01,219
I'm convinced there's something wrong
with Ms. Bok-ja's knowledge about kimchi.

509
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,054
She's getting more creative, but this…

510
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,849
This batch is… My goodness.

511
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,310
Why did you lie?

512
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:12,063
She made it for me.
Of course I should say it's good.

513
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,898
Because you always lie,

514
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,818
my mom makes kimchi
when she doesn't even know how to do it.

515
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,655
If it's not good, just say so. Why lie?

516
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:23,407
No, I didn't lie.
You know I was just joking.

517
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,493
It's good. It really is.

518
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,454
It really is good.

519
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,044
-What are you doing?
-I don't want to eat.

520
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,421
Is it because of the microwave?

521
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,340
I'll get it fixed.

522
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,718
I'll buy a new one
when I get paid this month.

523
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,139
It was a used microwave
and you've had it long enough.

524
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,976
Why bother getting it fixed?
Just throw it out.

525
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,983
Hey, Woo-ju.
I'm not sure why you're so upset,

526
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,110
but can you please try to snap out of it?

527
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,155
Come on,
it's our third anniversary today.

528
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,408
Did I embarrass you?

529
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,451
What?

530
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,871
The woman from a family of teachers
who works at a broadcasting station.

531
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,165
Who is she? It's not me.

532
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,377
Was my mom here?

533
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,466
Hey, let's talk.

534
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,011
You're just like the others. No.

535
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,887
You're the worst.

536
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,223
You should've never acted like
you understood

537
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,392
and just pitied us like everyone else!

538
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:32,560
Hear me out. I--

539
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,856
You denied me and my mom.
That is what you did.

540
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,692
Did you think she'd never find out
that it was a lie?

541
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,028
Or were you hoping
I'd play along and lie too?

542
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,822
Hey, all is fine
if our relationship is solid.

543
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:49,285
This way, we don't have to worry about
what others might think.

544
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,246
-Woo-ju, please--
-Don't touch me!

545
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,671
Because my microwave broke.

546
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,343
Your microwave broke?

547
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,260
And?

548
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,636
You couldn't get it fixed?

549
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,181
An A-list celebrity's
heartbreaking love story

550
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,099
from the time when no one knew him?

551
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:17,271
I was beyond embarrassed

552
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:22,234
because I did something
so horribly stupid.

553
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,613
I'll just leave it at that.

554
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:27,782
I'll drink this.

555
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,877
Hey, I got a text.

556
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,796
Oh, what does it say?

557
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,930
COUPLE'S PARADISE

558
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:55,810
MESSAGE THE PERSON YOU WANT
TO GO ON A DATE WITH TOMORROW

559
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,260
-Min-gu.
-Yes, ma'am.

560
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,847
The newbies shouldn't carry
more than two boxes at a time.

561
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,975
I told you it was dangerous.
You can't see what's ahead of you.

562
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,937
Captain.

563
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,401
Be careful.
You're not here to flex your muscles.

564
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,697
Mom!

565
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,492
-What did you do?
-He's all grown up.

566
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:54,994
-Me? I was observing.
-What?

567
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,203
That's her son.

568
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,204
I know.

569
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,708
I thought Captain was single.

570
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,168
She is single.

571
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,044
A single mother.

572
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,006
-Conches.
-Yeah.

573
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:09,008
-And clams.
-Clams.

574
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,927
-Over there.
-The beach over there?

575
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,179
-Yeah.
-Wait!

576
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,517
Can I call you when we're back in Seoul?

577
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,645
Sure.

578
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,109
Then, can I get your number?

579
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,153
You already have it.

580
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,613
Check the crew directory.

581
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,323
The crew directory?

582
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,413
-Come on, Mom.
-593359…

583
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,416
It was in the directory.

584
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,959
Yes!

585
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,476
HEAVEN HOUSE

586
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,174
I'm surprised you chose me.

587
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,052
What do you want to do?

588
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,975
He's handsome. You're so hot!

589
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,321
What are we here to do?

590
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,327
First,

591
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,705
let's get you a pair of shoes.

592
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,048
My goodness, Jeong-heon. Hello.

593
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,175
-Hello.
-Come on in.

594
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,180
This red one's nice.

595
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,360
Come on…

596
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,864
I can do it myself.

597
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,115
No.

598
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,295
Woo-ju.

599
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,759
Wait, this is…

600
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:00,763
You want to go pick up trash?

601
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,515
Yeah. Let's go.

602
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,984
I got no sleep the night before I came
because I was up all night baking this.

603
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,286
Ki-baek…

604
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,459
I know how you feel.

605
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,348
Oh, man. Aren't you getting tired?

606
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,475
No, it relaxing. It helps me not think.

607
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,643
That's good.

608
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,689
Are you sure
this is all you want to do?

609
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,068
Keep picking them up. Don't slack off.

610
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,611
Hon, you'd better--

611
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,365
You'd better not slack off, Mr. Kim.

612
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,910
THIS WAY TO THE BEACH

613
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,328
We're almost there.

614
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,792
I hope

615
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,920
you'll choose me.

616
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,258
-You said you know how I feel.
-Exactly.

617
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,593
That's why I'm telling you this.

618
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:26,682
The others don't know me well, but you do.

619
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,979
You said

620
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:37,401
the people making this show were
pouring their hearts and souls into it.

621
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,611
So am I.

622
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,489
And so is Ms. On.

623
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,325
We all are.

624
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,411
Cho-hui.

625
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,579
Help me.

626
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,124
No, please like me back, Ki-baek.

627
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,170
Before I ruin myself further.

628
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:05,679
We're here.

629
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,482
THROW YOUR TRASH HERE

630
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:31,955
Shall we sit down?

631
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:34,708
Sure.

632
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,673
Know what that boulder is called?

633
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,594
Trash Boulder.

634
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,891
A long time ago, when the people
on this island didn't farm at all

635
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,310
and fished to survive,

636
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,145
there were many widows living here.

637
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:01,151
Their husbands probably went to sea
to catch fish and never came back.

638
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,282
The widows would be
stuck at home, crying all day.

639
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,201
Then grannies would come and say,

640
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,539
"Go out and pick up trash,
or you'll fall ill at this rate."

641
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:18,460
Then one of the widows picked up
a basket and started picking up trash.

642
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,755
She was devastated and couldn't sleep,
so she thought she should

643
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:23,924
just get out of the house
and do something.

644
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:30,097
Then one by one,
more widows started to join her.

645
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,975
They'd each pick up
a basket full of trash,

646
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:39,022
then leave the baskets under the boulder
and cry together for a while.

647
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,316
Hence the name, Trash Boulder.

648
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,362
It's where you get rid of things
you want to forget.

649
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,034
Woo-ju…

650
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,915
I hope you can leave it all behind,
right here.

651
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,338
The old me

652
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:06,466
and the old us.

653
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,608
You said

654
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:27,696
the people making this show were
pouring their hearts and souls into it.

655
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,240
Don't worry.

656
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,659
Ms. On is one of them.

657
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,747
If you don't choose me,

658
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,583
I will destroy everything.
On Woo-ju and this show.

659
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,545
There's a lot
I want to get out of this.

660
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,889
Ki-baek, get ready to
make your final choice.

661
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,404
One moment.

662
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:15,285
Protect your heart. You're the only one
here who can protect yourself.

663
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,953
It was cool.

664
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,373
It was cool how you left.
I've never seen anything like it.

665
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,667
Let's give it a shot, this dating…

666
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,584
show.

667
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,837
I'm sure viewers will love the real you.

668
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,590
My heart fluttered.

669
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,718
And right now, my heart is fluttering.

670
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,682
That's pretty.

671
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,547
Did something happen? What's up?

672
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,383
I like you.

673
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:54,843
What?

674
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,303
I like you, Ms. On Woo-ju.

675
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,559
After that incident,

676
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,564
I felt like losing the ability to lie
was like a punishment,

677
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,233
but when I spent time with you, I realized

678
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:16,031
maybe it's the only thing giving me hope
that I can change my life.

679
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:17,365
I really thought that.

680
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,411
It was nice, and it made me happy.

681
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,501
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

682
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,086
Sometimes I felt like
I was riding a roller coaster,

683
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:34,841
but whenever I felt like that,
you became my safety bar.

684
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:39,262
And thanks to you,
I'm still here, alive and well.

685
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,392
Ki-baek, you're emotional right now.
You need to calm down--

686
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,436
I want to protect you too, On Woo-ju.

687
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,816
Although I'm not sure if I can.

688
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,463
You can say I let you down.

689
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,384
I've got nothing to say
even if you call me a coward.

690
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:19,594
But right now…

691
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,764
I must do this.

692
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,353
I'm sorry.

693
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,779
You will now make your final choices.

694
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:15,942
Ki-baek,

695
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,779
please make your final choice.

696
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:56,107
Ki-baek chose Cho-hui.

697
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,035
Woo-ju, please make your final choice.

698
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:34,479
A MONTH LATER

699
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,023
Auntie!

700
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:39,192
My goodness.

701
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,653
How come I haven't seen you in so long?

702
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,322
Come on. You see me every day on TV.

703
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:46,366
It's been so long. Come on in.

704
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,283
All right.

705
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:50,829
Whenever you're on TV, I feel proud
as if my own son has become a star.

706
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,080
-Really?
-Yes, really.

707
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:55,500
Well, then let your superstar son
boost your sales today.

708
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:59,671
So, how many people are coming?
You rented the entire restaurant.

709
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:02,966
Just two.

710
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:31,286
Will Ki-baek become
a superstar after this? Cool.

711
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,455
I should get him on my YouTube channel.

712
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:36,583
You're always trying to ride
on someone else's coattails

713
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,251
instead of living your own life.

714
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,627
Look who's talking.

715
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,629
I know he gave you a nice allowance.

716
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,507
Oh. The gym went bankrupt,
so you should work as his manager.

717
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,385
Hey, do you think
I stayed there to make money?

718
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,721
That wasn't the reason? Then why?

719
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,432
You went there on an errand,
so why did you stay for days?

720
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,561
Are you two going to keep bickering?
You aren't kids anymore.

721
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,937
He started it, not me.

722
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,647
He ignored and belittled me first.

723
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,150
Shut it. He always has to provoke me.

724
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,526
Be quiet, both of you.

725
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,028
I'm here.

726
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,154
It's been a while.

727
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,530
Yes, hello.

728
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,823
You must be hungry.

729
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,203
It's Ki-baek!

730
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,872
It's starting. The show's starting.

731
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,749
Your daughter is really in the show too?

732
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,920
From the next episode.
You won't see her in this episode.

733
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,381
She's the heroine appearing
at the most critical moment?

734
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,424
She's a writer,

735
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,761
but she appears in TV shows?
She must be really talented.

736
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,847
I won't give away any spoilers.
Watch. Stay tuned.

737
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,069
I'm late, aren't I? Sorry.

738
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,326
The traffic was so bad.

739
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,745
What are you, the woman of the hour?

740
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,663
-Have a seat.
-Hi.

741
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,957
-Hey, what's up? Eat.
-Hello.

742
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,166
You must be hungry.

743
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,093
What's up, you two?
Why are you so awkward?

744
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:12,637
You sure you're in the same show?

745
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,974
Hey, enough talking. Just eat.

746
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,892
Why? They're so awkward.

747
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,062
Why are they awkward?

748
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,606
-Thanks for the food!
-Thank you!

749
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,525
Eat up. We can order more food.

750
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:28,862
Excuse me, we'll take the "Heon" soju!

751
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,280
-Nice one!
-Soju is a must.

752
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,948
The show's starting.

753
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,701
Didn't you say
you couldn't have dinner with me today?

754
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,287
My plans got canceled.

755
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,664
How did you find this place?

756
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:43,001
And stir-fried longarm octopus?
You can't handle spicy food.

757
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,546
WOO-JU
SORRY, I'VE GOT PLANS

758
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,589
Hey, it's good.

759
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,550
Just eat, okay?

760
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,137
What?

761
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,055
-Cheers, guys.
-Cheers!

762
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,607
-Push him.
-No, Ki-baek.

763
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,319
You'd better not lose. What are you doing?

764
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,446
Mom, I lose in the end. I lose.

765
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:12,572
I lost this match.

766
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:14,240
-Ki-baek.
-What?

767
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,910
We're enjoying the show.
Don't give away any spoilers.

768
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,036
That's a big no-no!

769
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,121
-For God's sake.
-Hey!

770
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,041
Oh, no! Get up.

771
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,918
Whoa.

772
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,429
That was very cool. Ki-baek, you rock.

773
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,306
Do you and that girl become a couple?

774
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,265
What?

775
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:43,520
These days, people participate
in shows like this

776
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,605
and get married, you know?

777
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,149
You'll wake up tomorrow
with a grandchild in your arms.

778
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,193
Did you get her pregnant?

779
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,987
All right, let's tidy up
and go downstairs.

780
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,447
-Let's tidy up.
-Yes, sir.

781
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,823
All righty.

782
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:56,950
I'm so full.

783
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,163
-Oh, boy.
-I'm really full.

784
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,040
This is so heavy.

785
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,670
Tell me later. Okay?

786
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,306
It's been a while.

787
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:22,058
Pardon me?

788
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,019
It's nothing.

789
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,104
Shoot.

790
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:13,067
I came here
so you could stay on the rooftop.

791
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,278
Right.

792
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,533
Are you really avoiding me? Why?

793
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,744
Avoiding you? Who? Me?

794
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:25,830
It was just awkward, you know.

795
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,416
And I felt bad.

796
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,087
Has it been a month since I last saw you?

797
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,383
You seemed really busy.
Going to work early and coming home late.

798
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:40,928
What? So you've been watching me.

799
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,018
So are you back on the writing team?

800
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:52,565
Oh, I'm not involved in the pilot at all,
but it could get a regular slot.

801
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:56,361
-So I prepared some things just in case.
-I see.

802
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,781
What about you? Have you been well?

803
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:01,532
Nope.

804
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:03,910
Right.

805
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,871
It's impossible not to sneeze
for a whole month.

806
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,544
But even so,
how could you not call me once?

807
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,922
I saw you every day.

808
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,807
This is our first time talking
since that day.

809
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:37,026
You should've told me!
I can't believe you didn't tell me!

810
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,990
You must've been stressed out.

811
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,869
Why didn't you tell me?

812
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,455
Well, I regretted my decision.

813
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,833
And I felt bad.

814
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,293
I didn't mean to keep it from you,

815
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,671
but I didn't realize
so much time had passed.

816
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,132
I didn't know
and was on an emotional roller coaster.

817
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,259
One day, I'd think you were a weirdo.

818
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:03,177
Then I'd get curious about you.

819
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,846
And on some days, I missed you.

820
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:10,893
You missed me?

821
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,396
Oh, I…

822
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:17,859
I missed you too.

823
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,736
You said you saw me every day.

824
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,904
I wanted to really see you.

825
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,422
I'm curious about something too.

826
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:42,300
What?

827
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:44,510
Three seconds.

828
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:48,431
What did you think about
when you were making your final choice?

829
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,237
If you feel nervous
in front of the camera,

830
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,114
close your eyes, and for three seconds,

831
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,910
think of what made you happiest recently.

832
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,051
That's pretty.

833
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,179
Yeah, pretty.

834
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,689
I will not choose anyone.

835
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,241
Yeah, pretty.

836
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,221
EPISODE 7

837
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:56,976
SENDING YOU HUGS AND KISSES

838
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,540
FRANKLY SPEAKING

839
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,293
Are you guys in a relationship?

840
01:05:22,376 --> 01:05:23,544
I'm not sure.

841
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,505
Uncertainty between a man
and a woman can be bad.

842
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,382
She never texts me first.

843
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,384
Are you dating someone, Woo-ju?

844
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:33,387
You look so much better than
the last time I saw you.

845
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:36,015
Did you start to secretly date Jeong-heon?

846
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:38,309
I guess everything will
come up roses for you now.

847
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:39,977
Come on!

848
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,604
Perhaps I should throw it away.

849
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,940
Cut! We're not doing this.

850
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,232
I like On Woo-ju.

851
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,151
Is she busy?

852
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,110
Don't be sorry.

853
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,487
I really do understand.

854
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:58,704
