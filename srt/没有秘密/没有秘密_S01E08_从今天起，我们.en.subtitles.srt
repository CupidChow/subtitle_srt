1
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,801
FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:57,807
Yeah, pretty.

3
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,074
Well…

4
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,577
-Well, I--
-We should go home now.

5
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,372
Oh, yes.

6
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,555
Oh, right.

7
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,148
EPISODE 8:
STARTING TODAY, WE ARE…

8
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,408
I just hit 20,000 followers.

9
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,118
Want to celebrate at my restaurant?

10
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,495
Congrats, but I have
back-to-back client meetings.

11
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,623
Poor Ki-baek. The pool fight
and his self-intro were hilarious.

12
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,585
I've seen tons of memes of Ki-baek
and Jeong-heon rolling around.

13
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,502
I SAW THEM TOO

14
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,046
It will create more buzz
once Woo-ju shows up next week.

15
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,094
Is she still asleep?

16
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,805
Why isn't she saying anything?

17
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,237
STILL ASLEEP?

18
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:27,165
GOOD MORNING

19
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:28,249
Damn.

20
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,046
WANT TO JOIN ME FOR BREAKFAST?

21
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,616
Ki-baek, are you up?

22
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,953
Yes. I'm up.

23
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,941
They'll start sprouting soon.
We've got to eat them before they do.

24
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,402
I told you we should get just one box.

25
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,280
The grocery store owner always buys
three sets of lotion from me,

26
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,782
so how could I buy just one box?

27
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,534
Lotion and potatoes aren't the same.

28
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,536
Lotion doesn't go bad for years.

29
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,581
Hey, Ki-baek. Couple's Paradise, huh?

30
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,499
What? Is his show getting popular?

31
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,793
It's being hashtagged a lot.

32
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,794
You're on Instagram?

33
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,798
-Just peel the potatoes.
-Is Ki-baek going to be a star?

34
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,091
I love you so much, bro.

35
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,596
Ki-baek, get a plate
and put about five of these on it.

36
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,061
Ms. On, would you like
some potato pancakes?

37
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,897
I can smell them
from all the way down here.

38
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,107
I'd be disappointed if I didn't get one!

39
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:01,986
Take this too.

40
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,467
Are you trying to break the door?

41
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,219
Jesus.

42
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,888
-Thank you.
-Sure.

43
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,017
Gosh, look at all these potato pancakes.
Thank you.

44
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,174
I feel a lot better throughout the day
when I do my morning stretches.

45
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,011
I… I was having my morning coffee.

46
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,888
Would you like some? Just a minute.

47
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,557
It's okay. I already had some.

48
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,651
-You've got something on--
-What?

49
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,248
Oh, I don't--
I don't know what it could be.

50
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,791
You're good now.

51
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,088
-Starting today, we--
-Last night--

52
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,257
-It was nice.
-We're cool.

53
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,260
Yes.

54
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,479
The show has premiered,
but nothing is really different.

55
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,730
It's quiet.

56
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,775
It just premiered. Did you think
you were going to be a star overnight?

57
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,068
I didn't mean it like that.

58
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,198
What are you doing today?

59
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,492
Nothing. What about you?

60
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,535
I'm busy.

61
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,039
I'm working on another show
to fill in for someone,

62
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,000
and I think I'll drop by
the staff meeting while I'm out.

63
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,753
Good for you.

64
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,927
Jobs will come to those
who wait patiently.

65
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,974
What a cheerful way to tell someone
with impulse control issues

66
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,560
to be patient.

67
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,111
Ki-baek,

68
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,908
I hope you'll be yourself from now on.
Honest and unpretentious.

69
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,245
It's really cute when you do that.

70
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,333
It's cute-- Dad.

71
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,044
Oh, hello.

72
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:08,047
Boy, my shoulders.
Maybe the stretches were…

73
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,433
Let's go.

74
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,523
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
WEIGH TO GO GYM

75
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,361
WEIGH TO GO GYM

76
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,988
Yes, I just wired you the rent.

77
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,865
Yes. I won't be late again.

78
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,951
I'm going to do my best! Okay, bye.

79
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,038
All right.

80
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,750
YOU CAN DO IT!

81
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,835
What's this?

82
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,258
CHAE YEON

83
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,636
Un-baek.

84
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,141
You wouldn't be able to handle it.

85
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,894
There we go.

86
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,693
"No more bites, no more excuses."

87
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,074
Excuse me.

88
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,495
1:1 PROFESSIONAL TRAINING

89
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,168
I thought I should start working out.

90
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:28,836
I see.

91
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,671
Okay.

92
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:38,971
Hello.

93
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,264
-Hi.
-Hello.

94
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:48,064
COUPLE'S PARADISE

95
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,774
COUPLE'S PARADISE
AUGUST 16

96
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,526
Hello.

97
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,947
I JUST HAD LUNCH
DON'T SKIP ANY MEALS

98
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,283
THANKS, I WON'T! KI-BAEK--

99
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,201
Oh, Ms. On.

100
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,578
Oh! Mr. Jang, hello.

101
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,664
I heard. You hit it big this time.

102
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,916
Not yet, but I hope I do.

103
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,086
-Did you change your number?
-No. Give me a call sometime.

104
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,673
Of course. I should cast you
before you become a star.

105
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,384
I didn't know you wanted
to be in front of the camera.

106
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,678
-I'll call you.
-Yes, please do.

107
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,263
Bye.

108
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,108
Hey, your show is creating quite the buzz.

109
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,527
I could feel it at the preview.

110
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,322
You were mad at us
for spending too much money.

111
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,075
How's the editing going?
I appreciate your hard work.

112
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,578
Huh? Chief, you're here too.

113
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,540
It's been a while, Woo-ju.

114
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:51,001
-Did you catch our show's premiere?
-Of course. I was just talking about it.

115
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,711
You must've worked really hard.

116
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,048
You make your first appearance
at the end of the next episode.

117
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,968
Wow, you might become famous.

118
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,177
Come on.

119
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,472
Good luck until the end. Let's go!

120
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,890
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

121
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,227
But Woo-ju,

122
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,813
you shouldn't come here
for the time being.

123
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,234
You said you wouldn't be involved
in the production.

124
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,820
What if someone sees you here
and takes issue with it?

125
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,114
Right.

126
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,700
I asked her to come.

127
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,661
If the show does well,
we'll have to discuss Woo-ju's role.

128
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:27,955
It isn't your team's place
to discuss her role.

129
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,377
If you want the series to continue,
step up the promotion game.

130
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,087
Your ratings need to go up.

131
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,214
Yes, ma'am. We'll do our best.

132
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,841
-Have you got a latte?
-Here.

133
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,636
-I'll see you.
-Bye.

134
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,846
-Take care now.
-Bye.

135
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,100
I'm sorry I barged in.

136
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,519
Since the show premiered,
I wanted to show support.

137
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,688
No, I'm sorry too. It's okay.

138
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,398
Come on. Let's just have coffee.

139
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,234
No. I was going to leave
after seeing you guys.

140
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,071
I've got to get to the set.
Bye, enjoy the coffee. Good luck.

141
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,281
-You too.
-Bye, guys.

142
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,240
Thank you.

143
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,325
Sure.

144
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,093
Do you remember Myeong-sik?

145
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,056
He and I used to run
a barbecue restaurant together.

146
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,351
He runs a chili farm in the country.

147
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,145
I'm grateful that
he sends me some every year.

148
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,939
Grateful for what?

149
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,024
He ran off with your money.

150
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,111
You're right.

151
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,572
I have nothing to thank him for.

152
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,499
It's hot out here.

153
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,460
You don't want to be on TV
with a sunburned face.

154
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,257
The chilies will burn your eyes.
Go downstairs.

155
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,685
You should put on a hat or something.

156
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,782
Yeah, I paid the hospital directly.

157
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,160
No, don't worry about it.

158
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,329
Bye.

159
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,545
After Ki-baek left,
I wondered what he was up to,

160
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,297
but you know what?

161
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,507
He's good at reality shows.

162
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,427
You know he's a pro
when he puts his mind to it.

163
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,262
You're close with him, aren't you?

164
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,305
Yes.

165
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,601
Listen. If I ever go freelance,
put in a good word for me.

166
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,522
-You're thinking about going freelance?
-Life's unpredictable.

167
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,567
This salary just won't do.

168
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,235
You should think about it too.

169
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,113
You should make as much money
as possible while you're young.

170
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,670
DEAR DAD

171
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,799
He's a no-go?

172
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,428
Man, we're all set up here.
You've got to be kidding me!

173
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,515
His appendix burst on his way here.
Can you believe that?

174
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,770
I've made some calls,
so let's wait a little longer.

175
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,356
Every minute we wait, we're wasting money.

176
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:44,068
We're a low-budget show.
We can't afford to wait.

177
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,446
We even have to set up lights
if it gets dark.

178
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,614
Should we pull out?

179
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,866
What do we do?

180
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,453
Hey, were you able to move things around?

181
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,416
Oh. No, I understand. Bye.

182
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,972
Is anyone available for a show?

183
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,809
We got an urgent call
from Local Live Info Show.

184
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,145
The shoot is in Seoul, with In-cheol
as director and Woo-ju as writer.

185
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,946
Oh, man.

186
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,864
Ms. On!

187
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,074
Yes.

188
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,909
Why didn't you tell me?

189
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:35,703
Sorry?

190
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,496
You caught me off guard.

191
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,622
I knew you could do it.

192
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,604
Oh, Ki-baek.

193
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,606
Okay, let's get started.

194
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,691
-All right.
-Yes, sir.

195
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,446
I didn't know what we were doing today,
so I just came in a suit.

196
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:22,207
BRAISED RIBS WITH SEAFOOD

197
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,638
You didn't close the salon early
because of me, did you?

198
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:41,268
No. You said your mother won't feel better
until she sees me.

199
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,314
You make everyone feel better.

200
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,192
Oh, please. Let's go.

201
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,827
Please enjoy.

202
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,504
It's been a while.

203
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,673
Yes. I hope you've been well.

204
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,133
You've gotten quite old.

205
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,969
Come on, Mother.

206
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,097
Don't say something like that to her face.

207
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,681
Why don't we eat first?

208
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,683
You like the food here.

209
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,360
Well, you haven't aged at all.

210
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,780
-You're still as beautiful as ever.
-Stop seeing Yeong-won.

211
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,827
Mother.

212
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,464
Ma'am. Goodness.

213
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,427
For nothing in return?

214
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,513
You audacious skank.

215
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,891
How dare you pursue my son
when you're destined for a miserable life?

216
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:11,650
Don't ever come near my son again.
Take that and leave him alone.

217
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,236
All right, fine.

218
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,531
Please don't yell.
If your blood pressure rises,

219
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,659
we'll have to rush you to the hospital
in the middle of your meal.

220
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,495
You tramp. Are you mocking me?

221
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,623
Mr. Kim, where are you? Get my car ready!

222
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,585
Mom.

223
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,588
I told you. It's been over ten years
since Mr. Kim retired.

224
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,732
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

225
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,697
I hate you.

226
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,577
There's a thin line between love and hate.

227
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,135
Ji-hu called me and said it seemed urgent.

228
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:24,097
Thank you, Ki-baek.
The moment I saw you, I was dazzled.

229
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,099
Dazzled? I don't know about that.

230
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,809
You know Local Live Info Show?

231
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,229
We're doing a segment called
"Mr. Kim is on the Move,"

232
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,066
but since you're here,
we'll make it "Mr. Song is on the Move."

233
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,401
-Mr. Song is on the Move.
-Yeah.

234
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,822
You're an announcer,
so you know what to do, right?

235
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,033
You're introducing this restaurant
in a fun way.

236
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,578
You can relax and speak freely.

237
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,623
Can you be more specific about
how freely I can speak?

238
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,042
I might speak more freely
than you'd expect.

239
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,586
Well, it's…

240
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,881
You know, just be your usual self.

241
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,758
Like on Couple's Paradise. No filter.

242
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:02,010
Yeah.

243
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,768
GRANDMA'S BRAISED RIBS

244
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,103
FIND! TASTY TV

245
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,437
FEATURED ON KBC-TV

246
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,772
This is delicious, ma'am.

247
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,774
-It's great.
-Your ribs are killer!

248
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,651
-So good.
-It's like my grandma's.

249
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,278
It tastes just like my grandma's.

250
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,747
If you're here to eat, grab a damn seat.
Why are you standing around?

251
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,960
-Should I sit over there?
-Are you going to eat standing up?

252
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,552
Sit.

253
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,636
Right.

254
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,849
I'll have the ribs, a large one.

255
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,893
-For how many?
-One.

256
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,395
-Then get a small one.
-Sorry?

257
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,940
You damn fool.
You're going to have a ton left over!

258
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,484
I was told to order a large.

259
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,449
You'd better take all your leftovers
with you, you damn fool!

260
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,118
Cut!

261
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,663
We'll continue when the food is ready.

262
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,461
Mom.

263
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,296
Mom, can I see you for a second?

264
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,382
Well, excuse me.

265
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,644
Mom, the microphone.

266
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,772
-Cover it like this.
-Right.

267
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:37,939
Mom!

268
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,859
You're not cursing enough today.

269
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,028
You have to make it more realistic.

270
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,032
I've been sleep-deprived lately.
That's why.

271
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,411
It makes my heart race
to curse at strangers.

272
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:54,664
Mother, we're sending Ji-a
to an English-speaking preschool.

273
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,001
I even got you some deer antler extract.

274
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,003
That's right, Mom.

275
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,798
Pretend like you're acting
and make it realistic.

276
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,342
-You got this.
-Yeah. Okay.

277
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,426
Okay.

278
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,059
I'm at Grandma's Braised Ribs,
where the chef curses at you

279
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,354
but offers you food
that disappears into your belly.

280
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:21,108
Wow, the dish looks as rustic
as your way with words.

281
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,443
All right.

282
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,370
You don't cut it this way, you damn moron.

283
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,667
This meat on the bone is the best part.

284
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,627
Are you going to throw all this away?

285
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,255
Perhaps I should throw it away.

286
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:44,631
I'm sorry?

287
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,343
The meat is too tough,
and the sauce is too spicy.

288
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,054
While you're here
preoccupied with cursing,

289
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:55,475
maybe your son and his wife are only
paying attention to how it looks.

290
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:59,938
Do you really need this
to make it look good in pictures?

291
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,482
It may look good enough for social media,

292
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,609
but as far as taste goes,
it's got nothing.

293
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:09,531
This place has had a good reputation
for over 20 years.

294
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,492
But it seems like your food
has changed so much.

295
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:20,584
How dare you say our food has changed?

296
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,255
Who's the goddamn bastard
who thinks our food has changed?

297
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,883
That'd be me.

298
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,800
What?

299
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:33,138
I used to come here all the time
with my friends when I was in college.

300
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,558
We'd come in,
order one small braised ribs

301
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,226
and share it with extra rice.

302
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,521
You'd throw in more meat
when you were giving us a sauce refill.

303
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,691
I felt bad
seeing you young boys like that,

304
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:47,235
so how could I not?

305
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,286
The radish kimchi
tastes exactly the same. It's good.

306
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,705
You make this one yourself, don't you?

307
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,292
You should do the same for the ribs.

308
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,256
They say times have changed now.

309
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:13,762
I hear young people these days eat
with their eyes, not with their mouths.

310
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,096
Come on!

311
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,058
You eat with your mouth, not your eyes.

312
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,518
-Right?
-Yes.

313
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,980
Cut! We're not doing this.

314
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,024
Mr. Seong, we're not doing this.

315
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,526
Do you know how much
we've spent on marketing?

316
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,488
This reporter must be out of his mind!

317
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,157
Come on, sir. We're not done here yet.

318
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,868
We'll keep filming
and make it all good with editing.

319
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,621
Oh, forget it. Please just stop and leave.

320
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,790
Are you trying to ruin our business?

321
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,916
What are you doing?

322
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,793
-Can we talk?
-I can't believe this.

323
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,128
-Excuse me. Just a minute.
-I'm sorry.

324
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,964
How could he be so thoughtless?

325
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,382
He must be crazy.

326
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,591
I'm sorry.

327
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,804
I messed up again, didn't I?

328
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,224
I didn't mean for things to go this way.

329
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,143
Ki-baek.

330
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,397
Were her braised ribs really good?

331
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,483
I swear they were really good.

332
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,404
Okay, let's do it.

333
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:13,363
Sorry?

334
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,657
If it's good, we should film it. Come on.

335
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:33,216
Thanks for today.
I miss you, my dear Bok-ja.

336
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,680
Excuse me. Hi.

337
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,682
Can you do my hair?

338
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:41,808
Of course.

339
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,602
So, what can I do for you today?

340
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,772
Well, something that takes a long time.

341
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,816
I'm sorry?

342
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:54,195
Whatever takes the longest time.

343
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,447
What might that be?

344
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:59,743
You could get a perm,
or you could color or bleach your hair.

345
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,244
That'd take a long time.

346
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,038
I'll do them all.

347
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,748
Sorry? All of them?

348
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,291
Yes.

349
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,544
Sure, well, please have a seat.

350
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:16,676
But if you do them all at once,
it'll damage your hair.

351
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,761
Maybe you should…

352
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,400
Ma'am.

353
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,862
Are you all right?

354
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,531
I'm okay.

355
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,647
If you want to stop filming, you can.

356
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,069
But you can also keep going if you want.

357
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,614
I'll help you.

358
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,291
-I said forget about it
-We'll be done soon. Calm down.

359
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,584
Just a few more scenes.

360
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,503
I said no.

361
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:35,422
We'll make it all good with editing.

362
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,842
-Forget it. No.
-It's going to be fantastic.

363
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:39,759
Please calm down.

364
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,846
-How do you expect me to calm down?
-Trust me on this.

365
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,055
Let's start back up.

366
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,235
Listen, dear.

367
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,945
Yes, Mother.

368
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,655
Clear the table.

369
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,657
I'm going into the kitchen.

370
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,826
Mom!

371
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,705
You can take the apron off, you damn fool.

372
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,749
Didn't you hear me?

373
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,960
And you, young man.

374
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,588
Sit back down.

375
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,551
All of you, take a seat.

376
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,597
I'll let you taste my braised ribs.

377
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,810
Whether you think it's good or bad,

378
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,521
you can go ahead
and sing about it on your show.

379
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,774
Everyone, take a seat.

380
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,610
Come on, sit. Go on.

381
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,537
-Good work.
-Well done.

382
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,538
Good night, guys.

383
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,415
Good night. Take care.

384
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,959
-See you next week.
-Good work.

385
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,753
-See you next week.
-Bye.

386
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,175
Jeong-heon, are you okay?

387
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:03,885
No, I'm not.

388
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,016
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

389
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,560
You've been working nonstop
this past month.

390
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,272
Let's go home. I'm tired.

391
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,778
Okay. Tomorrow's shoot is at six.
Should I get it pushed back?

392
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,321
No, it's fine.

393
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,073
Are you sure?

394
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,002
STILLS FROM COUPLE'S PARADISE

395
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,614
Woo-ju…

396
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,410
I hope you can leave it all behind,
right here.

397
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,121
The old me

398
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,832
and the old us.

399
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,469
I was really mad at you.

400
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,681
Being mad means you lose,
but I couldn't help it.

401
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,892
I was devastated and angry.

402
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,894
Woo-ju, back then, I--

403
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:18,978
But

404
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,606
I'm not anymore.

405
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,653
You want me to leave it all behind.
I think I already have.

406
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,160
I want to thank you.

407
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:40,166
I think I finally got some closure here.

408
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,003
Somebody once told me

409
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,925
that you can't turn on the switch
unless you turn it off first.

410
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,111
After all this time, I'm in your shoes.

411
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,502
The director wants to change the name
to "Mr. Song is on the Move"

412
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,462
and replace the host with you.

413
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,880
Come on.

414
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,382
No, seriously.

415
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,468
If you score a few shows this way,
you'll feel a lot safer.

416
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,221
If you're going to be the writer,
I'll do it.

417
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,556
If not, then no.

418
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,893
I'm just a fill-in until the head writer
comes back from her honeymoon.

419
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,186
Then I won't do it.

420
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,149
What? You're not on the brink yet,
are you?

421
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,532
Are we taking your car tomorrow?

422
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,952
Are you crazy? What are you talking about?

423
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,079
To shoot promos for Couple's Paradise.

424
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,042
What I mean is,
the two of us can't go together.

425
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,626
Aren't you going?

426
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,170
I am, but…

427
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,884
We're not in a relationship
where we can share a ride,

428
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,053
looking all chummy.

429
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,389
If we're not in the kind of relationship
where we can share a ride,

430
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,766
then what are we?

431
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,352
Honestly, I'm worried.

432
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,065
Couple's Paradise has just premiered.

433
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,399
There's no stopping now.

434
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:36,282
No matter what Min Cho-hui did
and how it affected your decision,

435
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,203
you did choose her,

436
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,916
and I didn't choose anyone.

437
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,043
Those are the facts.

438
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:52,006
And we will have to
take responsibility for that.

439
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,302
Besides, you--

440
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,553
I like you.

441
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,808
And I'm not going to be able to hide it.

442
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:13,528
I'm not sure if it'll be okay for us
to be around everyone.

443
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,115
If I don't mess up, it'll be fine.

444
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,158
Even if I do…

445
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,870
you'll be next to me.

446
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,588
I'm home.

447
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,136
-Do you need a hand?
-It's okay. You can go.

448
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,055
-I'll help you.
-Go.

449
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,058
Okay.

450
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:59,323
WEIGH TO GO GYM

451
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,714
Oh, my God.

452
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,941
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am.

453
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,402
Hi.

454
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,031
Hi.

455
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,036
Shall we start the workout?

456
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,122
Oh, yes. The workout, of course.

457
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,665
This way, please.

458
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,334
Up.

459
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,378
Up.

460
00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:01,219
You're going to feel the burn right here,
between your arms and chest.

461
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,804
-Now, again. Up.
-Up!

462
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,974
Great. Okay.

463
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,103
Be careful.

464
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,190
You have to be slow
when you bring it down.

465
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,030
I think that's enough for today.

466
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,785
You're not just lacking muscle mass,
it's practically nonexistent.

467
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,246
Let's try different things
for the next session.

468
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,082
I'm not usually in such bad shape,

469
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,418
but I've been really tired lately.

470
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,754
Man.

471
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,300
Make sure you consume protein
after working out.

472
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,596
And you're a heavy smoker,
so you've got to do cardio regularly.

473
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,889
You live close by, right?

474
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,599
You should walk here then.

475
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:51,435
Do you give these
to every member of the gym?

476
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,480
Do you still make a profit?

477
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,818
Well, I recently reopened the gym,

478
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,279
and you're the first to join
since the reopening.

479
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:06,867
I can't believe you're the first member.
I haven't even started promoting yet.

480
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,621
Boy, what a coincidence.

481
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,332
It wasn't a coincidence.

482
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,254
See you next time.

483
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:27,430
63-1, DOKSEODANG-RO 39-GIL

484
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,228
Welcome.

485
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,815
Hello.

486
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:42,820
I'd like to change the color of my hair.

487
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:44,989
It's been a day.

488
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,246
I feel like this isn't exactly
the color I wanted,

489
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,666
and I'm also thinking about
getting a perm.

490
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,588
Your hair will melt off.

491
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,217
Have a seat.
I'll give you a conditioning treatment.

492
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,432
How long will that take?

493
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,394
A long time.

494
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,040
Secure it so it doesn't wobble.

495
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:36,957
Okay.

496
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,918
-Is there a spare watch?
-Check from the front.

497
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,921
Yes.

498
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,006
Put in the gas can.

499
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,342
Oh. I-na, put in the gas can.

500
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,259
Okay.

501
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,140
You eat that all the time these days.
You never used to eat at work.

502
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:55,226
Someone said I'm cranky when I'm hungry.

503
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,187
You're cranky even when you're not hungry.

504
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,438
What?

505
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,941
Guys, let's get ready!

506
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,906
I wish I could show you the set too,
my Cho-Chos.

507
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,659
Please be patient for now.

508
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,702
I'll tell you all about it next time.

509
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:20,334
Oh, the pop-up bakery shop is going to be
in two weeks in Apgujeong.

510
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,797
I've got to go.

511
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,216
I'll do a live broadcast again soon.

512
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,974
It's been a while.

513
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,643
Yes, it's been a while.

514
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,565
You look so beautiful.

515
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,943
Have you seen my Ki-baek?

516
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,653
He said he'd come find me here.

517
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,874
He must've told you everything.

518
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:06,255
I don't want to take issue with it
and cause a stir here,

519
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,468
but you will have to explain your actions.

520
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,762
You can take issue with it all you want

521
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,182
because I did nothing wrong.

522
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:21,353
Also, I don't think it's me
who owes an explanation.

523
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,194
Everyone, stand by.

524
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,033
Min-gu, is Jeong-heon here? He's up first.

525
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:37,495
Yes, but they won't let anyone
in his greenroom.

526
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,706
What are you talking about?

527
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,099
You shouldn't do this. Just go home.

528
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,478
Mr. Kang, go tell them he can't do it.

529
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,022
Let's go.

530
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,316
Jeong-heon.

531
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,360
Take out the hairpin.

532
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,573
Come on.

533
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:24,959
You all look so different.

534
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,168
So do you.

535
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,504
Like you wouldn't have ten billion won.

536
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,130
You look starved.

537
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,883
This is what they call
a special favor for the final couples?

538
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,719
Come on, I'm jealous of you.
You guys will--

539
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:39,181
-They'll get a million views for sure.
-Definitely.

540
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,268
Wow, you guys look great in your costumes.

541
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,022
You look great, really.
This is going to be huge.

542
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,942
Where's Ki-baek?

543
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:53,237
Oh, Ki-baek is making rice cakes.

544
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,321
Already?

545
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,625
The shoot hasn't even started yet.
Do we have to do this?

546
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,296
If we don't practice now,
we'll look awkward later.

547
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,882
But we're one of the final couples.

548
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,677
We should be doing that.

549
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,688
HAVE A GREAT CHUSEOK

550
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,773
Have a great Chuseok

551
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,234
with Couple's Paradise.

552
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:36,989
Yeah, okay.

553
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,950
We'll do each couple
and then do a group scene.

554
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,933
Oh, you don't have to do that.

555
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,812
Wow, that's so romantic.

556
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:12,650
It's so obvious
that he's not over Woo-ju yet.

557
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,251
Ki-baek,

558
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,212
are you upset about something?

559
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:35,381
Me? Why do you ask?

560
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,508
Do something about your face.

561
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,223
Let's start making songpyeon.

562
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,935
Look at that.
My baby is good at making songpyeon too.

563
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,396
Right? I know a thing
or two about cooking.

564
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,605
For my character,

565
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,775
shouldn't I just wait
and take your songpyeon?

566
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,777
My character wouldn't be
doing this either.

567
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,531
What's that?
It doesn't look like songpyeon.

568
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,493
The ugly ones actually
taste better, you know.

569
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:08,747
My mom said if your songpyeon is pretty,
you'll have pretty babies.

570
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,665
Is that an egg?

571
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,000
You're supposed to make songpyeon.

572
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:21,009
Please put your songpyeon on the tray.

573
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,397
What's that?

574
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,815
Why did you make a heart?

575
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,276
Oh, that's cool.

576
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,360
A heart?

577
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:44,366
Oh, they said
I could make it however I want.

578
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,411
Did you make that for Cho-hui?

579
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,329
No.

580
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:59,590
Songpyeon is easy to eat,
but it's hard to make.

581
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:01,800
Yeah.

582
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,178
-Woo-ju.
-Yes?

583
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:08,140
You look so much better than
the last time I saw you.

584
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,351
She's right.
Are you dating someone, Woo-ju?

585
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,729
No.

586
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,523
After the final shoot, did you…

587
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,950
secretly start to date Jeong-heon?
Did you?

588
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,286
No, I didn't.

589
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,454
No.

590
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,792
All right, then.
We'll steam your songpyeon.

591
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,336
-Okay!
-Okay.

592
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,474
-Good work today.
-Take care.

593
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,934
-Bye.
-See you.

594
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,477
-Really?
-Yeah…

595
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,273
-Mr. Song Ki-baek?
-Yes?

596
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,277
Do you have anyone
assisting you with your work?

597
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,403
Like a talent agency.

598
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,197
No.

599
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,954
Let's have a cup of tea sometime.

600
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,757
See you.

601
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,259
Yeah.

602
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,388
Jeong-heon. Come on.

603
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,991
I should've turned off the switch.

604
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,951
A heart? Seriously?

605
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,078
We didn't make any eye contact,

606
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,872
and we barely said anything to each other.

607
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,875
That songpyeon almost gave us away.

608
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,628
Everyone thought
you were seeing Jeong-heon.

609
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,424
It's not often we get to wear
those kinds of costumes.

610
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,926
You looked so beautiful today.

611
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:11,763
We had angel, woodcutter, noblewoman
and servant costumes

612
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,724
but we didn't take any pictures in them.

613
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,851
Are you going to keep complaining?

614
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,273
What?

615
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,538
What's this?

616
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,416
You're brooding over
not taking any pictures together,

617
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,959
so let's do it, Mr. Rice Pounder.

618
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,254
Wait, you're being so forward.

619
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,757
I love it.

620
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,968
Just look at the camera.

621
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,137
It sends the photo to your phone too.

622
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,221
Okay.

623
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,314
We're not there yet.

624
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,067
Then let's make a heart.

625
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,694
You and your hearts.

626
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:08,945
Come on, let's do it.

627
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,163
You have such a pretty smile.

628
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,540
I can't say you're paying lip service.

629
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,460
You have a real knack
for making things awkward.

630
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,129
Didn't you say it's cute when I'm honest?

631
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,923
That's…

632
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,717
You can stop being honest.

633
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,886
You know I can't help it.

634
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,420
Oh, my God!

635
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,634
Oh, my dad.

636
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,021
Oh, hey, Ki-baek.

637
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,774
Hi. What are you doing?

638
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,192
Exercising.

639
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,611
I used to box, remember?

640
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,655
I still throw some jabs sometimes.

641
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,657
I do remember, but--

642
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,368
I'd better get home. Good night.

643
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:51,673
Well, if you saw it, you can just say so.

644
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:56,094
Shadowboxing at this late hour
seems a little random.

645
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,346
I was just flustered.

646
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,849
I've never seen you with a woman.

647
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,021
Are you guys in a relationship?

648
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,150
-No.
-It didn't seem like it.

649
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,487
Then what? Just casually dating?

650
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,322
Well, you saw it.

651
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,575
I'm not sure.

652
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:21,995
Uncertainty between a man
and a woman can be bad.

653
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,705
You'd better make things clear.

654
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,582
Will you keep it a secret?

655
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,126
Please, I'm asking you.

656
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:32,631
This is also the first time
you've ever asked me for something.

657
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,343
Right. We should get home. Let's go.

658
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,321
She talks so much in person.

659
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,114
WRITER ON WOO-JU

660
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,827
But she never texts me first.

661
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:09,292
We're not in a relationship where we can
share a ride, looking all chummy.

662
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:15,841
Uncertainty between a man
and a woman can be bad.

663
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,051
You'd better make things clear.

664
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,599
WRITER ON WOO-JU

665
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,895
NAME

666
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,407
They asked for our confirmation.
You should take a look.

667
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,785
Ms. Ma said you need to see your doctor.

668
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,036
I can take care of myself.

669
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:52,627
She said you have to talk to Dr. Choi
about your difficulty breathing yesterday.

670
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,632
Jeong-heon. I'm really worried about you.

671
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,218
Why are you overstraining yourself?

672
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,596
You'll get sick
if you keep bottling things up.

673
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,513
You're right.

674
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,310
I bottled it up and got sick.

675
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,025
Hyeong-taek.

676
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:15,942
Yeah?

677
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,945
I need the day off.
Clear my schedule for this afternoon.

678
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,197
Okay?

679
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,074
I'll go see the doctor.

680
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,536
-Hello.
-Hello.

681
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,538
Please follow me this way.

682
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,915
Okay.

683
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:31,124
This is expensive stuff.

684
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,254
Please wait here.

685
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,339
-Oh, okay.
-Okay.

686
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,925
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

687
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,011
Man…

688
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,681
Why are you having a meeting
at a hair salon?

689
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:49,559
-Are you sure I can be here too?
-I'd feel awkward alone.

690
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,519
Say you're here to get your hair done.

691
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,230
Hey, they charge you 77,000 won
for a haircut here.

692
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,607
What?

693
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,818
I hear all the big shot
freelance announcers come here.

694
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,196
I guess everything
will come up roses for you now.

695
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,073
Roses?

696
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,824
Please. I'm in the jungle.

697
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,995
Instead of the jungle, perhaps you should
think of it as the land of opportunities.

698
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,539
I didn't know you had company.

699
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:13,541
This is Yoon Ji-hu, a JBC announcer.

700
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,628
Hey, this is Director Ma Mi-ra
of Forever C&C.

701
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:18,630
Nice to meet you. I'm Yoon Ji-hu.

702
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,298
Right. Nice to meet you too.

703
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,428
Let's cut it a little bit
and add some curls.

704
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:35,105
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M AT A HAIR SALON

705
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,272
I'M AT HOME

706
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:40,110
I'M A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW

707
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:46,491
OKAY, TEXT ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE

708
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,999
How many TV shows do you think are

709
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,543
available for
a freelance announcer to host?

710
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,963
Thirty? Fifty?

711
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:04,175
Even just with the major TV stations,
K has 29 variety shows

712
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,136
and 65 current affairs and cultural shows.

713
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,888
S has 8 variety shows,
23 current affairs and cultural,

714
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,017
and M has 24 variety shows
and 30 current affairs and cultural.

715
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,977
But since they have in-house announcers,

716
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,229
cable channels are
the best bet for freelancers.

717
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:20,900
Even just the four major ones
roughly have more than 100 variety shows

718
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,946
and 200 current affairs and cultural shows
airing 24-7.

719
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,615
There are hundreds of shows available.

720
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:34,080
The days when you had to work
for some coffee money

721
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,373
are now over.

722
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,460
Hey, you're going to make some big money.

723
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,794
Variety shows? Cultural?

724
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,839
You can do anything you want
if you work with me.

725
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,549
What about news shows?

726
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:47,677
Right. News.

727
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,767
Why not? If you're capable,
the possibilities are endless.

728
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:58,104
Oh, Ms. Ma. You're here.

729
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,397
Hi, Ms. Sim.

730
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,982
Is Jeong-heon coming here today?

731
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,068
He said he was going to the hair salon.

732
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,445
No, he didn't make an appointment.

733
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,614
What's going on?

734
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,948
Did he go someplace else?

735
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,910
Ms. Sim, did you guys have an argument?

736
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:15,080
No! Of course not.

737
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,547
I'm a big fan of yours, Jeong-heon.

738
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,841
What? Thank you.

739
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:30,261
I bet you can't find one person
in this country who dislikes you.

740
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,263
That's not true.

741
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:35,016
My daughter liked you so much too.

742
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:38,394
She'd go on and on about you,
calling you her "Heony."

743
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:43,108
She was spending night after night
with a guy I'd never even met,

744
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:47,362
and I still made kimchi
and all kinds of other dishes for him.

745
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,947
Right.

746
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:52,200
She always puts on a naive smile at work,

747
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:56,329
so people don't know
how she's really feeling inside. But…

748
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,626
I do.

749
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,338
I can tell.

750
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:11,469
I know when that fool's feelings are hurt,
just by looking at her face.

751
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,641
I don't know what happened
because Woo-ju never told me.

752
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,227
But you know what?

753
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:22,522
I don't care if her "Heony"
is some beggar in the street

754
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,233
or the biggest celebrity in the country.

755
00:57:26,067 --> 00:57:29,279
If he's the kind of guy who casts
a shadow over my daughter's face,

756
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,905
I will end him.

757
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,660
I'm sorry I came so late, Ms. On.

758
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,413
I'm sorry.

759
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,541
I came to apologize today.

760
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,631
I didn't realize until it was too late.

761
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,970
He said he wanted to get married.

762
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,475
He's told you
about our family situation, right?

763
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:03,980
His successful father has always
treated him like a troublemaker,

764
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:09,777
but he's worked hard to live the life
he wants and never asked us for anything.

765
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:16,284
I'll be honest. I pried a little.

766
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:20,538
He said he wants to get married
but didn't tell me anything about you.

767
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,165
Oh, right.

768
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,876
You are

769
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,504
as beautiful as he said.

770
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,340
Thank you.

771
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,553
I hear your parents are both teachers.

772
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:38,681
And that they work in another region.

773
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:43,686
And I heard you work
at a broadcasting station.

774
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,439
You two probably understand
each other well then.

775
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,191
JBC, is it?

776
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:50,902
Back then,

777
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:56,241
I thought I was protecting Woo-ju
by lying.

778
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:01,579
I hope you won't be offended
by what I'm about to say.

779
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:09,337
You and Jeong-heon can get married
whenever you want.

780
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:14,926
Just give me some time
to convince my husband.

781
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:20,723
You can marry him
and join our family then.

782
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:22,433
Okay?

783
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:26,938
I'm sorry.

784
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,940
No, I'm sorry.

785
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,070
Such a beautiful and wonderful woman
like you says she likes Jeong-heon.

786
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,782
Thank you.

787
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:45,456
I hid Woo-ju's wound
so no one could rub salt in it.

788
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,170
What Woo-ju really wanted from me

789
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:55,049
was just to accept it as it was, but I…

790
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,344
I was foolish.

791
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,269
I'm sorry, Ms. On.

792
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:09,272
I know I hurt you too.

793
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,279
Come out of there already.

794
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,765
SONG KI-BAEK:
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

795
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,600
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

796
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,438
Want to grab dinner?

797
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:52,690
Since we got a haircut,
how about a food court?

798
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:55,443
-Ji-hu.
-What?

799
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,071
I like On Woo-ju.

800
01:00:58,154 --> 01:00:58,988
And?

801
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,948
What? You knew?

802
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:05,286
No. But you two have been
through thick and thin,

803
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,330
and you live upstairs from her.

804
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,665
It's not a surprise.

805
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,291
I see.

806
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,627
So, food court?

807
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,754
When I was talking to Ms. Ma earlier,

808
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:16,631
I kept thinking about Woo-ju.

809
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:22,136
Thinking that I want to talk
to her about my future.

810
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,847
I'll just go by myself.

811
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,850
She's the only one
I want to talk to about that stuff.

812
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,686
I want a special relationship with her.

813
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:32,397
But I don't know.

814
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:37,318
I don't know if she feels
the same way about me.

815
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,696
And where we stand exactly.

816
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,575
Listen, Ki-baek.

817
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:49,288
I chased after my wife for a year
before we started dating.

818
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,998
Guess how many times I asked her out.

819
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:52,625
Ten times?

820
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,336
No, if I had,
I would've been arrested for stalking.

821
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,254
How many times?

822
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,380
Just once.

823
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,843
All I could do was hover around her,
and it was driving me crazy.

824
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:05,054
So one day, I got myself really drunk,
went to her house,

825
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:07,640
and I sang.

826
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:11,394
-She didn't call the cops?
-Her neighbor did.

827
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,897
She came down to the station
to give a statement.

828
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,236
I asked her out that day,
and she said yes, just like that.

829
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,030
I wasted a year for nothing.

830
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:27,994
So you never know until you ask.

831
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,956
Hi, Sol.
Are you in the mood for a Swiss roll?

832
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,125
Yeah, all right.

833
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,337
Ki-baek. Don't waste your time
and go ask her.

834
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,422
I'll see you.

835
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,551
Bye.

836
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,571
I'm sorry, Woo-ju.

837
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,782
I'm sorry.

838
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,328
That's what I came to say.

839
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,916
But I guess I'm too late.

840
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:27,678
Where are you?
I really need to talk to you today.

841
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,225
Oh, they have…

842
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:39,982
No.

843
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,068
Thank you

844
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,028
for telling me this.

845
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,699
I thought about it a lot, actually.

846
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:53,996
I thought, "Maybe he was really just
trying to protect me."

847
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:59,418
"Maybe he was trying his best
to love someone who's got a story

848
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,005
that people would frown upon."

849
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,843
Because I loved you so much.

850
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,556
I tried to rationalize it
and understand you.

851
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:15,810
But

852
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,688
now I really do understand.

853
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,442
So don't be sorry.

854
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,755
Why isn't she responding?

855
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:47,174
Is she busy?

856
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,312
SONG KI-BAEK: I WANT TO SEE YOU

857
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:02,690
Is Song Ki-baek the person
in your heart right now?

858
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,280
Why am I so nervous?

859
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:12,867
Should I tell her tomorrow?

860
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:17,830
Let's tell her.

861
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:19,790
I should tell her.

862
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,861
FRANKLY SPEAKING

863
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,990
The real-time ratings are
over ten percent!

864
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:34,907
Congrats.

865
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,950
I'm a huge fan!

866
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,743
Oh, it's him. It's Song Ki-baek!

867
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:38,869
It's Song Ki-baek.

868
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:42,498
He went on Couple's Paradise or whatever
and made a complete fool of himself.

869
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,709
She rejected Jeong-heon?
I hate On Woo-ju.

870
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,919
On Woo-ju is out of her damn mind.

871
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,672
The series can't continue with Woo-ju.
Let's do what's best.

872
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:52,049
Are you and Ki-baek doing okay?

873
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,592
Should I just retire?

874
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,430
Ki-baek made the news
for the wrong reasons!

875
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:58,764
