1
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,801
FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,225
What the…

3
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,981
Oh… You woke up.

4
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,366
You shouldn't see that. It's…

5
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,076
YEON
WHAT IS GOING ON?

6
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,204
COUPLE'S PARADISE!
EVERYTHING WAS A LIE?!

7
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,462
Ki-baek… isn't my boyfriend.

8
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,049
-Wait, what on earth…
-Ki-baek and Ms. On Woo-ju.

9
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,095
They were already a couple before
we started filming Couple's Paradise.

10
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:02,724
Ms. On got jealous of
her boyfriend's love interest in the show,

11
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,394
Ms. Choi Yu-yeong,
and kicked her off the show in the end.

12
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,522
Regarding this matter,
the production crew…

13
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,818
EPISODE 10: A BOLT FROM THE BLUE

14
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,403
Whoa, no way! Mom!

15
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,696
What's the matter?

16
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,114
-Mom.
-What is it?

17
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,158
-Ki-baek's love life is on the news!
-What?

18
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,827
That only happens to famous people--

19
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:24,537
My goodness!

20
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,124
-Ki-baek is famous, isn't he?
-Don't be surprised.

21
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,501
LET US LOVE EACH OTHER

22
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,794
"On Woo-ju"?

23
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,172
Ms. On's daughter?

24
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,842
WE'RE CLOSED TODAY
MADAME ON

25
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,621
I'm sorry!

26
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,294
-I'm sorry.
-Let's discuss what we're going to do.

27
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,047
But why are they discussing it here?

28
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,800
Should I go get some fruit for everyone?

29
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,303
People keep showing up at the TV station

30
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,098
and our meeting room
to make a fuss about it.

31
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,685
And if people see you two together,
it won't do us any good.

32
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,898
All right. In the video
that Min Cho-hui posted,

33
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,193
she takes issue with two things.
Number one.

34
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,737
Ki-baek and Ms. On Woo-ju.
They were already a couple

35
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,699
before we started filming
Couple's Paradise.

36
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,075
Hold tight!

37
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,829
And that's how Song Ki-baek,
who wasn't well-known, got cast

38
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,372
thanks to the head writer.

39
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,582
Your daughter has that much influence?

40
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,625
Influence? No.

41
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,878
I ask for a celebrity's autograph,
and she says it's abuse of power--

42
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,256
-Mom. I didn't do that.
-You did!

43
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,341
Now, number two.

44
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,053
Ms. On got jealous of
her boyfriend's love interest in the show…

45
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,140
On Woo-ju revealed her ambition
to become a celebrity,

46
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,227
kicked Choi Yu-yeong off the show,
and took her place.

47
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,813
Interesting.

48
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,733
First, let me go talk to Min Cho-hui.

49
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,320
You can't. She's already gone to France.

50
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,237
What?

51
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,948
She screwed us over and fled.

52
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,869
Should we go to France to find her?

53
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,871
Let me get the facts straight.

54
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,333
Your relationship began
after Couple's Paradise,

55
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,627
and the person who drove off
Yu-yeong was Cho-hui. Correct?

56
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,254
-Yes.
-Yes, that's right.

57
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:43,468
Well, then, should we think
about how to argue this?

58
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:48,806
We can argue all we want,
but there's no proof.

59
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,392
Would that work?

60
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,478
What else then? We do nothing?

61
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,271
Man, I don't know.

62
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,025
What if we're just giving people
another form of entertainment?

63
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,632
Man, this is completely untrue.

64
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,011
What are you up to?

65
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,930
Why'd you make rice balls?

66
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:31,641
They're combat rations.

67
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:42,235
COUPLE'S PARADISE

68
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,198
GENIE EDU

69
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,538
IS IT TRUE ABOUT SONG KI-BAEK?
POOR CHO-HUI

70
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,248
THIS IS ALL JUST A BIG PR STUNT

71
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,499
ISN'T THIS A MEDIA STUNT?

72
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,584
WHY THE BIG DEAL
OVER SOME ORDINARY PEOPLE?

73
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,588
I HATE ON WOO-JU MORE

74
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,965
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,845
ANYWAY,
SONG KI-BAEK TOTALLY SUCKS

76
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,139
Ki-baek.

77
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,100
Are you dating On Woo-ju?

78
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,810
Yes.

79
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:22,275
From now on, your answer
to every question should be no.

80
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,360
All right?

81
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,822
You must have an interview to explain it.

82
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,657
You and Ms. On Woo-ju have to

83
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,827
get your acts together,
or you'll both go down.

84
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,330
You don't have any feelings
for each other.

85
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,000
There's nothing going on between you two.

86
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:45,006
Happy birthday to you

87
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,552
Happy birthday, dear Cho-hui

88
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,388
Happy birthday to you

89
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,892
I just put 30 candles on the cake.

90
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,436
I wanted to go with three,
but she stuck them all in.

91
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,652
YOU'RE SO CRAZY ABOUT MEN…
APOLOGIZE TO CHO-HUI

92
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,613
YOU TOYED WITH SOMEONE'S FEELINGS
JUST DIE

93
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,242
0 FOLLOWERS

94
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,293
You blew out
all those candles like a champ.

95
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:23,419
Yeah, totally.

96
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,505
It was this night for sure.

97
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:28,925
Thanks, everyone.

98
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,469
Can't believe today's your birthday.

99
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,358
Is it true our show may not continue?

100
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,778
They've already taken it off
the on-demand streaming service.

101
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,572
And they shut down
the viewers' comment section.

102
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,785
You all look pretty chill.

103
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,704
Am I the only one who's worried
the show might be canceled?

104
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,873
Chief.

105
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,670
I get that you're upset,
but we're the victims here.

106
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,637
Woo-ju. I'm so disappointed.
I'm upset and sad.

107
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,639
I'm sorry, Chief.

108
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,518
No, no. If you were sorry,
you wouldn't be here.

109
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,313
If you're really sorry,
you should go out there and tell everyone

110
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,985
that there's nothing going on between you
and Song Ki-baek, don't you think?

111
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,362
-Chief.
-What?

112
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,615
-Come on, let's talk outside.
-What? Am I wrong?

113
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,992
Chief.

114
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,329
I'm sorry, guys.

115
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,250
If you say sorry,
it'll make us look like fools.

116
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,421
None of us did anything wrong.
All our efforts were genuine.

117
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,717
You're right. I'm not sorry, but…

118
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,803
Here. It's what you asked for.

119
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,685
Thanks.

120
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,702
I'm really not okay.

121
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,499
I'm screwed. I fell for you,
and now I'm totally screwed.

122
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,295
Well, who takes a couple picture
in the street anymore?

123
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,756
Everyone goes to
those photo booths nowadays.

124
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,050
Are you blaming me for that?

125
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,595
You were scowling at me
like you absolutely had to get a picture.

126
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,180
I didn't scowl at you.

127
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,350
I was looking at you because
you're pretty, and that's your fault.

128
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,603
Even if you thought I was pretty…

129
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,777
So, did Ms. Ma give you
a good dressing-down?

130
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,074
My agency wants me to do
an interview and explain.

131
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,701
Right.

132
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,371
That's the reasonable thing to do.

133
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,332
This all happened
because of someone's lies,

134
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,295
but to think that
we have to lie as well to fix it…

135
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,048
This is so hard.

136
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,511
What about you?
Did you get a good talking-to?

137
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:23,099
I'm thinking about quitting the Internet.

138
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,727
I told you not to read the comments.
You never listen to what I say.

139
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:30,064
I hope they know
we do read all those comments.

140
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:35,403
I wish it were just us reading them,
like private texts or emails.

141
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,535
No, that's not it.
On Woo-ju is the crazy bitch.

142
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,954
I knew something was off
when Choi Yu-yeong left.

143
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,708
She probably wanted to become
a celebrity too. She's a total nutcase.

144
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,336
The more I talk about her,
the angrier I get.

145
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,802
She's my daughter.

146
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,555
Oh, I see.

147
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,852
Ma'am, how much do I owe you?

148
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,854
-You don't have to pay me.
-Sorry?

149
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,862
If you go out and take a left,
there's a new twisted donut place.

150
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,614
Use that money
to get yourself some donuts.

151
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,866
You'll feel better.

152
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,701
They're really good.

153
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,078
Okay.

154
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,928
KNOW THAT HATEFUL COMMENTS
ARE ALSO A FORM OF VIOLENCE

155
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,894
THEY DON'T DESERVE OUR LOVE

156
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,563
SONG KI-BAEK!
AS A FAN, I TRUST YOU

157
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:17,963
Where is everybody?

158
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,966
Mom and Pung-baek went out.

159
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,593
-And Dad?
-In his room.

160
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,639
He's been in there since yesterday.
What's he doing?

161
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,808
-Fighting.
-Fighting? Fighting who?

162
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,646
-Do you know Dad's on Instagram?
-Instagram?

163
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,189
He follows me and Pung-baek.

164
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,858
If you ever get an account, let him know.

165
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,366
He's been busy all day
reporting your haters

166
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,909
and replying to their comments.

167
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,513
Why did you want to see me?

168
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,558
What, are you here to see Woo-ju?

169
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:16,730
You've got a new habit of saying things
without filtering them through your brain.

170
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,943
You're just as thoughtless as I am.

171
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,989
So why did you want to see me?

172
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,866
No reason. Just checking in.

173
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,703
God, you know,
you're still as nosy as ever.

174
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,374
What? Are you going to get angry
at me again for being nosy?

175
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,295
That was ages ago.
And you came anyway knowing that I might.

176
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:40,838
Ki-baek.

177
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,855
What Un-beom gave you was supposed
to pay for his academy fees.

178
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,816
I didn't tell my mom about your situation.

179
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,985
I just told her you were having trouble,

180
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,070
and she gave me my allowance in advance.

181
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,913
Did I ask you for money?

182
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,957
Come on. Don't take it that way.

183
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,090
I'm sorry if I offended you.

184
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,017
But you're my friend.
I didn't know about your situation before,

185
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,227
but now that I do, I can't just ignore it.

186
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,104
Are you really my friend?

187
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,485
Would a friend make you look
like a beggar?

188
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:47,780
Just admit that you feel superior
now that you know I'm flat broke

189
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,908
and not nearly as cool
as you thought I was.

190
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,993
I don't need your pity.

191
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,913
You have a successful dad,
so what would you know?

192
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,247
What did you just say?

193
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,088
-Let go! Damn it!
-Let go!

194
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,507
I just wanted to help you, you idiot!

195
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,550
I've never told that to anyone but you!

196
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,762
And it wasn't because
I wanted your pity or help!

197
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,472
I know.

198
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:18,435
I bet Ms. Ma is badgering you
to deny everything.

199
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:24,608
You know,
I never knew why people liked me,

200
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,068
but now they hate me.

201
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,029
It feels like they're beating me up,
but I can't even speak.

202
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,740
My heart races a dozen times a day.

203
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,286
Right, I didn't want to know that
in such detail.

204
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,373
How have you been dealing
with people like that?

205
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,208
Not everyone is like that.

206
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,629
You shouldn't try to be on top of things
at times like this.

207
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,799
-What?
-What people think about you?

208
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,510
You can't control that anyway.

209
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,472
You can't even control
what the woman you like thinks about you.

210
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,475
Just

211
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,061
do what you can do.

212
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,564
Which is what?

213
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,443
Even if people call you a fraud or a liar,

214
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,611
just continue to be yourself.

215
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,408
Then some of them will like you again,
and some will still hate you.

216
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,834
Thanks.

217
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,882
And I was

218
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,927
grateful to you back then,
though I never said it.

219
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,351
What are you saying?
Shut up. You're making me cringe.

220
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,161
-Who the hell are you?
-You bitch!

221
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,123
How dare you toy with someone's feelings?

222
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,708
-Call the police! Hurry!
-Let go!

223
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,751
Oh, right.

224
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,800
SEONGDONG POLICE STATION

225
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,933
Jesus, what is this?

226
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,772
Look, why did you do it?

227
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,818
You're in for property damage
and attempted aggravated assault.

228
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,779
Even first-time offenders serve time
for the latter.

229
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,448
You're a young person.
What are you going to do?

230
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,745
I'm a fan.

231
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,541
I like you very much.

232
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,210
Right.

233
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,755
That's why I did it,
because I like him too.

234
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,382
-What's that?
-Jeong-heon.

235
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,302
I only did it because I like you.

236
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,387
You see, I'm a fan of Jeong-heon's.

237
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,181
On Woo-ju, that damn girl!

238
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,476
She kicked you to the curb
for that Song Ki-baek or whatever.

239
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,229
It must've been so hard for you.

240
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,316
My God, look how gaunt you are!

241
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,489
I don't want you to be unhappy.

242
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:07,331
You shouldn't have settled
with her so easily.

243
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,082
She said she was sorry.

244
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,545
It was a difficult situation
because she's a fan. Thank you.

245
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,757
Not at all. No one got hurt,
and she's going to pay for the window.

246
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,966
You can go.

247
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,096
-Jeong-heon, are you all right?
-Huh? Yeah.

248
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,514
Let's go.

249
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,603
Ki-baek, you should take Woo-ju home.

250
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,355
-Yeah.
-I'll see you.

251
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,274
Jeong-heon.

252
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,861
Get home safely.

253
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,113
Take care of her.

254
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:41,907
Sure.

255
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,245
Thank you.

256
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,462
Jeong-heon.

257
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,633
You've dealt with crazy fans before.

258
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,053
Jeong-heon.

259
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,098
She likes me so much that…

260
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,143
she wanted to kill someone.

261
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,563
And I make a living out
of people like that.

262
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,235
I'm so sick and tired of it.

263
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:22,030
Of course, you are.
That girl looked totally insane.

264
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,492
No, I'm sick of myself.

265
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,541
I couldn't even say anything to her.

266
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,585
I just waited for the lawyer
to come and speak for me,

267
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,880
and I was relieved
when Woo-ju said she'd settle.

268
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,633
Jeong-heon.

269
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,177
Can I call myself successful?

270
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,820
I told you. I'm really okay.

271
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,659
You know I'd tell you if I weren't.

272
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,746
I'm not okay with this.

273
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,584
The threat was real this time.
You could've gotten hurt.

274
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:19,421
I am not okay with this at all.

275
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,764
Hi, this is Song Ki-baek.

276
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,934
I'll do the interview like you said.

277
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,770
Yes.

278
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,480
Thank you.

279
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,239
Even if it involves lying,

280
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,867
let's do everything we can.

281
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,641
SONG KI-BAEK PRESS INTERVIEW
REFERENCE SHEET

282
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,980
I'm glad you changed your mind
about the interview.

283
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,442
This is the only way
to solve the situation.

284
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,029
Tell them nothing's going on
between you and Woo-ju.

285
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,698
Okay.

286
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:32,285
They're all reporters I know very well.
You can relax.

287
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,168
Can you smile for me?

288
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,671
Yes, good. All right.

289
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,008
You went from being an announcer
who only spoke the truth

290
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,637
to launching your freelance career
and excelling in variety shows.

291
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,097
"Honest and sincere."

292
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,975
Those are perfect key words
to describe your character.

293
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:59,437
Thank you. Since my days as
an announcer, sincerity and truthfulness--

294
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,735
I'm sorry.

295
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:11,074
Sincerity and truthfulness have
always been the only values I pursued.

296
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,369
Speaking of sincerity and truthfulness,

297
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,788
you've been receiving
a lot of attention, Ki-baek.

298
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,875
Couple's Paradise is hot right now.

299
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,459
Yes.

300
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,671
When you and Ms. Min Cho-hui
became a couple in the end,

301
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,882
your fans were very excited.

302
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,969
But it doesn't seem like you guys
have been doing well since then.

303
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,265
Oh, that's not really true.

304
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,268
If it's not true,

305
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,229
are you saying there has been
a misunderstanding?

306
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:43,773
That's right.

307
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,069
Cho-hui caused
a misunderstanding and left town.

308
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,031
If I could,
I'd fly over to Paris and just…

309
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,246
That's funny.

310
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,963
This is not what I wanted to tell you.

311
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,802
You can relax. I'm sure you have
your own side of the story.

312
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,262
Please take your time.

313
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,263
Okay.

314
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,265
Take my time

315
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,768
and relax.

316
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,065
No one cares about details.
Everyone just believes Cho-hui

317
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,317
and is throwing stones at me.
Isn't that wrong?

318
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,402
No one's listening to what I have to say.

319
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:32,656
Okay, so are you saying that
Ms. Min Cho-hui told lies?

320
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,658
They are lies. Well, not all of them.

321
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,743
What exactly is a lie and what isn't?

322
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,287
I'll tell you
if you'll write about it honestly.

323
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,206
-Are you and Ms. On Woo-ju together?
-Yes!

324
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,541
-What?
-Oh, my God.

325
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,543
You're together? This is a huge scoop!

326
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,379
-Mr. An, let's take a break.
-Everyone.

327
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,964
Let's take a short break--

328
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,757
A break? We only have an hour.

329
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,134
If you and Woo-ju are in fact together…

330
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,346
That's not what you're supposed to say.
Get it together, okay?

331
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,682
-If it's not true, please explain.
-That's a lie!

332
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:01,268
-Do you have any proof to back it up?
-Well--

333
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,354
Why reveal this now
when it could escalate things?

334
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,690
-That's…
-We'll wrap things up here.

335
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,608
-Thanks.
-But this will make a good story.

336
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,943
Wait, Ki-baek.

337
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,198
Wait.

338
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,093
I'm sorry.
I have something I must tell you.

339
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,886
You're On Woo-ju, aren't you?

340
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,432
What is the matter with you two?
Are you insane?

341
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,560
Everything Min Cho-hui said
in her video is a lie.

342
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,773
It wasn't me who drove off Yu-yeong.
It was Cho-hui.

343
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:59,117
In here, I have a video that proves
Cho-hui was blackmailing Yu-yeong.

344
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:05,749
He said I-su has a picture of you two
as his phone wallpaper

345
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,751
and told him you're his girlfriend.

346
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,753
Cho-hui. Please keep it a secret.

347
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,212
I can't.

348
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,173
What do you want, then?

349
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,425
Get lost. Drop out of the show.

350
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,927
If you don't,

351
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,890
you're screwed. I'll go public with it.

352
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,518
One of the fixed cameras on set
caught their voices.

353
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,356
The editors missed it
because no one was in the shot.

354
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,107
I need Song Ki-baek.

355
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,777
With Kim Jeong-heon,
things may not go how I want.

356
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,238
-Did you meet with her?
-She's right here with me.

357
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,830
And I've brought a witness.

358
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,586
Hello.

359
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,838
Yu-yeong can join the interview.

360
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,094
Ki-baek. Are you okay?

361
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,306
What about your relationship
with each other?

362
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,269
It's true.

363
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,647
I really like her!

364
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,734
I wasn't going to tell you,
but it's true, and I can't deny--

365
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,944
Yes, we're together.

366
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,323
Wow, this is incredible.

367
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,991
Oh, my God.

368
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,995
But it's not true that
we were dating before the show

369
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,622
for some sort of personal gain.

370
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,875
Right. It was when we were
finished with the show

371
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,461
that I asked her out.

372
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:43,346
I know you may or may not believe
what we tell you.

373
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,182
-But the two of us--
-We will not lie anymore.

374
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:55,817
On Woo-ju and Song Ki-baek are a couple!

375
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,403
-Wow, this is…
-This is a huge scoop!

376
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,281
Man, what a scoop.

377
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,033
Wow, this is totally…

378
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,118
WE ARE A COUPLE

379
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,966
HAIL TO ALL COUPLES!
THE TRUTH OF PARADISE

380
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,075
They call you the Hooray Couple.

381
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,661
The comments are…

382
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,331
Half critical, half caring.
Everything is half and half.

383
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,916
That's true, but…

384
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,628
-Kim Myeong-ji did drugs?
-Really?

385
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,505
He named 12 accomplices,

386
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,924
including politicians and celebrities.
That's crazy.

387
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,510
Wow. I never thought
he'd do something like that.

388
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:05,303
-I know.
-Wait.

389
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:09,265
Does that mean this whole thing
about Ki-baek has blown over?

390
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,267
That's great, isn't it?

391
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,062
Ki-baek and Woo-ju are
already yesterday's news.

392
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,071
That looks nice.

393
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,533
GOLD RESORT
EXCLUSIVE LIMITED-TIME OFFER

394
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,952
Maybe we should all take a trip there.

395
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,995
Like we can afford it.

396
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,249
We've never taken a trip together,
all five of us.

397
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,507
WEIGH TO GO GYM

398
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,555
LUNGE, OVERHEAD DUMBBELL PRESS

399
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,267
WIDE SQUAT

400
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:00,275
Captain, are you lifting
enough weights at home?

401
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,489
-Wow.
-Think about me while you do it.

402
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,034
Should I come back
for another workout this evening?

403
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,871
I have some training sessions
scheduled this evening.

404
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,913
I see.

405
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,584
Come later at night.

406
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,878
Okay.

407
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,171
I ran into Gu-won a few days ago.

408
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,089
Really?

409
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,301
How come he doesn't like fried chicken?
That's unusual.

410
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,679
Gu-won does like fried chicken.
He loves it.

411
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,930
What?

412
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:34,267
His drone was stuck in a tree,
so I helped him get it out.

413
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,144
Didn't he tell you?

414
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,354
He didn't.

415
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,940
That's weird.

416
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,651
Gu-won tells me everything,

417
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,779
even little things like
how his shoelaces came undone.

418
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,243
Let's just work out.

419
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,760
What if someone sees us?

420
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:11,888
So what? We're the Hooray Couple.
The whole world knows.

421
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,308
I don't know if it's good or bad,
but people don't seem too interested.

422
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,897
Yesterday, I thought all those people
were going to bite us to death.

423
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,067
They have so many other things
to bite in here.

424
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,946
Thank you.

425
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,490
For not making me lie.

426
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,910
I'm sorry I pressured you into lying.

427
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:41,542
What happened to your switch yesterday?
You said you didn't sneeze.

428
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,591
Try lying about anything.

429
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,179
Here. "On Woo-ju and Song Ki-baek
are not a couple."

430
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,140
On Woo-ju and Song Ki-baek…

431
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:58,977
are a couple.

432
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,019
What?

433
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,187
We definitely are.

434
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,439
Come on, I'm not joking.

435
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,442
Try it. "Song Ki-baek is a woman."

436
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,028
Song Ki-baek…

437
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,783
is a man.

438
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,994
Why?

439
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,371
I mean, why isn't it working?

440
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,751
Do you feel the same?

441
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,847
The switch is gone.

442
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,726
Now, lightning will strike all the time.

443
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,729
Oh, lightning will strike?

444
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,815
It may seem like the recent incident
has been resolved somehow,

445
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,735
but I don't know what mistakes
I'll make in the future

446
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,945
and who I might end up hurting.

447
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,406
In the future?

448
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,200
Even the switch is gone now.

449
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,995
There is no one
who can put the brakes on me.

450
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:04,000
The people I like,
the people I love, my family…

451
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,419
I'll be causing trouble for them.

452
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,713
No, I already am.

453
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,339
It must've been really hard.

454
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,676
For everyone you love,
including your family.

455
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,720
Yeah.

456
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,389
-And?
-Sorry?

457
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,143
So what did you do for them after that?

458
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,812
I didn't exactly do anything.

459
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,571
"Oh, I'm going to be struck by lightning."

460
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,743
-Can anyone anticipate that?
-No.

461
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,579
Can anyone avoid lightning
because they plan to?

462
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,331
You can't.

463
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,250
So what are you worried about?
There's nothing you can do.

464
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,924
The future comes after the present.

465
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,968
Find something you can do in the present.

466
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,388
-"The future comes after the present."
-After.

467
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,682
-"Something I can do in the present."
-Find it.

468
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,101
Okay.

469
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,729
Oh, right.

470
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:11,609
This was struck by lightning too.
It's called byeokjomok.

471
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,821
Byeokjomok?

472
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,999
SU TAEKWONDO

473
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,420
Hello.

474
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,298
Mom!

475
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,759
-Mom!
-Mom!

476
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,846
Master, my mom is here.

477
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,514
-Hello.
-How are you?

478
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,057
-Great.
-Hey, this is my mom.

479
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,768
My mom works at a TV station.

480
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,187
-Take care.
-You too. Bye.

481
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,815
-Let's go, shall we?
-Yeah.

482
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,067
Are you not busy today?

483
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,571
No, I'm not busy.
Want to go eat something delicious?

484
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,488
Yeah.

485
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,159
Mom, in Korean class today,

486
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,662
I-jun cried about getting
a 90 on his dictation quiz.

487
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,373
I got a 50, but I didn't cry.

488
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:08,749
That's my boy.

489
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,543
-Don't eat too fast.
-Okay.

490
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,509
Would it upset him
if I asked him about Un-baek?

491
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:21,971
What?

492
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,764
Do you want water?

493
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,641
Does Un-baek like you?

494
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,233
I think so.

495
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,861
Do you like him too?

496
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,447
I think so.

497
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,783
I like you too, Mom.

498
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,787
I like you very much too, Gu-won.

499
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,831
But you're busy.

500
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,378
I only get a little time with you,

501
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:59,467
but this means
now I have to share it with him.

502
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,762
Gu-won.

503
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:05,473
No. I don't want to do that.

504
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,309
I don't want to share.

505
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm sorry, Gu-won.

506
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,607
I didn't know…

507
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,027
that's how you felt.

508
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,445
Why didn't you know?

509
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,573
I can hear all your thoughts,

510
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:27,578
so how come you never know how I feel?

511
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,390
CAPTAIN

512
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:51,227
She won't text me back or come to the gym.

513
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:23,301
Honey, did you pack the samples?
We're going to the morning class.

514
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,304
Of course. And I set one aside
for Ms. Park, the singing teacher.

515
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,390
For God's sake.

516
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,811
It's inside out! Seriously.

517
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,606
Would it kill you to put it in the hamper?

518
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,235
-Mom, did you wash my sneakers?
-I'm busy, okay?

519
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,696
-Wash your own sneakers.
-Why didn't you tell me?

520
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,073
I could've taken them to the cleaners.

521
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,993
That's a waste of money.
Leave them! I'll do it tomorrow.

522
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,455
Mom, we got the eggs
and rice delivered from the grocery store.

523
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:53,831
I ate some of the eggs.

524
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,000
I ordered them to make jangjorim.

525
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,711
How many?
Don't tell me you ate half already.

526
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,630
You're making jangjorim?
Sounds good. Should I boil the eggs?

527
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,175
-You're going to crack them all--
-Listen.

528
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,218
Yes, Ki-baek. What is it?

529
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,014
Maybe we should take a family trip.

530
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,641
Huh? Trip? Where?

531
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,729
We can't afford a trip abroad.
How about the Gold Resort down south?

532
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,231
The Gold Resort? The one we saw earlier?

533
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,651
The place that costs
one million won a night?

534
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:26,238
Are you insane?
One million per night? Are you kidding?

535
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,573
-Let's go!
-Zip it!

536
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,994
Ki-baek. You can't squander the money
you worked so hard to make.

537
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,914
Ki-baek, I appreciate the gesture.

538
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,250
I've already made a reservation,
so let's go.

539
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,127
Cancel it. I'm not going.

540
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,714
-Mom.
-Mom! Come on!

541
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,384
When would we ever get to stay
at the Gold Resort?

542
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,445
What's up with Gu-won?
Did he and Yeon fight?

543
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,031
Don't know.
Yeon said she'd pick him up later.

544
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:11,283
It's the same for me and her.

545
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,703
Our kids are the source of our worries.

546
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:18,457
Didn't you say I was what you live for?
That's hurtful.

547
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,046
You are what I live for. I could never
leave behind a daughter like you.

548
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,714
I'll make you worry forever.

549
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:26,757
Good grief.

550
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,468
What a good daughter.

551
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,514
Here.

552
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,975
What's this?

553
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,227
The number of my most frequent customer.

554
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,856
She's been coloring and bleaching her hair

555
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,568
without realizing her hair has become
as ragged as corn silk.

556
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,070
She just asks for
whatever takes a long time.

557
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,823
When she comes, she stays all day long.

558
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,453
But she said she'd be going
somewhere far soon.

559
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,582
She won't be back for a long time.

560
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,087
So she won't be back.
Why did you ask for her number?

561
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:09,216
I'm fine because I have a daughter
I'll forever have to worry about.

562
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,635
Do whatever makes you feel better.

563
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,927
Did you see Dr. Kim?

564
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,512
-Yes.
-What did he say?

565
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,389
Well, things that you would expect.

566
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,936
So, Woo-ju.
What's troubling you so much this time

567
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,938
that you had to do all this laundry?

568
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:11,070
Oh, it's my birth mom's phone number.

569
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,950
Let me go get laundry too. I've got tons.

570
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,451
No, I'm tired.

571
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,453
Come sit down.

572
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,347
Do I feel this way because I'm angry?

573
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:40,641
Maybe.

574
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,478
But I barely remember her.
There's nothing to be angry about.

575
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,564
Yeah?

576
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,857
Am I just curious why she did it?

577
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,526
Maybe.

578
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,237
But what's the point?
It's all in the past.

579
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,365
-I'm happy with my life now.
-Then that's all that matters.

580
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,161
You're giving me half-hearted answers
because it's not your business.

581
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:05,833
Of course not. I'm concentrating
all my energy on my shoulder right now.

582
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,671
I don't know

583
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:16,760
why my heart feels so heavy.

584
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:24,768
If you let this pass,
it will eventually become nothing.

585
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,608
If you meet with her,
you may be able to find out

586
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,402
why your heart feels so heavy.

587
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,867
Whichever you choose,
I support you one hundred percent.

588
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,998
It's heavy. Move your head.

589
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,924
YOON JI-HU:
I QUIT MY JOB

590
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,303
Oh no, you'd better go.

591
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,682
No, it can wait.
It's not like it isn't a big deal.

592
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,647
Come on, you should go.

593
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,817
This is more important to me.

594
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,869
Are you crazy? You quit your job?

595
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:28,332
Hey, why are you yelling? You scared me.

596
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,544
Dad, Uncle Ki-baek, have this too.

597
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:36,757
-Wow, this is delicious-looking plastic.
-God.

598
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,260
Wow, it's good. You're the best, Sol.

599
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,890
As you know,

600
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:50,646
my wife quit her job a long time ago
to take care of Sol at the hospital,

601
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:53,148
and I can't afford her medical bills
with my pay.

602
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,402
So why did you quit?
How are you going to make money?

603
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,861
I should make money.

604
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:01,156
I have to make way more than I did.
That's why I went freelance.

605
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,326
Didn't you see what happened to me?
You could go broke.

606
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,870
You're the reason why I did it.
I can do it too.

607
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,373
Ji-hu, this is a terrible idea!

608
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,128
I'm willing to do anything.

609
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:18,298
So Ki-baek, I need you to help me.

610
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:25,097
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I've got nothing,

611
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,725
and I can't think about that right now.
I'm sorry.

612
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,479
Dad, I want to play in the ball pit.

613
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,607
-Go ahead, Sol. I'll be there in a minute.
-Okay.

614
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,069
Ki-baek.

615
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,196
Come with me to the mountains.

616
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,323
Mountains? Why?

617
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:44,992
Don't tell me…

618
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,662
I can't. I don't want to.

619
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,747
Do you want to see me go down?

620
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:55,878
If I join you, I'll make things worse.
Please believe me, okay?

621
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:56,962
Hey.

622
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,966
-Help me out.
-Oh, for God's sake.

623
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,306
Cancel all the high-profile jobs.

624
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,141
And find another studio.

625
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,101
Here he comes.

626
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,770
-I'm a fan. Could I have his autograph?
-I'm sorry.

627
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:17,441
-Can we please take a picture with him?
-I'm sorry. We're busy right now.

628
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,609
Come on, Jeong-heon.

629
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,819
It's not like
we're asking for a big favor.

630
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:22,237
I know, right?

631
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,782
-I just wanted a picture.
-I'll do it.

632
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:26,992
-What?
-Really?

633
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,286
Wow, I can't believe this.

634
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,080
Could you take a picture with us too?

635
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,082
One, two, three.

636
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,836
-Wow, thank you!
-Thank you.

637
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,098
Smoke with the window closed.

638
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,433
Mr. Kang.

639
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,106
I'm trying to catch a breath,
not suffocate to death.

640
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,651
You're part of
that public health campaign.

641
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,117
Should I just retire?

642
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,258
-We're going on a trip, not moving.
-Are we leaving now?

643
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,093
You can have the ends.

644
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,719
Why? These are for us anyway.

645
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,513
They're not for us.

646
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,516
What then?
Are you going to sell them on the highway?

647
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,725
Seriously.

648
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,980
I'll have to join you tomorrow morning.
I have a gig.

649
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,106
I know.

650
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:42,442
I have a meeting too,
so we're heading out after lunch.

651
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,945
Don't worry and take your time.

652
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,238
Drive safely.

653
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,824
I'm sorry I can't come with you today.

654
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,538
He has to keep himself apart
when he suggested the trip.

655
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:01,628
Listen. You can use this
when you guys eat or something.

656
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,755
-I can pay for our meals.
-Wow.

657
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,257
I'll just hold on to it.

658
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,843
No need. I've packed everything we need.

659
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,812
LIFE IN THE MOUNTAINS

660
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:23,025
Your mother is very generous.
And a good cook.

661
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,569
Thanks to her, we saved money on food.
Thank you.

662
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,946
-Thank you.
-Thank you for the food.

663
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:29,948
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

664
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,366
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

665
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,869
It had to be so much work
for your mom to make all this.

666
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,622
By the way,
there are no cucumbers in her gimbap.

667
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,374
Oh, you're right.

668
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,126
He doesn't eat cucumbers. Right?

669
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:42,669
Right.

670
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,901
-Hey, careful.
-What are you doing? Gross.

671
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,611
You're a big star.

672
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:10,072
I can't roll out the red carpet,
but I can do this.

673
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,659
So we're just staying
at their home for a night?

674
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,912
"A night in the woods
with innocent real-life mountain people."

675
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,288
That's our theme.

676
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:22,084
I'm counting on you. You're the closest
to a star among the three of us.

677
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,001
-Three?
-Yeah.

678
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,213
He said he had a gig in the morning
and would join us after.

679
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,467
Hello, guys!

680
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,222
Park Jin-bok!

681
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,892
After you guys fought, he faced
serious backlash and hit rock bottom.

682
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:41,645
He got kicked out of his group
and took a break.

683
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:42,979
Now he's a trot singer.

684
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,107
Jin-bok!

685
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,490
-Ki-baek, it's been a long time.
-Hi.

686
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:59,955
Last year's PN has returned as Jin-bok

687
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:03,166
Your best lucky charm, Park Jin-bok

688
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,003
-Wow, that was good.
-Great. Our lucky charm is here.

689
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,548
Let's go up
to the mountain dweller's home.

690
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:10,924
Okay, let's go!

691
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:12,634
Jin-bok is as cute as…

692
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,930
Be careful. He had a tough time,
and now he's all hyper on his gigs.

693
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,391
-He climbs the mountain--
-Jin-bok.

694
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:22,185
Wrong way.
Please change your clothes first.

695
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,562
Okey dokey!

696
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:27,482
He climbs the mountain with light steps
And his voice…

697
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,775
Dude, he scares me.

698
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,528
That's what we're supposed to do.

699
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:56,553
It's so white it's going to get dirty
with the smallest amount of work.

700
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,847
This is the uniform
of Life in the Mountains.

701
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,807
So it's intentional.

702
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,852
-All right, go ahead.
-Oh, okay.

703
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:07,773
Yeah.

704
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,196
-Oh. Hello.
-Hello.

705
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,786
THERAPEUTIC SOUNDS VOL. 2
SOUNDS OF NATURE

706
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:26,458
I always start my day listening to
the sounds of nature.

707
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,169
Wow.

708
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:30,754
I see.

709
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,006
He scared me.

710
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,430
The water deer eat all my potatoes.

711
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,183
Stop eating my damn food!

712
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,394
But aren't water deer active at night?

713
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,646
Hey.

714
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,231
Whether you're human or an animal,

715
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:52,192
when you're starving,
you don't care if it's lunch or dinner.

716
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,161
Hey. Water deer sound scary.

717
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,248
All right. We should probably eat first.

718
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,249
-Yes.
-Sure.

719
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,501
I already have the main dish prepared.

720
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,379
Tall guy, can you go get eggs
from the chicken coop?

721
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:16,007
The two of you, please pick some greens
from the hill behind the house.

722
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,302
Get a move on.

723
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,937
You're rather quiet.

724
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:33,692
What? Me? I guess I am.

725
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,819
Still, I hope this won't be boring.

726
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:38,822
Yes, right…

727
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,798
Hens with healthy ovaries start laying
eggs around 18 to 20 weeks of age,

728
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,259
producing approximately one egg per day.

729
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,970
Wow, they clearly seem mature, don't they?

730
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,073
I did it. I got one.

731
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,672
-I got two more!
-I knew he was the ace of the team.

732
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,215
Will we be able to air this?

733
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,885
He's swearing too much.
How can we edit it out?

734
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:46,723
Go away, you damn chickens!
I'm scared of chickens.

735
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:47,891
Look at him go.

736
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,560
That's how hard you have to try?
I had no idea.

737
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,439
Get away. I'm sorry.
You goddamn chickens. I only took four.

738
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:02,113
He said he was going to cook,
but he hasn't started a fire.

739
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:04,783
Maybe he doesn't need heat.
It could be a salad.

740
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,286
I have an electric cooktop in the kitchen.

741
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,122
If you need to use it,
make sure you use the right pot.

742
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:14,584
-I thought you would use fire.
-You have to watch out for wildfires.

743
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,462
Wow, is this chicken soup?

744
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,840
Doesn't smell like chicken soup.
It smells familiar. What is it?

745
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,468
-Oh, curry!
-Ta-da.

746
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,057
Doesn't it look good?

747
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,351
The best part of fish is the head.

748
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,187
The eyes are a real delicacy,
so help yourselves.

749
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:35,855
What's wrong?

750
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,149
Guys.

751
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,151
I'm going in first.

752
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,950
-Wow.
-Good, right?

753
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,166
I just made this. Give it a taste.

754
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:06,052
I thought you'd be crushing the food,
but you're barely nibbling.

755
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,763
He always eats slowly
and in small quantities.

756
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,099
Really? That's a surprise.

757
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,727
I didn't mean it like that, Ji-hu.

758
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,063
It's okay. I know I look like
I'd eat a ton of food in no time.

759
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,733
No, that's not true.

760
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,902
When he first joined JBC,
he was thinner than me.

761
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,654
Really? Whoa.

762
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,575
If that's how you eat, what happened?
Is there a story?

763
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,870
My daughter can't eat much food.

764
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,957
And? Did you eat all the food
she didn't finish?

765
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,168
She simply doesn't want to eat.

766
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,963
Perhaps because she's been taking
so much strong medicine.

767
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,509
She has trouble digesting,
and she never has an appetite.

768
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:54,267
But whenever she saw me eating,
she'd come and take a bite.

769
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:59,272
So I started eating things
that I wanted her to eat.

770
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:02,984
Actually, this weight came from
all kinds of healthy food.

771
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,072
Hey, you're a good dad.

772
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:12,410
Now I want to be a successful dad,
but it's challenging.

773
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,625
Thank you.

774
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,005
Was Mr. Shin okay with it?

775
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,424
It's all good.
He'll edit out the part about Sol.

776
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,719
I actually think people
would like to hear about Sol.

777
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,639
It's nothing bad.
It made you look really warm-hearted.

778
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,934
That's just from our perspective.

779
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:38,520
When Sol becomes a teenager,

780
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,147
she might not like that
I talked about her on TV.

781
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:45,902
When it comes to Sol,
he becomes unbelievably wise.

782
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,949
Do you think
we're doing enough for the show?

783
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,451
Ki-baek in the chicken coop
was the only funny part.

784
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:54,702
You think so?

785
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:57,580
Speaking of which,
should we get in the water?

786
00:56:57,664 --> 00:56:58,581
What?

787
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,000
There are two types of water
in variety shows.

788
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,378
Water to drink, water to jump into.

789
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,548
What? Wait, Ji-hu.
That's a little over-the-top.

790
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,762
Mr. Shin! I'll go in.

791
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,765
Where? What? Why?

792
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,560
-Here.
-No, no. Don't do it.

793
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,187
Bad idea?

794
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,356
Hey. No! Get back here.

795
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:25,525
Don't do it.

796
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:32,240
No, you went in that chicken coop
with that face

797
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,075
and swore at those chickens!

798
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,870
-I have to try harder!
-Come here before I swear at you too!

799
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:37,996
Okay.

800
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,834
Go into the water? Are you kidding?

801
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,214
Ki-baek, do you have
another job tomorrow morning?

802
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,176
Oh, it's a family trip.

803
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,387
Wow. You guys are family men.

804
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:58,641
This is actually my first time
taking a trip with my entire family.

805
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,935
Really? Your mom must be thrilled.

806
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,813
She says it's a waste of money.
You know my mom.

807
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,357
Mom!

808
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,151
You look so nice today.

809
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:09,986
God.

810
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,821
You said you didn't want to go.

811
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,531
Just put these in the car.

812
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,493
Oh, I forgot about this. My gosh.

813
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:19,412
Hey, Yu-jeong.

814
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,290
You look so beautiful today,
like Audrey Hepburn.

815
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,125
What? Oh, my goodness.

816
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,252
Today isn't that big of a deal.

817
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,173
It is a big deal. All five of us are
going on a trip for the first time.

818
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,133
Have fun.

819
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,429
I'll drive. You couldn't sleep last night
because of your knee.

820
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,056
It's okay. I can do it.

821
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:40,350
I'll do it. You can drive us home.

822
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,352
-See you.
-See you, guys.

823
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,616
YOUR BEAUTIFUL SKIN
ENTRUST IT TO CHAM BEAUTY

824
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,244
All right! Let's go!
We're almost there, guys!

825
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,746
Come on, let's go.

826
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,165
-We never get tired! Let's go!
-Let's go.

827
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,338
Oh, man.

828
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,923
God, I'm exhausted.

829
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:15,677
Mr. Shin, did you get some good scenes?

830
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,387
Yeah. It was great.

831
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,181
You looked like a sloth.

832
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,349
-Really?
-Yeah.

833
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,935
I guess it was funny.

834
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,187
-Let's take a short break, guys.
-Okay.

835
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,565
This is what Mr. Mountain Man
was talking about.

836
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,608
Wow, it looks amazing.

837
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,902
He said it's a jujube tree
struck by lightning.

838
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,950
This was struck by lightning too.

839
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,201
It's called byeokjomok.

840
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,829
Yeah, it's a byeokjomok.

841
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,872
It's a surprise no one has cut it down.

842
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,125
Huh? Why would anyone cut it down?

843
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,837
This is the strongest wood in the world.

844
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:05,268
"A bolt from the blue has made me strong."

845
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,437
"I am no longer…"

846
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,106
"I am no longer afraid
of unexpected storms."

847
01:00:10,189 --> 01:00:11,274
You scared me.

848
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,236
I wrote that. What do you think?

849
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,157
-Isn't it awesome?
-It sounds familiar.

850
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,702
You're right.

851
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,582
-It's something I read somewhere.
-Right? You got me.

852
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,543
There are so many trees here.

853
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,796
You think it knew
it would be hit by lightning?

854
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,924
It's not like it could've run away
even if it knew.

855
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:38,176
Right.

856
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:41,179
Still, it was struck by lightning
and turned into Iron Man.

857
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,514
It worked out for the better.

858
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,728
After my business failed,

859
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,066
I moved here thinking everything was over.

860
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,234
But somehow…

861
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,863
I'm still alive and well.

862
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,375
You never know what will happen in life.

863
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:14,545
I was worried sick
about Ki-baek for days, and now?

864
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:18,966
Goodness. I never thought I'd have
a stroke of good luck like this.

865
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,677
This isn't a stroke of good luck.

866
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,430
The universe is rewarding you
for your hard work for the last 30 years.

867
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,848
You think so?

868
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,643
You're right.

869
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:33,398
Well, while I'm being rewarded,
I wish I'd get a vacation too.

870
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,440
Of course.

871
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,443
Don't lift a finger when we get there.
We'll do everything.

872
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,778
Really?

873
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,988
I'll cook.

874
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,407
I'll do the dishes.

875
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,617
I love you, Yu-jeong.

876
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:46,953
Yeah, I love you too.

877
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,580
Boy, this is so exciting.

878
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,085
That's right! I should enjoy
some luxury for a change.

879
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,344
I got rid of everything.

880
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:09,016
I got rid of my phone, my TV,
and everything else when I moved here.

881
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,893
But in the end…

882
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,397
I couldn't give up Wi-Fi.

883
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,108
I don't think you gave up a thing.

884
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:22,321
You don't have to give up everything
to live in the mountains.

885
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:26,367
Right? It's your life.
You can live it however you want.

886
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,913
Whether you're hit by lightning
or with a storm,

887
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,666
you just fight hard to survive.

888
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,043
You know, there's a saying.

889
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:40,339
"Don't be afraid of the storm
that can't be stopped."

890
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,843
"Learn how to dance in the rain instead."

891
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,430
Should we dance, then?

892
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,515
Let's do it.

893
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,102
For the kind of storm we're weathering,
we've got to really shake it.

894
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,854
Mr. Shin, I'm going to dance.

895
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,105
Oh, sure.

896
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,567
He's trying to get more screen time.
Aren't you tired?

897
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,777
No.

898
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,528
You look like a dancing sloth.

899
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,529
Really?

900
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:06,991
Jin-bok, are you asleep?

901
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:09,160
-Sing if you have nothing better to do.
-No.

902
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:11,162
Oh, I know you!

903
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:14,123
-You're… PN!
-Yes.

904
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,792
Should I play the instrumental?

905
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,627
No. He won an award for a song.

906
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,505
"Look At That." Sing that one.

907
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:30,640
Why did you do that?

908
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:37,688
I sit by the stream all alone

909
01:03:40,274 --> 01:03:46,322
When greens start to sprout

910
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:54,288
And the spring breeze ruffles the water

911
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:58,417
You said…

912
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:05,550
My mom said this to me.

913
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:13,516
You made such a promise

914
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,435
Are you that happy? You never sing.

915
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,313
What? Why can't I sing?

916
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,648
Endlessly

917
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,859
-I'm just saying you're really good.
-What?

918
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,027
Really?

919
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,990
Don't tease me.
I'm going to take singing lessons.

920
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:30,074
Sure.

921
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:35,663
She said that because
good fortune is too far away from us,

922
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,916
we shouldn't dream about catching it.

923
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:56,309
Wish we had more of your mom's gimbap.

924
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,727
Yeah, me too.

925
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,190
And we can't do anything
about the misfortune

926
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:05,318
that blindsides us.

927
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,614
All we can do is just accept it.

928
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,619
But life goes on.

929
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,664
Life is just about living each day.

930
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,844
That's how you live your life.

931
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,705
