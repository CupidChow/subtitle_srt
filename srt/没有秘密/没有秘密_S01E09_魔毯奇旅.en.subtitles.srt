FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,436
Is Song Ki-baek the person
in your heart right now?

3
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,284
WHERE ARE YOU?

4
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,702
I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO YOU

5
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,080
Why isn't she responding?

6
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,082
Is she busy?

7
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,793
I WANT TO SEE YOU

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,379
Yeah.

9
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,591
I like Ki-baek.

10
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,186
I'm sorry, and thank you.

11
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,191
But it's all in the past now.

12
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,446
I'll get going.

13
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,797
Why am I so nervous?

14
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,259
Should I tell her tomorrow?

15
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,305
Let's tell her.

16
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,182
I should tell her.

17
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,203
Ki-baek!

18
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,976
The test results show nothing unusual.

19
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,477
Seems to just be fatigue.

20
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:10,231
We'll put him on a drip and let him rest.

21
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,566
He'll be all right.

22
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,743
Get his autograph.

23
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,412
Wow, this is cool.

24
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,998
What's he doing
at a small hospital like this?

25
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,445
The doctor said he'd be all right,
so don't worry.

26
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,407
He said he was sorry.

27
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,371
He apologized to me and my mom.

28
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,418
He said he came to see me to say that.

29
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,673
To put me at ease.

30
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,593
He was always like that.

31
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,305
He doesn't even show it when he's hurting.

32
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,934
He was about to faint,
but all he could think about was

33
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,228
his past mistakes and how sorry he felt.

34
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,024
He's such a weirdo.

35
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,730
You should've taken Woo-ju home.

36
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,151
Would you let yourself drive
if you were me?

37
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,778
I don't have indemnity insurance.

38
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,369
Turn on the radio or something.

39
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,081
You're a patient, not my boss.

40
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,335
Nice one, Mr. Song the driver.

41
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,966
Let's find out how they first met.

42
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,262
Yes, Ms. Kang is in her forties.
She's divorced with two daughters.

43
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:50,141
Their situations were similar,
so they opened up to each other.

44
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,019
Yes. They could really
relate to each other.

45
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,312
VOLUME

46
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,176
Hey, you're renting, aren't you?

47
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,637
Go if you're going to talk nonsense.

48
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,101
STILLS FROM COUPLE'S PARADISE

49
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,951
Oh, my PR team took those pictures.

50
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:52,328
Your pictures are there too.
Take them if you want.

51
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,586
Have you told her?

52
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:08,386
I was going to
but couldn't because of you.

53
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,679
I'm not sorry.

54
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,639
You crazy idiot.

55
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,266
Let me tell you this up front.

56
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,144
I'd never give
you and Woo-ju my blessings.

57
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,479
But if it'd make Woo-ju happy,

58
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:23,151
I could use my impressive capabilities
and wealth to help you out a little.

59
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:25,820
Jeez.

60
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,197
Woo-ju likes you a lot.

61
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:37,707
You see, I know the face she makes
in front of the man she likes.

62
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,253
So scram now, will you?

63
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,006
Don't make Woo-ju wait.

64
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:51,762
I'm off.

65
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,194
I'm on my way.

66
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,404
-Where to?
-To you, On Woo-ju!

67
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,989
What?

68
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:22,126
LET'S MAKE IT OFFICIAL

69
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,384
I thought we were already official.

70
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,682
FALLING IN LOVE

71
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,273
Man, I'm starving.

72
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,068
I got two fried chickens to celebrate
our 22nd day together.

73
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,945
Nice, you know the way to my heart.

74
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:49,904
I'LL BE THERE SOON

75
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:50,905
BE SAFE

76
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,535
If you're bored,
you can come to the subway station.

77
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,912
I'm not bored.
I came to pick up my girlfriend.

78
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,164
Come down. It's raining now.

79
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,381
I'm tired. I'm not in the mood
to talk to you today.

80
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,216
I added noodles and cheese.

81
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,801
I'm running on my knees.

82
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,344
I'm still mad at you,

83
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,180
but I can't let the glass noodles
get all soggy, so…

84
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,559
You can punish me.
The tteokbokki did nothing wrong.

85
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,279
Come on, quick! It's about to start.

86
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,824
-What's going on downstairs?
-They're watching TV.

87
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,451
-They won't come up here.
-Okay. It's on.

88
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,584
HEAVEN HOUSE

89
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,627
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
COUPLE'S PARADISE

90
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,767
Oh, my God.

91
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,146
The real-time ratings
for the final episode

92
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,814
are over ten percent!

93
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,691
YEON

94
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,196
Yeon, it's important we keep our cool
when something like this happens.

95
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,160
We shouldn't act like
we've never tasted success before, but…

96
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,747
Hey, I haven't seen
two-digit ratings in so long.

97
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,666
My legs are all wobbly,
and my heart is pounding.

98
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,085
No, thump, thump.
It's beating like a drum.

99
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,589
Hurrah for On Woo-ju!
Seriously, hurrah for us.

100
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,967
I'm so happy. This is amazing.
We deserve a team dinner.

101
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,053
At one of those fancy restaurants,
you know?

102
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
All right, Yeon. Bye.

103
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,354
My goodness. Yeon is overly excited.

104
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,314
It's not professional to be like this.

105
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,067
I think you're more excited.
Are you that happy?

106
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,110
You don't know how amazing this is.

107
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:57,740
A five-episode pilot exceeding ten percent
is unbelievable. It's an epic success.

108
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,866
I see.

109
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,786
Right now,
the production team's group chat is…

110
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,080
It's hot. So hot!

111
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,331
-It's hot?
-Ouch.

112
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,248
What is this?

113
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,254
Look at this. Everyone's going wild.

114
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,172
THE SHOW'S OVER?

115
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,760
"Star writer, On Woo-ju"?

116
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,889
"Superstar, Song Ki-baek"?

117
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,362
We're floating.

118
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,782
Be careful!

119
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,620
It's so beautiful.

120
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,205
Look at the moon!

121
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,626
COUPLE'S PARADISE

122
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,002
Yes!

123
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,930
EPISODE 9: MAGIC CARPET RIDE

124
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,557
GO,
THE PILLAR OF THE SONG FAMILY!

125
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,600
RISING STAR SONG KI-BAEK!

126
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,938
-Congrats, son.
-Congrats.

127
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,649
-Everyone's talking about the show.
-Ouch, it's hot.

128
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,568
Your older brother hasn't eaten yet.

129
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,486
-It's fine. Dig in.
-All right.

130
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,363
It's hot. Can you help me?

131
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,283
My eldest son,
you'll go on to do bigger things,

132
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,451
so you have to eat well.

133
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,704
My phone's blowing up.

134
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:29,623
My friends are begging me
to let them come over

135
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,875
so they can see you.

136
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,253
Can I post a picture
of you on my Instagram?

137
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,588
Sure.

138
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,299
One chicken?
Couldn't you be more generous?

139
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,718
Do people buy two birthday cakes
if they're happy?

140
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,635
One's enough.

141
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,889
You like chicken porridge, honey.
The porridge is almost ready.

142
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,433
You can have this wing, Dad.

143
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,188
I'll just have the porridge.

144
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,362
Let's eat, all right?

145
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,489
Eat up.

146
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,866
I don't like wings because
of the slippery texture.

147
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,577
Ki-baek, you said you were going out.

148
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,703
Hurry up and eat.

149
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,164
Superstar Song, got plans today?

150
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,124
A commercial shoot.

151
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,042
What?

152
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,878
-A commercial?
-A commercial? Goodness.

153
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,254
Wow, that is amazing!

154
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,634
Now we can get one chicken per person…
No. Can we get beef?

155
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,178
Come on. I still have a long way to go.

156
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:26,722
Hurry up and eat.

157
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,022
Hello, Chief.

158
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,775
-This is for you guys.
-We got a regular slot!

159
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,029
-That sly chief director is all excited.
-Hey.

160
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,697
She said she'd reward us--

161
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,619
Oh, thank you in advance.

162
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,288
So does it mean the show can continue?

163
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:54,792
Yes. The whole country is talking about
Couple's Paradise now.

164
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,669
The show must continue.

165
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,920
Thank you.

166
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,090
Ha-young, I trust you'll handle
the pressure well.

167
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,514
You haven't told your team yet?

168
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,723
Chief.

169
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:12,017
Everything's going great.
What's your problem?

170
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,144
It's not hard.

171
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,982
Restructure the team without Woo-ju,
and you'll get a regular slot.

172
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,025
Don't tell me you'll turn this down.

173
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,236
You have Ha-young. You guys can do it.

174
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,404
But this show…

175
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,447
Woo-ju wrote it.

176
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,074
I refuse to do it without her.

177
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,118
The series can't continue with Woo-ju.

178
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,370
Let's do what's best for the team.

179
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,249
Seriously, must you all be such amateurs?

180
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,878
We should keep the momentum going.
Right, Ha-young?

181
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,173
You guys, get a grip.

182
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,342
Hello, everyone!

183
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,553
Oh, you're here.

184
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,470
I sure am.

185
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,390
Everyone's talking about the show,
so I ran here with a happy heart.

186
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,103
Chief, can we talk?

187
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:59,690
Director Chae, did you not have lunch?
Why are you so cranky today?

188
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,610
Chief, buy us some snacks. Something good.

189
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,820
Oh, sure thing.

190
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,864
Of course. That's no problem at all.

191
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,366
Here.

192
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,536
-Go pick up some snacks.
-Okay.

193
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,622
Buy lots.

194
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,962
Hey!

195
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,547
Level Nine, Level Nine

196
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,466
No problem

197
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,134
Level Seven, Level Seven

198
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,719
I feel confident

199
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:34,391
Fly to the world of success with Genie Edu

200
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,310
Hey!

201
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:40,356
Fly, fly, let's fly, fly, fly

202
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,691
Cut, all right!

203
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,109
Thanks, everyone.

204
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,237
We'll take a ten-minute break
before moving on to the next scene.

205
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,531
Prop team, the rug.

206
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,409
Don't forget to brush
the fringe on the rug.

207
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,536
Got it.

208
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,258
-Oh, thank you.
-Just talk to me casually.

209
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,135
I'll be with you wherever you go.

210
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,304
Sure.

211
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,104
MY WOO-JU:
GOOD LUCK

212
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,480
SOAR HIGH, SUPERSTAR SONG

213
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:30,864
SOAR… LET'S SOAR HIGH!
I'LL SEE YOU LATER!

214
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,825
Ki-baek, can we take a picture--

215
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,826
One moment.

216
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,161
Would that be all right?

217
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,330
Yes, sure.

218
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,748
Thank you.

219
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,001
I became a fan
after watching Couple's Paradise.

220
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,210
Just one picture, please.

221
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,713
-Let me take it for you.
-Okay, thank you.

222
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,714
Here we go.

223
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:48,882
One, two.

224
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,927
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

225
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,806
-You can't post it on social media.
-Okay.

226
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,350
The shooting schedule isn't out yet, so…

227
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,480
It's natural to feel frazzled.

228
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,861
You're stoked that
you've risen to stardom,

229
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,071
but you're worried you'll suddenly fall.

230
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,199
Just enjoy it.

231
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,493
Show up when needed
and take the offered jobs.

232
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,872
I don't want to be overexposed.

233
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,458
You really are clueless.

234
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,086
For variety shows, the more familiar
people are with you, the better.

235
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,048
Show your face
as often as you can, when you can.

236
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,342
Not even God knows
when or how things could turn sour.

237
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:40,976
Yes.

238
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,395
What did I say?

239
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,522
I told you the show would be a hit.

240
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,068
If you hear anyone saying
I've lost my touch, bring them to me.

241
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,652
I'll teach them a lesson.

242
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,616
I'll have another talk with the chief.

243
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,201
You'll return as head writer,

244
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,287
and Ha-young will assist you
as the second writer. Right?

245
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,999
I certainly don't want to get off a horse
that's gaining momentum.

246
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,001
Besides, it's not like I have to steal

247
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,378
this show from Woo-ju
to survive as a writer.

248
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,215
What are you two doing?

249
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:15,886
I'm sorry to disappoint you guys,
but I've already left the team.

250
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,263
Yeon, don't be so lame.

251
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,893
Will you go to the variety show division
and beg them to save On Woo-ju?

252
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,105
Shouldn't you be focused
on securing a bigger budget

253
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,981
to make the show even better?

254
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,067
You're frustrating me here.

255
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,153
And you. You got the head writer position
to fill in for me.

256
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,489
One mistake and you're done for.

257
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,366
You'd better stay laser-focused.

258
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,452
Let's think about it.

259
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,747
Good God.
Stop thinking and have a meeting.

260
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,708
I'm off. Bye.

261
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,794
Oh, man.

262
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,600
No more bites, no more excuses.
You can do it.

263
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,018
Come to Weigh To Go Gym.

264
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,106
Lose fat and gain muscle.

265
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,150
Come to Weigh To Go Gym.

266
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,317
Please visit us.

267
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,653
That little…

268
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,301
Hello.

269
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:38,760
You remember me?

270
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,304
Nope.

271
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,889
Liar.

272
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,558
We know each other.
Why did you say hello to me, then?

273
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,394
My mom said
I should always say hello to my elders.

274
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,399
My captain is a perfect mom too.

275
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,818
Mister, why is my mom your captain?

276
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:56,945
What?

277
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,074
Oh, no. I was just…

278
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,759
Man.

279
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,011
We can do this together.

280
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,721
Here.

281
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,723
I can go home and get my mom's ladder.

282
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,517
Come on. Just let me lift you up.

283
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,354
Don't touch me!

284
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,438
Jeez. There.

285
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,279
I should try to bond with him.

286
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,823
Would you stop acting buddy-buddy with me?

287
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:43,742
Oh, sorry.

288
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,161
Have you eaten yet?

289
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,831
-Want some fried chicken?
-I hate fried chicken.

290
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,416
There's nothing I hate more.

291
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,463
Wait. Then what do you like?

292
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,465
Hey!

293
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,598
They sent your pay for the commercial.

294
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,239
STRIP LOIN
HANWOO

295
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,784
Song Ki-baek!

296
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:32,708
You know, Song Ki-baek had this
with Min Cho-hui on Couple's Paradise.

297
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,751
This was that product placement.

298
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:37,421
It's a new product.
It's buy one get one free.

299
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,840
Hello, sir. Try this.

300
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,383
Oh, sure. Thank you.

301
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,761
You'll also get
two fish cake bars for free.

302
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,180
Excuse me, aren't you…

303
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,682
No, I'm not a singer.

304
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,684
Aren't you Song Ki-baek?

305
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:57,733
I'm a huge fan!
Oh, it's him. It's Song Ki-baek!

306
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,776
-Song Ki-baek is here.
-Oh, my God.

307
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,653
Can I please get your autograph?

308
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,030
-Me too.
-Me too.

309
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:06,074
I don't have one yet.

310
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:11,204
I can't because
I don't have a signature yet.

311
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,040
How could he not have a signature?

312
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,000
If he doesn't want to, he can just say so.

313
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,501
No, that's not why.

314
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,505
It's my first autograph request,
that's why.

315
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,382
I see.

316
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,260
Would my credit card signature work?
Then I can do it.

317
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,679
Of course. Can I get it here?

318
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,848
Are these dumplings good?

319
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,224
I prefer them pan-fried.

320
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,393
I know this is tasty,

321
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,103
but it's overpriced.

322
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,189
Yikes, you should get a different one.

323
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,359
A fresh mackerel has clear eyes
and bright scarlet gills.

324
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,028
Get another one and I'll sign it.

325
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,529
Thank you. Yes.

326
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,239
Oh, sure.

327
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,077
-Thank you. You're handsome.
-Thank you.

328
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,224
Are you going away?
Why did you buy so many things?

329
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,143
I got paid, so I went shopping.

330
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,686
I bought this too.

331
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:18,146
Come sit.

332
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,982
No, what if someone sees us
sitting side by side?

333
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,693
Who cares? I bought this
so we could sit side by side.

334
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,363
Just for a minute, then.

335
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,870
Wow, this is nice.

336
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,833
For the first time in my life,
I shot a TV commercial,

337
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,001
got a manager, and signed autographs.

338
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,088
Fish cakes were two per person,
but I got seven.

339
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,089
Whoa.

340
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,716
I might get a car or even a house soon.

341
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:51,471
Man, I don't want to move.
I like being Woo-ju's upstairs neighbor.

342
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,349
We can have a date at a nicer home.

343
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,351
A stay-home date?

344
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,353
Oh, cut it out.

345
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,901
So? Is your schedule full now?

346
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,696
I've booked one thing,
so it's a good start.

347
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,782
One thing? And you think
you can buy a car and a house?

348
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,954
What about you? How was your day?

349
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,706
How was the meeting?

350
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:19,916
Well…

351
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,377
It went well.

352
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,754
It went well?

353
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,881
That's it?

354
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:26,798
That's it.

355
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,511
Wow, are all famous TV writers
cool like you?

356
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,684
Is it doable?

357
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,394
Living with the switch on.

358
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,188
So far, yes.

359
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:46,067
Dr. Kim said it was important
to get used to the disinhibition symptoms.

360
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,198
Right, but I can't be glued to you 24-7,

361
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,450
so I should expose myself
to many situations.

362
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,328
Okay, but let me know
when you really need me.

363
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,001
What?

364
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,129
You too. Let me know if you ever need me.

365
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,051
I feel like I'm always
the one reaching out to you.

366
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,763
Sure.

367
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,279
I think that's fine. You must be tired.

368
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,032
-Is it true our show is getting canceled?
-Apparently.

369
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,284
What do you expect?
The main host is a loser.

370
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,746
He went on Couple's Paradise
and made a complete fool of himself.

371
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,498
It was nice before.

372
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,501
Who'd want him as a son-in-law now
after he got rejected?

373
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,961
Excuse me.

374
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,963
Please watch what you say on set.

375
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,714
Hey, what did you just say?

376
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,300
You shouldn't bad-mouth
Jeong-heon like that.

377
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,887
Let's be honest. He was the reason
this program was started.

378
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,597
Gosh, I'm so scared.

379
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,600
-It's not like what we said isn't true.
-Hey!

380
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:01,893
Hyeong-taek.

381
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,604
I'm going in.

382
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,400
Hello.

383
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,735
-Hello.
-Hello.

384
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,737
-You're early.
-Yes.

385
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,907
Stand by, everyone. We'll get started.

386
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,413
All right, we're rolling.

387
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,500
Ready, cue!

388
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,545
Are you having relationship problems?

389
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,922
Bring all your romantic concerns to us!

390
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,841
We'll be your counselor and adviser.

391
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,518
Hey, you're home.

392
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,436
Yes.

393
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,230
Oh. Ki-baek, you're home.

394
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,942
Honey, do your knees still hurt?

395
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,652
Maybe it's going to rain.

396
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,404
Ki-baek, take your umbrella tomorrow.

397
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,073
When your dad's knee hurts,
it always rains the next day.

398
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,954
If it hurts, you should go see a doctor.

399
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,706
Oh, come on.

400
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,958
It's nice not having to check the weather.

401
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,337
-The pain subsides quickly anyway.
-And he has seen a doctor.

402
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,049
Things that were functioning fine
can suddenly break down at our age.

403
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,093
It costs money to see a doctor.
Plus, it's a hassle.

404
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,555
He should've seen one right away.

405
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,265
Accidents can have
long-term complications.

406
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,560
Back then, we couldn't afford it.
You know that.

407
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,479
Did you have dinner?

408
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,230
Should I fix you something to eat?

409
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,149
I ate.

410
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,492
And turn on the lights in the evening.

411
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,381
It's Hanwoo.

412
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,150
We're closed now.

413
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,903
Oh, really?

414
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:20,323
Well, I saw that the lights were still on.

415
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:23,034
I'm tidying up now. Sorry.

416
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,540
Want to have a late-night snack?
I'm kind of hungry.

417
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,501
Oh, you have a customer. I'm sorry.

418
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,296
Mom, you have a customer.

419
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,881
We're closed.

420
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,799
What?

421
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:39,843
But…

422
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,388
Ma'am, we're closed.

423
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,392
I'm sorry.

424
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,909
You wanted a snack?

425
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,203
Yes. How about fried chicken?

426
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,621
Sure.

427
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,081
-Half and half?
-Yup!

428
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,220
All right.

429
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,765
Oh, it's hot. The toast is ready.

430
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:30,018
I'll have it with some butter.

431
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,897
Shoot. My strawberry jam.

432
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,527
Everyone knows
Butter and strawberry jam go hand in hand

433
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,197
Let's go.

434
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:50,663
My new strawberry jam.
I'll put some strawberry jam and…

435
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,545
Please make sure to keep that room
out of the frame.

436
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,463
Sure thing.

437
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,218
All right.

438
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,803
Nice.

439
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,763
Now I'll enjoy--

440
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,517
Who's that?

441
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,978
Oh, hey. What's up?

442
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,022
It is nice to see you, friend.

443
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,732
What are you doing?

444
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,900
What do you mean?

445
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,819
I'm greeting my friend.

446
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:21,903
My God.

447
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,614
Jesus Christ.

448
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:32,163
The shot of him at the door is unusable.
He and I will just talk casually.

449
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,081
Sure.

450
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,332
Just be yourself.

451
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,460
You could never be an actor.

452
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,131
Hey, here.

453
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,425
It's unlike you to buy stuff.

454
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,343
I know, right?

455
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:48,429
The writers asked me
to pick up snacks you'd like.

456
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,223
Do you even know what I like?

457
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,978
Hey, top student.
You have an amazing memory.

458
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,480
Are these gummy worms yours?

459
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,817
You can't have these
because you ranked 200th in school.

460
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,985
What, 200th?

461
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,361
Edit this out, please.

462
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,197
Hey, why are you revealing my class rank?

463
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,866
You started it.

464
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,868
I called you top student to talk you up.

465
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,620
As if that would catapult me into stardom.

466
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,788
What's this gibberish?

467
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,498
You'd better not touch these.

468
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,584
I guess they're super close.

469
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,087
-Yes.
-Oh, this two-shot is interesting.

470
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,130
Good stuff.

471
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,172
What a weirdo.

472
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,682
PROPOSAL

473
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,146
Restructure the team without Woo-ju,
and you'll get a regular slot.

474
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,398
The series can't continue with Woo-ju.

475
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,528
Let's get some work done.

476
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,239
I can write another show.

477
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,699
I can do this.

478
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,297
DIRECTOR HAN YE-SEUL

479
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,510
Hi, Director Han. It's been a while.

480
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,554
Yes.

481
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,973
Later today? Of course, I'm available.

482
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,476
Okay. See you later, then.

483
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,435
All right.

484
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,956
Hey, get up.

485
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,040
Why?

486
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,251
Will you just sit here and do nothing?

487
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,385
Hey, what's this?

488
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,763
You said you were here to work,
so let's work.

489
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,266
I'm not sure if I can do it.
It's been a while

490
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,267
Nice, okay.

491
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,478
What is this? I have to dance?

492
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,479
Get ready.

493
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,317
You chose your song. This is unfair.

494
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,946
This isn't too bad. Right?

495
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,698
Oh, nice.

496
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,449
Do we really have to do this?

497
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,577
You have to do this
if you want to get paid, all right?

498
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,581
The dance goes perfectly with the song.
This is great.

499
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,292
Move aside
if you don't think you can do it.

500
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,752
It's too hard for you. Move.

501
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,297
You move aside. Let me try.
You think I can't do it?

502
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,632
I'm your raccoon

503
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,511
Even if you call me sly
No matter what you say

504
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,512
You know my song.

505
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,514
-Of course.
-Nice.

506
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,475
I mean, not of course.
But everyone in the country knows it.

507
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,894
You're my adorable chubby chub chub

508
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,772
I'm your strong, muscular man

509
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,774
Wherever we go, we're stars

510
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,652
Shake away, let's have some fun

511
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,203
All they've done is play that game.

512
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,288
What should we do?

513
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,208
All right, cut!

514
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,586
Well, why don't we take a break?

515
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,796
Nice dance. Well done.

516
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,382
I feel like we could use
something else though.

517
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,135
You really can't show us that room?

518
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,219
Like, no way?

519
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,349
Everyone thinks the viewers
would be very curious.

520
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,893
Can you let me take a peek?

521
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:26,731
Director, we already talked about this.
Why are you being like this?

522
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,192
We're doing this purely for the show.

523
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,443
It's a reality show.

524
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,489
Do people in reality shows
have to shower naked?

525
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,951
They keep their underwear on.
Isn't it just basic privacy protection?

526
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,703
Well, this is different.

527
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:44,165
It's not like I'm forcing him
to do this shoot in the room.

528
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,167
I was just asking, that's all.

529
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,921
Everyone has something
they don't want to talk about

530
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,465
or see become the subject of gossip.

531
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,885
I was talking to Jeong-heon.
No need to put me on the spot.

532
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,969
Forget it.

533
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,846
That door will remain closed.

534
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,724
It's nothing to get worked up about.

535
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:03,935
And you, don't overreact.

536
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,688
Let's play one more round then.

537
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,317
Why don't we continue tomorrow?

538
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,277
You won't get any more useful shots today.

539
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:14,821
Let's talk.

540
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,197
-But…
-Actually, just leave.

541
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:18,950
-Seriously?
-Come on.

542
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,378
All you need is sundae
with steamed pork liver.

543
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,505
Why did they tell me to get
so many things?

544
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,048
-You won't even eat these.
-Hey.

545
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,509
Stop distracting me.
Go sit down. I got this.

546
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,594
I was just trying to help.

547
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:39,887
Go away.

548
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,805
Seriously…

549
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:47,353
You're a lightweight.
Why do you have so much booze at home?

550
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:53,109
KAOLIANG LIQUOR

551
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,029
Is this the bottle from that time?

552
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,159
Are you crazy? It's not like we dated.
Why would I still have that bottle?

553
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,660
The one in there costs way more.

554
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,333
What's that?

555
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,335
I stole it from my dad.

556
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,087
Did he hit you again?

557
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,882
Don't ask. It freaking hurts.

558
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,718
He'll hit you again if he finds out.

559
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,553
I don't care.

560
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,638
Can I stay with you for a few days?

561
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,764
-Nope.
-Why not?

562
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,641
Because I feel like he'd beat me up too.

563
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,768
Yeah, right. Bullshit.

564
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,313
Psycho. You're laughing?

565
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:33,649
Should I cry, then?
Will you let me stay with you if I cry?

566
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,944
Oh, should I act pitiful?

567
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,905
Pitiful, my ass.

568
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,032
You always do whatever the hell you want.

569
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,158
Hey.

570
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,495
Try living with my dad for a week
and see if you can say that.

571
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,040
Just wait until I make my debut.

572
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,960
I'll be sure to make him regret
treating me like garbage.

573
00:36:56,088 --> 00:37:00,426
The judge who ruthlessly punishes
criminals in court comes home

574
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:03,095
and beats up his family ruthlessly.

575
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,015
He fractured my brother's ribs
when he was in twelfth grade.

576
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,853
It's embarrassing.

577
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,440
You know I only tell you
these things, right?

578
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,319
My family is so messed up.

579
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,281
Yeah, so is my family.

580
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,295
I'm transferring.

581
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:38,839
What?

582
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,800
Ever live in a basement apartment?

583
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:43,261
Are you drunk after one sip?

584
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,139
The creditors might track us down,

585
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,852
so we have to keep moving to neighborhoods
where no one knows us.

586
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,647
And I have to transfer.

587
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,900
Have you ever been on the run?

588
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,695
What the heck are you saying? Weirdo.

589
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,657
I'm telling you my secret too.

590
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,714
You can stay for a drink.

591
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,759
Why would I have a drink with you?
That's absurd.

592
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:26,762
I'm off.

593
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,532
Let's do a show together.

594
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,535
What kind? Tell me the main concept.
I'll get right on it.

595
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,163
No, no. The writer and I
have it all mapped out.

596
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,331
We want you in the show.

597
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:54,957
What?

598
00:38:55,041 --> 00:39:00,671
We're launching a YouTube channel,
and we want you as our first guest.

599
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,716
We'll also get a few other people
who were on Couple's Paradise.

600
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:04,842
What do you think?

601
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:09,263
You need to reap the benefits
of the show's popularity.

602
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,931
You're the talk of the town.

603
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:12,808
I'm sorry, Director Han.

604
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,268
I don't think I can do it.

605
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,772
Did you agree to something else?
I'll work around your schedule.

606
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,900
I won't appear on any shows.

607
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,778
This isn't why
I went on Couple's Paradise.

608
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,035
If you need another writer, let me know.

609
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,454
All right, I will.

610
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:41,504
Hi.

611
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,339
Hey. Shall we have dinner together?

612
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,882
Let's go to that gopchang place.

613
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,426
I'm kind of busy right now.

614
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,097
Sorry, Mom. I'll call you back later.

615
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,313
ANNOUNCER YOON JI-HU

616
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,951
DEAR DAD, THANK YOU
FOR BRINGING ME INTO THIS WORLD

617
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,414
Hey, Ji-hu. I wish you all the best.

618
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,331
Oh, thank you.

619
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,084
Ji-hu, I'm surprised.
I really didn't know you'd quit.

620
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,335
Oh, yeah?

621
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,586
Keep in touch.

622
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,504
Will do.

623
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,346
All right.

624
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,812
SONG KI-BAEK

625
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,189
Hey, I'm at a meeting now.

626
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,858
I'll call you back in a bit.

627
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,319
-Hello.
-Hello.

628
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,904
-It's been a while.
-I know.

629
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,186
The salon is closed for the day.

630
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,353
Come back another time.

631
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:52,760
Hey, you're home.

632
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,308
You're eating that by yourself?

633
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,311
I've been busted.

634
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,355
Eat up. It's still warm.

635
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,732
Want a drink too?

636
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:16,075
You were so little and cute,
like a cherry tomato,

637
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,701
but you're all grown up now.

638
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,009
When we first met,

639
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,512
you were about this tall.

640
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,825
I've lived one hell of a life, you know.

641
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:02,121
I lost my parents at a young age,
and my first love failed.

642
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:06,041
Then I ended up with the shamanic illness.

643
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,797
It was as if my whole body was
disintegrating every day,

644
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:16,135
but I couldn't afford to see a doctor.
Not that they could do anything.

645
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,307
The shaman I met that day said to me,

646
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,768
"You're not destined to be a shaman.

647
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,980
You're just fated to die young
because of your shamanic illness."

648
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,858
GRAMOXINE
HERBICIDE

649
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,875
I'm hungry.

650
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,421
I had eaten even though
I was determined to kill myself,

651
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,965
but that kid clearly wanted to live,
so what could I do?

652
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,675
I had to feed her.

653
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,639
Thank you.

654
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:03,974
Just eat your food.

655
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:11,523
I thought, "I'll just wait until
she finishes her food and go kill myself."

656
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,655
But no one was looking for her,

657
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,948
and she had no one to look for.

658
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:29,291
"Okay, just one more meal.

659
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,841
Then I'll go and do
what I'd set out to do."

660
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:45,808
"Just one more meal."

661
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,270
Thank you for the food!

662
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,023
"Just one more meal."

663
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,404
"For one last time."

664
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,295
There, it's done.

665
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,715
Wow!

666
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,303
One, two, three.

667
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,935
Here, this is for you.

668
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,228
Thank you.

669
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:46,994
So that's why I'm still alive,

670
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,704
thanks to my daughter, Woo-ju.

671
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,126
Which is why I'm so grateful to the woman

672
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,419
who birthed you

673
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,922
and sent you to me.

674
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:02,009
You said she had
a big birthmark on her hand.

675
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,521
You finished all the booze.

676
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,273
I'll go get more.

677
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,411
We got a regular slot
for Couple's Paradise,

678
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,121
and we'd love it if you could join.

679
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,708
It's a good idea.
And it's a win-win for both of us.

680
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,962
I guess Woo-ju will be very busy
for a while.

681
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,466
Oh, I guess you didn't know.

682
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:45,219
Woo-ju has completely left the team.

683
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,722
That was the condition
for the regular slot.

684
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,225
And Woo-ju decided to leave.

685
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,785
POOPY KI-BAEK:
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

686
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,623
I'M WORKING

687
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,919
You're working at a playground?

688
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,549
Man, look at you lying
to someone who can't lie.

689
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,466
How mean.

690
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,427
Well, I was just…

691
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,305
Did something happen?

692
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,182
No.

693
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,651
Well, it's a beautiful night.

694
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,153
How about a date?

695
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,406
Sure.

696
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,995
-Want to check out this place?
-Sure.

697
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,288
It looks nice.

698
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,790
Oh! That's Song Ki-baek.

699
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,458
Isn't she that writer?

700
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,294
-Is it her?
-I think so.

701
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,045
-Let's go somewhere else.
-What?

702
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,005
Come on.

703
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:07,968
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

704
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,762
-How dare she reject Jeong-heon?
-I know.

705
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,556
I hate On Woo-ju.

706
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:15,142
-Who does she think she is?
-She's insane.

707
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,435
She's so annoying.

708
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,353
Three servings of tteokbokki, please.

709
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,355
-And some fish cakes.
-Looks good.

710
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,482
-Right? Look at that color.
-It looks so good.

711
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,860
-It looks amazing.
-I wanted something spicy.

712
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:25,861
Really? Why?

713
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,574
I see why paparazzi catch
celebrity couples

714
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,951
at their homes or in parking lots.

715
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,370
Let's just go home.

716
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,707
No, let's find a place
with no one else around.

717
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:43,378
Okay, let's go.

718
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,091
-Where are we going?
-Just come with me.

719
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,975
It's usually pretty quiet here at night.

720
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,645
I used to come here to jog.

721
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,397
It really is quiet.

722
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,777
Oh, right. Did the shoot go well?

723
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,944
The one with Jeong-heon.

724
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,071
Not really.

725
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,823
-We almost got into a fight.
-Why?

726
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,534
Maybe not really a fight.

727
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:19,122
Anyway, it's a long story.
I'll tell you another time.

728
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:22,250
But you guys did the shoot, right?

729
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,252
Yeah, I think they got enough shots of me.

730
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,838
And I'm sure
Jeong-heon knows what he's doing.

731
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,090
He's good at this stuff.

732
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,677
How about you, Woo-ju?

733
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,303
How was it?

734
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,764
-How was what?
-Just everything.

735
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,265
Are you okay?

736
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,478
Well, yeah. I'm pretty okay.

737
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,273
Hey…

738
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:51,905
If you're not okay, just say so.

739
00:49:55,242 --> 00:50:00,080
When you're hurting or stressed,
it's okay to say so.

740
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,875
All right.

741
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,255
You don't have to bawl your eyes out,
but you can vent.

742
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,299
If I cry and vent,
will that change anything?

743
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,553
Hey.

744
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,346
I'm okay. What's with you?

745
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,852
Why do you always say you're okay?

746
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,023
You can just tell me, you know.

747
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,407
I know how you feel.

748
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:38,827
I'm grateful to have you,
to know someone's got my back.

749
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,788
So…

750
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,584
I really am okay.

751
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,081
Not now. I mean…

752
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,554
Well, you see…

753
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,639
Mr. Song is just--

754
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,641
I know. You guys live together, right?

755
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,560
I found out while gathering info
on the cast.

756
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,103
You two weren't family,

757
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:50,190
and you said you'd rented out
the second floor of your house,

758
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,566
so I figured that was it.

759
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,318
Yes, you're spot on.

760
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,738
But seeing how flustered he is,
maybe you two are

761
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,990
more than just landlord and tenant.

762
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:03,161
Well, he's quirky, you know.
He's like that every time I run into him.

763
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,412
Hello, Mr. Song!

764
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,081
Oh, yes. Hello.

765
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,334
It's been a while, I-na.

766
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,169
Oh, hello.

767
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,672
You must be very busy these days.
Congrats.

768
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,173
Thank you.

769
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,468
I don't really have
anything to do right now,

770
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,638
but I should go inside.

771
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,350
Hold on. I-na, what brings you here--

772
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,854
-Mr. Song, aren't you busy?
-I have nothing going on today.

773
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,980
What?

774
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:31,690
No.

775
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,442
There's something
we've been doing together for a while.

776
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,365
Want to join us?

777
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:51,293
I'm sorry. I don't think we can produce
the special episode of Couple's Paradise.

778
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,296
Why not?

779
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:57,299
I can't persuade them to join.
They're all so famous now.

780
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:04,472
I mean, we might still be able to,
if you could help me persuade them.

781
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:11,021
By the way, you and Ki-baek are
on good terms, aren't you?

782
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,147
Pardon me?

783
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,108
You talk about him a lot
during your live broadcasts.

784
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,526
Right.

785
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,904
Yes, we are.

786
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,616
I'm just going to be honest.

787
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:25,785
I talked to him on the phone.

788
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,955
He said he'd never do anything with you.

789
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,374
I see.

790
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,800
Where should I put this? Okay.

791
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,260
Goodness.

792
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,190
Did you have to tag along?

793
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,234
Well, I had nothing to do,
and this is a good deed.

794
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,196
It might seem suspicious if you're
seen together, but not with me.

795
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,948
And there won't be a lot of people.

796
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:06,201
There's nothing to suspect.

797
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,369
Go on. I'll follow you.

798
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,912
Take your time.

799
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:09,913
All right.

800
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,791
-Hello!
-Oh, hello.

801
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:15,085
-You should've said no.
-Hi, I-na.

802
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,629
But how? I didn't want to say no.

803
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,632
I should've just punched you right away.

804
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,217
You're quite violent.

805
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:23,927
Since you're here,

806
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,638
stay focused on why you're here
and just do laundry.

807
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,765
Just do laundry. Okay, here.

808
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,269
Should I take this?

809
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:35,855
Call me if you want to sneeze.

810
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:37,482
Will do.

811
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,736
Man, seriously. For God's sake.

812
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,488
LAUNDRY LOUNGE

813
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,999
Can you wash this too?

814
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:54,916
Sure thing!

815
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,001
Thank you.

816
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,337
Guess she hasn't washed this in a while.

817
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,923
Look, the water is turning murky. Nice.

818
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,519
Stop staring at me and wash that thing.

819
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,396
We're here to work.

820
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,440
Okay.

821
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,745
We're done!

822
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,294
Why are you grinning?

823
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,254
Because you're pretty.

824
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,424
Well, it's not like
I'm not pretty on other days.

825
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,177
Are you going to say that
every time you see me?

826
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,304
I like you more
because you're pretty every day.

827
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:52,849
I brought food.

828
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:54,059
Oh, that's…

829
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,395
The ladies over there said
we should all eat together.

830
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,022
I told them you'd eat separately.

831
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,398
Oh, okay.

832
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,650
I'll eat with them.

833
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:03,568
Okay.

834
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,326
I thought you'd need this.

835
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,036
Oh, right. Yes.

836
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:14,704
Enjoy your meal.

837
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,669
What does I-na like?

838
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,256
I'll talk to her. It will be okay.

839
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,426
Anyway, what is this?

840
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,928
Oh, this…

841
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:34,933
29,381 LIKES

842
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:37,602
KI-BAEK AND CHO-HUI
THE FINAL DATE

843
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,313
QUIT YOUR BAKERY
AND SHOW US KI-BAEK

844
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:44,234
SHE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT
SONG KI-BAEK, BUT HE IGNORES HER

845
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,527
SHE STUDIED ABROAD, SERIOUSLY?

846
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,237
WHY DOES SHE GET
SO MUCH MEDIA COVERAGE?

847
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,960
KIM JU-YEON:
CHO-HUI, DID YOU SEE THIS?

848
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:23,398
This is nice.

849
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:28,486
I come here sometimes to help them
with their laundry and camp.

850
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:32,240
But why laundry?
There are other volunteer opportunities.

851
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:38,079
Some seniors struggle with laundry.
This way they can sleep on clean bedding.

852
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:40,999
When you do laundry,
your hard work doesn't betray you,

853
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,460
and you can see the results.
That's why I like it.

854
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,178
Yesterday…

855
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,849
I wanted to comfort you.

856
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:03,271
I just wanted to do something
for you, anything.

857
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,691
I was a little hurt.

858
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:11,237
You kept saying you were okay,
with a smile on your face.

859
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:19,078
But now that I've spent the whole day
with you here, I've realized…

860
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:26,211
that just being together makes you smile.

861
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:35,178
It's my favorite face, my favorite smile.

862
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,016
You're not smiling because of me.

863
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:46,898
On Woo-ju has to smile
because she wants to.

864
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,107
Enjoy!

865
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:56,908
Whether you want to smile or cry,
the decision should come from you.

866
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,085
On Woo-ju,
you look really pretty when you smile.

867
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:11,130
But you look very pretty
even when you're not smiling.

868
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,136
So just do what you want.

869
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,181
Smile when you want to,
and cry when you feel like it.

870
00:59:21,349 --> 00:59:24,227
I'll be right by your side,
just like today.

871
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,569
It's fine if you want to say you're okay.

872
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,949
And it's fine
if you want to say you're not okay.

873
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:51,212
The stars look really pretty here.

874
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:03,016
Come on. Not as pretty as On Woo-ju.

875
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,197
I saw my mom.

876
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,702
My biological mother.

877
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,998
My mother who abandoned me.

878
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:33,129
And I've decided to leave
the Couple's Paradise team.

879
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:39,093
Everything will be all right
now that I've left the team.

880
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,644
But I…

881
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,734
I'm not okay at all.

882
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,162
I'm tired.

883
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:08,956
I should go to bed.

884
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,008
Can you sing me a lullaby?

885
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:41,114
When the mother goes to the isle

886
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:48,079
To pick oysters

887
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:54,627
The baby is left alone

888
01:01:55,962 --> 01:02:01,008
In the house

889
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:08,141
Listening to the lullaby

890
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:14,939
From the sea

891
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:22,822
The baby

892
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,537
Falls asleep

893
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:37,754
Even though the baby

894
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:44,010
Is fast asleep

895
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:32,725
What the…

896
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:38,481
Oh… You woke up.

897
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,617
You shouldn't see that. It's…

898
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,702
YEON
WHAT IS GOING ON?

899
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:56,624
What?

900
01:03:59,001 --> 01:03:59,836
What…

901
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:06,551
What?

902
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,348
COUPLE'S PARADISE!
EVERYTHING WAS A LIE?!

903
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:14,934
COUPLE'S PARADISE WAS ALL A LIE

904
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:34,412
FRANKLY SPEAKING

905
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:38,374
Mom! They say Couple's Paradise
was all rigged.

906
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,293
Let's discuss what we're going to do.

907
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,712
Is it true our show may not continue?

908
01:04:43,963 --> 01:04:46,048
On Woo-ju is the crazy bitch.

909
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,759
He's been reporting the haters
and replying to the comments.

910
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,345
Does Un-baek like you?

911
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,472
Do you like him too?

912
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,850
Should I just retire?
Can I call myself successful?

913
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,021
You must have an interview to explain it.

914
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,398
Are you and Ms. On Woo-ju together?

915
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:03,316
Mr. An.

916
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,067
The switch is gone.

917
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:11,657
