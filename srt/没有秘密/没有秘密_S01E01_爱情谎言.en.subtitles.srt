NEWS AT NOON

3
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,981
Good afternoon,
and welcome to JBC News at Noon.

4
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,232
SONG KI-BAEK

5
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,195
It's been four years
since workplace bullying was prohibited

6
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:14,783
under the revised Labor Standards Act,
which took effect in July 2019.

7
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,119
Some say it has contributed
to raising awareness,

8
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:23,333
but many people are still suffering
from workplace conflict and harassment.

9
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:28,046
Kim Seo-jun has more on the story.
Reporter Kim Seo-jun.

10
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,174
Reporter Kim Seo-jun.

11
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,346
Reporter Kim Seo-jun?

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,015
Reporter Kim Seo-jun.

13
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,810
REPORTER KIM SEO-JUN

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,272
Yes. How are things on Planet Warr?

15
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,527
Yes. I'm here because
I received a tip-off that Tyranno Max,

16
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,655
the one who protects Planet Warr,

17
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,116
forced Agent Harry
to go hunting against his will.

18
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,076
He made an herbivore dinosaur go hunting?

19
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,328
That is wrong and unfair.

20
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:04,958
That's right. But Harry has to get
a reference letter from Max,

21
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,043
so he's been crying every night.

22
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,629
Hey, behave yourself.

23
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,548
Oh, boy. The situation seems serious.

24
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,384
Pachycephalosaurus and Brachiosaurus
also belong to

25
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,388
the Herbivore Dinosaurs Association.
Has the HDA made any moves yet?

26
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,809
I think it's wrong to order others around,
just because you're strong.

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,729
That wasn't in the script, you know.

28
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,106
Dad!

29
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,901
-Hold on. Is that a camera?
-Yes, it is.

30
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,902
Whoa.

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,532
Isn't this considered
workplace harassment?

32
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:41,369
Did he really have to bring his son
to work for his work experience?

33
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,165
I really respect Ki-baek.

34
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,667
He came two hours early
and waited on standby for this.

35
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,751
-God.
-Look at this.

36
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,920
Why would he do this?
He already has it all.

37
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,297
He's going overboard.

38
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,217
He doesn't have it all.

39
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,637
You think it's easy
to get the main news anchor title?

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,766
It's not like you guys would do this
if he told you to.

41
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,269
Mr. Kim pesters you until you give in.

42
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,520
Look at that.

43
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,522
And Ki-baek knows to put up with it.

44
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,774
I joined JBC
because of Ki-baek's news show.

45
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,234
What a letdown.

46
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,695
We may be announcers
in front of the camera,

47
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,739
but we're all just employees after all.

48
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,409
Don't come any closer!

49
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,663
Oh, Ki-baek. The closing line.

50
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,213
I sincerely promise you
that I'll only report the truth

51
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,882
and never lie to you.

52
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,470
Song Ki-baek, JBC News.

53
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,015
All right, let's take a picture.
Everyone, gather around.

54
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:47,769
All right.

55
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,647
One, two, three.

56
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,982
I WANT TO BE A REPORTER!

57
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,151
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK
WISHING YOU HAPPINESS

58
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,788
All right. Let's get ready!

59
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,839
Be punctual, will you?

60
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,801
Just an FYI.
We changed the opening line slightly.

61
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,099
All right. It's 11:57.
We have three minutes.

62
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,100
Stand by.

63
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,688
Ki-baek.

64
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,109
Be patient, and you'll soon be able
to anchor the main news show.

65
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,363
Kudos for putting up with that
this morning.

66
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,866
Your body reacts to stress right away.

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,869
Someone from hair and makeup
bought this from Japan.

68
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,330
It's good for the stomach.

69
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,549
Hye-yeon, your phone keeps buzzing.

70
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,393
Is something wrong?

71
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,312
Yes. What?

72
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,858
Hye-yeon, you don't look so well.

73
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,192
Are you all right?

74
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,695
Let's focus.

75
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,114
-All right, guys. Stand by.
-Stand by.

76
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,574
Stand by.

77
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,425
Ready.

78
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,844
All right. Here we go.

79
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,888
Cue.

80
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,520
EPISODE 1: IT'S A LIE

81
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:56,105
Good afternoon,

82
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,232
and welcome to JBC News at Noon.

83
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,446
Last week saw the highest number
of new flu cases reported since 2000.

84
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,530
Enjoy.

85
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,573
Thank you.

86
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm Kim Joo-ho.

87
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,248
WRITER HYE-JIN:
DID YOU MEET HIM?

88
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,458
YES, WE MET UP JUST NOW

89
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,834
GOOD LUCK

90
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:18,920
Oh, let me.

91
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,131
I'm sitting closer. Just wait here.

92
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,301
You're very efficient.

93
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,971
Time is precious, you know.
Let me go get our precious coffee.

94
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,348
Sure.

95
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:50,535
Oh, right. On TV, I've seen writers
working away in fancy studios.

96
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,411
Not variety show writers.

97
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,705
When I'm working,
I don't even have time to sit.

98
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,582
I even have to eat standing up.

99
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,709
You know the office caste system?

100
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,671
Oh, are writers the second caste?

101
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,047
Then I could sit and work.

102
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,510
If there were ten castes,
then writers would be

103
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,262
at rock bottom.

104
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,555
Rock bottom?

105
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,141
We have countless annoying, petty tasks.

106
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,395
From planning, casting, location scouting,
and from editing to comforting the cast.

107
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,522
At times, I wonder
if I'm just an errand girl.

108
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,901
That's right. I am an errand girl.

109
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,945
One who runs all sorts of petty errands.

110
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,201
Well, then you're probably
too busy to date anyone.

111
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,620
Oh, please.
We can always find time to date.

112
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,457
Years ago, we went to go shoot
in Thailand.

113
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,292
Back then, we were so busy.

114
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,712
On the day we were coming back,
a writer burst into tears at the airport.

115
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,964
I got worried and was like,
"What happened?"

116
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,717
All of a sudden,
a handsome Thai boy showed up and…

117
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,061
Was Bangkok's full name in the script?
Or is he improvising?

118
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,146
Improvising, I think.

119
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,023
Song Ki-baek never disappoints.

120
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,443
A city with a beautiful name, Bangkok.

121
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,199
I haven't been to Bangkok,
but to celebrate Visit Thailand Year…

122
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,160
What's with Hye-yeon today?
Did something happen?

123
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,286
I wonder too.

124
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:18,080
Most people don't know
Bangkok's full name.

125
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,417
You must be very interested in Thailand.

126
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,835
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

127
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,338
Ki-baek is on a roll these days.

128
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,089
This show's ratings have gone up.

129
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,675
Also, I heard he was born
into a wealthy family.

130
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,470
He's from a good family
on top of being competent and kind.

131
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,015
He has it all, which is clearly why
he's always so relaxed.

132
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:36,974
I'm jealous.

133
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,060
That's why we call him
the blue-chip stock.

134
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:43,648
The main anchor position always goes to
the young and rich, the tall and handsome.

135
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,067
He'll be the main anchor
of the nine o'clock news.

136
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,194
He'd be the first male announcer to do it.

137
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,570
-Really?
-Yes.

138
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:52,156
Must be nice to be that successful
at a young age.

139
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,076
Way to go.

140
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,577
So what's happening now?

141
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,913
Just keep him there a few more minutes.

142
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,165
I'll be right there. Okay, I have to go.

143
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,961
Was that one of those "annoying" tasks?

144
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,004
That's right.

145
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,466
If someone you know
wants to be a variety show writer,

146
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,717
talk them out of it.

147
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,845
Variety shows are really fun
when you're watching them.

148
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,765
I'm a huge fan of Men on the Run.

149
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,476
I rush home from work
to watch it and enjoy a solo drink.

150
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,687
-You're a Men on the Run fan?
-Sorry?

151
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,564
It's why I can put up with my job.

152
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,733
Falling asleep, laughing after eating
in the comfort of your own home.

153
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,318
It feels so awesome.

154
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,780
That's why I can't run away
from this hellhole.

155
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,409
-Oh, boy.
-Right.

156
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,326
Yes.

157
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:41,872
I see.

158
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,212
Email me the details, and I'll go over it.

159
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,882
As you already know,
the show is quite popular.

160
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,801
Appearing in it is great marketing.

161
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,971
The doctor on the previous team
opened a new clinic in Gangnam.

162
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,306
I see.

163
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,684
Oh, you can get going. You seem busy.

164
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,813
Variety show writers have
such a tough job.

165
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,649
Being unfunny is what's stressful for us,
not being busy.

166
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,029
Anyway, I really have to go.
I'll be in touch.

167
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,573
All right. Bye.

168
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,117
Yes, I'll be there shortly.

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,785
I told you I'd be right there.

170
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,581
About 20 minutes?
Hold on. No. Ten minutes.

171
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,875
I bet she really has no time to date.

172
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,378
ON WOO-JU
MEN ON THE RUN WRITER

173
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,463
It's such a shame.

174
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,507
The system must be expanded

175
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,260
so children in need
will no longer be left out.

176
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,473
Hye-yeon, your phone keeps buzzing.

177
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,393
HUSBAND: I'LL TEACH YOU TWO
A LESSON, JUST WAIT AND SEE

178
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,033
Hye-yeon, aren't you
going to say your line?

179
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,163
As adults, it is our duty
to protect children.

180
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,749
It's important to pay attention
in your day-to-day life.

181
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,378
VCR, cue.

182
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,507
-Hey!
-Yes.

183
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,549
Are you insane?

184
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,885
The director is watching this.

185
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,970
Another reshuffle is coming.
Get it together!

186
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,515
Hye-yeon.

187
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,100
Let's focus, okay?

188
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,269
Camera three, show Ki-baek.

189
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,774
Here's today's weather.

190
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,331
-Hello.
-Where is he?

191
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,959
Oh, the producer told us
not to call you, but--

192
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,669
Then you shouldn't have called me.

193
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,546
He said no female guests.

194
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:56,966
Why? Yesterday, he even said he'd go
to the salon early to prep for the shoot.

195
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,217
Well, the thing is…

196
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,218
What's the problem?

197
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,136
Well…

198
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,431
-His girlfriend won't let him.
-Quiet.

199
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,348
What?

200
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,559
He can't even make eye contact
with other women.

201
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:09,895
No, that's…

202
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,940
It's fish sauce. She drank it.

203
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,861
It's weak. Put in more fish sauce.

204
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,237
This won't do.

205
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,947
-What?
-Isn't this fish sauce?

206
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,198
Yes, it's strong enough.

207
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,658
Jesus.

208
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,163
Listen, trust me on this.
I'll make you look like Chae Chi-su today.

209
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:31,500
The team captain who only thinks about
basketball and his team. What do you say?

210
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,420
I can't be in the same frame
with the female guests.

211
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,965
Can't you just say
I'm not feeling well today?

212
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:42,344
I mean, I could.
But the show's called Men on the Run.

213
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,804
You need to actually run.

214
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,931
I'll tweak things
so you'll have no issues.

215
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,894
Who is she?

216
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,940
Who is it this time? Tell me.
I'll go and persuade her.

217
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:55,858
What? Cut it out.

218
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,278
Because of her,
you can't think rationally right now.

219
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,196
Punch in her number.

220
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,073
It's because
I'm really not feeling well today.

221
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,285
Hey, Kim Seong-hun! Who is she?

222
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,084
Isn't that your husband?

223
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,089
-What are you doing? Get out!
-Honey?

224
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,132
Director!

225
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,800
Kim Seong-hun, you son of a bitch!

226
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,055
Kim Seong-hun should be punished
for destroying my family.

227
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,349
He slept with my wife. That…

228
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,150
Wait, I-- Hold on.

229
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:42,696
You all need to know the truth
about that bastard who slept with my wife!

230
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,532
Please don't do this. We're on air.

231
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,491
-Why not?
-Get out!

232
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm doing this to get you guys in trouble.

233
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,833
I apologize.

234
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,835
That was an unexpected--

235
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:05,177
I apologize for the interruption.
Please understand--

236
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,722
Kim Seong-hun, you scumbag.
Do you know who I am? You bastard.

237
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,975
You'd better come here now. Right now!

238
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,060
Please…

239
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,483
What are you waiting for?
Switch on the ending signal!

240
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,610
Call the police. Dial 112.

241
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,988
Hey! What is going on?

242
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,449
What is happening?

243
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,367
Let go.

244
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,661
What are you waiting for? Switch that off.

245
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,079
Hurry!

246
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,214
The ending signal!

247
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,009
Someone barged into the studio.

248
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,345
At noon…

249
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,141
WHO WATCHES THE NEWS THESE DAYS?

250
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,311
ISN'T IT ALL FAKE NEWS ANYWAY?

251
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,647
I sincerely promise you

252
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,483
that I'll only report the truth
and never lie to you.

253
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,443
NEWS AT NOON

254
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,944
A NEW BEGINNING FOR KOREAN NEWS

255
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,196
Security!

256
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,116
Security!

257
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,078
You're just going to leave?

258
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,246
-Woo-ju!
-Woo-ju!

259
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,456
What now?

260
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,667
We have a big problem.
Seong-hun's name is all over the news.

261
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,210
-What do you mean?
-Woo-ju, look.

262
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,963
KIM SEONG-HUN HAVING AN AFFAIR?

263
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,384
-I'm screwed. Hey, let's go!
-But…

264
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,595
What? Wait, Seong-hun!

265
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,264
Oh, no.

266
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,853
My gosh. They're 12 years apart.

267
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,146
Seriously.

268
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:47,738
My apologies. It's all my fault.
I should've handled it better.

269
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,240
Of course. Clearly, it's not my fault.

270
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,868
How was I supposed to know in advance

271
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,704
that the announcer's husband
would cause a scene

272
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,248
because his wife was having an affair
with Seong-hun?

273
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,549
I'm sorry. I understand I should
take responsibility as the head writer.

274
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,634
Why are you sorry?

275
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,262
Those cheaters owe us an apology.
Why are you always apologizing?

276
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,806
KIM SANG-JIN

277
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,016
Damn it.

278
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,562
How dare they bring an abominable
personal matter into the news studio?

279
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,692
This happens when people don't separate
their personal and professional lives.

280
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,610
You know?

281
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,154
-Right?
-Yes.

282
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,781
You're absolutely right.

283
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,659
But we do have to follow the protocol,

284
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,995
so we'll need to submit a report.

285
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,874
It's really embarrassing though, you know?

286
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,627
So you take care of it
and get it sorted out.

287
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,586
Sure.

288
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,255
Ensure uninvolved parties aren't affected.

289
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,590
Especially people like…

290
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,634
Like me.

291
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,720
Yes, sir.

292
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,888
You can go now.

293
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,310
Oh, about the audition
for the main anchor position.

294
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,064
Yes. You said you'd give me
an update today.

295
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,401
I got your name on the list of candidates.

296
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,318
I see.

297
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,362
But the thing is,

298
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,742
I'm not sure if it's a good thing
or a bad thing.

299
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,493
What do you mean?

300
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:21,373
You know, your face is everywhere
because of the incident on the news today.

301
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,085
Everyone in the country
knows your name now.

302
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:30,799
You see, I think it could help you out,
but at the same time…

303
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:38,348
So it could give me a competitive edge
over the other candidates?

304
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,060
That's right.

305
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,355
So don't be discouraged.
Go and get ready for the audition.

306
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,068
I'll prepare thoroughly and do my best
so I won't miss this opportunity.

307
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,321
Oh, Seong-gyu! Mr. Superstar.

308
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,281
To what do I owe the pleasure?

309
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,076
What? You can go.

310
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,745
Hey, well…

311
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,372
Can I get your autograph? Just a couple.

312
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,169
CHEATING AND PUNISHMENT
BIZARRE TV NEWS BLUNDER

313
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,176
Guess your shoot ended early.

314
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,220
Yes.

315
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:21,475
Tantan had to attend an event
in the countryside, so we ended early.

316
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,729
Hey, are you all right? I read the story.

317
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,149
Your face looked awful in that photo.

318
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,822
Who cares about my face?
It destroyed the news program's dignity.

319
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,240
Spoken like a true anchorman.

320
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,161
Oh, right. I heard you
turned down Golden Family.

321
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,871
For the episode featuring announcers.

322
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,541
Everyone wants to be on that show.

323
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,627
Do you even visit your family these days?

324
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,713
Your mom's been calling me.
She said she couldn't reach you.

325
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,175
God, you scared me.

326
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,343
Oh, I'm sorry.

327
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,803
I see that you're working hard.

328
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,849
Man, you handled that so well.

329
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,934
I would've peed my pants, for sure.

330
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,645
Are you really going to
turn down Golden Family?

331
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,065
They said they'd contact me
if you said no.

332
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,569
Oh, it doesn't work with my schedule.
You should do it.

333
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,991
Heard your family can't do it.
Do they live far away?

334
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,242
Yes.

335
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,368
Do they live abroad?

336
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,579
Oh… Hey, I'm off.

337
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,664
Well, they live far away.

338
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,668
So you live alone in that big house
in Seongsu-dong?

339
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,172
Rumor has it you'd make headlines
in the finance section

340
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,675
if your house were to be revealed.
Is it true?

341
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,261
It must be true.

342
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,056
No wonder Mr. Kim always has your back
and no one else's.

343
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,766
What do you mean, he has my back?

344
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,476
All he does is dump work on me.

345
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,936
You know how he is.

346
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,232
He's keeping you by his side
because he knows he can benefit from it.

347
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,037
Will I really be all right?

348
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,915
Mr. Kim, please put in a good word for me.

349
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,793
It's the stress.

350
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,714
Cancel the show?
Are you really going to do this to me?

351
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,550
When you asked me to help
a program pulling in 3% in ratings,

352
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,178
I pulled all-nighters for three months
without complaining.

353
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,181
Now, the ratings are at a whopping 18%.

354
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:28,644
All right, I heard you.
Then persuade the no-show first.

355
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,439
Sure thing.
You cannot cancel the show, ma'am.

356
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,275
Woo-ju, you'd better step up your game.

357
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,987
I heard your rival show on tvM
might cast Kim Jeong-heon.

358
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,739
-Who?
-My goodness.

359
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,742
You don't know who Kim Jeong-heon is?
Everyone's ideal son-in-law.

360
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,619
Mr. Honey Bunny.

361
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:47,955
The doors are closing.

362
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,429
Hello? Hey.

363
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,231
CLOSED FOR INSPECTION

364
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,525
When people get off, you can get started.

365
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,026
…get started.

366
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,530
Has he lost his mind?
How dare he say he'll drop out?

367
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,408
Hey, make sure Mr. Kim doesn't leave.

368
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,785
I'll be there in three… No, in one minute.

369
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,538
Make sure he doesn't leave
until I get there.

370
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:31,039
Do whatever it takes.

371
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,377
Well, lock the door or cause a scene.
I'll be there shortly, okay?

372
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,755
What? I can't hear you.
I'm in the elevator now.

373
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,134
I said, I'm in the elevator now.

374
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,472
What?

375
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:49,891
What is this?

376
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,485
Nothing's going my way today.

377
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,746
Mr. Song Ki-baek?
Can you give me a hand?

378
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,710
It's dangerous to force open the doors
when the elevator's not working.

379
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,464
I know that because I worked on
Emergency Escape Number 3,

380
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,341
but I don't have time for this.

381
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,593
Maybe they're doing a routine inspection,

382
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,094
so let's wait a bit.

383
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,814
Did you fart?

384
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,275
Did you poop?

385
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:42,944
No, I did not.

386
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:48,575
Also, the official medical term
is "flatulence," not "fart."

387
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,369
Okay. So it was a wet fart.

388
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,623
Ouch.

389
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,920
Hurry up and help me open this!

390
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,297
It was just a fart this time,
but if it happens again,

391
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,840
you won't be able to hold it in.

392
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,135
I can't really move
or use my physical strength right now.

393
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:08,804
Seriously.

394
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,264
I guess I've been under a lot of stress.

395
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,517
And I think I have indigestion.

396
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,310
Don't care, didn't ask.

397
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,978
Just don't poop in here.

398
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,772
Don't you worry.

399
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,989
They're under inspection.
Use that elevator.

400
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,160
-It's over there.
-Hello?

401
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,996
Hello? We're trapped in here!

402
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,166
We're in this elevator.

403
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,172
What do we do?
Hello? We're trapped in here!

404
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,966
We're inside!

405
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,175
You're in the elevator?

406
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,427
Yes, we're trapped in here!

407
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,428
One moment!

408
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,978
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm all right.

409
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,855
Okay, just one moment.

410
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,814
Okay.

411
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,192
Can you move?

412
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,824
Well, I'm in a rush too. Cheer up.

413
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:12,993
Pull me out, please.

414
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,498
-Are you all right?
-Thank you.

415
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,500
Yes, I'm coming.

416
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,668
Are you all right?

417
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,171
What are you doing?
You don't want to come out?

418
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,008
Hurry up.

419
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,262
Come on out!

420
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,556
Keep out!

421
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,144
Is he okay?

422
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,478
What should we do?

423
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,605
Are you okay?

424
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:43,023
Did something bad happen?

425
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,215
Man, it's only 3:00 p.m.

426
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,222
JBC, WE CAN DO IT!

427
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,682
SMOKE-FREE FOR 87 DAYS,
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK

428
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,442
How about a beer after work?

429
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,153
-I'm supposed to see my friends today.
-Damn.

430
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,864
Oh, right. The audition for main anchor.

431
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,158
I heard some announcers were applying too.

432
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,160
I heard Song Ki-baek was doing it.

433
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,371
Hey, buddy. We have to bring our A-game.

434
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:43,458
The main anchor is like the face of JBC.
We can't let an announcer take the job.

435
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,087
Why not? Because it has never happened
in the history of JBC.

436
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,463
Come here.

437
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:52,425
When the CEO is finalizing his decision,
he collects the employees' opinions.

438
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:57,472
He asks all the producers and directors
what they think about the candidates.

439
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,224
Oh, I see.

440
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,061
Hello, Mr. Song.

441
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,022
Ki-baek!

442
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,607
Director Kim, why…

443
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,067
Hey, are you free now?

444
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,735
I have a no-show for a live show.

445
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,779
Can you spare me an hour…
No, half an hour.

446
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,907
Oh, I'm sorry.
I really want to help you, but…

447
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,286
When the CEO is finalizing his decision,
he collects the employees' opinions.

448
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,456
He asks all the producers and directors
what they think about the candidates.

449
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,084
I mean, I want to help you, so I will.
Let's go.

450
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,170
This way.

451
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,257
THROW OUT

452
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,767
Guys, we have to do the shoot this week.

453
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,853
If not, we'll all be screwed.

454
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,563
-Let's make it happen.
-Yes, ma'am.

455
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,732
I-na, that profile I printed earlier…

456
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,907
It's removable, right?

457
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,659
Last time, you used waterproof…

458
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,913
I threw out
those waterproof face markers right away.

459
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,374
This is a PPL product,
so I want to test it--

460
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,292
Okay.

461
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,919
I just want to test it.

462
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,088
Keep your eyes peeled.

463
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,715
The pay…

464
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,094
Announcers are our only option if we
consider the pay and the tight schedule.

465
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,598
Do we really have to play
this game right now?

466
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,810
Woo-ju said we should try things ourselves
to make sure they'll be successful.

467
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,854
Yes, it could help us come up
with useful ideas…

468
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,315
Here. Go for it.

469
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,362
-I'm sorry.
-Do we really have no one else?

470
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,155
EMPLOYEE RECORD, SONG KI-BAEK

471
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,367
Damn it. What's "announcer" in Korean?

472
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,743
Ki-baek! This way.

473
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,787
-Quick!
-Go inside and get ready!

474
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,121
We're good now. He's here.

475
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,749
Get ready! Ki-baek, go inside. Get ready.

476
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,792
We can do this.

477
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,003
Just change the opening line.
I trust you'll do great!

478
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,549
Calm down. Okay, ready.

479
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,847
Now, we're on.

480
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:11,147
Hello. I'm Song Ki-baek, the special DJ
for The Man Who Reads Poetry.

481
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,694
I-na. Hey, I-na.

482
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,157
I-na.

483
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,326
I-na!

484
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,957
How many days have you not changed?

485
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,293
Nine days.

486
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,133
Don't go to the sauna.
Use this to cab home.

487
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,427
Go home and come back.

488
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,262
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

489
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,348
No, not for you.

490
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,812
-Ouch.
-What's so interesting?

491
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,564
I want in on it.

492
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,816
This is the real-time chat
for a radio show.

493
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,401
A radio show? Is it funny?

494
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,070
A close friend of mine is one
of the show's writers.

495
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,156
They have a special DJ for the day,

496
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,199
and the regular listeners are teasing him.

497
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,409
Want to take a listen?

498
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:08,288
You're monitoring someone else's show?
Way to go, I-na. Let's hear it.

499
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,836
In this segment,
the poems you requested are read.

500
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,755
The next poem is…

501
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,215
I'M SORRY

502
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,066
"Upo Wetland" by Kim Ba-da.

503
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,905
"The Upo Wetland shrouded by fog
Is where the birds live

504
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,160
Waek, waek, waek, waek, waek, waek

505
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:53,500
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack
Qua-quack, qua-quack, flutter, flutter

506
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:58,379
Aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck
Aeck, waek, aeck, weak, aeck, weak

507
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,967
Aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck
Aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck, aeck

508
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:06,721
Caw-ak-ak, caw-ak-ak-ak, caw

509
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:11,142
Du-du, du-du, du, du-du
Cheep-cheep, cheep-cheep

510
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,478
Croon, croon, croon, croon, croon, croon

511
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,395
Du-du, du-du"

512
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,688
This is an actual poem?

513
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,732
His diction is so good. Who is this guy?

514
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,025
Song Ki-baek, the announcer.

515
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,151
Song Ki-baek?

516
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,278
Oh, the poopy pants.

517
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,697
He's got a really nice voice.

518
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,492
Right? Everyone in the chat room
is going wild.

519
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,077
He hasn't gotten a syllable wrong.

520
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:33,748
"Qwock, qwock, qwock"

521
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,961
That was "Upo Wetland" by Kim Ba-da.

522
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:43,299
"UPO WETLAND" FROM COW DUNG
BALLS ARE THE BEST! BY KIM BA-DA

523
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,555
I've never seen Song Ki-baek appear
on a variety show.

524
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:52,100
He doesn't have to do what he doesn't like
because his family is well-off.

525
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,727
He only does what he wants to.
Namely, news programs.

526
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,105
He was the one
who got attacked on the news.

527
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,316
I heard it was a hot mess.
Can he still anchor news shows?

528
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,068
I guess we could try asking him.

529
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,613
I think he stays away from variety shows
because of his image as an anchor.

530
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,242
It's our job to pull down
the likes of him off their high horse.

531
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:11,953
My gut's telling me to go for it.

532
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,739
CHINESE CRASH COURSE
FOR BEGINNERS

533
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,996
The Seoun Metropolitan Office of Education

534
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,957
has decided to close
Dorang Elementary School.

535
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,501
This is the fourth elementary school

536
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,546
to shut down in Seoun since 2018.

537
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,799
The Seoun Metropolitan Office of Education

538
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,344
also implied that they might
close more schools…

539
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,346
"HEY, LET GO"
THE JBC NEWS STUDIO INCIDENT

540
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,349
…that do not meet the minimum requirements
to stay open.

541
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,768
They also stated
they had more plans to help

542
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,687
small schools stay open,
such as allowing students

543
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,856
to transfer out of their school districts.

544
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,818
According to Statistics Korea,
the low birth rate among…

545
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,698
There are only 406,000 children
born in 2016 entering school this year,

546
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:35,703
and the total number of children
born in 2020 is 272,000.

547
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,747
Next news.

548
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,968
I sincerely promise you

549
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,471
that I'll only report the truth
and never lie to you.

550
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,518
Song Ki-baek, JBC News.

551
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,112
We're screwed.
We have no one left to call.

552
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:13,616
I've got one left.

553
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:19,288
Let's ride on his coattails
while everyone's talking about him.

554
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,207
Like discovering a new dark horse.

555
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:24,919
-Am I going overboard?
-Yes, you are going overboard.

556
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,963
We have nothing to lose anyway.

557
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:32,135
Let's do this and see
where it takes us, Song Ki-baek.

558
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,975
Why am I so cold all of a sudden?

559
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,686
He's so handsome.

560
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,146
And he has a heart of gold.

561
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,940
He's good-looking and kind,
and he's a good singer.

562
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,444
The star we'll meet
on Real Entertainment News today is

563
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,531
the charmer and Mr. Popular
who has won all the ladies' hearts.

564
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,117
It's none other than Kim Jeong-heon,
the ideal son-in-law.

565
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,911
My god, what's with that hideous costume?

566
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,621
What's wrong with the way I look?

567
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:04,167
Jeong-heon, can't you see
how awful you look right now?

568
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:07,587
I told you to go straight home
after yesterday's shoot.

569
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,548
I went straight home.

570
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:11,841
With the whole crew?

571
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,676
Either way, I did go straight home.

572
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,345
How much longer
are you going to wear this T-shirt?

573
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,264
That show's director must be retired now.

574
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:19,515
He retired last year.

575
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,559
So as his retirement gift…

576
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,937
Hyeong-taek, what did I send?
Oh, the full fishing set. That's right.

577
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,689
And why did you agree to do this show?

578
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,483
Your schedule is full.

579
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,568
I told them you'd join next season.

580
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,986
You should've played dumb.

581
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,821
Why did you have to step in?

582
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,449
We'll start at 1:00 p.m.

583
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,492
Got it.

584
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,243
I'm so hungover.

585
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,037
Oh, I'm still drinking that.

586
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,088
KIM JEONG-HEON

587
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,804
WE LOVE YOU

588
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,058
You're my adorable honey bunny

589
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,520
And I'm your raccoon

590
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,856
Even if you call me sly
No matter what you say

591
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,776
I'll always be right by your side

592
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,821
Director Jung, you promised
you wouldn't make Jeong-heon sing.

593
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:17,198
What? I didn't ask him to sing.

594
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,909
This was Jeong-heon's idea.

595
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,578
He hasn't sung in years.

596
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:27,416
Hop, hop, my adorable lady

597
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,586
Come to me, softly and quietly

598
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,629
-Come to me!
-Come to me!

599
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,590
Shyly profess your love to me and run away

600
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,301
No, no, don't go that way

601
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,427
-Don't go!
-Don't go!

602
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,639
That's where the wolves live

603
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:46,227
Make way, all of you, here I come

604
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,981
The raccoon that keeps his bunny safe

605
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:56,237
I'm your forever soul mate

606
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,620
The Best Trot Singer, Season Five!

607
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,206
THE BEST TROT SINGER 5

608
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,500
It's good to be here. I'm Kim Jeong-heon.

609
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,211
-Kim Jeong-heon!
-Kim Jeong-heon!

610
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,214
That was my first time singing
on stage in years.

611
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,632
I was so nervous.

612
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,303
But the contestants must be
even more nervous than I was,

613
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,180
so please show them lots of support.

614
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,766
All right.
The Best Trot Singer, Season Five.

615
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,852
It begins now.

616
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,277
Let's get our act together and focus.

617
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,071
The junior writer is broke,
the subwriter doesn't have time--

618
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,865
The head writer has lost her touch.

619
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,367
Let's go.

620
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,285
Where are we going?

621
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,411
Garak-dong.

622
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,329
Garak-dong? Why?

623
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:50,541
Let's go to the fruit market.
I need some inspiration. Tons of it.

624
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,126
What? Cut it out.

625
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,880
Hey, you know I have a knack
for discovering new variety show stars.

626
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,299
Song Ki-baek, there's something about him.

627
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,718
He looks like a perfectly ironed shirt,

628
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,971
but I can sense his inner loser.
He's perfect variety show material.

629
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,849
Man, I'm tired. Let's go home.

630
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,268
Let's get some sleep
and talk again tomorrow.

631
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,520
Good night. I mean,
have an inspiring night.

632
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:12,897
All right.

633
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,775
Nice. A new car!

634
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,756
What?

635
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,845
Look at that scaredy-cat acting all tough.

636
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,020
Let's go.

637
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,242
A variety show?

638
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,577
You told me to prep for the audition.

639
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,830
I did? When?

640
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,999
Oh, come on. Then what?

641
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:16,460
Should I tell you to sit around
and do nothing as your manager?

642
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,213
You said everyone knowing my face
was a good thing.

643
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,881
Everyone does indeed. Look.

644
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,926
Your face is everywhere.
But in a ridiculously embarrassing way.

645
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,220
What are you going to do?
You call this an anchor?

646
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,139
Look. Isn't this Comedy Big League?

647
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,725
Did he get an earful from the higher-ups?

648
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,852
He recommended Ki-baek for main anchor

649
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,521
and got chewed out
for disgracing the network's reputation.

650
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,816
The way he changes his stance
is as swift as Son Heung-min's footwork.

651
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,404
I do want to participate in the audition.

652
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,282
Please just listen to me, okay?

653
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,535
I'm only suggesting this
because I know you can do it.

654
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,079
You excel at everything.
Why are you being so stubborn?

655
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,664
For the time being,

656
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,293
you should focus on variety shows
and culture shows.

657
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:00,212
I mean, you've got an offer.
How nice is that?

658
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,465
Others are dying
to appear on variety shows.

659
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,133
I want to do it too.

660
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,593
I'd say yes right away.

661
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:11,390
You know I can't go back to news programs
once I start appearing in variety shows.

662
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,059
Come on, these days, everyone…

663
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,311
You can do it, Ki-baek.

664
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:17,396
-Sorry?
-I have high hopes for you.

665
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,856
But…

666
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,070
Oh, Ms. On.

667
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,405
Hello.

668
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:30,034
Hello. She's the head writer
of the variety show I told you about.

669
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,536
Have a good talk, you two.

670
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,506
You remember me, right?

671
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,758
We escaped from that elevator together.

672
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,093
ON WOO-JU

673
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,262
Let me introduce myself.

674
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,473
I'm On Woo-ju,
head writer of Men on the Run.

675
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,850
I'm Song Ki-baek.

676
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,560
Have you ever watched Men on the Run?

677
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,020
Yes. Of course I have.

678
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:03,401
The "men" on the show get together

679
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,571
and travel all over the country…

680
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,574
-Running around together.
-They race.

681
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,534
"My bro's leg is"?

682
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,244
"Worth a million dollars."

683
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,663
No, you got it wrong.

684
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:20,543
The regular cast members
and the guests split up into teams

685
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,586
and play indoor ball games.

686
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,880
Yes, that's right. I know the show.

687
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,050
I must've confused it
with a different show. Sorry.

688
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:31,095
If you're sorry, join us
and learn more about the show.

689
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,013
I really want you on the show.

690
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,890
People trust you,
yet you'd be a new face.

691
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,183
You're perfect.

692
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,727
Thank you for the offer, but…

693
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,023
It's not that I don't trust you.
We're headed in different directions.

694
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:48,320
I believe I'm better suited for programs
that have depth than lighthearted shows.

695
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,074
Those who make variety shows cry
a hundred times before a show premieres.

696
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,535
It hurts my feelings
to hear variety shows lack depth.

697
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:03,878
Also, I was in an accident years ago,
and my ankle never fully healed.

698
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,797
I haven't been able to play
strenuous sports for a long time.

699
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:11,343
I see. You have a bad ankle.

700
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,553
Well, it's too bad.

701
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:16,390
You scored the most goals in last year's
staff basketball tournament.

702
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,933
You set a record.

703
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,978
JBC STAFF BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT
TOP SCORER, SONG KI-BAEK

704
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,648
The tournament was organized
by the company,

705
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,401
so I wanted to do well.

706
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:31,822
I guess I'm getting old.
My legs are getting weak.

707
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,452
Don't tell me you hate variety shows.

708
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,913
Or is it because
you want to protect your image.

709
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,582
No, that's not the case at all.

710
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,251
Oh, I have a shoot.

711
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,130
I wish you and your show all the best.

712
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,091
There's a cockroach.

713
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,093
-Where?
-Oh, no. Right there.

714
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,428
It's moving toward…

715
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,100
Careful not to hurt your ankle again.

716
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,355
Right. Thanks.

717
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,366
How dare he lie to my face?

718
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,125
I FAILED TO PREVENT MY
CO-WORKER'S EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIR…

719
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:26,877
Damn it.

720
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,423
I mean, I am the victim.

721
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,428
Oh, there you are.

722
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,305
Oh, yes. Hello.

723
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,431
What is this?

724
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,936
Man, just get it done quickly.

725
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,648
Hey, can you take care of the dubbing
for World's Table?

726
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,942
Mr. Kim said you weren't busy.

727
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,236
By when?

728
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,655
Well, take your time
to finish this up first.

729
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:57,783
Come to the recording studio
on the tenth floor in half an hour.

730
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:58,909
What? Half an hour?

731
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:03,330
I think Mr. Kim and Mr. Heo are going out
for drinks even though it's still early.

732
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,999
They invited me all of a sudden.

733
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,251
Hey, I'll put in a good word for you.

734
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,462
I should vouch for you
so you can get your show back.

735
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,299
Thank you.

736
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,508
I'll count on you, then.

737
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,597
-Is Ki-baek in there?
-Yes.

738
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,853
Heard you're writing a report.

739
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,646
It must be stressful.

740
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,983
You like green juice.

741
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,279
The day after tomorrow,
do you have any plans for the evening?

742
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,280
No, I'm free.

743
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,073
For the evening?

744
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,491
Can you cover my night shift?

745
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,910
I was asked to host
a pre-production press conference

746
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,912
and can't turn it down.

747
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,206
Mr. Kim said you weren't busy these days.

748
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,546
Sure, but aren't those press conferences
normally held in the early afternoon?

749
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,423
The director invited me
to their team dinner.

750
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,383
Cover my shift, please.

751
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,350
Right, I only have 30 minutes.

752
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,065
Why didn't you erase it?
I can see it clearly.

753
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,941
Well, Sol likes this.

754
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,069
What are you going to do
about the variety show?

755
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,613
Did you say you had a bad ankle?
Do they not care?

756
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:22,034
Thought they'd give up if I made excuses,
but they even called Mr. Kim.

757
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:23,869
They even know I went hiking last week.

758
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,788
Then try and persuade Mr. Kim.

759
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,499
No, just go ahead and rebel.

760
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,626
Have it out with him.
Tell him you want a news show.

761
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:33,045
Hey, that's crazy talk.

762
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:35,172
If you don't think you can persuade him,

763
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,050
then just accept it.

764
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,760
Everyone is supportive of the idea.

765
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,970
Gaining variety show experience
wouldn't be bad.

766
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,723
Being supportive?
They're trying to push me out.

767
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:48,477
You took on Pyororong Witch School
thinking it'd be a one-off appearance,

768
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,813
but it's been five years.

769
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,856
I'm doing this because Sol likes it.

770
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,443
You know how hard I worked to become

771
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,196
the first male announcer
to get the main anchor title.

772
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,407
My efforts are about to go down the drain.

773
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,327
Then keep acting up and tell them
you'd rather die than do it.

774
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,413
What will happen to my image, then?

775
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,664
For God's sake.

776
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,375
You figure it out.

777
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,726
MR. KIM: I TOLD THEM
YOU DECIDED TO DO MEN ON THE RUN

778
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,280
IT'S ON WOO-JU, THE WRITER

779
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:43,365
PLEASE SAVE MY NUMBER

780
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,471
NATIONAL DODGEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP
A STEP TO VICTORY

781
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,363
MEN ON THE RUN

782
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,073
LET'S PLAY TOGETHER
AND HAVE FUN!

783
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:26,825
PN!

784
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,286
PN, look here and strike a pose.

785
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,623
Oh, hey. Careful.

786
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,833
-You have something on your face.
-I do? What?

787
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,335
Handsomeness!

788
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:38,462
Thank you. You have something here.

789
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,048
Would you take a picture with me?

790
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,257
No photos, please.

791
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,092
It's all right.

792
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,719
All right, I love you all.

793
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,679
Don't wait for me out in the cold.

794
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,348
No, we will wait for you!

795
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,808
-We love you, PN!
-We love you, PN!

796
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:53,393
Ditto!

797
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,355
I love you!

798
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,607
LET'S PLAY TOGETHER!

799
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,691
SOLOMON'S SEAL TEA

800
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,817
LET'S PLAY TOGETHER!

801
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,319
MEN ON THE RUN, LET'S HAVE FUN!

802
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,655
Oh, hello.

803
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,323
Yes, hello.

804
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,492
-Hello.
-Hello.

805
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,244
-Hello.
-Hello!

806
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,787
Wait.

807
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,790
Oh, we're wearing the same shoes.

808
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,794
Great minds think alike.

809
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,462
-We'll catch up in a bit.
-See you.

810
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,672
A MEN'S BALL GAME
AND THEIR SHOWDOWN!

811
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:22,756
MEN ON THE RUN

812
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,815
You said it was a limited edition.

813
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:41,650
You said there were
only three pairs nationwide.

814
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,277
Yeah, I know.

815
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,238
Who knew we'd see two of them here?

816
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,240
Do you want to wear something else?

817
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,119
Why should I do that?

818
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,663
Go tell that idiot
to wear different shoes.

819
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,334
I'm barefoot.

820
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,170
I'll have a talk
with his stylist, all right?

821
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,922
Don't blame it on me. Be diplomatic.

822
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,883
He promised to sing on my new single,

823
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,385
so don't make me look like a jerk.

824
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,513
-All right.
-Oh, PN. Here's your milk.

825
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,605
-What the hell?
-What's wrong?

826
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,107
I wanted soy milk!

827
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,025
Soy milk?

828
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,527
I get diarrhea when I drink milk
on an empty stomach.

829
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,112
I drink lactose-free.

830
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:29,448
Oh, I thought I heard you say
you wanted milk.

831
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:30,824
I never said that, you little--

832
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:31,908
Hello, PN!

833
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,037
-You're here.
-Hello.

834
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,705
Did you practice playing dodgeball?

835
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,874
Oh, I took the ball.

836
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,710
I took it with me when I went
to record the music show.

837
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,170
Oh, my.

838
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,881
Anyway, are you the only cast member
in this room?

839
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,759
Where did he go?

840
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,565
What are you doing there?

841
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,654
Oh, I had a nap on the couch in the back.

842
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,074
I conked out.

843
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,494
You should meet everyone.

844
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,745
Come out and say hi.

845
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:18,455
Say hi.

846
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,792
I bet you've never worked with
a K-pop idol on a show before. Right?

847
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,253
Hello. I'm PN.

848
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,631
I can call you "bro," right?

849
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,424
Oh. Yes, PN.

850
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,764
Please talk casually
once the shoot begins.

851
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,396
All right, Men on the Run.
And we're rolling!

852
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,108
Hello, viewers of Men on the Run.
It's nice to meet you.

853
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,609
Today's game is a big match.

854
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,403
-Yes.
-I'm really excited for it.

855
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:53,240
Men on the Run versus
Donkeys the Dodgeball Kings.

856
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,200
-It begins now.
-Yes, so it begins.

857
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,285
Ki-baek and PN are getting ready
for the jump ball.

858
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,203
Yes.

859
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:00,831
It's in their court now.

860
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,333
Song Ki-baek got the ball.
Then it went to Kim Chan-u.

861
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,668
Pass it over.

862
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,754
It's passed back to Song Ki-baek,
and Song Ki-baek throws it!

863
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,755
PN dodged it!

864
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,841
Oh, Chan-yeong got hit. Chan-yeong is out.

865
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:13,093
-Out!
-Nice one!

866
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:15,011
-They weren't ready at all.
-That's right.

867
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,514
-That's the first punch tactic.
-Land it to win.

868
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,391
Ki-baek seems to be
in good spirits today.

869
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,350
Yes.

870
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,273
I'M THE TEAM'S ACE!

871
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,233
PN caught the ball. And shoot!

872
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,944
-Ki-baek dodged. Dong-hyeok is out.
-Out!

873
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:33,864
-Yes!
-Team Men on the Run has scored a point.

874
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,782
It's not looking good for Team Donkeys.

875
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,576
Oh? What?

876
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,035
He looked at the camera.

877
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,538
That finger heart.
That's why he's the team's ace.

878
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,831
Let's go!

879
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,416
KEEP THE MOMENTUM

880
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,251
LET'S GO

881
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,718
Song Ki-baek has the ball.

882
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,095
Hold on.
What's with that look on his face?

883
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,307
Hang on. He has crazy eyes right now.
Hold on.

884
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,229
The ball left Crazy Eyes' hands.

885
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,398
-Shoot!
-Shoot!

886
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,027
Save!

887
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,196
Wow, I survived.

888
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,406
Kim Ung-min throws.
Is he after Song Ki-baek?

889
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,409
Not a chance. Song Ki-baek looks around
and selects his target.

890
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,246
Hold on. Song Ki-baek jumped.
He's floating in the air!

891
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,417
Kang Ho-jun, Kang Seung-beom. Oh, PN!
That's the second headshot.

892
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,753
Oh!

893
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,296
-Save!
-It's a save.

894
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,297
Damn it.

895
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,674
PN looks very upset right now.

896
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,134
Is he all right?

897
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,598
Relax. Easy.

898
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,849
Right. Sure thing.

899
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,060
"Hey, relax." He lectured him.

900
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,145
He only did that to throw him off.

901
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,648
Oh! Song Ki-baek got the ball again.

902
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,445
That's…

903
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,907
-That is the deadly fire shot!
-Wait.

904
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,243
PN is knocked out!

905
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,413
Line crossed. Switch turns!

906
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,502
-Hey, don't worry about it.
-Too bad. All right.

907
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,461
Let's go get them.

908
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,462
-All right.
-Okay.

909
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,841
I told you to bring a variety show star,
not the Dodgeball King.

910
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,802
He's done three headshots
just today alone.

911
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,262
What's with him?

912
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,430
No, I'm good. I don't need it.

913
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,308
The cameras are rolling.
Why won't he drink the tea?

914
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,018
Did you give him the sponsored products?

915
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,479
-Well, I did.
-Okay.

916
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,773
He thanked me and took extra products.

917
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,485
Why? So he could have them at home?

918
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,780
-What's his deal? Min-gu.
-Yes.

919
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,031
Can we take a break?

920
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,117
We'll take a short break.

921
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,869
I'll talk to him. Tidy up here.

922
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,163
-We're doing pretty well.
-Did that hurt earlier?

923
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,206
Ki-baek.

924
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,249
Can we have a chat?

925
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,750
-Sorry?
-Just a chat.

926
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,752
Why? Oh, because I did so well.

927
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:53,712
I'll be right back.

928
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,263
Hello.

929
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,901
HIGH VOLTAGE
KEEP OUT

930
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,320
HIGH VOLTAGE
DO NOT TOUCH WITH BARE HANDS

931
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,203
Ki-baek. Are you the Dodgeball King?

932
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,875
Do you know the main theme of the show?

933
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:35,879
A men's ball game, a showdown.
"Let's play together and have fun."

934
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,047
Yes, exactly.

935
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,051
Ball game, a showdown.
I think I'm doing a good job.

936
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,762
No. What you said after that is
the most important part.

937
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,806
"Let's play together and have fun."

938
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,350
You're doing it all by yourself.

939
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:52,062
Nothing's more important than chemistry
between cast members on a variety show.

940
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,564
Oh, team play.

941
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,983
I think I'm doing well on that front too.

942
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,778
Forget it. Why do you keep targeting PN?

943
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:00,695
His head, at that.

944
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,323
We usually show PN's close-up
before the commercial break.

945
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,533
At this rate, it'll begin
right after the headshot.

946
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,036
That's because he's usually in the center.

947
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,372
That's right. Why do you think that is?

948
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,499
From the uniforms
to the lunch you guys had,

949
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,460
PN's fans and the advertisers
prepared everything.

950
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:16,878
Oh…

951
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:20,465
I guess I didn't know
how things worked on the show.

952
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,220
Oh, please. You know enough about showbiz.

953
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:28,098
If you keep doing this,
people will call you an amateur.

954
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,854
Even so, I am not an amateur.

955
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,209
You excel at everything.

956
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,461
You call this a news anchor?

957
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:00,296
Can you cover my shift? Mr. Kim said…

958
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,234
What is this? What's going on?

959
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:22,902
What's going on?

960
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:23,820
Is the power out?

961
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,989
What? Why would the power go out?

962
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,537
Mr. Song Ki-baek.

963
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,083
Please wake up.

964
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:39,794
Mr. Song!

965
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,755
Yes?

966
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,134
Ki-baek, are you all right?

967
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,472
My God. Are you okay?

968
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,556
Yes, I'm all right.

969
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,807
Are you really okay?

970
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,601
There were electric sparks everywhere.

971
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,686
Who knew I'd see someone get
an electric shock?

972
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:59,147
Are you really all right? You're okay?

973
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,690
No, I'm not okay!

974
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,450
What are you doing here?

975
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,203
The power's out in the whole building.
Come out. Hurry!

976
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,084
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?
I think you just had an electric shock.

977
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,752
No, I feel fine physically,

978
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,338
but I'm getting a headache
because you're so loud.

979
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,508
I mean… Ma'am?

980
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,638
You're not getting out?

981
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,765
Ma'am? You're not getting out?

982
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,160
Why did the power suddenly go out?

983
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,955
Well, some stuff happened.

984
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:59,040
-Did you call Facility Management?
-Yes.

985
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,126
-I called them.
-It's so damn hot today.

986
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,670
Do you want something to drink?

987
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,921
Took you long enough.

988
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,507
Are you messing with me?

989
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,591
Don't you have something cold?

990
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,218
And what are you waiting for?

991
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,970
I feel so hot! Go get the umbrella.

992
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,805
I'll get a sunburn on my face!

993
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,098
Okay.

994
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,850
Jesus Christ.

995
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,477
PN is so cranky right now.

996
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:21,855
What if he loses it
and throws a crazy tantrum?

997
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:23,982
And here I thought
he was behaving himself.

998
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,068
Oh, Ki-baek.

999
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:27,986
Over here.

1000
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,031
I knew you'd cause trouble.

1001
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,409
What the heck did you do
to make the power go out?

1002
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,619
It's always a nobody who causes trouble.

1003
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:37,829
Loser.

1004
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,789
Loser.

1005
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,669
What? Why is that loser standing there?

1006
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,178
Are you trying to get my attention?

1007
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:54,971
Then you really are--

1008
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,181
No, I'm not.

1009
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,935
Hey. You can't stand me, right?

1010
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,187
Yes!

1011
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,106
No.

1012
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,524
I mean, no.

1013
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,276
Oh, this guy is funny.

1014
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,530
Oh, I see. You want to be my friend
because you want the spotlight.

1015
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,532
I could help you if you'd like.

1016
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,783
Then how about…

1017
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,413
you do as I say? All right?

1018
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,333
That's how it works here.

1019
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,294
There are many eyes watching,
so don't fight here.

1020
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:28,129
-I-na, take Ki-baek.
-Just avoid him.

1021
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,340
Come here, PN. Let's talk.

1022
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,257
Talk about what?

1023
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,051
Let's just go.

1024
00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,511
No, I don't want to.

1025
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,514
I'll chew that jerk to pieces today…

1026
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,227
Please calm down.

1027
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,561
He keeps provoking me.

1028
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,105
-Calm down--
-Damn you! What are you doing?

1029
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,358
I did nothing wrong, okay?

1030
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:49,734
Min-gu!

1031
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,736
No, it's not that.

1032
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,950
I'm sorry, PN. My apologies.

1033
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:00,370
Loser. He's apologizing again.

1034
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,248
Park Jin-bok!

1035
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:10,964
Park Jin-bok?

1036
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,091
He hates it when someone
says his real name.

1037
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,551
We're screwed.

1038
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,392
Why did you apologize?

1039
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,727
Have you lost your mind?

1040
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,439
I thought you were a clown,
but are you just plain crazy?

1041
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:30,692
Hey! Forget about the shoot.

1042
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,405
Get this psycho out of my sight!

1043
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,491
Get your act together!

1044
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,868
Everyone you see right now
is here to work.

1045
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:45,081
No one came here to be harassed
by a crazy bastard like you!

1046
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:48,209
Do you think everyone's a joke
because they let you have your way?

1047
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,336
-Let go, okay?
-Park Jin-bok!

1048
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,171
What should we do?

1049
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,090
Jin-bok can't fight. Just leave them be.

1050
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,133
You!

1051
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,011
You're successful because of your fans.

1052
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:02,473
If you remain such an ingrate,
someone will screw you over.

1053
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,226
You deserve to get screwed over, big-time!

1054
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:09,397
Just one slap in the face from me,

1055
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,399
and you'll turn over a new leaf.

1056
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,651
You rude bastard!

1057
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:14,986
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

1058
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:20,742
-What?
-Oh, no. Woo-ju!

1059
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,458
-What is this?
-Have you lost your mind?

1060
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,794
What… What's happening?

1061
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,171
What?

1062
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,089
No, no way. Trust me.

1063
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:37,759
This can't be.

1064
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:38,968
No, no. No way!

1065
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,678
This has got to be a lie.

1066
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,390
This is all a lie!

1067
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,544
FRANKLY SPEAKING

1068
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,297
You've changed. You're acting strange.

1069
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:18,925
So I can't say what I don't mean.

1070
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,009
Does this even make sense?

1071
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,055
I respect you? No, I don't.

1072
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:26,349
This is so damn stressful.

1073
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,226
-Get out, moron!
-Apologize!

1074
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,690
Song Ki-baek. I'm worried.

1075
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:37,694
Are you all right?

1076
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,653
It's dangerous!

1077
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,405
-Get out of my sight!
-Stop!

1078
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,865
I'm sorry!

1079
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,705
