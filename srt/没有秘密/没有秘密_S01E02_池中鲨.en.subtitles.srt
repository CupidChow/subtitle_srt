FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,472
Park Jin-bok!

3
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,516
Have you lost your mind?

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,976
Hey! Forget about the shoot.

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,312
Get this psycho out of my sight!

6
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,313
Get your act together!

7
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,315
Everyone you see right now
is here to work.

8
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,567
No one came here to be harassed!

9
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,651
You rude bastard!

10
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,861
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

11
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,286
-What is this?
-What?

12
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,539
What… What's happening?

13
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,251
-This can't be happening. It can't be.
-Have you lost your mind?

14
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,753
No, no way.

15
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,006
Unbelievable. He just went
and bit his head off.

16
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,466
What is he, a shark?

17
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,718
This is all a lie!

18
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,888
EPISODE 2: SHARK IN A POOL

19
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,357
Currently, the KOSPI stands
at 2,697.58 points,

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,486
marking a decrease of 9.44 points
from the previous trading session.

21
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,197
Meanwhile, the KOSDAQ
is showing a slight uptick,

22
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,534
rising by 0.66 points
to reach 923.62 points.

23
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,786
No, I'm not.

24
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,788
-Hey. You can't stand me, right?
-Yes!

25
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,040
I'll chew that jerk to pieces today…

26
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,333
Get your act together!

27
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,714
A non-soft cookie from the land
of non-soft cookies wanted to become

28
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,926
a soft cookie and traveled to the land
of soft cookies.

29
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,762
The gatekeeper of the soft cookie land
said, "Hey, kid, today…"

30
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,472
Just one slap in the face from me,

31
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,849
and you'll turn over a new leaf.

32
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,476
You rude bastard!

33
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,938
Why on earth did he do that?

34
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,273
It is truly hard to believe.

35
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,651
Let's hear from Mr. Song Ki-baek
who was at the scene.

36
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:32,902
Just why…

37
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,239
Why in God's name

38
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:43,913
did you speak your thoughts out loud?

39
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,585
A CLEAN BODY
LEADS TO A HEALTHY MIND

40
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,436
Time to get to work
so Mr. Kim can tear me a new one.

41
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,439
What did I just say?

42
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,816
Man, what's wrong with me?

43
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,904
That Song Ki-baek. Song Ki-baek!

44
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,072
Let's recap. So what happened was--

45
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:23,870
Song Ki-baek tore into PN
with both verbal and non-verbal violence.

46
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,749
PN now claims to be suffering
from extremely severe PTSD as a result

47
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,877
and has provided a doctor's note stating
he can no longer be in our show.

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,005
What are the chances
of PN coming back after recovery?

49
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,049
He wants to gracefully leave the show.

50
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,091
Oh, yeah?

51
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,094
Then we should also
gracefully leave the show.

52
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,346
I'll go talk to PN.

53
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,349
We can't afford to be graceful like him.

54
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,601
We have to be pathetic
and beg him to stay.

55
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,520
-I'll come with you.
-No thanks.

56
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,564
You stay here
and take care of what you can.

57
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,234
Maybe I should go like this.

58
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,653
I've been crawling
and begging to so many people.

59
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,449
Don't try too hard.

60
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,743
How can I not?

61
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,536
The crew might lose their jobs.

62
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,623
I'll crawl if that's what it takes.

63
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,668
Hey, Song Ki-baek! Song…

64
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,670
Where is he? Where's that bastard?

65
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,171
Has he run away? Where's…

66
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,297
Where is Song Ki-baek?

67
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,841
Yoon Ji-hu! Where is that bastard?

68
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,344
I'm going to kill him and go to hell.
Bring him to me.

69
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,638
I've got a shoot
for Pyororong Witch School.

70
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:24,847
Huh? You have what?

71
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,974
A shoot, sir.

72
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,518
Hey, you little… Take that thing off.

73
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,061
Hey! Where's Song Ki-baek…

74
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,647
Tell me where he… Hey!

75
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,773
Mr. Kim is throwing a fit.

76
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,984
Don't come here. Hide somewhere for a bit.

77
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,987
"Don't come here"? "Hide somewhere"?

78
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,488
Oh, man. What am I going to do?

79
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,534
Oh, he's calling me. What do I do?

80
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,705
It's been a while. Taking a smoke break?

81
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:53,293
Hey, Ki-baek doesn't smoke.
He's doing the anti-smoking campaign.

82
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,294
Oh, wow.

83
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,337
It's only been a week or so
since I quit.

84
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,760
You smell like an ashtray.
Please take care of that.

85
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,888
No, I didn't mean that. I…

86
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,225
NO MORE STINKY BREATH!

87
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:19,736
Wow. He's thoughtfully rude.

88
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,948
Hey, Ki-baek!

89
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,659
Mr. Kim is looking for you
with lasers shooting out of his eyes.

90
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,994
What's going on?

91
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,038
Hold on, wait. Are you free?

92
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,790
-Can you fill in for me for a dubbing job?
-Don't do that.

93
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,042
Oh, no, sir.

94
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,335
What?

95
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,670
Don't worry, man.

96
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,839
-I'll talk to them and make sure--
-No!

97
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,842
All you do is talk trash about people.

98
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,136
Do you think I don't know how
you pass off tiresome tasks

99
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:49,682
to your juniors and then gripe
about them doing a crappy job.

100
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,686
Ki-baek, I have a favor to ask.

101
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,564
No favors.

102
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,399
No! No more favors!

103
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,069
And no more green juice!

104
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,304
Enjoying a cup of tea with my heart.

105
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,390
Happiness comes from these little moments.

106
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,560
I'm hungry.

107
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,942
Did you know? It's already corn season.

108
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,194
-Huh?
-The hairdresser downstairs gave me some.

109
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:44,904
Aren't they huge?

110
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,739
Come on, I don't want corn.

111
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,199
Let's order in, Mom.

112
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,329
-How about Yupdduk?
-Oh! Order a super spicy one!

113
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,666
You have no problem ordering delivery
when you don't even make a penny.

114
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,460
The corn is nice and chewy.

115
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,088
I'm in pain, so Yupdduk?

116
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,048
-Come on, Yupdduk.
-Knock it off.

117
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,800
I'm going to the gym.

118
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:08,010
Didn't you say today was your day off?

119
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,846
You teach people how to work out,

120
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,223
and you want to work out
on your day off too?

121
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,141
Oh, stop it.

122
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,393
I've got to work out myself
because it's my day off.

123
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,228
Come on, Mom. Let's have Yupdduk.

124
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,063
I'll make you rice cake soup for dinner.

125
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,106
It isn't the same.

126
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,691
Hey!

127
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,942
See you later.

128
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,111
You're taking all the eggs again?

129
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,697
I peeled them to make jangjorim.

130
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,034
Goodness! Let me get you some cold water.

131
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,035
Oh, forget it.

132
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,081
Didn't you notice it's steaming hot?
Maybe you need glasses.

133
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,291
Oh, please.

134
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,084
You good-for-nothing.

135
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,588
You're staring at your phone
when your mom's tongue is on fire?

136
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,091
No way. Mom, Dad. Look at this.

137
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,929
IDOL SINGER P
ASSAULTED BY ANNOUNCER S

138
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,308
It's not too bad, right?

139
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,101
This works best when you want to hide.

140
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,729
So what happened anyway?

141
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,316
Why'd you do something so wild that it
made the news and made Mr. Kim flip out?

142
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,112
Why do you keep making the news
instead of reporting it?

143
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,822
Oh, whatever. Stop asking questions.

144
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,200
How do you film in this thing?

145
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,326
I can't breathe.

146
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,994
You get used to it.

147
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,331
I even ran around in the hospital
with Sol yesterday wearing this.

148
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,083
-She's back in the hospital?
-Just for a few days for some tests.

149
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,919
Sol is fine.

150
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,504
You should worry about yourself.

151
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,925
Are you planning on going freelance?

152
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,885
Trying to leave
while you're in the limelight?

153
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,053
That's ridiculous!

154
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,430
It's not that.

155
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,515
All right then.

156
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,809
I'd better get to the shoot
for "Pororong."

157
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,103
"Pyo-ro-rong."

158
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,563
What's your problem?

159
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,025
It's "pyororong"
as in Pyororong Witch School,

160
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:49,028
not "pororong"
as in Pororo the Little Penguin.

161
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,696
Can't you say "pyo" instead of "po"?

162
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,490
Fine.

163
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,785
I'm off to shoot Pyororong Witch School.

164
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,038
I'll take this with me.

165
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,342
ANNOUNCER S
CAUSES SCENE DURING SHOOT

166
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,221
This is obviously me.

167
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,432
Oh, she…

168
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,726
WRITER ON WOO-JU

169
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,314
Why won't you answer your phone?

170
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,776
Because I don't want to.

171
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,487
JBC NEWS AT NOON

172
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,864
Mr. Song Ki-baek, please come with me.

173
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,866
All I can do is just beg PN to stay,

174
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,035
but you're the one who caused all this.

175
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,329
If we lose PN,
it'll be the end of our show.

176
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,290
The jerk is the one who should apologize.

177
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,083
Are you really going to be like this?

178
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,211
I understand your logic, Ms. On.

179
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,338
Considering his influence,

180
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,341
I agree that this is an issue
that must be solved.

181
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,384
So you get it.

182
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,261
The hell I do!

183
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,187
Did you not know PN was a horrible person
who treats people like crap?

184
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,480
There's no way you didn't.

185
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:11,402
You just pretended not to and enjoyed
the free stuff and advertisers he brought.

186
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,487
Is it okay to be an ass if you're a star?

187
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,117
What else can we do?

188
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,746
You think we can just be like,
"Well, he got what he deserved."

189
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,832
Look, the entire crew's livelihood
is at stake here.

190
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,667
Don't talk like this is a simple matter.

191
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,544
I'm not. It's hard for me to say this.

192
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,297
But I can't apologize to him.

193
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,843
Mr. Song Ki-baek.
You're really not going to apologize?

194
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,722
It's not that I won't. I really can't.

195
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,349
Right now, I'm in a state…

196
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,353
-What do you mean?
-Back off!

197
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,188
The doors are closing.

198
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,360
What am I going to do?

199
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,861
What do I do about this?

200
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,411
Wow. Was I wrong about you?

201
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,537
Ki-baek, seriously!

202
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,623
Hey, is something going on with you?

203
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,834
I never thought you, of all people,
would do something like this.

204
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,921
Have you always had trouble
controlling your emotions?

205
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,090
KIM SANG-JIN

206
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,007
KIM JERK

207
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,217
Say something!

208
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,555
Don't break the absolute rules

209
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,308
Don't let go of my hand

210
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,060
Unity is my weapon

211
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,187
Walk towards the wilderness

212
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,314
I know that's your home ground

213
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,108
Stand up to the threat

214
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,442
Push past it, push past it!

215
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,945
I'm listening, sir.

216
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,739
Get it together, man.

217
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,783
Just go for now.

218
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,452
Hey, Song Ki-baek.

219
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,581
That's him, guys.

220
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,334
Hey, you're the one who attacked
my sweet PN, right?

221
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,585
Let's kick his ass!

222
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,879
-You, apologize to him!
-Come on, guys!

223
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,965
-Hey!
-Hey!

224
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,052
What?

225
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,805
-There he is!
-Hey!

226
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,808
That's Ki-baek. Hi, Ki-baek.

227
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,309
-We meet again.
-Come out here.

228
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,520
-Get out of the car!
-Watch out, guys.

229
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,065
God.

230
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,820
Man, seriously.

231
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,238
HANGUK MILK

232
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,285
You've got to have
strawberry milk with soju.

233
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:29,123
Jesus. I have better things to do
than fetch you milk, you know.

234
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,250
Those jerks.

235
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,294
They wouldn't even let you see him?

236
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:38,132
I waited two hours in front of PN's agency
and three hours in front of his house.

237
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,803
You should've known
when to give up and leave.

238
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,388
Man, you're an idiot.

239
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,931
Think our show will be canceled?

240
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,266
It's already been canceled.

241
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,019
They made the final decision just now.

242
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,437
We need to leave the office.

243
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,857
To be honest, I've always felt guilty.

244
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,194
Every time we heard PN yelling
at the staff and saw them crying,

245
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,030
we pretended like we didn't see it.

246
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,033
Well, what could we have done?

247
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,785
Fly at his throat like Song Ki-baek did?

248
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,497
We might not have been able
to fly at his throat,

249
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,208
but if this is how
things were going to turn out,

250
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:18,047
perhaps I shouldn't have lashed out
at Song Ki-baek to make him apologize.

251
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,314
PHONE
CONTACTS

252
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,238
MOM

253
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,548
We're human, just like them.

254
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,969
If they play dirty, we have the right
to defend ourselves.

255
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,303
But still…

256
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,807
BEAUTY MANAGER NA YU-JEONG

257
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,142
Don't worry. I'll take care of the rest.

258
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,359
My goodness.

259
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:24,113
Sweetheart. What on earth is going on?

260
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,281
Did you get my text?

261
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,116
You're not hurt anywhere, are you?

262
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,745
You won't even say hello to your brother?

263
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,872
Hey, man.

264
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,630
What's this?

265
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,385
LET ME STAY HERE TONIGHT

266
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,518
It may be uncomfortable,
but you'll have to make do.

267
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,103
I'll clear out the room in the morning.

268
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,899
What's up with Ki-baek?

269
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,443
What do you think?
You saw the news, didn't you?

270
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,113
"Mr. S who assaulted an idol." That's him.

271
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,700
People may not know,
but I recognized him right away.

272
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:12,161
Because they did a crappy job
blurring out his face.

273
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,704
My poor Ki-baek.

274
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,831
He just went in there
without saying a word.

275
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,626
He must be feeling terrible.

276
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,044
Oh, boy.

277
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,715
But he's supposed to give me
my allowance today.

278
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,426
Can I ask for just another 100,000 won?

279
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,552
Are you kidding?

280
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,679
Don't you dare say a word.

281
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,017
I have to ask him for money
for our living expenses today.

282
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,986
Ki-baek, wake up.

283
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,739
Hey. Come out here for a second.

284
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,741
What…

285
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,161
What are you doing?

286
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,083
I know you're going through
something at work,

287
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,462
but why would you just drop in like this?
You're making everyone tiptoe around you.

288
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,255
What are you doing? Stop it.

289
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,966
Huh? For God's sake,

290
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,468
take off the mask!

291
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,638
What the heck?

292
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,265
Have you gone crazy?

293
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,435
Ki-baek. What's going on with you?

294
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,272
Ouch! That must hurt.

295
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,649
Ki-baek.

296
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,818
I don't know what happened,

297
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,611
but let's sit down and talk.

298
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,904
Oh, for God's sake!

299
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,490
Just leave me alone, will you?

300
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,034
I don't need your consolation. Okay?

301
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,536
Don't treat me any differently.

302
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,538
You wouldn't even care if I died.

303
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,124
All you care about
is the money I give you.

304
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,210
Ki-baek! If that's how you're going to be,
go back in there.

305
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,632
Just leave me the hell alone!

306
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,217
Damn it.

307
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,928
You've never bothered to visit us before.

308
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,389
You're only here
because you've got nowhere to go.

309
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,307
And you don't pay
for everything around here.

310
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,892
Don't be so patronizing about--

311
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,519
What? Patronizing?

312
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,521
What? Am I wrong?

313
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,940
You've always acted like
you're the only adult!

314
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,235
You're a 30-year-old man
who's barely making ends meet,

315
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,029
so don't you preach to me!

316
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,697
What? You little…

317
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,157
Enough!

318
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,456
Stop it. That's enough.

319
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,221
Hey.

320
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:19,598
You actually came.

321
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,725
You told me to.

322
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,727
Still, I didn't think you'd show up,

323
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,188
especially after bolting
like that earlier.

324
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,316
So did you meet with PN?

325
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,111
He wouldn't see me.

326
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,530
I waited five hours.

327
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,285
Listen, Ms. On Woo-ju.

328
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,578
Thank you.

329
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,334
I've wished at least a hundred times
that I could punch PN.

330
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,090
I knew all about how he only bullied
the young and powerless staff members.

331
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,094
I'm the head writer,

332
00:18:57,177 --> 00:19:03,350
but all I did was tell them to let it go
and I'd talk to him later.

333
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:11,275
Anyway, thanks for beating him up
when I couldn't.

334
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,901
"Beat him up"? I didn't…

335
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:18,073
You totally beat him up with your words,
and it felt great to see that.

336
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,075
Are you always like that?

337
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,494
I mean, is that okay? You're an anchor.

338
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,540
No, I'm not always like that.

339
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,877
It's been driving me totally crazy
since yesterday.

340
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,046
Yesterday?

341
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,300
Hey, hang on.

342
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,262
Wash it down with this.

343
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,306
Oh, I'm good.

344
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:43,265
Just try it.

345
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,726
Bitter and sweet,
they're a perfect pair. Here.

346
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,150
I'm not drunk, you know.

347
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,402
I hope not.

348
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,613
I'm telling you. I'm not drunk.

349
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,552
You're going to sleep out here?

350
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,512
Come on, you'll get in a lot of trouble.

351
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,433
Listen. Give me your address.
I'll call you a cab.

352
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,771
Okay? Your address.

353
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,192
Oh, boy.

354
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,992
She'll be all right.

355
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,496
She can't expect me
to stay with her all night.

356
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,627
I'll be going then.

357
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,755
Excuse me.

358
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,677
Shouldn't we film a final episode?

359
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,847
The show's been on for two years.
We should say goodbye to the viewers.

360
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:49,474
People don't do that anymore.

361
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,852
Our ratings have been down
for a while now.

362
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,229
Let's just accept
that this is the end of it.

363
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,939
Let's start on the next one.

364
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,818
-Your greenroom is this way.
-Okay.

365
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,279
See? My greenroom is upstairs. Come here.

366
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,197
What is it?

367
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,074
What's up with them?

368
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,119
One of their cast screwed up,
and their show is being canceled.

369
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,329
No way.

370
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,080
-It's true.
-What?

371
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,876
I hear this was their first show.
They probably won't get another chance.

372
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,296
You should be careful too. Okay?

373
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,048
-I'll see you upstairs.
-Yeah, yeah.

374
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,726
I respect you…

375
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:34,978
No, I don't.

376
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,898
Let's try one syllable at a time.

377
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,525
This is

378
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,737
so damn stressful.

379
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:49,701
Man. I'm sorry.

380
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,041
Everything was

381
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,293
not my fault.

382
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,339
That's right. It wasn't all my fault.

383
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,260
It seems I can't bring myself
to say what I don't mean,

384
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,387
which is just ridiculous.

385
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,768
MR. KIM

386
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,230
Don't be so upset about it, all right?

387
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:22,859
You were going to leave News at Noon
to audition for the main news show anyway.

388
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,030
Just think of this as a little break.

389
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,325
Here, you want candy?

390
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,163
By the way, I just don't understand
no matter how hard I try.

391
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,414
Why did you do that?

392
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,166
This isn't your first day on the job.

393
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,709
With your experience,

394
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,838
I'm sure you know better than
to cause a scene in public.

395
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:46,341
You're not like the other guys
who get into trouble for their temper.

396
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,052
I wouldn't be so curious
if it was anybody else.

397
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,012
I just can't help wondering.

398
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,182
Damn.

399
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,977
Oh! Hey, the brand awards.

400
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,353
You should host it.

401
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:01,064
Park Jin-u was supposed to do it,
but he was in a car accident.

402
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,650
They wanted me
to get back to them by today,

403
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,776
and you're not busy.

404
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,028
You'll be taking a long break.

405
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,823
Since you're taking a break,
do this for me.

406
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,491
Okay! Good.

407
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,036
Take a nice, long break, okay?
Just take a break and think.

408
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,624
Use this break to reflect on yourself
and really use your brain, you know.

409
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,626
Why do you keep calling it a break?

410
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,380
I'll still have to come to work
where you breathe down my neck.

411
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,799
It's a punishment.
You'll dump all the menial jobs on me.

412
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,676
Excuse me?

413
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,887
Also, did you step in poop
on your way here?

414
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,763
-Poop?
-Don't you know your feet stink?

415
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,564
Mr. Kim, hello. Oh.

416
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,864
Lastly, I know this is a bad time,

417
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,742
but I really want to audition
for the main news show.

418
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,702
The main news show? Are you kidding?

419
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,662
Your name was taken off
the list ages ago.

420
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:01,374
Are you dense or just thoughtless?

421
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,626
Get out, you moron!

422
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,961
I'll make you pay for this.

423
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,421
I swear.

424
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,215
Make me pay?

425
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:10,717
Ki-Baek.

426
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,637
What are you doing?

427
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,144
Hey, let him talk. Keep going.

428
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,688
Say what? You swear you'll what?

429
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,857
I swear…

430
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,445
I'm sorry. Oh?

431
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,072
I'm sorry. Oh.

432
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,156
Oh.

433
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,451
-I'm sorry.
-Oh.

434
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,916
Bye.

435
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,670
He's been acting like a lunatic
since he went on your show.

436
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,546
What happened to him over there?

437
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,591
Well, I'm not really sure,

438
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,010
but he certainly seems a little weird…

439
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,095
Hey.

440
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,015
Mr. Song Ki-baek.

441
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:06,564
I got home very safely last night,
thanks to you.

442
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,650
Right, I'm glad.

443
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,985
Hey, listen.

444
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,779
Did you see a doctor
after the electric shock?

445
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,489
No.

446
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,741
You said you've been feeling weird.

447
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,619
Shouldn't you go see
a psychiatrist or a neurologist?

448
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:24,416
People know who I am,
and I'm a little self-conscious.

449
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,668
What kind of nonsense is that?

450
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,129
This may be a serious problem.

451
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,380
Let's go to the hospital.

452
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,590
-No, I'm not going.
-For God's sake.

453
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,720
Come on. I'll buy you tonkatsu.

454
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,815
He's the doctor
I tried to get on our show.

455
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,776
He promised to keep things
as private as possible.

456
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,578
Hello, doctor.

457
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,455
Have a seat.

458
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:07,000
Didn't we say we'd meet
at the outpatient clinic after lunchtime?

459
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,920
I'm sorry. I'm trying not to be seen
by many people.

460
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,840
Please go on and eat. There's no rush.

461
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,008
Oh, right. Yeah.

462
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:20,930
Can someone's personality change
after being electrocuted?

463
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,642
Like I said on the phone,
I'll have to run some tests to be sure.

464
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,519
Don't worry about it until we know more.

465
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,481
I got myself in trouble
before I could even start to worry.

466
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,777
Wait a minute. You look familiar.
Is he… He is, right?

467
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,281
See? I told you he'd still recognize me.

468
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,532
-Yes, I'm--
-A singer.

469
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,034
-Oh.
-Oh.

470
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,287
A news anchor.

471
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,914
Wow, I'm embarrassed for you.

472
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,665
That's why you looked so familiar.

473
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,626
I'm a fan.

474
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,266
One plus one is…

475
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,644
Five. Oh!

476
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,729
I did it.

477
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,731
Oh, I did it.

478
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,441
I did it.

479
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:17,987
This is all because of stress.
Stress is the cause.

480
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,491
I'm okay. I'm okay now.

481
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,371
Good morning, everyone.

482
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:30,375
It's Wednesday, May 3rd,
and you're watching JBC Morning News.

483
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,878
For the holidays in May, the Ministry
of Culture, Sports and Tourism…

484
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,965
MCST ANNOUNCES NEW PLAN TO BOOST
CONSUMPTION FOR FAMILY MONTH

485
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,429
I see a future full of hope ahead of me.

486
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,266
I did it.

487
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm rich. I'm the best anchor there is.

488
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,735
I'm okay.

489
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,905
I'm back to normal.

BRAND AWARDS CEREMONY

496
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,769
Ladies and gentlemen. Good

497
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,021
evening.

498
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,284
-Hello. Oh, hi.
-Hello.

499
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,578
-Jeong-heon, stay healthy.
-Thank you.

500
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:51,080
Please hold my hand! Over here!

501
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,711
Oh, my God. This is insane.

502
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,590
Thanks to you, Jeong-heon,
our sales have gone up.

503
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,426
Those mom fans are so generous.

504
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,303
They even give you deer antler extract?

505
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,055
They are devoted fans.

506
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,015
You should have one.

507
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,975
Would that be okay? It looks so fancy.

508
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,185
Oh, of course.

509
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,645
My, look who it is.

510
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,562
Hello, Mr. Jang.

511
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,606
I'm surprised to see you here.

512
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:20,360
Oh, Mr. Jang.
Are you here to get your hair… Whoa.

513
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,402
What?

514
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,238
What brings you here?

515
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,114
I'm here to cast you.

516
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,034
Jeong-heon, I'd love to have you
on my new show.

517
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:31,037
I told you to talk to Ms. Ma
about these things.

518
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,457
I'm not an idiot. You always have her
turn people down for you.

519
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,168
Who's your head writer?

520
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,419
Oh, our head writer?

521
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,796
She's really good.

522
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,507
-It's Kim--
-No. Do you know Ms. On Woo-ju?

523
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,925
She's great at her job.

524
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,928
Of course I know her.
I hear she really messed up her last show,

525
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,471
and now she's planning a new one.

526
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,473
She's planning a new show?

527
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,392
Yeah, but it's literally just planning.

528
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,477
Who knows if it will get off the ground?

529
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,438
I doubt that it will,
seeing how incompetent she is.

530
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,149
Our head writer, though,
always gets amazing ratings--

531
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,234
Mr. Jang.

532
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,863
-Are you close with Ms. On?
-No.

533
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,906
So you're just rude then.

534
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,908
You talk about people behind their backs.

535
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,702
I don't want to work with someone rude.

536
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,288
-Hyeong-taek, Mr. Jang is leaving.
-Yes?

537
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,082
-Mr. Jang, let me walk you out.
-Wait, but…

538
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,042
Have some deer antler extract.
I'll call you.

539
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,336
-Oh, thanks.
-I hope you enjoy it. Bye!

540
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,630
-Hyeong-taek.
-Yes?

541
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,007
You know a lot of scriptwriters?

542
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,426
Yes.

543
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,386
This is actually better.

544
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,263
We're in a corner room,
so we can focus.

545
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:35,059
And the talent managers don't come here,
so we'll be left alone to focus.

546
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,978
Those are all talent managers.

547
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,230
I-na.

548
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,276
I love how it's next to the smoking area
and there are no bugs.

549
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,236
We're so close to the bathroom too.

550
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,405
I'll make sure we move somewhere far away

551
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,282
from cigarette smoke and bathrooms.

552
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,367
-Let's make our next show a hit, okay?
-Yeah.

553
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,245
I suddenly had an idea yesterday.

554
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,163
All right, check this out.

555
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,998
Lots of celebrities live on Jeju Island.

556
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,209
We could get some to Seoul
and compare their lives in the two places.

557
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,920
Like coming back to the city.

558
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,129
What do you think?

559
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,131
Seoul Check-In.

560
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,090
What?

561
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,052
I think Director Kim Tae-ho
already did that with Lee Hyo-ri.

562
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,263
Hey, mine would feature more people.

563
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,973
He only had Lee Hyo-ri.

564
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,393
Oh, it looked like Kim Jeong-heon
was looking for a new show to host.

565
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,145
He wants to try something new.

566
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,897
Oh, Kim Jeong-heon?

567
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,316
If we could cast him,
the show would be a hit for sure.

568
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,859
Right?

569
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,028
He's not even that funny.

570
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,822
No, he's really hot right now.

571
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,242
I actually know his manager.
Should I ask about his schedule?

572
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,915
I have an awards ceremony today.

573
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,084
Oh. Did you win an award?

574
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,003
I'm going so I win one in the future.
All the celebs will be there.

575
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,506
I'll go hook them all in. Sparta!

576
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,467
Ooh, ooh!
I-na, you said you'd say it together.

577
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,052
Ooh, ooh.

578
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,348
No freaking way.

579
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,849
Oh, my gosh.

580
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,103
Hello? Hi, Mr. Kang.

581
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,231
You know, we were just talking
about Mr. Kim Jeong-heon.

582
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,235
Here she comes. You look fabulous!

583
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,488
All right. Thank you. Thank you, GVAN.

584
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,574
Now, please welcome Kim Jeong-heon.

585
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,202
It's like the David statue
has come to life.

586
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,996
Doesn't he look dashing?

587
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,080
Look over here, please.

588
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,207
Please look to your left too.

589
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,375
-That's cute.
-Over here!

590
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,919
-Okay. Thank you, Jeong-heon.
-Thank you.

591
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,546
All right.

592
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,008
This is a gift from Chairman Park Pil-gu
of Joa Tasty Rice.

593
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,676
Jeong-heon, I'm a big fan.

594
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,885
Oh, thank you.

595
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,929
Thank you for the gift.

596
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,389
Come on.

597
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,598
A rice cooker?

598
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,393
Hang on.

599
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,353
Please take some pictures!

600
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,523
-I love Joa Tasty Rice!
-He looks stunning holding a rice cooker.

601
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,025
Over here, please!

602
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:47,942
Yes!

603
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,861
-Please look over here.
-I love it!

604
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,697
Isn't he the best? All right.

605
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,866
And look, he's very strong too.

606
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,202
Of course. Thank you, Jeong-heon.

607
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,370
Thank you.

608
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,456
You're not here to shoot an ad.
How embarrassing.

609
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,250
Isn't embarrassment
better than losing a commercial?

610
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,085
I lost my old rice cooker commercial,

611
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,880
so I just got myself a new one.
Joa Tasty Rice!

612
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,801
Hey, Hyeong-taek. Did you find out?

613
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,762
A different show?

614
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,306
Okay.

615
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,934
No, it's nothing.
I'll call you later. Bye.

616
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,395
Was that Mr. Kang? What is it?

617
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,189
Well, kind of.

618
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,441
"Kind of"?
You're acting suspiciously again.

619
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,484
Can I go in now?

620
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,736
-Yes, go ahead.
-Thank you.

621
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:35,740
No, I haven't met Hey Meeny Miny Poe yet.

622
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,909
You still haven't met her yet?

623
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,535
-No.
-All right.

624
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,953
That's Lee Jeong-un.

625
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,706
Hello.

626
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,291
Sol, I just saw Lee Jeong-un.

627
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,417
You don't know him?

628
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,170
Anyway, I'll go inside
and look for her, okay?

629
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,922
I'll call you later, honey. Bye.

630
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,759
Hey. This event is hosted by our company,

631
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,719
and the higher-ups are paying attention.

632
00:34:56,803 --> 00:35:00,264
If you do a good job here, I'm sure
Mr. Kim will give you another chance.

633
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,599
Try not to be nervous.

634
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,352
God, I'm so nervous. Aren't you nervous?

635
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,270
Not at all.

636
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,231
Wow, impressive.

637
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,987
On Woo-ju.

638
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:25,790
It's been a long time.

639
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:28,876
You're right.

640
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,087
You look good.

641
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,260
-Are you--
-Ms. On Woo-ju?

642
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,178
Oh.

643
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,555
This is Director Ma Mi-ra.

644
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,141
I'm Ma Mi-ra.

645
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,852
Are you close with Jeong-heon?

646
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:49,939
No.

647
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,819
Please excuse me.

648
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,283
Mr. Song Ki-baek.

649
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,493
What are you doing here?

650
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:07,748
Oh, I am hosting the ceremony.

651
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,250
Oh.

652
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,752
Song Ki-baek?

653
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,007
I heard you became an anchor.

654
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,842
Good to see you. How have you been?

655
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:19,552
Hey.

656
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,805
Ji-hu, I've got to go change.
I'll catch you later.

657
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,890
All right.

658
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,517
Wait, Woo-ju.

659
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,644
Jeong-heon. I'm a fan.

660
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,937
Can we take a picture?

661
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:33,900
-Thank you.
-Sure.

662
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:34,984
Awesome.

663
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,239

668
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,821

ONLINE SECTOR
HOTTEST ICON OF THE YEAR

676
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,727
Ki-baek, your face looks a bit oily,
so let's put some powder on it.

677
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:56,274
You guys are doing this because
I'm nice to you and do what you ask me to.

678
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,609
Today, I'm a bit…

679
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,047
These are the nominees
for the Hottest Icon of the Year.

680
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,050
With the rise of K-content
to new heights this year,

681
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,178
the competition is expected
to be extremely fierce.

682
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,888
Who will win this award?
It's pretty obvious.

683
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,307
What?

684
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:38,816
Who will win this fierce competition
and claim this honorable award?

685
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,985
Only one of the nominees
is here tonight.

686
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,162
For a small awards show like this,
only the winners show up.

687
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,255
The winner is Park Se-mi. Congratulations.

688
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,438
Park Se-mi is a comedian
who's widely known as Seo-jun's mom,

689
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,524
who is a character she plays
on her beloved YouTube channel.

690
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,235
Congratulations on your award again.

691
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,744
I'm sure you didn't give me this award
just because I'm the only one present.

692
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,915
Ki-baek, what are you doing?

693
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,666
You're ad-libbing too much.

694
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,377
Ad-libbing? Are you kidding?

695
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,878
What did you just say?

696
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,004
No, no.

697
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,217
Mr. Song, are you all right?

698
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,553
I don't think I can do this anymore.

699
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,596
What?

700
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,515
Mr. Song. Please go back up onstage.

701
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,642
I'm in no condition
to host the show right now.

702
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,685
Stop talking nonsense and get up there.

703
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,312
-No, but--
-Just go.

704
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,730
-Get up there.
-No, I really--

705
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,190
Ki-baek is going back onstage.

706
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:02,149
Stand by.

707
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,780
This is insulting.

708
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:12,493
-Seriously.
-Oh, my word.

709
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,746
All right. Let's move on
to the next award.

710
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,333
The next category is
Best Sports-Entertainer of the Year.

711
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,252
Boy, this is the 19th award already.

712
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,629
I'll be presenting the award myself.

713
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,714
This is not a major award, so…

714
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,093
Kim Seung-hyeon, congratulations.

715
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,596
BEST SPORTS-ENTERTAINER
OF THE YEAR

716
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,557
Let's give him a big round of applause.

717
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,740
I have a lot of people to thank.

718
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,786
-Heo Su-min of Ungok Entertainment.
-Tell him to keep it short.

719
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,829
Lee Jae-yong--

720
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:02,209
Oh, the staff just asked to make
the speech short and straightforward,

721
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,045
but you're the ones
who decided to present 19 awards.

722
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,257
Feel free to finish.

723
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,054
Director Kim Hong-jun,

724
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:18,809
Manager Choi Ja-yeong,
Director Kim Geun-u, Director Lee Eun-ha,

725
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:23,022
Manager Kim Seon-jun, CEO Jang Ji-yeon
of Hair Boutique Gangnam--

726
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,065
That's going to take forever.

727
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,568
Why does everyone thank
such a long list of people?

728
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,862
If you want to thank someone,
do it whenever you can.

729
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,623
I'll keep working hard. Thank you.

730
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,877
Congratulations!

731
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,962
Congratulations!

732
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:49,715
Unbelievable.

733
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:55,429
Carry on.

734
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,976
There's still an award left.
Best Actor of the Year.

735
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:08,609
Presenting the award is
Chairman Park Pil-gu of Joa Tasty Rice.

736
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,319
Let's welcome him with a big hand.

737
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,780
BEST ACTOR OF THE YEAR

738
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,241
Greetings. Well, may I announce…

739
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,286
Right, okay.
I'll announce the winner then.

740
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,373
The first Korea Brand Awards.

741
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:26,835
Best Actor of the Year goes
to Lee Jeong-un. Congratulations.

742
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,798
Let's give it up for him. Congratulations.

743
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:39,390
Lee Jeong-un came back from
a long hiatus to play Kim Man-ho,

744
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:43,561
the drug king who dominates the world
of darkness, in last year's film Junkers.

745
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:47,815
Ironically, the reason he went on hiatus
was because of his alleged drug use.

746
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,988
Drugs became his downfall
and his redemption.

747
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,198
He's the true drug king of our time.

748
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,659
I'm sorry!

749
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,283
Ki-baek.

750
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,076
Song Ki-baek!

751
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,620
Hey!

752
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:46,582
-What?
-Hey, are you okay?

753
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,501
Oh, Mr. Kim.

754
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,047
Things could've gone
a lot worse, you know.

755
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:57,509
Mr. Kim. I'm sorry.

756
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,136
Come on, it's okay.

757
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,848
You just messed up
a stupid awards show. It's not a big deal.

758
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,936
Don't let something like this
get you down.

759
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,356
Go back to how you were earlier.

760
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,107
Sir?

761
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,778
You had a lot of nerve
running your mouth like that.

762
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,279
I…

763
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,616
-Go ahead and say whatever you want.
-No, I…

764
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,869
I can always find another news anchor.

765
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,498
What's the point of good qualifications,
a good family, and a nice image?

766
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,375
It's all meaningless.

767
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:32,294
They're all fake.

768
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,472
Mom.

769
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:44,515
What are you doing here?

770
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,975
What does it look like?
I'm working, of course.

771
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,521
I've got to earn every penny I can.
Am I right?

772
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,569
Sweetheart, I know you've had a long day.

773
00:44:59,154 --> 00:44:59,988
Mom.

774
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:02,991
My perfect son.

775
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,743
You did nothing wrong, okay?

776
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,329
It's not like you hit or killed someone.

777
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,456
You said a few things
that were on your mind.

778
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,250
What's wrong with that?

779
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,130
Just lie to people again, honey.

780
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,965
You're good at that.

781
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,009
You have to keep pretending
like we don't exist

782
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,805
and continue living a facade
as the perfect Song Ki-baek

783
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:28,767
so we can sponge off you forever. Right?

784
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,478
Mom.

785
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,539
I thought his family was well-off.

786
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:53,834
I heard you'd make the finance section
if your house were to be revealed.

787
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,128
They say he comes
from a powerful family.

788
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,422
So he's not the prince but the pauper.

789
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,258
Says who?
You're the ones who created my image.

790
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,427
It takes skills to build a good image!

791
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,680
He's been acting like he's got it all
and like he's a good person.

792
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,392
Man, it's unbelievable.
It's all been complete lies.

793
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,480
I have to ask him for money today.

794
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,982
Can I ask for just another 100,000 won?

795
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:19,318
Let's sit down and talk.

796
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:49,139
Huh? What… What's that?

797
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:15,958
What?

798
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,061
Huh?

799
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,235
What happened?

800
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,362
44 UNREAD MESSAGES

801
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,073
POSITION: NEWS DIVISION
NAME: SONG KI-BAEK

802
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,825
Song Ki-baek is being penalized.

803
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,119
You know, I'm worried.

804
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,329
About what?

805
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,872
About Song Ki-baek.

806
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,001
What if something really
happened to him in that accident?

807
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,043
What accident?

808
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,630
On Woo-ju.

809
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,301
Oh, Ms. Chae. It's been a while.

810
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,260
Hi.

811
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,554
What's going on?

812
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,056
Well, I was just in the neighborhood,

813
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,810
and I thought I'd stop by
your mom's hair salon.

814
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:20,022
Go play with your grandma, okay?

815
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,232
Go ahead, Yeon.

816
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,444
-Bye.
-Bye.

817
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:31,408
Want to grab a coffee?

818
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,702
I sent Yeon away
because I thought you'd do this.

819
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,746
Let's go.

820
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,748
Just leave. I have somewhere to be.

821
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:40,709
I sent her away
because I didn't want to embarrass you.

822
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,462
Goodbye.

823
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,356
What?

824
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,567
What's going on?

825
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,571
Oh…

826
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,416
Don't you get clingy too, Beep Beep.

827
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,543
God, this is embarrassing.

828
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,923
Embarrassing? I love this car.
Why is it embarrassing?

829
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,591
It's a used car for one thing,

830
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,052
and I spent the money
I saved for your birthday gift.

831
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,346
That's what makes it more meaningful.

832
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,515
That means I own a small part of it.

833
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,727
Oh, this is great.

834
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:44,314
Now you don't have to stay all night
at bus terminals to make morning shoots,

835
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,400
and you have a place to be
when you're on standby.

836
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:48,694
And we can go somewhere far together.

837
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,736
That's right.

838
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,075
Please keep him safe, Beep Beep. Okay?

839
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,284
You named it Beep Beep?

840
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,452
Yeah, Beep Beep.

841
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,331
It's the assistant director.

842
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,582
Hello, sir.

843
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,460
Oh, I'm on my way now. Yes.

844
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,380
Sorry? Liquid painkiller?

845
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,757
I don't have a liquid painkiller.

846
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,969
Oh, no. I'll get you one.

847
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,638
Yes. Don't worry. Bye.

848
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:20,809
We're in the middle of nowhere.
How are we going to find a pharmacy?

849
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:21,893
Ta-da!

850
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:25,397
There's a pharmacy right here.
How do you…

851
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,858
What, never been bitten
by mosquitoes at a shoot?

852
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,278
Oh, Jeong-heon. Stop!

853
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,404
What? Oh!

854
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:35,115
TASTY DUMPLINGS AND STEAMED BUNS

855
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,325
Hello. Could I have a box of steamed buns?

856
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:38,827
-All right.
-Thank you.

857
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,370
Sure, please enjoy.

858
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:43,081
Are you hungry?

859
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:47,169
The FDs accidentally sat on a bag of buns
they were going to use,

860
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,379
and Yeong-gyu saw it.
He's refusing to eat them.

861
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,174
But how did you even catch that?

862
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,926
Wow. It's insane how quickly you think.

863
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,972
They call me the super rookie
for a reason.

864
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:00,515
Let's go.

865
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,351
Come on, let's go.

866
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,119
It can be described as disinhibition.

867
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,664
The lesion in your brain has caused
emotional dysregulation

868
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:28,418
and personality changes
similar to symptoms of dementia.

869
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,212
But there's no danger to your life.

870
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,673
Nonetheless, considering your job,

871
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:38,345
being unable to control the things you say
could be a challenging issue for you.

872
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,565
Hey. How are you?

873
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,902
Move out of the apartment?

874
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:55,445
It's a little unexpected.

875
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,198
You're moving back next month?

876
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,659
You said I could stay
as long as I wanted.

877
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,077
I mean…

878
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,038
I don't have money
to get a place right now.

879
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,834
It's your apartment.
You can do whatever you want with it.

880
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:13,505
Your car is fine too.
Listen, I have to go.

881
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,860
Min-gu, all the locations
on your list looked great.

882
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,571
The Fishermen and the Country shot there.
They said it was amazing.

883
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,490
I should've come with you.
I'm really sorry, Woo-ju.

884
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,158
Don't worry about it.

885
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,494
I can check out these locations by myself.

886
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,996
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

887
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,205
-Okay.
-Bye.

888
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,041
Wow, this place looks fantastic.

889
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,008
Hey, isn't this nice?

890
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:00,927
Aren't you glad you came?

891
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,179
It's nice.

892
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:07,809
It took me a lot of effort to join
The Fishermen and the Country, you know.

893
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,520
I should practice my fishing technique.

894
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,981
That rock is a good fishing spot.

895
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,774
Yeah?

896
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,028
There are a lot of things I want to ask,

897
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,030
but we're here to have fun today,

898
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,490
so let's do that.
Talk to me when you're ready.

899
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,034
Yeah.

900
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:27,120
I'll catch you some black sea bream.

901
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,916
FISHING EXPERIENCE

902
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:58,318
Oh, you're adorable.

903
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,570
This is supposed to be a good spot,

904
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,530
so why can't I catch a single minnow?

905
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,658
Even the god of the sea
couldn't get you one.

906
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,369
Minnows live in freshwater,
not in the ocean.

907
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:11,289
Touché. Fishing is all about waiting.

908
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,708
Aren't you supposed to be
the symbol of patience?

909
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,085
Don't be ridiculous.

910
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,878
Symbol of patience, my ass.

911
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,006
You've been acting strange!

912
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,383
You've changed. You know that?

913
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,887
I'm going to go get something to drink.

914
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,263
My butt's too sore to sit here.

915
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,435
He's so touchy these days.

916
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,187
-Thank you.
-Bye.

917
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,371
Seriously, I'm not getting any bites.

918
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,624
Hi, honey.

919
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,046
What? But she was fine until this morning.

920
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,966
Damn it. Okay.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

921
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,098
Good God.

922
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,437
Damn it, I should've worn sneakers.

923
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,532
Thank you for your cooperation.

924
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,950
I'll be in touch.

925
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,502
Huh? What?

926
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,797
Isn't that Song Ki-baek?

927
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,925
What's he doing over there alone?

928
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:12,285
Everything isn't over yet, right?

929
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,955
Maybe it's already over.

930
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,336
What is the matter with you, Ki-baek?

931
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,799
What did I do
to deserve something like this?

932
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:28,051
I've worked so hard to get here.

933
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,677
Huh?

934
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,941
Man, it's so damn beautiful.

935
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,697
I'm really scared here.

936
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,618
What's he doing up there?

937
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,090
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

938
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,093
Boy, now I'm even hearing things.

939
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,264
Hey, stop! Stop!

940
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,934
Huh? Ms. On?

941
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,228
Just calm down and get down here.

942
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,980
I know it's hard, but don't do this!

943
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:24,190
Wait, what are you doing here?

944
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,151
Everything is going to be okay.

945
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,944
Come down here. Come on!

946
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,322
Did you follow me here? Why?

947
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,617
Why are you coming up here?

948
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,371
I know you're stronger
than this, Mr. Song!

949
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,124
Don't come up here! It's dangerous!

950
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,210
If you're feeling upset about something,
talk to me.

951
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,587
I'll listen, okay?

952
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,297
Listen to what? I told you.

953
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,299
I'm not entirely fine!

954
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,676
This is driving me crazy.

955
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,344
Why are you doing this?

956
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,512
Stop talking to me!

957
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,764
This wouldn't have happened
if I hadn't met you.

958
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,058
Why do you keep showing up in front of me?

959
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,602
I said, don't come up here!

960
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,312
Don't! Oh.

961
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,397
Don't come near me. Just don't, okay?

962
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:08,735
Look, Mr. Song. Calm down. It's dangerous!

963
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,529
-Get out of my sight!
-You'll fall!

964
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,491
Oh, for God's sake.
Why would you follow me here?

965
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,618
Oh, no! Don't move!

966
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:18,578
Don't come near me!
Get out of my sight!

967
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:19,746
You'll fall!

968
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,661
FRANKLY SPEAKING

969
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:02,580
Have you gone totally insane? Get a grip!

970
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,873
Help!

971
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,085
When I see your face,
I get this strong feeling of…

972
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,044
I feel better now.

973
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,171
Ms. On, I hear you're having a hard time.

974
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,507
Hey. Could you help me, please?

975
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,010
I'm genuinely interested
in your new show as a show host.

976
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,304
Just go. I'm not interested.

977
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,015
I have a problem staying calm.

978
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:24,185
Who invited Song Ki-baek here?
This is just embarrassing.

979
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:26,646
What if the switch turns on
when I'm at work?

980
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,983
You came to work? You've got thick skin.

981
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:34,028
The switch is turned on, isn't it?

982
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:40,201
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to JBC News.

983
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,423
Aren't you scared?

984
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:58,469
My mom said there's a shark in there.

985
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,054
There's no shark.

986
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,974
Your mom lied so you wouldn't spend
too much time in cold water.

987
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:06,728
Also, when you grow up,
things like sharks don't scare you.

988
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,647
What scares you is life.

989
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:19,282
-Cold, isn't it?
-No, it's not cold at all.

990
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,783
You're lying.

991
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,077
I'm not lying.

992
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,205
Aren't you cold?

993
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,248
Nope.

994
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,918
Are you the kind of grown-up
who never lies?

995
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,300
Somehow, that's what I've become.

996
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,431
Oh, it's really quiet.

997
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,141
That's cool.

998
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,480
It's not cool. It's ruining me.

999
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:53,107
People might say it's cool.

1000
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:59,656
Or that it's satisfying without realizing
how it's completely messing up my life.

1001
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:02,367
Hey, can we be friends?

1002
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:07,455
I have a feeling something fun will happen
if I'm with you.

1003
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,957
I'm not sure.

1004
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:19,884
