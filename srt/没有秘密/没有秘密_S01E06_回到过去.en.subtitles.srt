00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,801
FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,596
You know, I'm hurt.

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,101
I mean, I get it.

4
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,396
But you, Ms. On, you really hurt me.

5
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,566
But you know what?

6
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,652
I can't quite figure out why I'm hurt.

7
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,118
What was the potential you saw in me?

8
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,954
What was it that you saw in me?

9
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,251
My heart fluttered.

10
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,839
She basically confessed her feelings.

11
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,263
How did that make you feel?

12
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,975
I…

13
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,977
And right now…

14
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,607
My heart is fluttering.

15
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,574
When people are anxious
due to a rush of adrenaline,

16
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,910
they often act and speak impulsively.

17
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,788
But those feelings

18
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,958
are only true for a moment.

19
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,255
Even if it's just for a moment,
they're still real feelings.

20
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,509
Don't say anything.

21
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,764
I'm sorry, Ki-baek. I made a mistake.

22
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,109
You got lost in the woods,

23
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,653
and Yu-yeong hugged you
the moment you showed up.

24
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,530
That's proof her feelings are genuine.

25
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,701
By the way,

26
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,995
why do you keep smiling?

27
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:52,130
EPISODE 6

28
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,569
Oh, Jeong-heon, look.

29
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,618
Hey, Woo-ju. Are you all right?

30
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,871
I'm fine.

31
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,917
Ki-baek!

32
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,172
You're not hurt, are you?

33
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,382
I was worried sick.

34
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,471
-On Woo-ju.
-Hey.

35
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,015
-What happened to your leg?
-I twisted my ankle.

36
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,017
Why did you storm off like that?

37
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,937
Get this on camera.

38
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,940
But we'll have to cut out
the whole horror game.

39
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,985
She's confessing. It's a great scene.
We should film it even if we can't use it.

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,032
What is it?

41
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,285
You're alive, so it's all good.

42
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,454
-Woo-ju!
-Woo-ju!

43
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,956
-Woo-ju.
-Are you okay?

44
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,040
Yeah, I'm fine.

45
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,834
-I'm sorry. I should've gone with you.
-I'm okay.

46
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,211
-I'm fine.
-Are you hurt?

47
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,046
I'm sorry I worried you guys.

48
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,006
I'm really okay. Let's head down.

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,258
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

50
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,467
You must be tired.

51
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,427
-I'll carry you.
-No, stop it. I'm good.

52
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,512
Oh, okay.

53
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,183
-Come on.
-Let's go.

54
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,936
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Thanks.

55
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,525
HEAVEN HOUSE

56
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,203
So you tumbled down the hill.

57
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,205
Yes.

58
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,541
That was a close call.

59
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:53,710
Yes.

60
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:57,964
Woo-ju gets easily scared.

61
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,716
Yes.

62
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,344
Thanks for coming back safely.

63
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,810
She was like that before too.

64
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,314
She didn't like to be alone in the dark.

65
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,611
I'm going to go and get some fresh air.

66
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,696
Good night.

67
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,628
That was childish as hell.

68
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,055
Happy birthday.

69
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,307
Happy-- Happy birthday.

70
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,313
KIM JEONG-HEON - SONG KI-BAEK

71
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,694
Man, why did it have to…

72
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,789
KI-BAEK

73
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,420
No.

74
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,506
Of course not.

75
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,556
You scared me.

76
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,975
Well, I couldn't sleep.

77
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,059
Here.

78
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,530
So you're okay?

79
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,323
You seemed uncomfortable earlier.

80
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,743
-Try doing this with your ankle.
-I'm really okay. Totally fine.

81
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,039
Right.

82
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,975
I wish I hadn't dated you back then.

83
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,688
If I dated you now,
I'd be a cooler boyfriend.

84
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,108
I was a loser when I was with you,
you know.

85
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,902
Now, I'm totally--

86
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,445
I'm like--

87
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,489
They call me
the ideal son-in-law, you know.

88
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,368
-Did you just laugh?
-Yeah, I did.

89
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,432
Hey, you're still up.

90
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,403
I wonder if we could play
a game with this.

91
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,488
Let's see.

92
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,038
Is this going to be too hard?

93
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,875
What are you doing?

94
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,794
I just got an idea.

95
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,878
You can go ahead.

96
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,966
Don't stay out too late.

97
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,650
Breakfast in Heaven.

98
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:32,029
Make breakfast for the person
on your mind right now.

99
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,032
All the pairs who choose each other
will have a breakfast date

100
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,036
and get the last hint on
what the guys have in common.

101
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:40,955
Can I order delivery?

102
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,373
What do you think?

103
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,379
-What?
-We've got a professional chef here.

104
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,506
Isn't it a little unfair?

105
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,466
This is not a cooking show.

106
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,636
All that matters is that your food
comes from the heart. Don't worry.

107
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,430
What should I make?

108
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,682
-What will you make?
-I don't know about this.

109
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,269
-But I can't cook.
-Can I just use a meal kit or something?

110
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,313
Well, this is going to be fun.

111
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:12,612
-I didn't think I'd be cooking here.
-You should only use one hand.

112
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,542
Are you carving it?

113
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,590
It looks good.

114
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,682
Okay, good.

115
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,983
Don't be so nervous.

116
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,445
This isn't about cooking.
It's about dating.

117
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,365
Just think about the person
you're cooking for. Nothing else.

118
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,158
The person I'm cooking for.

119
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,871
What kind of food do you like, Ha-young?

120
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,915
What? Why would you ask what I like?

121
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:10,252
You know, there might be some food
that you crave when you're tired at work.

122
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,754
I never have an appetite at work.

123
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,298
Even when you see all this food?

124
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,967
Eating props brings
three years of bad luck.

125
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,807
I see. You're cranky
because you're hungry.

126
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,225
I'm not cranky.

127
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,685
I'm trying to stay on my toes
because Woo-ju is soft,

128
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,771
and she always goes so easy on people.

129
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,695
It looks like you.

130
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,489
Here.

131
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,573
It looks like you.

132
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,535
They're not props.

133
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,498
Thanks.

134
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,460
Anyway, just try your best.

135
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,834
Why did he put a trotter in the middle?

136
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,669
It's like he buried it in a grave.

137
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,380
I've never seen plating like it.

138
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,308
Would you like to have breakfast with me?

139
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,102
Yes, I'd love to.

140
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,319
Would you like to join me?

141
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,655
Come on.

142
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,668
Would you like to have breakfast with me?

143
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,769
Yes.

144
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,145
What?

145
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,856
I'd love to.

146
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,698
Ki-baek isn't exactly my type,
to be honest.

147
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,201
Sorry?

148
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,079
I don't know if it's because
he's honest or just insensitive,

149
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,958
but he's the type to embarrass people
with his words, which is the worst.

150
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,878
Then why…

151
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,549
It looked like things were going well
between you and Jeong-heon,

152
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,051
so why did you have breakfast
with Ki-baek today?

153
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,430
Because sometimes
I can see that he's being genuine.

154
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,814
And somehow,
the things he does do it for me.

155
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,898
Oh, my God!

156
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,694
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
That's mean.

157
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,988
It must've been caught on camera.

158
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,282
Here.

159
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,579
Those are fixed cameras,
so they probably didn't catch it.

160
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,289
It's just some gunk.

161
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:34,915
Remove it now.

162
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,001
There's nothing cool about him,

163
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,503
but he's different from the others.

164
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:42,464
You're right.

165
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,180
Here.

166
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:55,936
This is amazing.

167
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,896
You like it?

168
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,691
Ki-baek?

169
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,902
Yes.

170
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,111
Aren't you going to eat?

171
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,033
I'm happy to just see you enjoying it.

172
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,329
It's delicious.

173
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,419
You're right.

174
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,297
Help yourself.

175
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,805
This is the hint?

176
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,057
What does it mean?

177
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,604
Oh, there's another hint
they only gave to the girls yesterday.

178
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,564
I'll tell you.

179
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,653
Suzy.

180
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,380
Someone got the right answer.

181
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,717
So what's the answer?

182
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,928
She said someone got it
but not what it is.

183
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,972
Are we supposed to
just stand here like this?

184
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,729
What?

185
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,314
What?

186
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,942
No way.

187
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,209
You're kidding.

188
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:25,002
-One of them mentioned her.
-Right?

189
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,715
What's going on? Who is she?

190
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,927
My first love.

191
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,141
Cho-hui.

192
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,354
Cho-hui.

193
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:14,301
We first met like it was

194
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:18,138
A coincidental joke
And we talked

195
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,766
Your words captured…

196
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,771
Happy birthday.

197
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,648
Happy-- Happy birthday.

198
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,944
Whoa.

199
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,821
Thank you.

200
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,032
It's so pretty.

201
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,247
Everyone, please welcome Ms. Min Cho-hui,

202
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,415
the first love of all
our male contestants.

203
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,377
With your love stories from the past
and present in the mix,

204
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,295
which path will your heart follow?

205
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,342
Couple's Paradise, the First Love.
The second chapter begins now.

206
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,348
Hello, I'm Min Cho-hui.

207
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:27,666
Bringing their first love as the new girl
seems a bit unfair.

208
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,128
Guys get a little sentimental when
it comes to their first love, you know.

209
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,256
Still, it's all in the past.

210
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,800
Nothing is different
except she's gotten old.

211
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,180
What's important is the present.

212
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,684
I said whoever guesses what the guys
have in common will be given an advantage.

213
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:50,439
The advantage is to have
the first date with your first love.

214
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,191
And the winner of the date is…

215
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,029
I shouldn't have told him about Suzy.

216
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,156
This sucks.

217
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,955
First love?

218
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,711
Someone got the right answer.

219
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,671
All right, let's take a short break.

220
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,759
After the break, Jeong-heon and Cho-hui
will have their special date.

221
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,844
-Okay, thank you.
-Help me move this!

222
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,561
Hey, Cho-hui.

223
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,522
I never saw this coming.

224
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,942
I never thought I'd see you here.

225
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:35,859
Right?

226
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,571
Do you remember that bar
we used to hang out at near our school?

227
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,698
I went there just last week.

228
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,785
The scribbles we left
on the wall are still there.

229
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:49,456
Wait, didn't you say you don't drink beer?
You insisted on having whiskey last night.

230
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,543
Now I know why I wanted to make
braised mussels this morning.

231
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,003
Cho-hui, do you remember?

232
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,631
You said it always helped
when you caught a cold.

233
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:02,636
So did you know about this whole setup?

234
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,138
Yes.

235
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,766
I think it's really cool.

236
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,978
Someone as timid as me
would never have the nerve to do this.

237
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,188
You must be really open-minded.

238
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,565
Oh, did she used to live abroad?

239
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,566
Yes, with me.

240
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,117
I'm going to go use the bathroom.

241
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,201
Right.

242
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,663
The bathroom is this way.
I can show you the way.

243
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,540
No, I can find it on my own.

244
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,090
Cho-hui.

245
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,675
Hey.

246
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,053
Are you all right?

247
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,805
Yes.

248
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:54,229
To be honest, I'm a little nervous.

249
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,648
I'm nervous.

250
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,698
There are a lot of cameras and people.

251
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,285
And everyone seems to get along
like a team, except you.

252
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,495
Exactly. How did you know?

253
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,123
It's the same for me.

254
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,209
Oh, I see.

255
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,192
I knew you had your ambitions,
but this is a surprise.

256
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,989
Come on. I've got a date with Cho-hui.

257
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,998
Before the special date,

258
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:59,252
we have a special offer for Cho-hui,
who has just joined us.

259
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:02,881
If you want,
you can invite someone else to your date.

260
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,050
There can be a third person.

261
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,780
Ki-baek, do you want to join us?

262
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,247
You were right.
The new girl is certainly a pot stirrer.

263
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,791
And your decision to let her choose…

264
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,044
No. It's very good.

265
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,256
This is going to be a game changer.

266
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,050
Everyone's first love has shown up.

267
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,594
It's going to shake things up like crazy.

268
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,569
Oh, Yeon.

269
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,736
Back there.

270
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,988
I'll get it.

271
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,201
-I'm okay. It's heavy.
-I got it.

272
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,786
Goodness. Wow.

273
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,997
How are you doing?

274
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,791
If the work is too much,
just let me know, okay?

275
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,376
There's a lot for me to do here.

276
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,587
Moving stuff, taking care of my brother,

277
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,547
and taking care of you.

278
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,400
Well…

279
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,821
I'm sorry.

280
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,534
I understand.

281
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,165
I guess you found Cho-hui in my notebook,

282
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,167
connected the dots to Jeong-heon,

283
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,712
and learned about
the other guys through her.

284
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,383
And that must have given you
the idea for the show.

285
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,638
You're not mad at me?

286
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,725
I gave you that notebook to read.

287
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,395
I can't say that I wasn't surprised,

288
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,858
but I'm the one who gave it to you,
so of course, I understand.

289
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,286
I'm sorry. I'll leave you guys to talk.

290
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,289
Thank you.

291
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,009
Thank you for earlier.

292
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,136
You really helped me relax.

293
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,930
Feeling better now?

294
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,474
Actually,

295
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:02,936
it wasn't easy for me
to decide to come on the show.

296
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,898
But this is just as hard as I thought.

297
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,904
I feel like I'm bothering you all
by showing up here, complicating things.

298
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,658
I want to do well
since I'm already here, but…

299
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,953
But you don't really know
what to do, right?

300
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,746
Exactly.

301
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:27,210
But one of the reasons
why I decided to do this…

302
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,923
was because I missed you, Ki-baek.

303
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:40,056
They say you don't forget your first love
but bury it in your heart.

304
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:45,020
So you can always dig it back up again.

305
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,816
He and his friend like the same girl.

306
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,486
It's Seong-bin, right?
The kid who gets stocks for New Year's?

307
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,280
Why are you so immature?

308
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,118
If Ms. Na tells my mom, she'll be upset.

309
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:04,122
Gu-won told Seong-bin his secret,
but he told everyone about it.

310
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,665
It's not my secret!

311
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,584
I've never told that to anyone but you!

312
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,795
And it wasn't because
I wanted your pity or help!

313
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,672
Why are you so twisted?

314
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,757
That's it.

315
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,384
What the hell do you know about me?

316
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,307
What are you guys doing?

317
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,729
Two guys liking the same girl.
How's that a secret?

318
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,067
Oh, dear. It's okay.

319
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,986
Hey!

320
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,988
Gu-won, you know what?

321
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,576
Ki-baek used to write
in his journal every night

322
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,454
about his first love or something too.

323
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,040
Don't you remember?

324
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:50,877
I think it was his senior year,
on the birthday of the girl he liked.

325
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:52,921
That's right.

326
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,255
It was his senior year.

327
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,634
He had a huge fight with his friend,
and you were totally flabbergasted.

328
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:59,260
-You remember, right?
-Exactly.

329
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,639
He had never in his life
caused trouble like that.

330
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,933
It's the good kids
who cause big trouble, Mom.

331
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:05,975
For goodness' sake.

332
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,019
That's your brother you're talking about.

333
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,605
Go on and eat.

334
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:13,775
You're right.

335
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,111
It was that one time

336
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,488
when Ki-baek…

337
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,492
bared his soul.

338
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,289
Mr. Song.

339
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:36,172
Why do you think it's all your fault?

340
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,889
What are you two whispering about?

341
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,269
I think it's a secret.

342
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,735
Wow, you look beautiful.

343
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,194
You look gorgeous.

344
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,446
Enjoy your food, guys.

345
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,741
Gu-won, don't miss the academy bus.

346
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,243
-Okay.
-And turn off the lights when you leave.

347
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,536
Yes, don't worry.

348
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,248
All right, see you later. She's glowing.

349
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,252
Perfect.

350
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,788
Remember these?

351
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,999
Schisandra flowers.

352
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:54,083
In early summer,

353
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,212
they grew against the wall
outside your house.

354
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,965
In the language of flowers…

355
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,720
they mean, "Let's meet again."

356
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:44,384
Did you know that Cho-hui was coming here?

357
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,302
Does it even matter?

358
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,513
Hello, Jeong-heon.

359
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:50,890
My daughter's a fan.
Could she get a picture with you?

360
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,892
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you.

361
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,186
Jeong-heon is really popular.

362
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:56,729
Right?

363
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,816
I haven't been
to an amusement park in ages.

364
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,401
Really?

365
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,698
Today, I wish I were in your shoes, man.

366
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,200
This is supposed to be a date
but it seems impossible.

367
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,918
Ki-baek, are you going to be okay?

368
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,337
You got scared
during the horror game and fell over.

369
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,759
Oh, if Ki-baek can't go on the rides,
I'm fine just watching.

370
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,721
I tripped, okay?

371
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,723
Scared? Oh, please.

372
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,310
Who's scared?
What's there to be scared of?

373
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,394
Song Ki-baek!

374
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,605
Mr. Nostrils.

375
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,799
Come on, let's go on a scary ride.

376
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,226
Isn't this a scary one?

377
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,687
I've got you. Don't worry. It's okay.

378
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,608
Worry about yourself
or you'll bounce like popcorn.

379
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,069
Popcorn?

380
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,029
-Cho-hui, hold on tight.
-Okay.

381
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,368
You've set up cameras on it, right?

382
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,244
Yes.

383
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,622
It'd look better
with more people on the ride,

384
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,290
so the writers should go on it too.

385
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,375
Let's do that.

386
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,379
Including you.

387
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,588
What?

388
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,215
Why are you doing this to me?

389
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,175
Come on, you're the head writer.

390
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,844
You've got to teach them
how to be funny on variety shows.

391
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,846
But…

392
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,735
-Guys, let's all sit over here.
-Okay.

393
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,370
All right, today's a special day.
Who's ready to kick it up a notch?

394
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,747
Let's make it thrilling. Let's go.

395
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,626
-Cho-hui, are you okay?
-Yes.

396
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,045
For God's sake.

397
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,049
It's moving. It's fast.

398
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:32,969
What makes someone
everyone's ideal son-in-law?

399
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:36,472
Strength. Let's see
how strong they are. Pang!

400
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,895
Let go of the railing.

401
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,230
Hold on tight!

402
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,858
Just follow your body,
follow your heart. Pang, pang!

403
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,365
God.

404
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,077
Now, we've got the show's head writer.
Let's see how strong she is. Pang!

405
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:10,923
Ms. On!

406
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,562
What are you doing? Let go of me!

407
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,980
I got you.

408
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,275
Let go of me!

409
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,611
I got you. Don't worry.

410
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,989
Just hang on. Try to-- No, stop.

411
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,949
Ms. On!

412
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,826
Ms. On!

413
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,454
Ms. On!

414
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,545
Ms. On!

415
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,964
We'll just have them go on the ride again.

416
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,425
-Ms. On!
-Man…

417
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,353
Let's take a short break.

418
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,023
You can go grab some coffee
if you want but don't go too far.

419
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,442
-Okay. Coffee? Sounds good.
-Cool.

420
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,612
Guys, gather around.

421
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,947
Let's have a talk.

422
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,407
I-na, go with the cast members.

423
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,201
Okay. They have coffee over there.

424
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,589
-Can I put my arm around you?
-What are you doing?

425
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,260
-Take a picture.
-Nice. Give a thumbs-up.

426
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,387
Wow, that's great. That's it.

427
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:43,683
He was bragging about how popular he is,
and he got what he asked for.

428
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,434
Serves you right, you jerk.

429
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,687
Are you guys all friends?

430
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,314
Wow! I've never met a celebrity.
Is she your girlfriend?

431
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,192
She's a celebrity too.

432
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,777
-Oh!
-Hey, she's a celebrity!

433
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,445
-I'll get a picture.
-She's pretty.

434
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,530
Go get some people.

435
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,157
-Oh, okay.
-Go with her.

436
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,576
Take a nice one.

437
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,411
Get in there. All together.

438
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,163
-All of you.
-Let's take some pics.

439
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,248
Come on. One, two, three.

440
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,541
-Four, five. Nice.
-Really?

441
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,210
It looks awesome with the Ferris wheel.

442
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,837
It looks great!

443
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,423
You guys have fun.

444
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,549
Hey, bro!

445
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:18,634
Buy us some coffee.

446
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:21,304
-You nutjob. What are you, a thug?
-What?

447
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,640
-Ask him to send you a gift card.
-Come on. You're loaded.

448
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,058
You should thank us for that.

449
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,520
-Cut it out. You're acting like a psycho!
-Are these designer clothes?

450
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,856
You're right! They're designer…

451
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,492
Jeong-heon! Kim Jeong-heon!

452
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,039
Who's he?

453
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,625
Everyone's ideal son-in-law
or everyone's doormat?

454
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:52,877
Hey.

455
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,420
Just go over there.

456
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,009
You see him on TV,
and you think he's your friend?

457
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,513
But he doesn't know you.

458
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,183
You came here to have fun
wearing nice clothes and shoes,

459
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,643
so just do what you came for.

460
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,564
Look, mister. Who are you to lecture us?

461
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,025
Wait, babe. He's that guy.

462
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,945
From that YouTube video.
You know, up his nose--

463
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,656
-That dude whose face got--
-The one with the nostrils.

464
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,241
-You're right!
-It's him!

465
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,617
That guy?

466
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,077
I can't believe these kids.

467
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,829
What? What are you going to do?

468
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,792
I'll teach you a lesson.

469
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,002
I'll teach you a lesson.

470
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,171
-You nutjob.
-Mister.

471
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,174
Mind your own damn business
and just keep walking.

472
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,051
Go straight that way. Yes.

473
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,135
Why?

474
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,764
Why "bro" for him but "mister" for me?

475
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,601
Why call him "bro" and me "mister"
in front of all these people?

476
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,064
-Everyone's taking our picture. Let's go.
-Do something.

477
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:59,110
Hey, why are you filming us
without permission?

478
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,569
We have-- What's it called?

479
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,238
We have portrait rules, okay?

480
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,823
-We have portrait rules!
-Stop!

481
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,658
It's portrait rights, guys.

482
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,910
It's portrait rights, not portrait rules!

483
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,578
I've had enough of this guy.

484
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,665
Who cares if it's portrait rules
or portrait rights?

485
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,125
Who cares?

486
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,877
I'm sorry.

487
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,338
-What?
-What?

488
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:25,219
In a situation like this,
you say "I'm sorry" and leave.

489
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,263
You know you've done something wrong.

490
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,685
And you people.
Are you just going to keep filming?

491
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,021
What are you going to do with the footage?

492
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,941
Are you going to put it on the Internet,
find out who they are and punish them?

493
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,818
Is that the right way to educate them?

494
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,779
Isn't it your responsibility as adults

495
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,073
to give them guidance
before they stray further--

496
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,117
-What are you doing?
-Just come.

497
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,493
Hey.

498
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,245
Hey, put me down.

499
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,913
Put me down now!

500
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:56,292
Just stay still before I knock you out.

501
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,713
-Please delete the photos.
-Are you okay?

502
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,924
-I'm sorry. No pictures, please.
-Thank you.

503
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,468
-All right, come on.
-Thank you.

504
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,553
Could you delete the photos?

505
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,305
-I'm really sorry.
-I'm sorry.

506
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,031
Are you okay?

507
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,372
I got slapped in the face once

508
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,458
for not smiling for a picture.

509
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,711
This is not a big deal.

510
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,553
If you're having a hard time,
talk to someone.

511
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,806
Anyone.

512
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,267
You can talk to me too.

513
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,231
It's nothing.

514
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,866
Where's Ki-baek?

515
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:19,375
You should've stayed out of it.
Didn't you know you'd cause trouble?

516
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,462
I'm sorry.

517
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,131
I mean it.

518
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,634
I never meant to
cause problems for the show.

519
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:35,141
You can't make a scene like that
without thinking about the consequences.

520
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,823
Just go ahead and say it.

521
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,283
If you consider consequences,

522
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:56,245
how could you use someone's personal,
private memories for your TV show?

523
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,915
Did you think about how much
it would hurt and shock me?

524
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,877
But you said you understood.

525
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,714
I feel betrayed,
like I can't trust anyone in the world.

526
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,216
It hurts. I'm hurt.

527
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,639
I'm sorry.

528
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:19,727
I did think you might feel betrayed.

529
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,772
I deserve to be called selfish,
but what I saw in that notebook was--

530
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,857
But…

531
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,988
I'm trying to understand you…

532
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,202
because I was the one
who gave you my notebook.

533
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:42,416
Besides, I know you didn't mean any harm…

534
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,339
given the reason why

535
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,801
you brought me here.

536
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,851
I'm doing all sorts of things
that'll make people hate me,

537
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,478
but I'm still going to do my best

538
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,189
to not be the worst guy.

539
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:07,900
I'll try.

540
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,951
WAITING ROOM
TICKETS

541
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,707
I guess that's the character
he's going with.

542
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,961
He made a mess,
but I'm sure our bosses will clean it up.

543
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,129
From today, Ki-baek is my favorite.

544
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,467
Maybe it's because he's an announcer.
He's so logical even when he lashes out.

545
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,721
It felt so cathartic
hearing him talk earlier.

546
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,557
I'm totally charmed.

547
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,308
-Already?
-Isn't he charming?

548
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,852
People do like
someone outspoken these days.

549
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,062
Like my Ki-baek.

550
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,022
He's cool.

551
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,774
-He's cool.
-So charming.

552
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,776
He's totally my type.

553
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,497
By the way,
don't you think Ki-baek is kind of cute?

554
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,458
I find him adorable
when he gets all flustered.

555
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,421
Oh, is he not like that with you yet?

556
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,049
I guess things are still awkward
between you two.

557
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,135
You're his first love,
but it's been decades.

558
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,100
-Someone's calling you.
-Sorry?

559
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:24,977
Your phone.

560
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,771
Oh, it's fine.

561
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,943
Can I drop the formalities
and call you Cho-hui?

562
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,529
Did you say you were 37?

563
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,323
Was it 38?

564
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,203
You're the same age as Ki-baek.

565
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,957
So you're 33, right?

566
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,250
Yes.

567
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,466
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

568
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,016
-By the way, are you guys okay?
-Heard you got into a fight at the park.

569
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,977
I lost my temper and made a scene.

570
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,648
Thank you for your concern, and I'm sorry.

571
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:14,443
Well, it's all settled,
and Ki-baek did nothing wrong.

572
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,988
Actually, people are saying
Ki-baek was super cool.

573
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:22,409
I-na did my interview earlier,
and she went on and on about Ki-baek.

574
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,286
It's like she wanted to be in the show.

575
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,956
I heard it was pretty rough on you,
Jeong-heon. Are you all right?

576
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,875
Oh, yes. I'm fine.

577
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,919
You guys went to the same school, right?

578
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,421
Ki-baek helped Jeong-heon big time today.

579
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:37,883
Thanks, Ki-baek.

580
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,180
Still, it must've been nice.
I wanted a date at an amusement park.

581
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,224
Now I feel bad.

582
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,520
Still, I'm happy we have another girl.

583
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,896
I have a roommate now.

584
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,650
Cho-hui, this is really good. Try it.

585
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,610
Oh, thank you.

586
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,199
My ankle still hurts.

587
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,493
I hurt it
during the horror game yesterday.

588
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,621
It was your right ankle.

589
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,547
Hey, can I see you for a second?

590
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,173
-Why?
-Come on.

591
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,050
What is it?

592
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,803
She's funny.

593
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,431
I think she did it on purpose.

594
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,184
Talking about an incident between us
that you don't know about.

595
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,604
It's childish but effective.

596
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,689
Is it?

597
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:43,615
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

598
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:47,161
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

599
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:51,540
-Happy birthday, dear Cho-hui
-Happy birthday, dear Cho-hui

600
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:54,585
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

601
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,547
I just put 30 candles on the cake.

602
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,049
I wanted to go with three,
but she stuck them all in.

603
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,261
Man, if we weren't out here on an island,
I would've gotten--

604
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,597
Hey, look at the flames.

605
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,556
Blow them out.

606
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,853
Happy birthday.

607
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,062
Thank you.

608
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,445
Hi, Mom.

609
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:25,616
You haven't returned
any of my calls all day.

610
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,243
I've been busy. You know I'm at work.

611
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,370
Did your date go well?

612
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,831
No, because I was worried
about my daughter.

613
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:36,210
Why work so hard you can't even have
seaweed soup on your birthday?

614
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,757
I bet you're stuck in the countryside,
running around like a headless chicken,

615
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,051
not even having time to shower.

616
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,928
I'm the head writer, Mom.

617
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,804
All I do now is give orders.

618
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:53,227
I am celebrating my birthday here,

619
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,188
so you can enjoy the seaweed soup.
You worked hard to raise me.

620
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,899
I made it with a ton of top-quality beef.

621
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,109
I'll save you some.
Good luck with your work.

622
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,488
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

623
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,031
Thanks.

624
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,366
Chug it!

625
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,661
-Chug, come on.
-I'll do it.

626
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,540
-Chug it!
-Chug it!

627
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,172
That's enough.

628
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,591
-Cho-hui, are you okay?
-We'll wrap it up here, guys.

629
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,844
-We'll do the individual interviews later.
-Okay.

630
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,348
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

631
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:34,560
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

632
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,854
-Happy birthday, dear Woo-ju
-Happy birthday

633
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:38,772
We got you a cake.

634
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:42,526
Happy birthday to you

635
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,531
Blow them out.

636
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,991
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

637
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,993
Pretty. Blow out the candles.

638
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,035
Okay.

639
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:53,870
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
WOO-JU

640
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,247
Happy birthday, Ms. On.

641
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,331
I didn't know.

642
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,875
Thank you.

643
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,294
God, I'm sorry, Woo-ju.

644
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:03,297
I feel terrible.
That's supposed to be our job.

645
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,508
Hey, who celebrates birthdays on set?

646
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,844
Oh, happy birthday.

647
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,264
My team is good at their jobs.

648
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,185
Woo-ju, please kill me.

649
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,022
I cannot believe I forgot your birthday.

650
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,608
Stop it.
Since when do we celebrate birthdays?

651
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,860
-Woo-ju, happy birthday.
-Thanks.

652
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,695
Happy birthday, Ms. On.

653
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:27,821
Happy birthday.

654
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:28,905
Happy birthday.

655
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,743
A birthday party while we're busy?
Can't they do it later?

656
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,578
We've got equipment to disassemble.

657
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:36,872
Oh, you know what?

658
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:40,167
I'm just really tired.
Let's call it a night here, shall we?

659
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,128
-You should go rest. Good night.
-Let's go.

660
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,631
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

661
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,550
Thanks. Go on, guys.
I'll just clean up here a little.

662
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:50,594
Good night.

663
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:51,970
Min-gu.

664
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,388
Come on, Min-gu.

665
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,223
Hey, I-na.

666
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:06,193
You met your first love again today.

667
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,694
Did your feelings change?

668
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,323
You're mad, aren't you?

669
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,911
I may not know much about other stuff,
but I can tell when you're mad.

670
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,290
You met your first love again today.

671
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,792
Did your feelings change?

672
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,128
Yes.

673
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,381
I keep liking her more and more.

674
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,758
A lot more than I used to.

675
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:33,428
What made you feel that way?

676
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:37,641
Because I can now do all the things
I couldn't do for her before.

677
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:44,106
I've never been able to celebrate
her birthday, but now I can.

678
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:51,738
I made some mistakes in the past,
and I didn't express my feelings.

679
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:55,075
Maybe I can express them now.

680
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,498
Your mistakes. Your feelings.

681
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,712
When you're in a relationship,
there are times

682
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,631
when it should be about them, not you.

683
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,718
I'm sure you know that,

684
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,431
but I'm saying this, hoping that things
will go well between you and Cho-hui.

685
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,126
You're still up.

686
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,963
The others went out
to play with some fireworks.

687
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,175
Right. I can't sleep.
I've got a lot on my mind.

688
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,221
Earlier at the amusement park,

689
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,682
I was a bit surprised.

690
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,560
You seem to have changed a lot.

691
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,480
You're right.

692
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,357
Have I changed a lot too?

693
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,861
No.

694
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:18,033
To me, you're still the Min Cho-hui I knew
from Minseong High School.

695
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,452
It's true.

696
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,750
Can I…

697
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,296
ask about your feelings?

698
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,010
Is there anyone that…

699
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:40,180
you like here?

700
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,140
There is.

701
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,269
Is there a chance that it's me?

702
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,395
No.

703
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:50,649
Sorry.

704
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,818
But it's not you.

705
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:55,654
Right.

706
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,281
I'm sure a lot of things happened
before I came here.

707
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,076
As expected, this is hard.

708
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:05,080
Yes, a lot of things happened.

709
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,416
So many things happened.

710
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:16,550
Still, you can't be sure your feelings
will stay the same tomorrow.

711
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,011
I mean, feelings can change many times
even in a day, right?

712
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,014
Right. That's the problem.

713
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,976
You want to understand, but you can't.

714
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,313
You decide not to tell anyone,
but then you want to.

715
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:34,484
You know it's better not to do anything,
but it's all you want to do.

716
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,735
That's the problem.

717
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,696
Yes.

718
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:42,951
That's why I hope you and I can be honest
with each other while we're here--

719
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,828
I should just be honest.

720
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,663
What?

721
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:51,167
Humans are complex beings, you know.

722
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,716
Thanks, Cho-hui.

723
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:59,676
I've got to go.

724
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:04,556
Get a good night's sleep.
The schedule is crazy here.

725
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,142
Forget all the dating shows
you watched for reference.

726
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,542
Is something the matter?

727
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,347
I…

728
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,059
will not confess my feelings.

729
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:50,977
What?

730
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,395
In disaster movies,

731
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:56,066
those who survive in the end always
think they love each other and kiss.

732
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,485
I've never thought that was real love.

733
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,531
That's just camaraderie
from surviving a crisis together.

734
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,244
I thought that's what you and I had.

735
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,211
It is. That's what we have.

736
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:20,173
No, it's not. I don't want to survive
a life-or-death crisis with you.

737
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:27,639
Because I don't want you to be in danger
or to see you suffer.

738
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,321
But I don't want you to avoid me
with that look on your face.

739
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,159
That's why

740
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:50,996
I'm not going to confess.

741
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,626
The rule of this show is to date
in front of the cameras,

742
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:58,795
and I won't break it.

743
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,175
All right.

744
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,637
But,

745
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,391
there's something I want to do instead.

746
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,311
What's that?

747
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,030
-Celebrate your birthday.
-What?

748
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,576
You're so unpredictable, Ki-baek.

749
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,912
All right. Let's celebrate.

750
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:34,914
-Hold this.
-What?

751
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,295
You remembered.

752
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,465
Spicy food is
the best kind of food there is.

753
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,092
You're just being tricked.

754
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,886
By who?

755
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:49,387
By trotters?

756
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,598
Spiciness is a kind of pain sensation,

757
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,099
so when you eat spicy food,

758
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,770
the brain perceives it as pain
and releases hormones like endorphins.

759
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,981
So, spicy food improves your mood?

760
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,484
No, you're being tricked.

761
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,486
So what if it's a trick?

762
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,447
You can think your brain is
working hard to make you feel better.

763
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:12,035
If you're going to lecture me,
put it back in here. Just don't eat it.

764
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:14,496
I wasn't refusing to eat it,
just sharing what I knew.

765
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,914
Why tell me not to eat?

766
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,211
This is exactly what I wanted.
How did you know?

767
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,297
"When life throws too much spice at you,
don't back down.

768
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,840
You should be just as spicy."

769
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,552
You eat spicy food
when you're stressed out.

770
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,848
You've looked stressed
the whole time here.

771
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:37,602
I brought this too.

772
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,773
You brought a lot of things.

773
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:45,735
Wow.

774
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,155
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

775
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:54,285
Happy birthday, Woo-ju
Happy birthday to you

776
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,121
Blow it out.

777
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:58,998
Come on, harder.

778
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,131
Applause.

779
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:13,304
Try it.

780
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,107
You've got to taste this.

781
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:31,948
It's good, right?

782
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,285
I can't really eat spicy food.

783
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,333
Wow, it's really good.

784
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:57,765
That's pretty.

785
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,734
Yes, pretty.

786
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,003
Thank you.

787
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,548
For not confessing your feelings.

788
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,637
And for celebrating my birthday.

789
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,799
Woo-ju.

790
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,551
Yes?

791
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,969
We've got a serious problem.

792
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,179
What is it?

793
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:25,144
There has been a big change
since last night.

794
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,315
One of the contestants has left the show.

795
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,026
That stupid girl
thought she was so clever.

796
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:37,657
Ki-baek.

797
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:39,993
What?

798
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,995
Woo-ju and I used to date.

799
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,041
Does that matter at this point?

800
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,252
Yes.

801
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:51,754
It will.

802
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:58,011
So we came up
with an alternative for everyone.

803
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:05,268
Please welcome
our new member to the group.

804
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,709
Hello, I'm the new contestant

805
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,129
On Woo-ju.

806
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,036
FRANKLY SPEAKING

807
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:09,499
She couldn't look more awkward,
being painfully conscious of the cameras.

808
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:13,461
Min-gu, don't forget to replace
the tissues. Oops.

809
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:15,588
You'll play a game
to decide your partners.

810
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,132
It's delicious.

811
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,677
You know that Ki-baek is
on a date with Cho-hui, right?

812
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,345
Why did you break up with Woo-ju?

813
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:25,431
Wait!

814
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,517
Can I call you when we get back to Seoul?

815
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,185
Please understand how I feel.

816
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,357
-I'm sorry about that.
-I know I may have disappointed you.

817
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:36,150
I'm sorry.

818
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:40,571
Couple's Paradise, the First Love.
You will now make your final decision.

819
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:52,458
