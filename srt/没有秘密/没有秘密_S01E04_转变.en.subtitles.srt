FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,723
I cannot lie.

3
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,476
Truth, fairness and justice.

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,313
I trust that news programs devoid
of these values aren't worth existing.

5
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:08,234
That is the reason
I must be a man who cannot lie,

6
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:12,947
and the reason why I've decided
to leave this corrupt news studio

7
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,492
that reeks
of such a disgusting rotten stench…

8
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,746
which I cannot stand any longer.

9
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:33,009
What a load of crap.
You quit your job on an impulse?

10
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,927
Are you nuts?

11
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,762
Do you have enough money to survive?

12
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,264
Still, wasn't it pretty cool what I did?

13
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,141
I protected my dream--

14
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,520
Two million won a month goes to family.

15
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,065
And 1.5 million to cover
your loan and the interest.

16
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,733
Oh, your severance pay?

17
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,694
You used it to help out your family
with their security deposit.

18
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:52,904
What a good son.

19
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,824
Credit card bills,
transportation expenses, phone bill.

20
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,534
SEIZED ASSET, BALANCE 0 WON

21
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:02,122
You're broke. You'll starve to death
trying to protect your dream.

22
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,880
Perhaps, this is a new opportunity for me.

23
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,799
Opportunity, my ass.

24
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,385
You turned off the switch on your life
with your own hands.

25
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,679
Wouldn't you say?

You're still here? We're closing.

31
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,247
Yeah, I'm still here.

EPISODE 4: THE SWITCH

33
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,266
Please enjoy.

34
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,143
-Thank you.
-Sure.

35
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,020
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

36
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,231
-Jeong-hun, it's been a while.
-Hello.

37
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,235
The chief seems busy this morning.

38
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:10,208
Anyway, Woo-ju doesn't need to know
about this, right?

39
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,793
Of course not.

40
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,714
No head writer would be happy to learn
that a junior writer makes more money.

41
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,425
You know I have faith in you, don't you?

42
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,719
That's why I agreed to pay
what you asked for.

43
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,640
I make sure my work is worth my pay,
so don't worry.

44
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,767
Do you want me to meet
with Kim Jeong-heon?

45
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,352
I know everyone at Forever C&C.

46
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,187
Oh, will you?

47
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:36,234
Woo-ju seems to be going through
a rough patch lately.

48
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,151
Come on.

49
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,113
That's no excuse for a writer.
When the tide comes in,

50
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,492
you've got to paddle, even if it means
using chopsticks when your paddles break.

51
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,620
That's my Ha-young.

52
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,293
Who cares how much she makes?

53
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,044
There's no point in getting jealous.

54
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,381
It's okay, On Woo-ju.
Just focus on your own work.

55
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,259
Wow, Ha-young is so amazing.

56
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,136
She got all these sponsors for our show

57
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,388
even before the casting was completed.

58
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,472
She's really great.

59
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:11,561
Woo-ju is hardworking too,
but I have to say, she's not as efficient.

60
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,645
-Right?
-Yeah.

61
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,480
Yeah. Do you want some of this?

62
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:15,815
I can't eat right now.

63
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,697
-Ms. On, it's been a while.
-Yes? Oh, hello.

64
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,491
-Hey, Woo-ju.
-Yes?

65
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,784
-Starting a new show?
-Yes.

66
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,828
-I hope it goes well.
-Wish me luck!

67
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,664
-Ms. On.
-Yes?

68
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,124
-Let's grab a bite sometime.
-Sure.

69
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,709
-I'll call you.
-I'll call you.

70
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,131
-Ms. On Woo-ju.
-Yes?

71
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,051
I have a shoot here at the set.

72
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:49,807
That's no excuse for a writer.
When the tide comes in,

73
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,811
you've got to paddle, even if it means
using chopsticks when your paddles break.

74
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,774
Hey, we're late.

75
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,108
-Let's go.
-See you there.

76
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,951
Hey, On Woo-ju.
You're going to make the floor collapse.

77
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,330
Even when I start my morning feeling good,
it doesn't even last half a day.

That is the reason why I've decided
to leave this corrupt news studio

83
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,682
that reeks of such a disgusting rotten
stench, which I cannot stand any longer.

84
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,418
On Woo-ju, what are you doing?

85
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,234
Oh, my God!

86
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:26,571
Mr. Song?

87
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,865
Ms. On, what are you…

88
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,950
Are you actually following me around? Why?

89
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,994
What are you doing here?

90
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,412
-I live here.
-I live here.

91
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,663
-What?
-What?

92
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,585
They're fixing up their storage room
for their eldest son who's moving in.

93
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,128
They apologized for the noise.

94
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,132
Apparently, their son also works
at a TV station.

95
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,049
He's an announcer.

96
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,052
The eldest son who just moved in upstairs?

97
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,054
-The announcer?
-Listen, dear.

98
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,141
The landlady's daughter
is a TV show writer.

99
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,685
Should I ask her to cast you on her show?

100
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,188
You're the landlady's daughter?

101
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,189
Yeah.

102
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,568
What happened to your apartment?

103
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,320
That huge, fancy apartment.

104
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,821
It's not my apartment.

105
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,199
It belongs to a friend
who's been working abroad.

106
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,451
He moved back
out of the blue and kicked me out.

107
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,496
My attempt to build a nice image
and reputation

108
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,040
with something that wasn't even mine
ended in failure.

109
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,042
I see.

110
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,504
Can you stop asking questions?
I don't want to answer.

111
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,005
You know I can't help it.

112
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,175
It's not like I wanted to hear
all those details.

113
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:40,311
I'll go. This is your house, your rooftop.

114
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,649
The rooftop is a shared space.

115
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,526
You can stay.

116
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,668
Are you okay?

117
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,505
I've never seen anyone
make such a dramatic exit from their job.

118
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,757
I'm not okay.

119
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,552
Right. Of course not.

120
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,929
So what's your plan now?

121
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,681
I don't know.

122
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,933
-Anything you want to do?
-No.

123
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,103
Do you regret it?

124
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,814
Yes.

125
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,567
No plans, no hope.

126
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,527
What a great combination.

127
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,905
You didn't have to point it out like that.

128
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,201
You looked like
you could use a reality check.

129
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,666
I have no plans or things
that I want to do, and I do regret it.

130
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,046
But even if I could go back,
I think I'd make the same decision.

131
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,883
It was cool.

132
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,014
It was cool how you left.
I've never seen anything like it.

133
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:13,195
Oh, I meant to throw it away,
but I couldn't find a trash can.

134
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,324
Got some pastries?

135
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,284
Are you throwing them away?
Can I have some?

136
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,453
Well…

137
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:22,413
Yeah.

138
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,169
It's good.

139
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,507
It may be all squashed out of shape,
but it's retained its taste and flavor,

140
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,346
which means it's still pastry, not trash.

141
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,683
You do have a way with words.

142
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,026
Would you like to drink one of these?

143
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,331
I won't ask you if you're okay.

144
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:12,546
You tell me when you're not okay,
and I'll buy you some pastries then.

145
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,345
It's good.

146
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:52,294
I might have been a loser yesterday
But not today

147
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,047
When you feel down
Get energy from your gut

148
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,174
Like this, like that

149
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,385
Like this, like that

150
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,594
Are you sick?

151
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,639
Mom, are you going somewhere?

152
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,809
I have a grade school reunion.

153
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,436
I've told you about it many times.

154
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,896
Do you have my pictures with you?

155
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,940
What are you going to do if you miss me?

156
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,358
You crazy girl.

157
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,069
I've got tons. You took a lot of them.

158
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:21,365
Goodness, you're a fool for your daughter,
my dear Ms. Bok-ja.

159
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,576
Don't be gross, silly.

160
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,037
There's japchae and marinated meat
in the fridge you just need to stir-fry.

161
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,998
-I can take care of myself.
-It's not for you.

162
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,749
It's for Gu-won if he comes over.

163
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,170
You don't need to tell me
how to take care of him. God.

164
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,589
By the way,

165
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:42,094
isn't the storage room upstairs
too small for a grown man?

166
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,971
If he can lie in it, isn't it good enough?

167
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:46,182
Why?

168
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:51,353
Would you be willing
to let him stay in your room?

169
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,981
What? Don't be ridiculous.

170
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,108
Ms. Bok-ja is leaving.

171
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,069
-How is it?
-Not bad.

172
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,696
That's what I thought.

173
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,585
This should…

174
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,968
CHINESE CRASH COURSE
FOR BEGINNERS

00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,012
SONG KI-BAEK

176
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,563
Wow, I didn't know I still had this.

177
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,742
Man, this is going to take forever.

178
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,333
Song Un-baek. I said, come move this.

179
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,502
And Pung-baek, go help your dad.

180
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,088
Come on, Mom.
You told me to clean the bathroom.

181
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,757
What am I, a spider?
You think I have ten hands?

182
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,260
Spiders don't have ten hands, dummy.

183
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,886
-They have six.
-Oh, zip it.

184
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,804
Just do it.

185
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,557
Ki-baek is in his room. Have him do it.

186
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,227
He needs to rest.
He hasn't been home in a long time.

187
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,104
Stop yapping and just get to it.

188
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,990
There are only a few of us here,

189
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,993
but someone gets to rest
while the others have to work.

190
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,036
We were going to help you clean up.

191
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,413
Finished unpacking already?

192
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:36,375
No, there isn't enough space,
so I'll just get to it later.

193
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,211
And I could move out again
if things get better.

194
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,925
Why unpack at all
if you're moving back out?

195
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,679
Do what you want, Ki-baek.

196
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,307
There's food in the fridge,
so make sure you eat.

197
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,976
If you run out of toilet paper
or towels in the bathroom,

198
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,020
they're in the storage room…

199
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,064
They're in your room, in the closet.

200
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,903
-Let me carry it downstairs for you.
-No, you don't have to.

201
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,572
-It's just these boxes.
-Have lunch with your brother.

202
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,656
See you later, Mom.

203
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,700
-Yeah.
-Give it to me.

204
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,744
Un-baek.

205
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:15,164
Spiders don't have six hands.
They have eight legs.

206
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,167
See you, Dad.

207
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,586
Come home early.

208
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,587
See you.

209
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,758
-Six, you say?
-Give it a rest.

210
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,723
Man, it's so hot.

211
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,319
Whoa.

212
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,202
Who's hungry? I'm making ramyeon.

213
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,578
I have to go to the gym.

214
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,164
If I don't fix the toilet,
we can't open tomorrow.

215
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,333
Me. I'll have some.

216
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,377
What?

217
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,048
You can eat with him.

218
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,639
Please stay. Come on, please?

219
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,724
-For God's sake.
-It's going to be so awkward.

220
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,809
Ta-da!

221
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,186
Let's eat.

222
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,230
-It looks good.
-Right?

223
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,539
Hey, are you really planning
on staying here?

224
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,458
Why? You don't want me here?

225
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,668
It's uncomfortable.

226
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,505
I'm not comfortable here either.

227
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,632
Now that I'm here,

228
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,760
I'm constantly being confronted
with how crappy my life is.

229
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,603
I just don't have
any other choice right now.

230
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,693
Is that who we are?
People who make your life crappy?

231
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,404
This ramyeon is so good.

232
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,364
Isn't it good? Help yourself.

233
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,282
Hey, slow down.

234
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,370
Man, it's awesome.
I cooked it really well this time.

235
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,091
You've got to paddle, even if it means
using chopsticks when your paddles break.

236
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,019
No, thanks.
Hyeong-taek, what are we having for lunch?

237
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,437
Hamburgers.

238
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,360
Good God.

239
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,779
Care to join me for coffee?

240
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,873
You sure you're okay with this?

241
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,879
Of course. I got Kim Jeong-heon,
everyone's ideal son-in-law, on my show

242
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,506
without making any effort.

243
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,008
-I should thank you.
-It's good to be appreciated.

244
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,137
Now that we've got the main cast member,

245
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,640
things will move fast
with production and programming.

246
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,351
I'll sort out the details as well.

247
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,231
How have you been?

248
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,859
We haven't seen each other in eight years.

249
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,782
We dated and broke up
in the most ordinary and typical way.

250
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,033
That's all.

251
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,870
We're Jeong-heon and Woo-ju.
It couldn't have been ordinary or typical.

252
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,705
That's so hurtful.

253
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,794
I'm here to work.

254
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,755
You should do the same.
Stop joking around.

255
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,175
Well, you said you liked that I'm funny.

256
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,302
That's not your personality.

257
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,012
It's your well-crafted armor.

258
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,641
You're just trying to hide the fact
that you're only interested in yourself.

259
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,562
Woo-ju.

260
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,189
When I lied to you before--

261
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:14,194
Say one more word, and I'll destroy you.
I don't care who you think you are.

262
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,035
All right, well, let's take it slow.

263
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,415
I'm just happy
that we sat across each other today.

264
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,500
I look forward
to working with you, Ms. On.

265
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,512
Getting a job at another company…

266
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,389
I wouldn't be able to keep my mouth shut.

267
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,766
I can't get anyone else in trouble. Pass.

268
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,518
Emceeing events?

269
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,479
Right, who knows
what I might jabber about again?

270
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,231
Yeah, pass.

271
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,942
Teaching aspiring announcers?

272
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,405
I'd better not shatter
their hopes and dreams.

273
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,036
A reporter. That won't work either
if I can't stick to the script.

274
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,331
I should look for a remote job.

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,836
Man, what an incompetent
experienced worker I am.

276
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:22,387
Hey, you don't want to do anything,
but you wish you could do something?

277
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,015
Wow, that's hard to understand.

278
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,350
What does that mean?

279
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,312
Oh, did I say all that out loud again?

280
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,192
How come you're always alone?

281
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,444
Like at the bathhouse before,
and now here too.

282
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,365
I see.

283
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,826
Hey, are you good at riding a bike?

284
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,286
Can you teach me?

285
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,664
I can't be bothered.
Ask your dad to teach you.

286
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,957
I don't have a dad.

287
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,834
And my mom is busy.

288
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,381
My mom works at a TV station,
and she's really busy.

289
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,926
Grandma always says it's too dangerous.

290
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,720
I also taught myself how to ride a bike.

291
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,681
You're supposed to do it alone.

292
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,141
Look, see?
It only has one seat, doesn't it?

293
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,687
Okay, I'll do it alone.

294
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,730
Goodbye.

295
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,033
Riding a bike is so much fun!

296
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,119
Hey, you can let go now.

297
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,203
No, you'll fall.

298
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,413
Just let go!

299
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,957
-You'll hurt yourself if you fall.
-Just let go!

300
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,256
See? I told you you'd fall.

301
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,426
So? I can just get back up.

302
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,138
You're a total wimp.

303
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,772
I got it!

304
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,741
YOON JI-HU

305
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,493
Hey, what's up?

306
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,289
I'm not doing anything.
Just standing in the street.

307
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,540
Why?

308
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,876
I knew you had it in you, Woo-ju.

309
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,379
How did you get
Kim Jeong-heon just like that?

310
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,549
I-na, are you ready to move to
a bigger place that has more light,

311
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,595
is far away from the bathroom,
and doesn't smell like smoke?

312
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,430
Hey!

313
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,806
Hey, On Woo-ju!

314
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,851
Hey! You two, get out.

315
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,561
What?

316
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,731
-Beom, what are you--
-I need to talk to Woo-ju, so get out.

317
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,608
Is that not clear?

318
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,817
You can stay.

319
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,238
-What?
-I don't know what this is about.

320
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,158
But Min-gu and I-na are
also writers on my team.

321
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,037
Look, what's your deal
with Kim Jeong-heon?

322
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:52,954
Sorry?

323
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,333
Who does he think he is
to turn me down and treat me like crap?

324
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,045
Is he looking to get back at me
for refusing to cast him before?

325
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,339
-That's…
-You know what?

326
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,216
Maybe I should talk to Lee Ha-young.

327
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,093
I hear she's the actual head writer.

328
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,719
She even makes more money than you.

329
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:16,186
Yes, that's right. Do you need her number?

330
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,814
But I doubt talking to her
will make any difference.

331
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,608
Hey, have you lost your mind?

332
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,984
-Hey!
-Woof, woof!

333
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,278
Woof… What?

334
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,573
You sounded like a barking dog
with your bullshit, so I tried it too.

335
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,325
Bullshit?

336
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,202
You must be out of your mind.

337
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,870
-Are you insane?
-Beom.

338
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,169
I was wondering where you went
in the middle of the shoot.

339
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,546
Here you are.

340
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,427
Come on, what is this?

341
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,389
This is embarrassing for someone
who has it all like you.

342
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,807
Look, Jeong-heon.

343
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,934
You think you're some superstar?

344
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,146
How long do you think you'll last?

345
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,981
I don't know.

346
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,735
But probably longer than you.

347
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,156
Because I'm younger.

348
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,662
Man, you little…

349
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,170
What is going on here?

350
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:27,924
Beom came to talk to Woo-ju
about casting, and…

351
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,803
Let's go.
I invited you all to lunch today.

352
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,805
Count me out. I'm busy.

353
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,476
Come on, let's go.

354
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,396
We'll be working together,
and this will bring the team closer.

355
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,440
No, you guys go. I have tons to do.

356
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,317
-Oh, come on.
-I said no.

357
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,485
-You have to eat. Let's go.
-I'm not hungry.

358
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,237
My goodness.

359
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,947
Thank you, it was great.

360
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,618
The ideal son-in-law is here.

361
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,787
Although I couldn't cook you a chicken,
I picked the biggest,

362
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,750
juiciest octopuses
and cooked them up nice and spicy.

363
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,960
Right. Thank you, Mother.

364
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,921
Oh, my goodness!

365
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,797
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

366
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,424
-Thank you.
-Oh, my God.

367
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:13,178
Wow, this will hit the spot.
It's going to be our stress-buster.

368
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,721
Do you like spicy food?

369
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,015
It looks delicious.

370
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,892
I-na and Min-gu aren't joining us?

371
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,102
I gave them my credit card.
They'll be happier alone.

372
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,522
-Isn't it good?
-Wow, it's really hot.

373
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,275
Are you okay?

374
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,490
I told you we should have ox bone soup.
You can't even look at spicy food.

375
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:37,244
You said you were in a bad mood.
You could use some spice.

376
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,763
Moving forward,

377
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,141
I'd prefer if you let the production crew
handle the casting decisions.

378
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:04,562
It's true that having you on our show
is a great help,

379
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,066
but we're not your puppets.

380
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:14,030
Is that something you should bring up
in the middle of the meal?

381
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,865
Why not?

382
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,118
It's fine to talk about
things like this anytime,

383
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,286
you know, between us.

384
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:21,162
Yeah.

385
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,548
SWEET JEONG-HONEY SOJU

386
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,936
You're good at your job.

387
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,857
What are you getting at?

388
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,776
Nothing. It's about the way
you handled things earlier.

389
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:57,240
And I don't know how you did it,
but you snapped up Jeong-heon right away,

390
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,367
and he even knows
what kind of food you like.

391
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:04,122
I thought you might have some
special skills to win someone's heart.

392
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,875
Lee Ha-young, you're crossing a line here.

393
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,586
Come on, don't take it so seriously.

394
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,130
It's a compliment.
I'm saying I'm impressed.

395
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,637
Hey, hey, hey

396
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,182
THE 8TH HEALTHY HUNDRED FESTIVAL
MC KIM HYEOK-JIN

397
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:23,475
Yah, ah, ah, ah

398
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,977
That's why I dream every day

399
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,898
I thought we were here to see Hyeok-jin.
He's a news anchor, so why are we here?

400
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:30,815
What?

401
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,443
Well.

402
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,695
-Hey, you want to grab a seat?
-All right.

403
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:40,200
Wow, that was so adorable.

404
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,328
Watch your step. Wow, all right.

405
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,539
So, did you guys enjoy
our little ones' show?

406
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:47,624
-Yes!
-Yes!

407
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,459
-Let's give them a hand!
-Hyeok-jin?

408
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,547
Ma'am, you look like
you're having a blast.

409
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,050
You'll hurt your knees.
Take it easy, all right?

410
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,929
Sit back and let your dear boy Hyeok-jin
entertain you, okay?

411
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:04,224
I'm Kim Hyeok-jin.
Thank you for watching JBC News at Noon.

412
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,267
Thank you.

413
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,773
That's a wrap.
That was Mr. Kim Hyeok-jin's final show.

414
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,443
-Great work!
-Great job!

415
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,529
You've done amazing work.

416
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:18,655
Great work.

417
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:22,158
You'll be doing nothing but news shows
over there at ITN, Mr. Anchorman.

418
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,536
Let's all have a meal sometime.

419
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,454
-I'd love that.
-Of course. Thank you.

420
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,622
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

421
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,915
Sure.

422
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,708
Great work, Hyeok-jin.

423
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,880
When I'm gone,
you should take over this show, Ki-baek.

424
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,466
I want to do nothing but news shows
just like you.

425
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,051
I'm a fan of yours.

426
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,639
I'm sure you'll do a better job.

427
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,272
I talked to him a few days ago.

428
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,816
When I told him you quit,
he said he wanted to see you.

429
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,777
You know how much he cared about you.
He's just been busy.

430
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,530
Who is that guy?

431
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,242
I'd rather see the trot singer boy again.

432
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:09,706
I saw somewhere earlier that
he's a "fring" announcer or something.

433
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,416
"Fufuring"?

434
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,126
"Fufurang"?

435
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,461
A freelance announcer.

436
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,256
Hyeok-jin!

437
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,722
You're my adorable honey bunny

438
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,223
-Looks great.
-Good to see you.

439
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,308
You too.

440
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,810
So, are you enjoying your freelance life?

441
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,272
You host some events like this

442
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,316
and some TV shows, right?

443
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,903
God, this is good.
Hey, are you kidding me?

444
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,322
Anyone with a mouth
can be a show host now.

445
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,990
I feel like just another worker ant.

446
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,784
To survive winter when jobs are scarce,

447
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,536
I have to kiss my dignity goodbye
the rest of the year.

448
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,706
I've seen lots of people hit it big
after going freelance.

449
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,168
You'd better start that story
with "Once upon a time."

450
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,462
Things aren't like how they used to be.

451
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,548
Freelancing sounds glamorous,
but we're all hustling to get by.

452
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,134
The competition out here
is on a whole other level.

453
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,763
Actors, comedians, models, sports stars.

454
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,474
I constantly get knocked around
competing with those guys.

455
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,309
So why do you live like this?

456
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,104
I'm sorry?

457
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,525
What's with Ki-baek today?

458
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:21,611
Get it together.

459
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,822
I heard you quit your job.

460
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,494
Throw your shoulders back and keep
your voice at… do, re, mi, fa, sol, sol.

461
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:31,663
Hello.

462
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,331
Keep it higher than that, okay?

463
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,458
It's not easy to survive in this field.

464
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,336
Take a photo with me.

465
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,798
-Goodness. Sure thing.
-All right.

466
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,925
So, do you remember my name?

467
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,343
Just take it.

468
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,971
I'm going to show it to my grandson.

469
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:52,517
-You're quite the wordsmith.
-Goodness, thank you so much.

470
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,395
Hey, look. You should tell that to them.

471
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,105
-See that tent?
-Yeah.

472
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,899
You'll find Chief Kim
from the district office there.

473
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,485
Go tell him to hire me again next time.

474
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,404
-All right.
-Promise?

475
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,322
-Yes.
-All right, good.

476
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,032
-Look over here.
-Yeah.

477
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,367
All right.

478
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,494
-Take care then.
-All right.

479
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,662
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

480
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,123
-I'm going to show this to my grandson.
-All right.

481
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,712
Let's see.

482
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,509
Here.

483
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,136
What is this?

484
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,137
Pocket money.

485
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,308
I don't want this.

486
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,896
Come on, man.

487
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,523
Look, I know how it is. I've been there.

488
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,985
Here. Take it.

489
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,695
All right.

490
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:49,240
People say this sells
like hot cakes at the market.

491
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,785
Take it. It's a gift for my longtime fan.

492
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,085
I'm not your fan anymore.

493
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:02,921
What's that?

494
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,757
What's wrong with him today?

495
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:06,025
We see each other often
now that we're in the same neighborhood.

496
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,404
We live under the same roof, to be exact.

497
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,002
That was a close call.

498
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,045
All right. You can let go now.

499
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:24,228
Was it like witnessing the downfall
of a man who used to be your role model?

500
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:27,523
I thought it was
something like that until…

501
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,736
-Until?
-Until I saw the look on his face.

502
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,364
He didn't look like
someone who had fallen.

503
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:41,204
Should he be moping around just because
he's not on the news anymore?

504
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,372
Every morning, you wake up to a new day.

505
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,917
Who knows what life's got up its sleeve?

506
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,211
Don't be a wimp.

507
00:34:56,135 --> 00:35:00,098
I keep hoping for a new day to come,
but it never seems to happen.

508
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,601
-Can I tell you a cliché?
-Wait.

509
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:07,188
If it's about darkness before sunrise,
I appreciate the gesture, but I'll pass.

510
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,398
I wasn't going to make any gestures.

511
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,985
When you're feeling down
and have a lot on your mind,

512
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,154
it helps to get some spicy food.

513
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,366
When life throws too much spice at you,
don't back down.

514
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,326
You should be

515
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,494
just as spicy.

516
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:26,833
It's like,
"Cheer yourself up when things get hard."

517
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,337
I'm sharing my first meal of the day
with you, so enjoy.

518
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,512
This is your first meal today?

519
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,431
I've been busy.

520
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:49,063
Before I quit my job, when I didn't feel
like eating and had no energy to,

521
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,275
my go-to excuse was that I was too busy.

522
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,487
Were you busy today?

523
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:22,972
"Let's keep going. Just do something."

524
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,600
"Give it a try,
and if it doesn't work, try again."

525
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,519
I keep telling myself that, but…

526
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:33,941
These days, I'm busy getting humiliated
every second of the day.

527
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,406
Spicy food, huh?

528
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,952
Damn it.

529
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,037
Oh, no.

530
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,748
Come on, not on a white T-shirt.

531
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:49,749
Hang on.

532
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,587
Oh, that's-- I'll do it.

533
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,714
I'll do it.

534
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,136
Huh? No, I'll…

535
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:11,687
I'll do it.

536
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,402
Get it out quickly.

537
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,035
Is this yours, Ki-baek?

538
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:28,037
Did I drop this too?

539
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,706
Jesus.

540
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,795
Damn.

541
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:40,049
I haven't seen someone
with a notebook in a long time.

542
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,802
I used to carry around
an idea notebook too.

543
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,680
Oh, I found it
when I was unpacking my stuff today.

544
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,056
I didn't even know I had it.

545
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,231
You can have it.

546
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,692
-What?
-Scratch that. You can borrow it.

547
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,821
-Wait, why are you--
-Just because.

548
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,573
When life seemed boring, predictable
and pathetic,

549
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,701
I used to read that.

550
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,662
You can borrow it.

551
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,064
Ki-baek.

552
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,818
You feel completely lost,
like you don't know what to do next

553
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,654
or even who the hell you are, right?

554
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,241
But Ki-baek.

555
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,161
You'll do a better job.

556
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,288
I'm sure you'll do a better job.

557
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,269
Hello!

558
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,188
Hello!

559
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,648
Hi, how are you?

560
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,985
I brought you some snacks.

561
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,822
What's he doing here again?

562
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:27,990
Goodness gracious.

563
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,909
-Oh, what the heck?
-This place here.

564
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:32,536
Isn't it the most beautiful island
in the country?

565
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,164
I know it, you know it,

566
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,999
everybody in the world knows it.

567
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,795
So please let me do this, okay?

568
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,714
I don't care if it's for TV.
No cameras. Leave us alone.

569
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:49,637
Boy, you're so impatient.
Just hold on a sec and hear me out.

570
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,106
In that case, I'd be open to negotiating.

571
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,567
I'll draw up
the location rental fees on paper.

572
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,320
Oh, we want a new heating system
at the village hall.

573
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,655
Can you make it happen?

574
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,616
One of our potential sponsors
is a heating manufacturer.

575
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,951
We'll make it happen.

576
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:15,913
Goodness gracious.

577
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,707
You wore me down, missy.

578
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,420
While you're here, feel free to pick
all the chilies from this row.

579
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,923
-Min-gu.
-Yeah?

580
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,091
Hey, get it ready.

581
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,135
Come have some snacks.

582
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,222
Hi, Mom.

583
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,306
You mean girl.

584
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,934
Your mom stays out overnight
for the first time in decades,

585
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,477
and you didn't even call?

586
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:43,524
I was just about to call you.
It's like we can read each other's minds--

587
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,234
Forget it, silly.

588
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,780
Get yourself home early.
Don't stay out late drinking, okay?

589
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,532
Drinking? No, I'm working.

590
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,617
I'm not worried about you.

591
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,120
You might put
other people in danger, dear.

592
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:58,914
What?

593
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,637
MY DAUGHTER

594
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,183
Hello? Mom? Mom.

595
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,267
Mom.

596
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,285
I'm fine.
You know it's bothered me for years.

597
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:38,245
It'll be okay if I rest for a bit.

598
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,498
That's the problem. That it's been years.

599
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:44,960
Until this day, just seeing a motorcycle
pass by gives me a sinking feeling.

600
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,962
It doesn't hurt anymore.

601
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,175
You're supposed to be the breadwinner,
but now I handle everything.

602
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,384
Hope you're happy.

603
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:58,140
How come my life never gets any easier?

604
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,896
From this month, Ki-baek won't be able
to give us any money.

605
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:12,238
Oh, hey. Your brothers went
to hand out flyers for Un-baek's gym.

606
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,865
You should eat.
I made some nice kimchi soup.

607
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,492
Go on and eat.

608
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,123
By the way, why is it cold in here?

609
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,380
No.

610
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,549
Eighteen degrees?

611
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,843
Stop!

612
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,012
Who was it? Who did this?

613
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:43,185
Didn't we agree to keep the utility bills
under 50,000 won each month

614
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,272
as a show of cooperation, sacrifice,
and love for each other?

615
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,149
It's gotten really hot lately though.

616
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,442
Okay, then.

617
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,112
-Was it you?
-No!

618
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,613
Son.

619
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,617
Was it you?

620
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,870
No!

621
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,248
Oh, it wasn't me.

622
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,292
It really wasn't me.

623
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,586
And Mom, I'm not hungry.

624
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,014
I can lie again now? Why?

625
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,351
When did the switch turn off?

626
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,656
On Woo-ju.

627
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,451
What is she?

628
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,510
Hello? This is Song Ki-baek.

629
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,097
Oh, Yoon Ji-hu recommended me?

630
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,309
Oh, sure. He told me about it.

631
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,144
I see.

632
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,689
But I don't think I can do it though.

633
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,982
You'll pay me double?

634
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,651
Well…

635
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,529
But for some personal reasons, I--

636
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,989
Quadruple?

637
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:24,662
I do have some personal issues,
but I'll sort things out.

638
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,663
Yes, I'll do it.

639
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,248
Yes, thank you for calling.

640
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,834
Thank you. Goodbye. Yes, thank you.

641
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:39,009
I do really need this,
but will I be able to do it though?

642
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,595
But they said quadruple.

643
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:50,562
It's all done. I should wash these now.

644
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,523
Family Outing is ancient history.

645
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,233
Now that they've got Jeong-heon,

646
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:57,820
the director and writer are
just set on enjoying an easy ride.

647
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,407
It's more like they've got
an easy theme and a good cast.

648
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,953
When I got the call, I assumed
that you'd be the head writer for sure.

649
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,996
There you go again, laying it on thick.

650
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,167
Honestly, I don't know if this will work.
It's such a cliché.

651
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,086
-Woo-ju.
-Oh, hey.

652
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,463
They told us to hurry.
We've got a lot to do.

653
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,424
Yeah, okay.

654
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,677
Can you not sneak up on people like that?

655
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,678
Right.

656
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,305
Listen, Ha-young.

657
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,308
I need you to send me
the pictures of the locations by tonight.

658
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:31,562
I should just wash them over there.

659
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,522
Hey, Min-gu. Turn on the water.

660
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,857
-Okay.
-Hey.

661
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,526
Let me do that. Here you go.

662
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,320
The sieve-- Shoot, I forgot to bring it.

663
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,743
You have to give speech lessons to a kid.
It's easy.

664
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,163
Good luck.
I wouldn't have recommended anyone else.

665
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,915
Get it together.

666
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,960
Song Ki-baek, bite your tongue

667
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,045
If you can't
Look at the ceiling, distract yourself

668
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,089
Cry if you're about to curse
Think of the money

669
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,632
Run away if it all goes south

670
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,723
What is the power of words?

671
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:11,185
How can being a good speaker
change your future?

672
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,729
How do you improve your speech?

673
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:16,607
The power of words is truly amazing,
so being able

674
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,444
to speak effectively can make
a significant difference in your future.

675
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,612
IDIOT

676
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,874
Brian.

677
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,170
Brian.

678
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,007
Wow, you managed to hold it in.

679
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,646
My family is rich, just like Iron Man.

680
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:03,946
Look, Brian.

681
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,740
Look. Wait, Brian.
Let's take a seat, shall we?

682
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,033
Sit down.

683
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,994
Gross.

684
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:15,999
My mom's yoga instructor is here,
so she won't be coming in here.

685
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,463
Huh? What do you…

686
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,980
I found it.

687
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,069
It's important. Where are you?

688
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,612
Where?

689
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:57,749
I've told you many times to make
an appointment at the hospital.

690
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,919
I'm on vacation right now.

691
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,006
I'm in the middle of my temple stay.

692
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,507
I found the switch.

693
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,928
-The switch?
-It's sneezing.

694
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,431
When I sneeze, I get out of control.

695
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,058
I turn into an unstoppably honest person.
I'm sure of it.

696
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,560
Sneeze for me.

697
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,645
I just did. The switch is on.

698
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,689
So turn off the switch and sneeze again.

699
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:23,191
I don't know how to turn it off.

700
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,526
That's why I'm here.

701
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:29,323
Well, I can't help you
until I see it turn on, can I?

702
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,918
The silence must run deep

703
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,463
for the scenery to speak.

704
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,424
The switch.

705
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:55,474
I think it may be an opportunity
to turn your life around.

706
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,059
The switch, I mean.

707
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,226
The switch.

708
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,111
Do you think we're going to be okay?

709
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,656
Everyone's whispering
behind our backs, even the crew.

710
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:14,618
I'm sure Woo-ju is well aware
that our show is about to sink.

711
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,287
I don't know anymore.

712
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,998
We could be
out of a job before we know it.

713
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,208
What are we going to do?

714
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,587
I have to make payments for
another ten months for my washing machine.

715
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,674
We don't have any choice
but to trust Woo-ju, but…

716
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,010
Honestly, lately Woo-ju seems--

717
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,470
You're worried, right?

718
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,974
Worried about what?

719
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,101
She's On Woo-ju.

720
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:43,146
She's going to figure out a way somehow.
She never does things by halves.

721
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,774
Hey.

722
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,988
Just have some faith in Woo-ju
or what I say about her.

723
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:55,242
You have nothing to worry about
as long as you work with Woo-ju.

724
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,161
Bye.

725
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,080
Okay, bye.

726
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,626
We'll be all right. Let's go.

727
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:09,840
WE LIVE TOGETHER
MAIN HOST

728
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,640
That's not enough.

729
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,227
Is there anything fun we can do?

730
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:27,315
I, too, want to do something original
that no one has ever seen, you know.

731
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,831
SONG KI-BAEK

732
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,169
FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE

733
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,920
PREPARE NOW
TO ACT INSTINCTIVELY ON TEST DAY

734
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,214
What is this? A collection of wise words?

735
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,931
"When in a tight spot,
birds peck at anything,

736
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:05,437
animals harm humans,
and humans resort to lies."

737
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:07,939
Got it.

738
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,692
In that case, I'll just lie.

739
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,870
The tragedy of everything that happens
from the moment you wake up

740
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:25,290
to the moment you fall asleep
being calculated, in terms of cost,

741
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,501
is incalculable.

742
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:30,962
JBC APPLICANT

743
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:35,008
When you don't know what to do,
find something you'd never do.

744
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,594
It actually sets you free.

745
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,938
Okay, I think I got it too.

746
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,817
Song Ki-baek.

747
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:06,665
Think carefully about what happened
on the day of the accident.

748
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,292
The moments when you sneezed,
for instance.

749
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:14,798
Something powerful that might have been
etched into your brain.

750
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,476
Are you all right?

751
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,438
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

752
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,316
Ki-Baek.

753
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,068
Wait, it's weird.

754
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,445
Protect your heart.

755
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,120
On Woo-ju.

756
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,124
WRITER ON WOO-JU

757
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,168
Damn it.

758
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,648
This is driving me crazy.
Why is his phone off?

759
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,609
Oh, look who it is.

760
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,652
-Tired?
-Can I have some water?

761
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,613
-See you.
-Okay, bye.

762
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,614
See you tomorrow.

763
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,269
Stay calm, okay?

764
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:52,479
Stay calm.

765
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,640
-Where were you?
-Where were you?

766
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,892
-This is it.
-Ki-baek, do you cook?

767
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,103
-No. Ms. On, it was you.
-Can you sing?

768
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,313
Yeah, pretty well.
Listen, I found the switch.

769
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,399
-Can you dance too?
-I danced in college.

770
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,567
Stop asking these stupid questions
and listen.

771
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:43,279
Something you can't and don't want to do.
I think you and I can do it together.

772
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,906
This isn't the time to comfort me.

773
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,909
Are you going to keep sitting around
doing nothing like a fool?

774
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,750
It's not like I want to do that.

775
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,391
What I meant was--

776
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,810
It's not like I want to
sit around doing nothing.

777
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:15,645
I know that. What I'm saying is--

778
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,188
But what can I do right now?

779
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:21,443
All I ever knew was how to report
the news, but I've ditched that.

780
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,320
I've got no money, no home,
and no relevant experience.

781
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,739
What's left for me to do?

782
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,867
You have no idea
how miserable and hopeless I am.

783
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,202
That's not what I was saying.

784
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,370
Besides,

785
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:36,916
you can't be as miserable and hopeless
as I am, so stop and listen--

786
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,919
You're miserable and hopeless?

787
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,839
You're just insulting someone
who's actually miserable.

788
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,467
You want to talk about being miserable?

789
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,636
My junior writer is bossing me around
and has a bigger paycheck,

790
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,056
and everyone is whispering
that I've lost my touch,

791
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,099
and that I'm washed up
and have no authority.

792
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,144
I'm hanging on by a thread,
but I keep making a fool of myself.

793
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,480
Have you been electrocuted?

794
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,607
Do you know what it's like
to have your mouth

795
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,817
keep running like a busted faucet?

796
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,453
That's what true misery is like, okay?

797
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,498
Like someone just smacks you,
making your eyes pop out.

798
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,500
You can't see, and you're bleeding.

799
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,878
Do you know what it's like
to have your ex suddenly show up

800
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:24,964
and you have to do what he says
because your job is in his hands?

801
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,592
Or how it feels to force a smile
when you're dying inside?

802
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,095
-Well, I don't!
-Then shut up about it!

803
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,544
The switch is turned off.

804
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,967
I can only turn it on again
after turning it off first.

805
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,817
Listen. Let's give this a shot.

806
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,011
Here we go.

807
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,055
All right, careful.

808
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,474
HEAVEN HOUSE

809
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:46,814
Gather around.

810
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,066
All right.

811
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,860
From 10 to 11 a.m.,
you guys can have your breakfast.

812
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:51,819
Oh, hello.

813
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,246
See you later.

814
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:09,897
FRANKLY SPEAKING

815
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:12,233
Reality dating show.

816
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:15,278
I'm sure they'll love
the real you, Ki-baek.

817
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,572
I'm here to find a love
that's like a miracle.

818
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:19,657
Like a miracle! You know.

819
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,200
I think you're really cool.

820
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,912
Kim Jeong-heon against ordinary men?
He's going to make you look like fools.

821
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,749
There's something about being
at the shoot.

822
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:28,958
Reminds me of the old days.

823
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,503
I don't want you to think
about the old days.

824
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,964
Who do you like the most, Ki-baek?

825
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,384
I'm upset.

826
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,138
I'm really upset with you, Ms. On.

827
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:48,478
