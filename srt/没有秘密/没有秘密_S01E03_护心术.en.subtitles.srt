1
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,801
FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:58,850
-Toady, toady, I'll give you an old house
-Toady, toady, I'll give you an old house

3
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,603
-Give me a new house
-Give me a new house

4
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:06,816
Toady, toady, I'll give you an old house

5
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,865
We will build you a house

6
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,158
Mom.

7
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,328
It's raining.

8
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,372
-What? Is it?
-Let's go home.

9
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,834
Those scary men must've left by now.

10
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,546
Ki-baek, how about we sing the song
just two more times?

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,217
Dad will come and get us once they leave.

12
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,887
I'm a blue belt.

13
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,640
If you get scared, I can protect you.

14
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,270
No. If you see those scary men again,
pretend you don't know them.

15
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:48,233
If you ever run into them,
just tell them you do not know me or Dad.

16
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,319
But lying is bad.

17
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,702
Lying isn't always bad, Ki-baek.

18
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:05,416
If you have to lie to protect me
and your brother, it's not bad.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,418
You're a big brother, Ki-baek.

20
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,796
You can do that, right?

21
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,383
Yes!

22
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,345
At first, it started with a white lie.

23
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,223
My parents are very busy, so I don't think

24
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,559
they can attend
the parent-teacher conference.

25
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,352
It wasn't even about anything big.

26
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,104
Your mom called.

27
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,232
She told me she and your dad work
in the countryside.

28
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,900
She was very worried.

29
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:36,072
I told her to put her worries to rest
because you're so good at everything.

30
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,575
From your tuition fees
to your lunch money,

31
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,577
there are ways to get practical help…

32
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,080
Jesus, that was
a long-ass counseling session.

33
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,541
Hey, top student.
What is this, special treatment?

34
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,001
Let's go.

35
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,503
By the way, Ki-baek,
is it true your tutor tells you

36
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,880
what to expect on every test?

37
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,923
This punk will never tell you.

38
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,592
I think he also goes
to a cram school in secret.

39
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,138
I either didn't correct
people's false assumptions about me…

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,016
Hey, newbie.

41
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,810
Where do you live?

42
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,229
I live in this area.

43
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,773
You do? Where?

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,026
Over there.

45
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,446
Nice. Do you live with your parents?

46
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,949
No, my parents have their own place.

47
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,743
Where do they live? Gangnam?

48
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,203
I knew it.

49
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,040
I thought you looked like you came
from money, you know?

50
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,625
Nice.

51
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,003
I just gave people
the answer they wanted to hear.

52
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,963
-Bye.
-Did you go to school in this area?

53
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,528
Are you heading out?

54
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,698
I bought another bed.
Stop being stubborn and just use it.

55
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:05,912
I'm already so grateful that you let me
crash here from time to time.

56
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,873
I'll take care
of this month's maintenance fees then.

57
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:12,168
The maintenance fees here are
way more than your monthly salary.

58
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:17,215
Just look after my car and this place
when I have to work abroad, okay?

59
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:25,723
You're hosting the news next week.
You need to look dashing.

60
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,017
This is a bit much.
I'm still new, you know.

61
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,229
You should wear expensive clothes
so you can have it easier at work.

62
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,398
The office is like a battlefield.

63
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,109
Wear good armor,
and no one will dare to mess with you.

64
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,944
Everyone will want to be your friend.

65
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,113
Call it the art
of protecting yourself, socially.

66
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,031
All right?

67
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,953
Swallowing what you want to say
and saying what others want to hear.

68
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,792
I mean, that's not a bad lie, right?

69
00:04:54,168 --> 00:05:01,009
THE ART OF PROTECTING YOURSELF

70
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,679
EPISODE 3:
THE ART OF PROTECTING YOUR HEART

71
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,097
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

72
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,891
Ki-baek!

73
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,943
What just happened? Am I hurt?

74
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,029
Am I alive right now? What is this?

75
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:26,034
Ms. On! Are you all right? Are you hurt?

76
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,202
Are you alive? I mean, are you okay?

77
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:32,081
I said it was dangerous.
I told you to stay away. We nearly died!

78
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,125
Have you gone totally insane?

79
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,501
What did you say?

80
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,296
-Have you gone totally insane? Get a grip!
-What?

81
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,797
You can't seem to snap out of it.

82
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,884
Whenever I see you like this, I feel bad
because I feel like it's my fault.

83
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,011
God, why are you being like this?

84
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,307
Well, I mean…

85
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,935
Why did you try to jump into the water?

86
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,522
I had no intention of jumping, whatsoever.

87
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:01,611
That's why I said it was dangerous
and told you to stay away, numerous times.

88
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,613
Because of you, we both slipped and fell!

89
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,406
We nearly died!

90
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,409
Also, you asked me if I'd gone insane.

91
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,286
What I have is called disinhibition.

92
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,206
It means I can't control
my emotions or actions.

93
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,875
I'm sick! That is what the doctor said!

94
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,753
Is it very serious?

95
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,298
Do they have to open your skull?

96
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,927
My head is about to split in half
because of you. Do you hear me?

97
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,261
-What?
-Fine.

98
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,680
If it's difficult for you
to pretend not to know me

99
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,934
because of your personality,
let's just be total strangers.

100
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,895
Don't follow me. Really, don't.

101
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,022
Seriously.

102
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,862
What a freak.

103
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,122
Where is he?

104
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,415
My phone got all wet
and isn't even working now.

105
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,626
God, Yoon Ji-hu.

106
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,092
What is this? What a mess.

107
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,219
Seriously, what is this?

108
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,140
But I saved someone's life…

109
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,934
Whatever.

110
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,773
This is nuts.
My car seats will get all ruined.

111
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,984
Damn it.

112
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,155
Huh?

113
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,661
What?

114
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,163
What now?

115
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,874
The car's gone.

116
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,668
The guy I came with
vanished without a trace.

117
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,255
Okay, so?

118
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,549
Well, practically everyone
in the country knows me,

119
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,343
thanks to the unsavory incident
that happened recently,

120
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,180
so I cannot use public transit.

121
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,766
What are you, a top-tier celebrity?

122
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,811
So?

123
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,230
Give me a ride.

124
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,692
You know it's absurd, right?
The two of us and this situation.

125
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,653
Let me get a ride, please.

126
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,158
Fine, get in.

127
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,828
Wait!

128
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,623
It's brand-new. I haven't even made
my first payment yet.

129
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,250
Are you going to push the car
down the road instead of driving?

130
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:25,004
Well, I would if I could, but I can't…

131
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,006
That's right.

132
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:35,806
Korean wrestling.

133
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,308
What?

134
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,560
I mean, I'm good at it.

135
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,896
This won't do.

136
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,482
Oh, yes. This will work.

137
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,902
I can't wear this.

138
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,362
Right, you can't wear this.

139
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,696
That won't even fit.

140
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,658
I've got something for you.
I have something you can wear.

141
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,758
MEN ON THE RUN

142
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,597
I thought you guys only played ball games
on Men on the Run.

143
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,183
Well, we played all sorts of games
in the early days.

144
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,439
Why do the youngsters
these days like cropped tops so much?

145
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,524
Isn't it uncomfortable?

146
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,112
Let's wear our own clothes.
I'll pay for you to wash your car.

147
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,991
They're soaked in salt water.
It won't wash out.

148
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,951
Just find your own way back then.

149
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,996
What kind of psycho
walks around like this?

150
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,080
FULL OF LOVE

151
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,708
Do you know what I had to go through
to find this costume?

152
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,334
Here, have some water.

153
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,794
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

154
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,715
Isn't it about time
you took off that spandex suit?

155
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,383
You're supposed to be
the ideal son-in-law.

156
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:55,678
What put me on the map when I was trying
to decide between music or variety TV?

157
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,765
This saved me from nearly ruining myself
while trying to keep up with Young-woong.

158
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,183
-Do I look cute?
-Sure do.

159
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,936
Are you going to take on
Director Jang's new show on GBS?

160
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,938
-Nope.
-What about the MBS pilot?

161
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,148
No, I won't do it.

162
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,361
I see you're busy posting photos
of yourself in that spandex suit.

163
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,447
Oh, "On Woo-ju, JBC"?

164
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,574
"On Woo-ju"? You mean the writer?

165
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:20,077
Is she doing a JBC show?
Did they confirm a time slot for it?

166
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,912
They will if I do the show.

167
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,916
You're expressing your interest in a show
that hasn't even been confirmed yet?

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,835
-I need to put this wig on you.
-Okay.

169
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,796
Just wait. I'll explain
what's going on once I know for sure.

170
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,344
Ms. On, are you all right?

171
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,514
Your face looks pale.
It looks blue, actually.

172
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,724
I'm fine.

173
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,770
Hang in there. There's no traffic,
so we'll get home in no time.

174
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:51,317
Anyway, why did you go up there?
I don't think you were trying to drown.

175
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,153
Just because.

176
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,950
Normally, I never do things for no reason.

177
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:03,537
But these days, I can't help it.

178
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:08,209
I remember thinking to myself,
"I want to look down at the ocean."

179
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,629
The next thing I knew,
I was already climbing the rocks.

180
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,469
Ms. On, are you really okay?

181
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,553
I'm fine.

182
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,515
I don't have indemnity insurance.
I can't get into an accident.

183
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,477
Let's pull over onto the shoulder.

184
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,605
Yes, right here. Slow down.
That's it. Careful.

185
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,776
I'm really okay.

186
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,821
Do you accumulate points
for repeatedly saying that you're okay?

187
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,574
You keep saying you're okay
when it's obvious that you're not.

188
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,285
But you keep saying, "I'm not okay,"
I mean, "I'm okay"?

189
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,622
Huh? Ms. On.

190
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,792
Ms. On Woo-ju?

191
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,544
What?

192
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,711
Hey…

193
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,422
Ms. On Woo-ju. Hey…

194
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,390
Help! Over here!

195
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,016
We need help!

196
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,977
Sir, open your eyes.

197
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,230
-What happened?
-He suddenly collapsed while on a trip.

198
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,362
Man, she clearly isn't okay.

199
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,532
Excuse me.

200
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:25,453
-My little brother is…
-Hold on. One moment.

201
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,997
Are you all right?

202
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,410
Oh, you woke up.

203
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,288
What's with the blanket and the mask?

204
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,916
I don't want anyone to recognize me.

205
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,337
Anyway, who's that boy?

206
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,796
I don't know.

207
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,049
Hey, worry about yourself first.

208
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,510
I'm okay.

209
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,429
Help!

210
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,473
He's not breathing.

211
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,600
Help!

212
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,436
Please save him.

213
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,980
Hey, kid. Are you all right?

214
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,657
They told me to wait until Mom gets here,

215
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,284
but my brother is sick.

216
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,627
Once upon a time, a famous man
named Confucius said this.

217
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,257
"When in need, birds can peck the grain,
dogs can bite people

218
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,136
and people can lie."

219
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,015
-Pardon me?
-What do you think you should do

220
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,059
to grab people's attention?

221
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,895
You saw that earlier.

222
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,193
Oh, boy.

223
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,784
You had temporary hypothermia.

224
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,370
We brought your temperature
back up to the normal range.

225
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,622
You can go home once the drip is finished.

226
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,499
Thank you.

227
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,967
I really am okay now.
You can go. Get going.

228
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,512
Hey, you need to lie down.

229
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,308
Wait until the drip is finished.

230
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,894
My goodness.

231
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,737
Wow, nice place.

232
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:09,867
It's your fault that this happened,
so I won't thank you for the ride.

233
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,369
Can you drive yourself home?

234
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,538
Oh, sure.

235
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,209
You can go.

236
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,260
You had hypothermia
and had to go to the emergency room.

237
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,804
Do you not eat? What are you, a kid?

238
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,057
You're as light as a feather.

239
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,892
Cover your stomach. It's cold.

240
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,646
I'm off.

241
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,689
Wait, Mr. Song Ki-baek.

242
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,151
Thanks for your help earlier.

243
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,966
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK'S
FIRST NEWS SEGMENT

244
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,312
The system will undergo a total makeover
to allow children's meal tickets

245
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,481
to be used at any eatery.

246
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:26,193
Currently, children's meal tickets can
only be used at registered eateries,

247
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:30,447
which are mainly limited
to convenience stores.

248
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,951
The City of Gyeongmun has announced
that the tickets can be used

249
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:38,789
at any place that accepts credit cards
once the change takes effect.

250
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,250
The tickets are issued
for children under the age of 18

251
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,127
who are likely to be food insecure.

252
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,462
Inflation will be taken
into consideration in…

253
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:05,107
Sweetie pie, have you got a girlfriend?

254
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,110
Her name is…

255
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,780
I can hear it.

256
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,866
Su…

257
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,118
A?

258
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,580
SU-A, GU-WON

259
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,500
You see, I know everything.

260
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,299
I pray my mom will never have
to work late again.

261
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,260
I'm home.

262
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,179
You're home.

263
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,598
-Did you have dinner?
-I'm not hungry.

264
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,605
-You need to give him a proper meal.
-You look a mess.

265
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,273
What's that? A wrestler's belt?

266
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,233
Oh, this is the latest trend.

267
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,071
I told you not to teach him these things.

268
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,865
Grandma Bok-ja knows everything.
She really does.

269
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,453
The two of you will ruin everything.

270
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,123
-What?
-The tower's on fire,

271
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,917
and it's been struck by lightning. Whoa.

272
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,631
I'm going to wash up.

273
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,264
WOO-JU THE PRETTY WRITER

274
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,027
Man…

275
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,496
Get going.

276
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,622
Hey,

277
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,125
you need to lie down.

278
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,835
Wait until the drip is finished.

279
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,048
You had hypothermia
and had to go to the emergency room.

280
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,467
Cover your stomach. It's cold.

281
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,409
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
It's Monday, May 15,

282
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,286
and welcome to JBC Morning News.

283
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:26,707
The sinkhole that occurred in Ilyeon-dong,
Seonggok-gu last weekend was caused by

284
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,420
the wastewater
in the sewer pipes in the area.

285
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,927
BOSIN BATHHOUSE

286
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,785
The Korea Motorsport Race
will take place on the 25th to the 26th…

287
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,040
Even taking pictures…

288
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,128
GIVING A LIFE-CHANGING SPEECH
BEGINNER'S CHINESE

289
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,005
I sincerely promise you

290
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,799
that I'll only report the truth
and never lie to you.

291
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,301
For JBC News…

292
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,636
This is Song Ki-baek.

293
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,809
God, what am I going to do now?

294
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,146
What are you talking about?
We have so many things to do.

295
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,566
Just get them together in one place,
and we'll have tons of things to do.

296
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,152
"We Live Together."
This will work, I'm telling you.

297
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,445
But the thing is--

298
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,447
Think young people prefer to live alone?

299
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,950
Kids these days are lonely
and want to be around people.

300
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,826
That emotional ambivalence…

301
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,955
-We'll satisfy their conflicting needs.
-Hey, emotional what?

302
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,414
Be quiet.

303
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,167
-I get that, but--
-It's okay if it feels familiar.

304
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,337
If the setting and cast are different,
we can craft fresh stories.

305
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,880
Hey, Ms. On.

306
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,384
What did the chief say?

307
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,014
Don't add or take out anything.

308
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,557
Tell me verbatim.

309
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:13,772
"It's outdated. She's lost her touch.
No one will want to be on the show."

310
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,610
Me?

311
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,074
Shake, shake, shaking my head.
I'm hopping mad.

312
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,450
Shall I go ballistic on her?

313
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,829
-What?
-It's "Shake, shake, I'm so mad.

314
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,622
Do you have a death wish?"

315
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,873
Be quiet, okay?

316
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:35,585
It's what youngsters say these days.
You need to learn these things.

317
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,261
It feels so damp in here.

318
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,138
What are they, moles?

319
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:55,939
Anyway, speaking of which,
we're understaffed and--

320
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,192
Bonjour!

321
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,571
Hello.

322
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,160
My goodness, Ha-young is here.

323
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,041
I thought we were meeting tomorrow.

324
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,168
-You came a day early.
-Yeah.

325
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,880
It's been a while.

326
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,341
Yes. Hi.

327
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,806
You're my adorable honey bunny

328
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,976
I'm your raccoon

329
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,312
I'm Na Yu-jeong, your beauty manager.

330
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:36,605
Here, take one.

331
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,316
I do house calls too.

332
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,860
Give me a call.
They're skincare products. The best!

333
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,570
Give me a call.

334
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:46,114
You rock, lady. Stay healthy.

335
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,077
Wherever we go, we're stars

336
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,370
-We're Mr. and…
-Ms. Popular!

337
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:55,290
-Let's hold hands and have some fun
-Na Yu-jeong, beauty manager.

338
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:57,876
Spin, spin, spin around and look cool

339
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,794
Look cool!

340
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,963
Sparkle, sparkle, I see no one but you

341
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,383
Hop, hop, my adorable lady

342
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,637
Come to me, softly and quietly

343
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,807
Stop drinking that thing
and pack some rice cakes.

344
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,517
Rice cakes? Why?

345
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,395
This is Ki-baek's favorite rice cake.
He likes it steamed and grilled.

346
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,147
He'd rather have this than rice.

347
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,276
Should I call him to come
and pick up the rice cakes?

348
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,070
Make way, all of you, here I come

349
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,864
Hello, I'm Na Yu-jeong,
your beauty manager.

350
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,671
Thanks.

351
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,715
-Are you the newbie?
-Hello.

352
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,134
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

353
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,469
You said their pre-recording was today.
You can go.

354
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,804
Oh, thank you.

355
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,223
Being supportive
of the newbie's fan activities?

356
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,934
I heard you were in a tight spot.
Guess that's not the case.

357
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,895
I-na, you can get going.

358
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,313
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

359
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,858
Well…

360
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,279
Ha-young is joining the team.

361
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,407
Chief went through hoops to persuade her
as soon as she returned to Korea.

362
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,537
Woo-ju as our head writer
and Ha-young to back her up.

363
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,330
Now we have nothing to worry about.

364
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,294
After my divorce,
I lived in Cali for a year,

365
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,630
then in Paris the following year,
so has it been about two years?

366
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,007
Yeah.

367
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,635
You haven't changed one bit.
You still have such fair skin.

368
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,847
You must've spent
all your time planning shows.

369
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:37,184
What are you talking about?
It's because I use an expensive sunscreen.

370
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:40,520
Haven't you been watching TV?
I've worked on a number of shows.

371
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,441
Better keep up. You'll lose your touch.

372
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,985
I only watch shows that do well.

373
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:50,655
I feel like my brain is rotting
when I watch unpopular shows.

374
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,828
I was so happy for you
when you left the team

375
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,748
to jump on the opportunity
to work as a head writer.

376
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:03,335
Nice to see you after just two years.
It's like my runaway child is back.

377
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,755
And that runaway child can pull
the family out of the gutter now.

378
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,132
Who is she, really?

379
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,801
Writer Lee Ha-young.

380
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:15,388
-But who is she?
-The legendary newbie.

381
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:19,059
The uncontrollable, unimaginable,

382
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,144
and the worst newbie.

383
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,312
HOMETOWN REPORT AT NOON

384
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,563
Gwangju in Gyeonggi?

385
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,190
TV CREW

386
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,359
It's Gwangju in Jeolla.
How could you confuse them?

387
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,236
You said you scouted a school there.

388
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,781
There's a school
with the exact same name in Gyeonggi.

389
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,282
What should we do?

390
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,451
Call city hall and ask if we can shoot.

391
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,371
Find out if we can do
something like a pottery experience.

392
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,623
Stay out of the senior writers' sight.

393
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,418
If someone says something to you,
just keep talking on the phone.

394
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,128
Hey, hide.

395
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,966
That's how the legend began.

396
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,720
What should I do? You see, this is…

397
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,013
Woo-ju.

398
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,308
Woo-ju!

399
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,018
-Pour them in here.
-Okay.

400
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,270
Sorry, we'll be quick.

401
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,438
-Hurry up and pour.
-Okay.

402
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,898
Hey, Ha-young.

403
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,735
What? You forgot their passports?

404
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,529
You've got to be kidding me.

405
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,700
Woo-ju had just graduated
from newbie status,

406
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,203
so she had a lot on her plate too,
but Ha-young was really something.

407
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:24,249
She always had Ha-young right by her side,
like a mother hen nurturing its egg.

408
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,166
It's not that heavy.

409
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,669
But if they struggled
and learned things together,

410
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,879
shouldn't they be pretty close?

411
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,214
What's with those two?

412
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,759
Woo-ju trained Ha-young so well

413
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,346
that Ha-young got an offer
to be another team's head writer.

414
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,932
Woo-ju was getting ready
to debut as a head writer too.

415
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,393
Not long after she had assembled the team,

416
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,811
Ha-young suddenly left.

417
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,316
When Ha-young was a subwriter,
she was a legend in a different sense.

418
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,736
She had a knack for casting
and had brilliant ideas.

419
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,906
Let's get along, okay?

420
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,118
If I were Woo-ju, seeing her again
would make me uncomfortable.

421
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,995
Will Woo-ju be all right?

422
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,838
Hey, have you grown taller?

423
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,674
I've got a casting meeting.

424
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,135
Oh, they've agreed to meet you?

425
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,179
Yes, of course. Who'd turn me down?

426
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,891
Have some coffee before you go.

427
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,149
My ears feel clogged.

428
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,819
This is way too high for me.
I feel like I'm getting motion sickness.

429
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,364
I told you we should call first.

430
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,866
The security guard always treats us
like we're solicitors.

431
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,118
My goodness. Be quiet, will you?

432
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,373
What? He could be home now.

433
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:49,250
That's exactly why.

434
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,086
Do you think he'd want to see us?

435
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,962
He has a lot of pride, you know.

436
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,255
Just hang this here.

437
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,801
You want to leave without seeing him
after coming all this way?

438
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,854
What are you doing?
You can't see anything through that hole.

439
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,380
He took it.

440
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,881
Let's go.

441
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,309
I won't even eat this stuff.
Why do they always…

442
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,728
This is good.

443
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,110
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK'S
FIRST NEWS SEGMENT

444
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,909
One plus one equals…

445
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,329
Two. Damn it.

446
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,876
Song Ki-baek isn't screwed--

447
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,172
I'm screwed.

448
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,798
It's not working.

449
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,344
Man, it's not working. What is going on?

450
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,974
I'm sorry. Oh? I'm sorry.

451
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,392
DONKEYS THE DODGEBALL KINGS

452
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,310
What is this?

453
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,145
It worked, right?

454
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,605
It did work a few times.

455
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,984
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

456
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,569
-Have you lost your mind?
-Oh?

457
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,156
Ki-baek. What are you doing?

458
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,412
WRITER ON WOO-JU

459
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,082
Where are you?

460
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:54,667
What?

461
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,920
I'm at Forever C&C.

462
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,130
Why do you ask?

463
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,549
Huh?

464
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,259
What's with this guy?

465
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,888
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm on my way now.

466
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,098
Just tell them
I'm running a few minutes behind.

467
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,099
Hey, Mr. Kwak.

468
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,477
-Gosh, what the--
-Finally, I get to see you.

469
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,354
Hey, you're still here?

470
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,106
Come on. I waited for you, as I should.
Hey, Mr. Kwak.

471
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,859
We've been through
thick and thin together.

472
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,152
Could you help me, please?

473
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:27,075
I'll accommodate your schedule, pay,
food preferences, mood and lifestyle.

474
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,535
What do you say? Are you in?

475
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,411
Listen, Woo-ju.

476
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,789
If I want to live, I must eat and poop.

477
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,041
I don't eat
because I have no time to poop.

478
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,751
And I can't poop because I don't eat.

479
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,586
I won't take up a lot of your time.

480
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,089
Ms. On, I hear you're having a hard time.

481
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,425
You haven't even secured
a time slot for it yet.

482
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,887
You expect me to do
We Live Together just to help you?

483
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,389
No, no way.

484
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,890
I want to live at my place.

485
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,141
Let's go to my place.

486
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,769
-Hey, come on.
-Writer On Woo-ju.

487
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:01,234
I came over here to see
if it was really you, and here you are.

488
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,361
-Hey.
-Sorry to interrupt.

489
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,905
You're not interrupting.

490
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,324
You haven't been
in the office for a while.

491
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,451
I'm supposed to have a meal
with the CEO today.

492
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:11,619
Oh, really?

493
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,745
Anyway, Ms. On.

494
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,248
It's so hard to get a meeting with you.

495
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,209
-Sorry?
-I told you I wanted a casting meeting.

496
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,628
-Well…
-A casting meeting?

497
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,424
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

498
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,094
Hey, Jeong-heon. Woo-ju.
Let's go grab a coffee or something.

499
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,637
No, Mr. Kwak.

500
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,640
I get what you're trying to say.
I'll be in touch.

501
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,685
Come on! Hey.
Don't be all business with me.

502
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:39,564
Drop the "Mr." Just call me Beom. We good?

503
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,901
Beom, I'll be in touch then.

504
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,986
Call me, Woo-ju.

505
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,325
Hey, Jeong-heon.

506
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,662
We're represented by the same agency,
so we'll be like a package deal.

507
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,205
You get the idea, right?

508
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,583
Shall we do it?

509
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,754
But if I'm the main item,
I don't need a freebie to seal the deal.

510
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,798
-What's with you?
-I'll see you around then.

511
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,216
Let's do it!

512
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,427
-That's not even funny. Don't do that.
-Hey, but…

513
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,266
Huh?

514
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,397
Did you call me after a few days

515
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,733
and ask me where I was
to come and find me?

516
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,569
I think I've figured it out.

517
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:27,654
Figured out what?

518
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,782
That mysterious link
between inhibition and disinhibition?

519
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,159
Do you mind putting it in layman's terms?

520
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,412
Hey, come here.

521
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,584
I'm not in the mood to joke around
with you today.

522
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,670
Well, I'm dead serious right now too.

523
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,713
All right, what's three times six?

524
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,801
Eighteen.

525
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,885
What?

526
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,637
I mean, I'm 20…

527
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,931
I'm 40.

528
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,226
I'm 33. Damn it.

529
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,061
What the heck are you saying?

530
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:04,065
Whenever I saw your face in the past,
I got this strong feeling and felt okay.

531
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,818
Was this not the reason?

532
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,361
Why not?

533
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,780
God. Let go, will you?

534
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,331
It's my son-in-law!

535
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:23,876
Hop, hop, my adorable lady

536
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,879
Why is he your son-in-law?
He's everyone's dream son-in-law.

537
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,090
Goodness, isn't he so cute?

538
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,967
He's well-spoken and a great dancer.

539
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,261
Your daughter works
at a broadcasting station.

540
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,595
Ask her if you can see him.

541
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,558
I asked her to get me his autograph,
and she flat out ignored me.

542
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,351
That brat is such a snob.

543
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,436
But you know what?

544
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,440
Every time I see him,
I feel like I know him personally.

545
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,277
He and Ki-baek went
to high school together.

546
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,194
-Huh?
-What?

547
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,904
Your forever soul mate

548
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,742
Again? You didn't have to bring anything.

549
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,161
It's nothing compared to
the peaches you gave us.

550
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,412
Anyway, thanks.

551
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,625
-The front gate works now.
-Okay, thanks.

552
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,711
Hey, Un-baek.

553
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,379
Did you know that Ki-baek

554
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,882
and Kim Jeong-heon were friends
in high school?

555
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,551
"Friends"?

556
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,178
Here comes your raccoon

557
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,262
I doubt that.

558
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,515
Do you guys know each other?

559
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,269
I believe you said hi to each other
at the award ceremony too.

560
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,314
Oh, we went to high school together.
We're friends.

561
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,691
We just went to the same school.

562
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,822
Back in high school, Ki-baek was
the top student, and he was athletic too.

563
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,407
He was perfect in every way.

564
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:39,994
Are you talking about yourself?
You were Mr. Perfect.

565
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,497
You were athletic and rich,
and you had lots of friends.

566
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,166
That is true.

567
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,626
Go on and catch up, you two.

568
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,294
-No.
-No, wait.

569
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,090
What are you doing? Let go.

570
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,763
Wait, it's weird.

571
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,810
-Woo-ju.
-Just go. I'm not interested.

572
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,541
MADAM ON

573
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,588
HANGUK MILK
STRAWBERRY

574
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:43,307
I bet you got chewed out again
or something like that.

575
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,352
If you're upset about something,
just sleep it off.

576
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,604
Why do you have to make such a fuss?

577
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,065
Nothing gets resolved
if you just sit around.

578
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,316
I must do something.

579
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,778
Then while you're at it, wash these too.

580
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,247
YEON

581
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,168
-What's up?
-Hey, why didn't you tell me?

582
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,461
I hear Kim Jeong-heon has taken the bait.

583
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,548
"Taken the bait"? What is he, a fish?

584
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,467
On Woo-ju.

585
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,511
Hey, Woo-ju.

586
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,309
So you have no interest in me. About that…

587
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,814
-But aren't you here to work?
-Yeah, exactly.

588
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,984
So, why did you have to butt in
and ruin everything?

589
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:38,362
You think I ruined your project?

590
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,241
I am Kim Jeong-heon, you see.

591
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:48,789
I'm genuinely interested in your new show
as a show host, not as your ex-boyfriend.

592
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,794
So decide wisely. You're a pro.

593
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:04,055
I pulled all sorts of antics
to do a good job but got no work done.

594
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,557
I'm so embarrassed.

595
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,828
You can promise me
you'll keep it to yourself, right?

596
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,415
It's crucial that I get to the bottom
of it if I want my job back.

597
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,294
A doctor must keep
his patients' personal info confidential.

598
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,172
But this is no hospital.

599
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,133
I suggest making an outpatient appointment
in the afternoon.

600
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,469
Is it possible though?

601
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:48,516
You mean, symptoms of disinhibition
suddenly disappearing or returning?

602
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,519
That's right. So I tried to look
for some patterns, but…

603
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,271
Well, that failed.

604
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,982
It could be caused
by an imprinting effect.

605
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,859
If a certain situation
or action at the time of the incident

606
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,736
left a lasting imprint on your mind,

607
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,074
it could turn your symptoms on and off,
like a switch.

608
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,786
So you're saying there's a switch
I don't know about inside my head?

609
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,371
Now I'm even more confused.

610
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,333
Hey, don't do it like that.

611
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,377
Watch me, okay?

612
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,879
-One second.
-Fold it over.

613
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,465
Pick it up using the center point,
then shake it once.

614
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:28,264
I have a problem staying calm because
I don't know when the symptoms will come.

615
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,894
What if the switch turns on
when I'm at work tomorrow?

616
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,899
It'll be helpful for you
if you can find out what that "switch" is.

617
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:43,904
For now, let's wait and see how it goes,
while hoping it won't turn on again.

618
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,700
All right.

619
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,504

-Hello.
-Oh, yes. Hello.

622
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,490
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,909
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

625
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,956
-He couldn't hold back?
-He should write an apology.

626
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,583
What's he going to do?

627
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,252
He'll get fired at this rate.

628
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,963
Hello, Mr. Kim.

629
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,550
I'm back, as of today.
I apologize for causing you concern.

630
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,054
What?

631
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,265
What do you want?
Go do what you need to do.

632
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,350
Yes, sir.

633
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:58,229
He came to work? Wow, he's got thick skin.

634
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,606
Those who should voluntarily resign
never do.

635
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,691
Mr. Kim. I'm here.

636
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:08,614
Hey, Mr. Choi! Give me a hug.

637
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,825
So you're back?

638
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,160
Yes, after completing my job
at the overseas branch.

639
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,955
Nae-jeong, it's been so long.
You look great.

640
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,165
I thought you were coming next month.
What a surprise.

641
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,083
Plans changed.

642
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,584
-Let's sit down.
-Welcome back.

643
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,795
-You need a chair.
-I brought you something small.

644
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,423
You didn't have to get me anything.
Oh, cookies?

645
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,466
I didn't have time
to pick out proper gifts.

646
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,261
-Guys, eat up. They're all cookies.
-Have a seat.

647
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,973
-Open this and have a taste.
-Sure.

648
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,766
So, how have you been?

649
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,269
-I've been well.
-So you're back for good?

650
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,187
-Yeah.
-Not going someplace else?

651
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,272
Where?

652
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,483
This makes me so happy, seriously.

SONG KI-BAEK: SUSPENDED

655
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,706
We'll start drinking in broad daylight
and drink until we drop.

656
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:00,583
-I'm done for the day.
-Okay.

657
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,751
-Have a great time.
-Join us if you can.

658
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,920
-What shall we eat?
-Pork bone soup would be nice.

659
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,922
Pork bone soup, it is.

660

JBC NEWS 8 ANCHOR AUDITION

661
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,733
He came to work? Wow, he's got thick skin.

662
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,486
Those who should voluntarily resign
never do.

663
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,279
-What?
-He came to work?

664
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,114
-He's really something.
-Way to go.

665
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,283
What's he going to do if he gets fired?

666
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,619
-He's brazen.
-If I were him, I wouldn't come.

667
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:38,162
Go do what you need to do.

668
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,817
Mr. Song Ki-baek.

669
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,198
You're breaking out in a cold sweat.

670
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,991
Are you all right?

671
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,371
Hey. I asked you if you were all right.

672
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,709
Come on in.

673
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,295
Over here.

674
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,839
Come this way.

675
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,176
Wait, can we come in here
without permission?

676
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,346
There's no shoot until the evening,
so it's fine. Sit here.

677
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,639
Okay.

678
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,599
You can't stay here.

679
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,268
We have to change the desks.

680
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,895
Oh, you have to change the desks today.

681
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,064
Come here. It's okay.

682
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,322
They definitely don't need this set today.

683
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,949
We have to dismantle the set.

684
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,952
Oh, that's why they're dismantling it.

685
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,372
Well, come with me.
I know of another studio.

686
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,886
About yesterday. What was that?

687
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,472
You said you'd figured out something
but made no sense.

688
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:21,974
It was nothing.

689
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,894
-Do I have food on my face?
-Nope.

690
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,190
I do. Why did you lie?

691
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,321
I guess you feel like your normal self,
seeing how you can lie like that.

692
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,952
-Thanks for the food.
-You barely touched it.

693
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,121
I have to go. Throw this out for me.

694
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,375
Mr. Song.

695
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,545
Just sit down for a moment.

696
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,009
Maybe it's not a bad thing
that you've become so honest.

697
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,053
It could be helpful for you.

698
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:02,264
The moment the switch turns on,
I turn into a ticking time bomb.

699
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,810
But does that "switch" really exist?

700
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,062
Is it turned on now?

701
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,148
I think it's off.

702
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,816
But you're so honest right now.

703
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,528
You already saw everything.
I don't need to hide it from you.

704
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,155
Oh, right.

705
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,949
You know…

706
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,747
Do you think I can host a news show?
I mean, in this state.

707
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:31,585
A news show? That might be a little too…

708
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,587
Right?

709
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,049
You see,

710
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,763
I've put up with everything and held out
until now to be a news anchor.

711
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,267
There were so many false rumors about me,

712
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,603
and I used them

713
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,857
because I wanted everyone to think
that position was rightfully mine.

714
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:02,533
Ki-baek, what does the news mean to you?

715
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:12,709
To me, it means…

716
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,677
I'm not sure.

717
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,266
I have to go. I'm sorry.

718
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,476
Ki-baek.

719
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,231
I don't really know what's going on,

720
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:37,317
but I do know you're going through a lot.

721
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,822
But if you let yourself get depressed,
it'll only make things worse.

722
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,408
You have to cheer yourself up
during tough times.

723
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,492
Okay?

724
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,831
I'm struggling because I've got no energy,
but I'm supposed to cheer up?

725
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,004
You know what self-defense is.
Protecting yourself physically.

726
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,382
But do you know what's more important
and powerful than that?

727
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,385
The art of protecting your heart.

728
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,097
You must protect your own heart.

729
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,725
"The art of protecting your heart"?

730
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,323
-Is the team dinner at Bongbong Pub?
-Yes.

731
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:28,160
But Mr. Kim said everyone
who reports to him should be there.

732
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,579
Let's just go.

733
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,509
BONGBONG? BONG…

734
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:59,983
Hey, Song.

735
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,154
I was going to call
but thought you might be here.

736
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,280
And here you are.

737
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,718
LOOKING FOR A NEW FACE
TO HOST JBC NEWS 8

738
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:35,894
Hello.

739
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,354
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

740
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,481
-Hi.
-Hello.

741
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,069
Oh, Ki-baek--

742
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,158
Look at you, Song Ki-baek. I knew it.

743
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,120
He's trying to cheer himself up
even though he's got no energy.

744
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,663
I should cheer up too!

745
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:59,334
APPLICANT: SONG KI-BAEK
APPLYING FOR: JBC 8 NEWS ANCHOR

746
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,928
Hey, Ki-baek. Come out.

747
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:14,474
Did Mr. Kim tell you to audition?

748
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:18,061
Rumors are running rampant
that Mr. Choi is getting the position.

749
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,896
They asked rookie announcers to audition

750
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,441
so it'd look like
they had enough applicants.

751
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:23,734
What are you doing here?

752
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,612
For God's sake, hey.

753
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,658
It's a total shit show. It's all rigged.

754
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:36,204
No one will say anything even if
you ditch the audition and leave now.

755
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,498
Mr. Kim is just using you.

756
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,375
-I know.
-Then why are you here?

757
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:41,752
I must do this.

758
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:46,465
I have to let him use me this time
to seize my next opportunity.

759
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,508
Hey, Ki-baek.

760
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,676
I will do it.

761
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,303
I have to.

762
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,602
Here for the audition, Ki-baek?

763
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,982
-Let's both do our best.
-Yes.

764
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,659
This way, please.

765
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:17,954
-Hello.
-Hi.

766
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,166
-Thank you.
-We're ready for the third applicant.

767
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,835
Jin-ju, we need the script.

768
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,004
Over here.

769
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,859
Who's next?

770
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,820
Number three, Song Ki-baek, is next.

771
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,446
Song Ki-baek?

772
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,656
NAME: SONG KI-BAEK

773
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,784
Hey, isn't he

774
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:57,577
that guy from JBC News at Noon?

775
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,331
When I think about
what I had to do to clean up that mess…

776
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,835
But I admit I laughed my head off
when I watched that clip afterward.

777
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,753
Guess there weren't a lot of applicants.

778
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,505
I just see a bunch of losers.

779
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:10,966
Let's make this quick. Give him a cue.

780
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:29,860
All right. Ready?

781
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,404
Will you wait if I'm not ready?

782
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,657
Pardon me?

783
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,910
All right, ready.

784
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:47,294
Hey, On Woo-ju.
You're going to make the floor collapse.

785
00:50:48,044 --> 00:50:51,256
Even when I start my morning feeling good,
it doesn't even last half a day.

786
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:54,926
JBC NEWS 8 ANCHOR AUDITION

787
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,315
Camera, we're rolling.

788
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,233
You can start when you're ready.

789
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,820
But seriously.

790
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,281
Who told Song Ki-baek
he could participate in this?

791
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,491
This is just embarrassing.

792
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,117
Who's emb--

793
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,371
-Embarrass…
-Come on. He can hear you.

794
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,873
So what? Who cares?

795
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,917
It's not like he'll get
the anchor position.

796
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,711
Hey, let's make this quick.
Let's not waste our time.

797
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:31,838
Who's embarrass--

798
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,924
Embarrassing…

799
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,093
Number three?

800
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,806
You can start. Please start.

801
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,612
One moment.

802
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,296
The switch is turned on, isn't it?

803
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:19,010
Neither of us knows how to turn it off,

804
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,389
but I know that this audition is
very important to you.

805
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,685
I asked you what the news meant
to you, remember?

806
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:30,564
I think you're here because you know
the answer to my question.

807
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,902
Remember the art of protecting your heart?

808
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,824
Protect your heart.

809
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,452
You're the only one here
who can protect yourself.

810
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,249
Excuse me.

811
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,835
Can't you see we're holding an audition?

812
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:56,339
I'm sorry. I'm his stylist.
I just noticed that his tie was crooked.

813
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,842
Sorry about that. All right.

814
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,260
-Please get out.
-I'm sorry!

815
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,637
One, two, one, two.

816
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:07,893
Mr. Song. Do you want to continue?

817
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,519
Yes.

818
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,188
Get ready again.

819
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:36,212
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to JBC News.

820
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:42,135
The National Human Rights Commission
and the Journalists Association of Korea

821
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,763
co-published the 2023 Human Rights
Report Casebook.

822
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,723
This was done in compliance

823
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:49,351
with the Human Rights Practices
Reporting Standards,

824
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:53,647
which were enacted in 2011 and amended
in 2014 by the two organizations.

825
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,566
Since the COVID-19 pandemic,
standards on reporting infectious diseases

826
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:59,903
and human rights practices
have been strengthened…

827
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:02,781
-Well, I must say, not bad.
-Right?

828
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:06,368
It reflects the media's neutral gaze
on the reporting of sex work.

829
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:09,788
The media outlets' heated competition
over viewership ratings has resulted

830
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:13,124
in reckless reporting,
which has been an issue lately.

831
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,960
All eyes are on whether

832
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,004
the media's efforts to shift away
from such trends will be fruitful.

833
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,840
Song Ki-baek, JBC News.

834
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,222
We'll move on to the anchor briefing.

835
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:34,980
NS-2 ANCHOR BRIEFING

836
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,067
Why was Choi Nae-jeong suddenly summoned
from the overseas branch?

837
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,362
The higher-ups flipped out
over the main news' rock-bottom ratings.

838
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,824
Choi Nae-jeong has a huge fandom.
It all comes down to business.

839
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,744
We need ads and better ratings.
The news must be marketable to be saved.

840
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,621
Man.

841
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,333
What happened to the honor
and dignity of the news?

842
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:58,211
They all know
such things do not exist here.

843
00:54:58,294 --> 00:55:00,839
Actually, I bet they aren't
even interested.

844
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:05,343
Look, that's why he volunteered
to be part of this shit show.

845
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,976
Ki-baek, what do the news mean to you?

846
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,523
To me, it means…

847
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,993
A city with a beautiful name, Bangkok.

848
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,454
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

849
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,123
As adults,
it is our duty to protect children.

850
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,001
And it's important to pay attention
in your day-to-day life.

851
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,340
To me, the news is…

852
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:52,640
In my life filled with lies,
it was the only real thing.

853
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,644
Ki-baek, what do you want to be?

854
00:55:56,728 --> 00:55:59,022
You get good grades, you're popular.
I'm so jealous.

855
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,690
How am I going to support myself?

856
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,275
Ki-baek isn't like you.

857
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,943
I'm sure he already has a plan.

858
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,446
Hey, Ki-baek, what do you want to be?

859
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,326
Announcer.

860
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,245
I want to be an announcer.

861
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:16,831
NEW ANNOUNCER TRAINING
IN SESSION

862
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:24,297
I sincerely promise you that I'll only
report the truth and never lie to you.

863
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,758
Song Ki-baek, JBC.

864
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,887
Here, I don't have to lie.

865
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,848
No, I must not lie.

866
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:50,782
NS-2 ANCHOR BRIEFING

867
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:15,598
I cannot lie.

868
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,186
Truth, fairness and justice.

869
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,606
I trust that news programs devoid
of these values aren't worth existing.

870
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:33,366
That is the reason I must be
a man who cannot lie,

871
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:38,788
and the reason why I've decided
to leave this corrupt news studio

872
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,583
that reeks
of such a disgusting, rotten stench…

873
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,545
which I cannot stand any longer.

874
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,822
Let go of me! What did you say?

875
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,908
I let a loser like you audition, and what?

876
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,993
What's rotten? What stench?

877
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,536
You little…

878
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,210
What?

879
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,547
You.

880
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:32,675
You stink.

881
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,598
You rude bastard!

882
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:40,642
Oh, no.

883
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,330
Where do you think you're going?

884
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,582
Hey! You little…

885
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,334
If you leave now, you'll get fired.

886
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,460
Woo-ju.

887
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,589
Today, my heart and my dream…

888
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,883
I managed to protect both.

889
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,974
"The art of protecting your heart."

890
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,352
Thank you.

891
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,318
Un-baek, don't let it drop like that.

892
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,238
Here, like this. Taekwon!

893
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:36,864
-Now you try.
-Taekwon!

894
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,784
-Okay. Pow!
-Pow!

895
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:42,245
I knew it. You are a genius. Well done.

896
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,039
-Mom!
-Mom.

897
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,793
Mom, want me to teach you too?

898
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,003
No, thank you.

899
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:55,675
Mom, I will protect you, Dad
and Un-baek once I get my red belt.

900
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,513
Self-defense moves.
My master said he'd teach me those too.

901
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,723
Gosh, you.

902
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,308
Self-defense moves!

903
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:10,773
You see, before you become
someone who is physically strong,

904
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,193
I want you to be someone
who's mentally strong.

905
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,529
It's important
to protect yourself physically,

906
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,742
but protecting your heart
is more difficult, and it's more precious.

907
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:27,332
I will protect your heart.

908
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:30,084
Your heart.

909
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,171
I'll protect your heart too.

910
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,256
Goodness, my babies.

911
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,135
All right. Ki-baek, Un-baek.
You can do it.

912
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,219
Yes, we can do it!

913
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,304
-We can do it!
-Yes!

914
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,388
We can do it.

915
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,684
-Let's go.
-Let's eat something delicious at home.

916
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,020
Okay, we'll have a nice dinner.

917
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,742
ANNOUNCER SONG KI-BAEK

918
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,845
FRANKLY SPEAKING

919
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:25,181
It was cool how you left.

920
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,934
I've never seen anything like it.

921
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,521
Throw your shoulders back
and always talk with confidence.

922
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:33,022
Wait, hold on.

923
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:36,776
You'll starve to death
trying to protect your dream.

924
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:38,736
I knew you had it in you, Woo-ju.

925
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,738
How did you get
Kim Jeong-heon just like that?

926
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,115
What's your deal with Kim Jeong-heon?

927
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,241
Ms. On Woo-ju.

928
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:46,577
-Lately Woo-ju seems…
-You're worried, right?

929
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,497
That was a close call.

930
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,749
Why is his phone off?

931
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,292
-Where were you?
-Where were you?

932
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,878
Let's give this a shot.

933
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:03,344
