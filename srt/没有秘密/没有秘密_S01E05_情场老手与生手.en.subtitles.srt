00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,801
FRANKLY SPEAKING

2
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,372
Let's do it. This dating thing.

3
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,708
What is this? A prank?

4
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,586
Come on.
Let's give it a shot, this dating--

5
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,797
show.

6
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,928
You've worked with me on a variety show.
In my current state--

7
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,096
Back then, I didn't know you well.

8
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,182
You should try things out
and see how it goes.

9
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,856
Unless it's something like
You Quiz or Hidden Singer.

10
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,318
-You know, a show that requires a host.
-What?

11
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,196
I can't go on I Live Alone
because I don't live alone.

12
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,532
I can't do OIV
because I don't have a manager.

13
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,080
My goodness. Someone's ambitious.

14
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,416
Do you think you can compete against
Yu Jae-seok or Jun Hyun-moo?

15
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,710
They're seasoned veterans.

16
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:13,216
If they're polar bears, I'd say you're
a baby penguin that just left its colony.

17
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,009
One that can't even walk properly yet.

18
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,306
Okay, so what's your point?

19
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,268
Reality dating show.

20
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:27,647
Regular people can participate too,
and it's definitely entertaining.

21
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,819
Most importantly,
I'm sure viewers will love the real you.

22
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,615
You said I was your switch.

23
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,367
So use me.

24
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,830
And I'll use you too.

25
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,213
A penguin can never encounter
a polar bear in its lifetime.

26
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,383
You know why?
Because penguins live in the Antarctic.

27
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,853
WORKMAN

28
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,820
Excuse me.

29
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:20,783
I told you to meet me in half an hour--

30
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,577
Well, I couldn't wait.

31
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,329
Hello, Dr. Kim.

32
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,375
AGREEMENT

33
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,961
SONG KI-BAEK AND ON WOO-JU
WILL PERFORM THEIR DUTIES

34
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,714
Can't we just say
we'll trust each other and get on with it?

35
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,133
People sign agreements
to ensure everything goes well

36
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,135
and to address issues if they arise.

37
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,851
Well, you see. I'm a doctor, not a lawyer.

38
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,144
Why are you doing this?

39
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,440
Do you think I can be socially active
despite my disinhibition syndrome?

40
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,152
No, I mean, can I go on a TV show
in my current state?

41
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:02,242
Well, people go to work and school
with a broken arm or a broken skull.

42
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,369
That's life.

43
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,538
You're alive and breathing.
That's nice. Is Mr. Song dead?

44
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,332
See?

45
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:15,380
Let's collect some data first
with the switch on.

46
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,965
You should confront the problem.

47
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,975
We'll do it your style

48
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,644
and my style.

49
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,324
God, does this even make sense to you?

50
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,867
We got Kim Jeong-heon on board,

51
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,953
but you want to change
the concept altogether?

52
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,914
What if Jeong-heon doesn't want to do it?

53
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,834
-Right now, we--
-Kim Jeong-heon is all we have.

54
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,002
That's why I'm doing this.

55
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,254
We're on the cliff's edge.

56
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:58,715
Viewers have seen
enough of Kim Jeong-heon.

57
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,591
We need something new and fresh.

58
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:02,885
Like what?

59
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,345
Do you have a concrete plan?

60
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,849
Kim Jeong-heon and Song Ki-baek.
There's something going on between them.

61
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,184
We'll have something
if we put those two together.

62
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,646
Okay, but even so,
do you think Jeong-heon would say yes?

63
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,231
Let's do it.

64
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,984
Sorry?

65
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:23,614
It's my chance to transition
from ideal son-in-law to ideal boyfriend.

66
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,700
We'll give it our all.

67
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,702
I'm counting on you, Ms. On.

68
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,959
Let's get started.

69
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,881
I'll hit the slate. One, two, three.

70
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,474
Hello, everyone. I'm Louis Kim.

71
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,059
I'm 30 in Korean age.

72
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,061
I moved to France to study
when I was young.

73
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:57,315
I currently run a small restaurant
that I own in Hannam-dong. I'm a chef.

74
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,611
I'm 29. It's a lovely age.

75
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,820
I'm Choi Yu-yeong.

76
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:07,825
I was a professional swimmer until age 23
and worked in TV up until recently.

77
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,203
Now I'm getting ready
to start my own business.

78
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,080
-Hello.
-Let me help you with that.

79
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,414
It's a little heavy.

80
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,415
It is kind of heavy.

81
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,251
I'm Park Seong-jun.

82
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,837
I recently launched
a men's streetwear brand.

83
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,214
Our annual revenue…

84
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:25,301
I'm bashful about saying it myself,
but about ten billion won?

85
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,969
I'm 25.

86
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,388
I'm Park Hae-ri.

87
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:33,476
I'm a graphic designer
with 100k subscribers.

88
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,812
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

89
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,313
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

90
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,149
I'm Cho Hui-seon.

91
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,776
I'm a lawyer.

92
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,655
I used to work at a big law firm
but opened my own practice this year.

93
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,366
I've published a book,
and I give lectures on legal topics.

94
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,700
-Hello.
-Hello.

95
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,910
-Take a seat.
-Shall we…

96
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,122
Send in the next guest.

97
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,097
Oh, someone else is here.

98
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,518
-Hello.
-Hello.

99
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,602
Hello.

100
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,730
-This way.
-Need a hand?

101
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,734
-He said he's good.
-This is awkward.

102
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,236
You can sit over here.

103
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,362
You can sit…

104
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,824
Let's move on.

105
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,250
Oh, someone else is here.

106
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,710
Here, this way.

107
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,045
Oh, aren't you Jeong-heon?

108
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,886
-Hello.
-Hi.

109
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,555
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

110
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,723
Hello.

111
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,767
-Hello.
-Hello.

112
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,811
Hello.

113
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,688
I'm a fan of your shows.

114
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,772
Hello.

115
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,316
-This is cool.
-Wow.

116
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,068
-Are we supposed to stand?
-You can sit.

117
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,072
First, introduce yourselves.

118
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,624
Hello, I'm Park Seong-jun.

119
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,710
Applause, please.

120
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,466
I like women with pretty smiles.

121
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,801
-Louis Kim. I've seen him on Insta.
-Thank you.

122
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,386
He's famous.

123
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,181
I want to meet a successful man.

124
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,684
How about a business owner
that makes ten billion won annually?

125
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,690
It's nice to meet you guys.

126
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,403
Hey, Ki-baek.

127
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,864
Go ahead.

128
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:08,422
Hello, I'm Song Ki-baek, a JBC announcer.

129
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,342
Announcer?

130
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,930
I was at JBC for eight and a half years
but got kicked out

131
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,139
for causing trouble…

132
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,818
At the moment…

133
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,739
I'm un--

134
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,450
FREELANCE ANNOUNCER

135
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,037
I'm free and unemployed.

136
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,173
Well, I'm here to try new things
with new people in a new environment.

137
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,093
But I see more cameras than people.

138
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,429
How do they expect us to date here?

139
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,272
-Oh, no.
-I want a love that's like a miracle.

140
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,900
Like a miracle.

141
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,570
Nice!

142
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,906
-He's not drunk, is he?
-I feel drunk all of a sudden.

143
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,743
Chin up.

144
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,509
So…

145
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,056
Hello, I'm Kim Jeong-heon.

146
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,358
That's it?

147
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,489
Such a cheeseball.

148
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,824
Come on. That should be in the teaser.

149
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,159
He's a total pro.

150
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,920
EPISODE 5: THE PRO AND THE AMATEUR

151
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,547
Okay, we'll now move on
to individual interviews.

152
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,841
You can make yourselves at home and chat.

153
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,805
-Where's your luggage?
-Over there.

154
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,598
Really? Let me go get it for you.

155
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,350
-Is your suitcase this one?
-That one.

156
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,685
Which one is yours?
I'll take it inside for you.

157
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,229
Thank you, I--

158
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,443
You.

159
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,947
Yeah, as you promised.

160
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,281
The pinky?

161
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,534
You have to do a good job.

162
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,952
The best?

163
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:43,869
Okay?

164
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm the best?

165
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,416
Yes.

166
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,546
Wait!

167
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,883
I have an important announcement.

168
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:04,056
-Why do we have to put it back on?
-The crew wants to change the lapel mic.

169
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,725
I got this. I know how to do it.

170
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:07,977
It's faster if I do it.

171
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,611
Are you enjoying it so far?

172
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,989
Well, we're just getting started.

173
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:20,906
Right.

174
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,035
It's been forever since
the two of us stood together like this.

175
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,916
Don't you think it'll be better
to pair up these two?

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,335
There's something about being on set

177
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,628
and seeing you too.

178
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,131
It reminds me of the old days.

179
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,843
I don't want you
to think about the old days.

180
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,014
Hey, was I that obnoxious?

181
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,640
Everyone's so mean to me.

182
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,851
I was obnoxious.

183
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,478
What?

184
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,812
I said, I was obnoxious.

185
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,361
Let me know if you need help.

186
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,198
I could be of help to you here.

187
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,033
All right.

188
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,374
Ki-baek.

189
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,710
Don't look at the camera.

190
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,131
I'm used to looking at the camera.
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,392
You can relax and sit comfortably.

192
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:34,146
Oh, this-- this side of my face
looks better on camera.

193
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:38,192
Please kindly edit out what I just said.

194
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,153
Requesting edits
will make us not want to do it.

195
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:44,198
Be it a humorous blunder or an error,
we want it in the show.

196
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,410
True, that's what variety shows are about.
That much I know.

197
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,745
Good point.

198
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,374
Just relax and tell me
whatever's on your mind.

199
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,584
I'll never make you look bad.

200
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,379
So? Who do you find most attractive?

201
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,756
-We met just an hour ago.
-What?

202
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:06,220
I mean, I know--
I know that's what we're here to do,

203
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,764
to say "I like you" an hour
after meeting each other.

204
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,768
I'm very nervous right now.

205
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:18,357
This question shouldn't make you nervous.
This should be a little easier.

206
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,528
Why did you decide to do this show?

207
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,113
I couldn't go on You Quiz.

208
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,620
I mean, I'm a penguin.

209
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,081
A penguin?

210
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,125
I see. You're a penguin.

211
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,793
A penguin.

212
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,713
What am I supposed to say to this?

213
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,216
Is he trying to flaunt his charm?

214
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,262
Like, trying to say he's cute
and fluffy like a penguin?

215
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,770
All right. Calm down and think, okay?

216
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,106
What is it that you have to do here?

217
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,025
I need to find my match.

218
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,611
I may look like a loser
because of my current situation,

219
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:07,698
but I've been on many blind dates.
I have many qualities that women like.

220
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,325
I'm tall and…

221
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,243
I mean, I'm tall--

222
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,829
and I went to a good school.

223
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,456
And my job…

224
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,458
Well, I had a good job.

225
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,835
You're not getting the point.

226
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,504
This is a reality dating show.

227
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,883
You need to have the qualities
the viewers want in a man.

228
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:28,385
People watch reality dating shows

229
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:32,181
to see the difficult, competitive process
of winning someone's heart.

230
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,558
That said, the most important thing is…

231
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,060
What is it?

232
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,686
Victory.

233
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,439
Whether it's a game or a mission,
you must win.

234
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,025
Good point.

235
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,069
The second most important is loyalty.

236
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,947
In a show where people
are put through emotional turmoil,

237
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,993
a loyal man who never betrays you
tends to be more popular.

238
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,913
"He won, and he's loyal?
He sure is a keeper."

239
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,873
Victory and loyalty.

240
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,710
Of course, some might try to rub others
the wrong way to grab attention,

241
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,130
but it's something only pros can do,
so don't you even dream of it.

242
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,924
But victory and loyalty.

243
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,551
They both require intense energy,

244
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,929
so you need something soft as well.

245
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,889
Show them you also have some yudori

246
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,892
and surprise them.

247
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,939
The three key traits of Mr. Popular
on variety shows. The three keys.

248
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,068
THE 3 KEY TRAITS
= VICTORY, LOYALTY, YUDORI

249
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,072
Victory, loyalty and yudori?
For yudori, let's say flexibility instead.

250
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:34,535
Or a relaxed attitude.
It's a Japanese loanword.

251
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,661
Oh, right.

252
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,130
THE FIRST GAME
TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE

253
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,467
Once the game begins,
one of the guys will be eliminated,

254
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,554
and the girls will choose their matches.

255
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,015
The ladies will each have
a balloon on their backs.

256
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,017
If the balloon pops, the team is out.

257
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,145
The last team remaining
in the pit is the winner

258
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,398
and will be given a huge advantage.

259
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,315
COUPLE'S PARADISE

260
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:20,164
Good luck! Let's go!

261
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,415
Good luck!

262
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,048
VICTORY

263
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,980
Let's do this!

264
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,005
There you go.

265
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,257
They're so competitive right off the bat.

266
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,843
They can't just date
when the camera starts rolling.

267
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,555
You need to spark their competitiveness.
Dating can be embarrassing, but not this.

268
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,351
Once they get competitive,
they'll begin to develop some feelings.

269
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:23,560
That's right.

270
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,606
Ladies, go ahead and pick the person
you want to team up with.

271
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,278
Jeong-heon.

272
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,255
Ki-baek, can you help me down?

273
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,339
Oh, sure.

274
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,135
All right. We got this.

275
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,095
Yes. Hold tight.

276
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,242
Hold tight!

277
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,290
Right there!

278
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,503
Go for it!

279
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,758
-Well done.
-Nice. Good work.

280
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,554
Nice, we did it. Well done.

281
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,150
Song Ki-baek. Don't tire yourself out.
Slow down.

282
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,402
Slow down? What do you mean?

283
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,072
-Let's give them the picture they want.
-The picture they want?

284
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,827
I guess you're suggesting we rig the game.
You're messing with the wrong guy.

285
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,788
You think I'm messing with you
when I'm trying to help you?

286
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,540
Seriously, I can't talk to you.

287
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,918
Shut your mouth. What do you know?

288
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,878
Shut your mouth. What do you know?

289
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,318
-It popped!
-It popped.

290
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,945
We beat them.

291
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,571
We won!

292
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,659
-I won! We won!
-We won!

293
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,328
We're done.

294
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,167
We won!

295
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,172
I thought I was watching an action film.

296
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,425
Well, they've secured enough screen time.

297
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,970
Wow, Song Ki-baek is fiercely competitive.

298
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,390
Hey, right now.
That look on his face. Get it on camera.

299
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,435
Nice. I love that look
on Kim Jeong-heon's face too.

300
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,022
Now this is what I call a fierce showdown
between men, you know?

301
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,148
Yes.

302
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:38,380
-Are you okay?
-Good work.

303
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,301
We'll freshen up and meet back here.

304
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:46,930
Hey, Ki-baek.

305
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,892
If the bathrooms are full,
you can use ours.

306
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,477
Oh, thanks.

307
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,650
-Woo-ju.
-Yes?

308
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,777
Are you interviewing Kim Jeong-heon?

309
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,113
-Sure.
-All right.

310
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,664
Seriously, I can't believe this.

311
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,791
You said I was hungry for attention.

312
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,252
You begged me, in tears,
not to go on the show.

313
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,798
You already met another girl?
You really are a piece of garbage!

314
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,053
I'm sick and tired of this too.

315
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,763
Let's just break up. If we end--

316
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,436
Wait, Ki-baek.

317
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,650
Sorry for disturbing you.

318
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,778
You heard everything?

319
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,904
Yes, I did.

320
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,364
Are you going to tell the production team?

321
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:50,786
Why would I? I'm not the type
to go out of my way to stir up trouble.

322
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,876
So, does it mean I've just lost a guy?

323
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,505
Yes, you just broke up with him.
I heard everything.

324
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,633
No, I'm talking about you.

325
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,179
I bet you now have no feelings
for me whatsoever.

326
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,264
I never had feelings for you.

327
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,808
-What?
-Sorry?

328
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:17,729
So you weren't interested in me?

329
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,314
No.

330
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,150
Then who…

331
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,613
Well, I'm not sure yet.

332
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:32,828
Oh, I looked for you to give you this.

333
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,083
I noticed you fell
during the game earlier.

334
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,669
Oh, no. You're hurt.

335
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,340
I should've protected you.

336
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,759
I guess I got
a little too worked up. I'm sorry.

337
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:55,225
Well, I owe you one,

338
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:59,104
so I promise I'll choose you
in the first round.

339
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:02,440
It'd be nice if you could choose me too.

340
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,568
Let's be loyal to each other.

341
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:10,907
A loyal man who never betrays you
tends to be more popular.

342
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,410
LOYALTY

343
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,163
Anyway, when did you see this?

344
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,666
Well, just now.

345
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,549
You know…

346
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,307
I find Choi Yu-yeong attractive.

347
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:37,642
Yu-yeong?

348
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:41,104
Yes. She smiles a lot and seems easygoing.

349
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,608
I thought there was good chemistry
between you and Hui-seon.

350
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,278
Well, I like people who are fun.

351
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,658
So, you find Yu-yeong more fun.

352
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,210
Why did you, everyone's ideal son-in-law,
decide to come on a dating show?

353
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:15,138
The ideal son-in-law title is nice,
as is being everyone's favorite host.

354
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:18,099
I'm grateful for everything,
but it felt like something was…

355
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,062
missing in my life.

356
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,774
So for the first time in my life,
I turned around and looked back,

357
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,361
then saw something
I wanted back in my life.

358
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,451
I guess you'll have to edit this out.

359
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,579
Then…

360
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,668
I'm here because I now want to be
everyone's ideal boyfriend.

361
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,379
I see.

362
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,589
The winners will go get the hint.

363
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,970
-Are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

364
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,021
-Here, hold my hand.
-Thank you.

365
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,154
Can we finish this in time?

366
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,951
Watch your step.

367
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:22,330
-Hey, Min-gu.
-Yes.

368
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,999
What's everyone else doing?

369
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,709
They all paired up and went out.

370
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,837
-Really? Who got left out among the guys?
-Song Ki-baek.

371
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,380
Who's with him?

372
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,966
He wanted to rest.
I'll head back once I'm done here.

373
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,592
How could you leave him alone?

374
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,428
For God's sake.

375
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,929
I'm sorry.

376
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,224
We'll stick to the plan.

377
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,185
Sorry about that.

378
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,568
HEAVEN HOUSE

379
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,241
Man, I'm so frazzled.

380
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,163
Honestly, Kim Jeong-heon's going to make
the others look like fools.

381
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,165
What? Why? Song Ki-baek is here too.

382
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,002
I heard he's why
Men on the Run got canceled.

383
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,462
Oh, really?

384
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,423
Did he bribe the head writer or something?

385
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,632
Hold on.

386
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,634
Maybe he bribed her with something else.

387
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,428
-Like what?
-Well, you know.

388
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:20,764
-What?
-Is your mind in the gutter?

389
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:22,515
-No, it's not.
-Mr. Song.

390
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,318
What are you doing…

391
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,114
Hello, Ms. On Woo-ju.

392
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,993
This is our first time chatting
outside of those meetings.

393
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,747
What are you talking about--

394
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,376
I know you absolutely hate befriending
the cast members on your shows.

395
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,128
I must say, I almost took it personally.

396
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,715
But kudos to you for keeping your work
and personal life separate.

397
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,759
What is this nonsense--

398
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:01,179
Ms. On, just do what you normally do.

399
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:06,059
Go ahead and neglect me, as usual.

400
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,353
Neglect you? Me?

401
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,231
Oh, we're understaffed right now, so--

402
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,399
It's fine.

403
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:15,402
Keep neglecting me, as usual.

404
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,572
Since we're not close at all,
I ask you to keep neglecting me.

405
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,577
Go do what you need to do.

406
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,996
I need some alone time,
so you can get going.

407
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,957
Yes, go. Go on.

408
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,084
Go on.

409
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,379
I'll see you later at the shoot.

410
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:00,864
My goodness.

411
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,325
I've never seen someone

412
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,704
with such severe seasickness
in the 30 years I've been a fisherman.

413
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,957
And he's a big guy who looks like he could
catch a whale with his bare hands.

414
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,542
Hurry up, will you?

415
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,754
Gross! What the heck is he doing?

416
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,135
I hate you, Mom!

417
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,851
When celebrities have a shoot,
don't their fans send

418
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,812
coffee trucks
and other goodies to the set?

419
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,980
That's right.

420
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,398
How much does it cost?

421
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,525
Let's find out.

422
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,946
It's 1.2 million won?

423
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,199
It's 1.2 million?

424
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,659
Why? Do you want to start
a fan club for Ki-baek?

425
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,247
That's cool. Very cool.

426
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,670
What?

427
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,838
Why would you come here?

428
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,007
You're here?

429
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,051
A coffee truck?

430
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,846
Where?

431
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:13,937
I can have a cup of coffee and relax?

432
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,732
Time to relax.

433
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,784
Damn it.

434
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,913
Excuse me.

435
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,877
-Yes?
-Where's the set for Couples Paradise?

436
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,184
You're not allowed to sell
these things here.

437
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,687
Please leave, okay?

438
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,772
I'm not here to sell stuff.

439
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,400
I'm Song Ki-baek's brother.

440
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,653
I see.

441
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,697
Come with me.

442
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,911
Don't litter your cigarette butts.

443
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,037
Sorry.

444
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,123
No cigarette butts!

445
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,457
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

446
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:26,926
Hey, Un-baek.

447
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,636
-Check the other room.
-Thanks.

448
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,143
Mom missed work to make these.
It was nuts.

449
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,690
No, no. When I drink coffee…

450
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,070
RELAXED ATTITUDE

451
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,196
Let's go.

452
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,785
What are you doing?

453
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,621
Okay.

454
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,207
RELAXED ATTITUDE

455
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,631
You're a big guy,
yet you can't even pull this?

456
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,633
You need to work out.

457
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,845
Hold on.

458
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,557
Will this be enough?

459
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,978
-Thank you.
-My pleasure. Enjoy.

460
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,189
-Thank you.
-No problem. Enjoy.

461
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,273
Dig in.

462
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,567
Yes.

463
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,779
I told you not to go overboard.
Are you advertising that a celeb is here?

464
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,405
What is this?

465
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,490
ENJOY THE FOOD

466
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,908
Why did you make another sign?

467
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,993
Is it that obvious? I'm glad.

468
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,038
I've only seen stuff like this on TV.

469
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,331
Jeong-heon, you're so cool.

470
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,416
Jeong-heon, you really are a celebrity.

471
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,377
I guess I am.

472
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,461
Have some food. Enjoy.

473
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,545
Thank you.

474
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,173
-Enjoy. Yes.
-Enjoy.

475
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,051
What are you doing?

476
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:53,388
Mom missed work
and stayed up all night to make these.

477
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,765
I don't want them to spoil.

478
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,725
Hey.

479
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,353
Or is it that you're embarrassed?

480
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,271
Hey, why would I be embarrassed?

481
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,648
We'll have them later.

482
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:07,902
Hey, come on. I know you're embarrassed.

483
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,821
Seriously.

484
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,408
Damn it, I'm an idiot
for lugging them all the way here.

485
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,284
-Ki-baek, what's that?
-Hey.

486
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,411
Is that rice punch?

487
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,496
-Yes.
-Nice, can I have some?

488
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,664
Oh, sure thing.

489
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,041
Is this homemade rice punch?

490
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,751
Yes, it is.

491
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:26,295
Is this really homemade?

492
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,047
-Yes, help yourself.
-Whoa.

493
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,800
-I'll take one.
-Awesome.

494
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,343
-Help yourself.
-What's this?

495
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,261
What is it?

496
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,470
-Come here.
-Rice punch.

497
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,430
Have some.

498
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,347
Homemade rice punch.

499
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,557
This is so awesome.

500
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,225
-Awesome.
-Seung-hyeon.

501
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,768
-Come on.
-There are snacks.

502
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,398
-You and Geum-bi go over there.
-All right.

503
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,482
Come with me.

504
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,109
-But--
-This way.

505
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,698
-The rice punch is good.
-Last one.

506
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:54,615
Oh, yes.

507
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,329
Yes, make sure you don't skip meals.

508
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,081
All right.

509
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,129
God, you scared me.

510
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,798
May I help you?

511
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:18,431
We met earlier.
I'm Song Ki-baek's brother. Hello.

512
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,557
Yes, hi.

513
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,728
Do you have something to tell me?

514
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,025
It's for you.

515
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,989
PLEASE TAKE GOOD CARE OF KI-BAEK

516
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,284
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

517
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,661
Do you have some time?

518
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,790
-Pardon me?
-Do you have some time right now?

519
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,168
Well…

520
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,628
-There are snacks.
-Give me some.

521
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,506
It's good. It's homemade rice punch.

522
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,132
-Can I have this?
-It's so good.

523
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,383
Hey, try it.

524
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:55,885
You had coffee earlier.

525
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:56,969
Hey, that's not fair.

526
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:04,811
Eat up.

527
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,145
Hey, you guys--

528
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,897
Who wants the green tangerine flavor?

529
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,108
-It's tomato juice.
-Tomato.

530
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,401
-Tomato juice.
-Here's some more rice punch.

531
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,029
-Thank you.
-No problem.

532
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,531
-Thank you!
-No problem.

533
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,285
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

534
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,079
Oh, Ki-baek! They're so popular.

535
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,330
They're gone.

536
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,920
Oh, no. They're gone. Bummer.

537
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,632
This is the last one.

538
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,092
It's green tangerine juice.

539
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,219
Here.

540
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,679
Thank you.

541
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,472
It's cute.

542
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,309
We're all ready for the evening, right?

543
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,479
-We're almost ready.
-Hey, Ki-baek. Say cheese.

544
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,861
One more time. Cheese.

545
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,574
So, it's a wrap for today.

546
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,285
The guys can return to their rooms,

547
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,871
or feel free to stay here
to enjoy the food and drinks.

548
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,914
Good work today.

549
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,082
-Thank you.
-Great work.

550
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,292
-Good work.
-Thank you.

551
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,252
Let's clink our glasses.

552
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,796
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

553
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,263
It's okay. We'll take care of that.

554
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,098
Don't worry about it. This is my job.

555
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,477
Director Chae gave him a job
since we're understaffed.

556
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:31,856
I came voluntarily.

557
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,525
I missed the last ferry.

558
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:43,743
-Where are you going?
-We're done for the day, so I'm off.

559
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,163
Done for the day?
Says who? We are not done.

560
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,251
The crew is all gone,
so the real fun begins now.

561
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,254
-Pour me one too.
-Sure.

562
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,388
Cheers.

563
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,307
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

564
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,850
Ki-baek. Let me pour you one.

565
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,477
Oh, I'm good.

566
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,686
You can't drink?

567
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,647
Well, my stomach is a little upset.

568
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,564
Oh, no.

569
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,149
By the way,

570
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,402
she said all the guys had one shocking
thing in common. What could it be?

571
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,738
I have an important announcement.

572
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,699
The four guys here
have something in common.

573
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,661
You'll find it quite shocking.

574
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,580
Find out what it is.

575
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,791
If you figure out what it is,

576
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,503
you'll be given a huge advantage.

577
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,088
Do you know each other personally?

578
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,427
Oh, from the military?

579
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,137
I served in the army.

580
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,555
-Marine Corps.
-I got an exemption.

581
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,890
I served in the air force.

582
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,685
-Your MBTI type?
-ENTJ.

583
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,936
ISFP.

584
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,521
-What's that?
-No idea.

585
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,648
Maybe you all have the same birthday?

586
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,191
-Mine's in October.
-Me too.

587
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,026
Oh, mine too.

588
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,488
Mine's in September.

589
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:07,785
If it was that easy, they wouldn't have
turned it into a mission like this.

590
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,289
How are we supposed to figure it out
when you guys have no idea whatsoever?

591
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,625
We should put our heads together
and figure it out. Right?

592
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,586
Jeong-heon.

593
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:20,548
What was the hint you and Hui-seon got?

594
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,716
Can't you tell us?

595
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:22,967
Sorry?

596
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,139
Okay. Well, it is important to put
our heads together at a time like this.

597
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,062
Here.

598
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,356
What is this?

599
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,817
Anyone know what it means?

600
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,819
-You? Any ideas?
-No clue.

601
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,326
That cat looks very familiar.

602
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,164
-You scared me.
-Why are there so many mosquitoes here?

603
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,750
Shoot. Hold on.

604
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,004
There are so many mosquitoes.

605
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,672
-Please.
-If I spray it here--

606
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,007
I might die first.

607
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,133
Oh, hold on.

608
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,510
I see one here.

609
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,979
Sorry, are you okay?

610
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,359
No, I am not okay.

611
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,822
Hey, you said your stomach was upset.

612
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,451
Microphone check, one, two.

613
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,621
Guys, let's sing!

614
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,500
Hae-ri likes Kim Jeong-heon, right?

615
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,629
I tried to sound her out in the interview.
She said she was a fan.

616
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,713
WHO LIKES WHOM

617
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,382
We have a triangle here.

618
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,133
Can you put this in full-screen mode?

619
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:51,263
I think it's safe to say Hui-seon
and Seong-jun are already a couple.

620
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:52,932
Choi Yu-yeong.

621
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,934
She likes Kim Jeong-heon,

622
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:57,103
but she was giving
Song Ki-baek this look.

623
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,107
If it's Kim Jeong-heon, Song Ki-baek
and Choi Yu-yeong,

624
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,902
I'd say we should go for it
as the show's main love triangle.

625
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:09,198
As if Kim Jeong-heon would play along.
It's all for show.

626
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,034
-It'll be fun.
-It'll be fun.

627
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:20,751
Whatever you want to hear
I'll whisper it in your ear

628
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,211
-I love you
-I love you

629
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,379
With your lips

630
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,632
Tell me, tell me softly now
In my ear

631
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,550
Get married!

632
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,467
Tell me softly…

633
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:31,387
-I-na is there, right?
-She'll line up the song and come back.

634
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,055
Okay, let's go!

635
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,349
I had to throw in this Easter egg.

636
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,059
Get it? Pretty please?

637
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,274
"PRO AND AMATEUR"
BY ROO'RA

638
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,614
Who lined up this song?

639
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,075
It wasn't me.

640
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,911
-Why does it sound familiar?
-How do I know this song?

641
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,831
Okay.

642
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,671
SONG KI-BAEK

643
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,840
I can do anything and everything

644
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,050
I can make you love me

645
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,927
I can touch your heart

646
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,804
I can give you
All the love in the world

647
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,098
I can make you come to me and love me

648
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,850
It's nothing hard

649
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,977
I know when to end things
And how to leave you

650
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,062
There's nothing I don't know
I know everything

651
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,566
We first met like it was

652
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:29,862
A coincidental joke
And we talked

653
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:36,494
Your words captured my heart

654
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,498
It's nice to sing this after so long.

655
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:41,999
Did you line it up?

656
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,794
Hey, variety shows are all about
who gets more screen time.

657
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:49,256
Stop dwelling on the news show where
the camera was always zoomed in on you.

658
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,258
Listen when I'm talking.

659
00:41:53,552 --> 00:42:00,559
I'm crying this much
Because I wanted to trust you

660
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:08,400
I thought I'd never trade you
For anything in this world

661
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,072
Who can I talk to?

662
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:16,825
Would anyone understand the truth?

663
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,162
They all seem buzzed, right?

664
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,373
God, they're all totally drunk now.

665
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,500
Talk about good timing.

666
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,670
Send the message.

667
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,549
MESSAGE THE PERSON
YOU FEEL MOST ATTRACTED TO

668
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,842
Check your phone. They just texted us.

669
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,805
I want to go out into the world too

670
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:44,395
I want to show you my dreams
With confidence

671
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:48,482
My wings, I haven't been able to spread

672
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,776
Wow, you're good.

673
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:51,819
You're like a pro.

674
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,280
Right? He's like a singer.
My ears are happy.

675
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,990
He's really good.

676
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,870
I want to fly

677
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,957
I'm so impressed.

678
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,042
He's a really good singer.

679
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,753
That's our shared phone, right?

680
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,796
Yes.

681
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,090
-Did someone already text back?
-Park Seong-jun.

682
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,802
"Hui-seon, the moment I first saw you,

683
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:20,222
your intelligent and pure vibes
lit up ten billion stars in my heart."

684
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,933
Ten billion stars? As in ten billion won?

685
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,185
It's anonymous but he's so obvious.

686
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,688
Forward the messages
to the correct recipients.

687
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,772
Will do.

688
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,691
-I-na.
-Yes.

689
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,651
Hey, Min-gu. Pass me the phone.

690
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,238
What about Song Ki-baek?

691
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,992
He's still like a deer in headlights.

692
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,663
-We'll try to get him with Yu-yeong.
-I think he's already fallen for her.

693
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,624
-Really?
-How do you know?

694
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,250
When we were having snacks…

695
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,753
Woo-ju, you saw that too, right?

696
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,004
You were there too.

697
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
Oh, yeah.

698
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,177
It's green tangerine juice. Here.

699
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,513
Thank you. It's cute.

700
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,558
He did that?

701
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,978
He must really like her then.

702
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,897
He knew the camera wasn't rolling.

703
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,734
But how come we haven't heard back
from Song Ki-baek yet?

704
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,781
MESSAGE THE PERSON
YOU FEEL MOST ATTRACTED TO

705
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,828
It'd be nice if you could choose me too.

706
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,622
Let's be loyal to each other.

707
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,379
Cute, cute
You're so cute when you smile

708
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,590
You're so adorable, my darling

709
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:39,051
You're so cool

710
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,763
You look so dashing
That my heart is fluttering like…

711
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,481
I'm learning how to swim
So I won't drown in your eyes

712
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,734
YU-YEONG HAS SEAWEED STUCK
IN HER STRAIGHT, WHITE TEETH

713
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,324
YU-YEONG HAS SEAWEED
STUCK IN HER TEETH

714
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,997
CHOI, TEETH, SEAWEED

715
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,333
YU-YEONG, GET THAT SEAWEED
OUT OF YOUR TEETH

716
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,145
What's this?

717
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,107
Look in the mirror?

718
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,818
Oh, because she's good-looking?

719
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,319
He thinks she's pretty.

720
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,779
Did he write anything else?

721
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,907
What is this? What does he want?

722
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,201
Maybe he's not finished.

723
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,204
I-na, go and see if Yu-yeong has
something on her face.

724
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,747
Me?

725
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,416
Yes, you.

726
00:45:55,711 --> 00:46:02,301
I'm Louis Kim. Just call me Louis.
I'm 30 in Korean age.

727
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,760
I recently launched--

728
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,699
Ladies, you can--

729
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,313
Jesus Christ!

730
00:46:56,396 --> 00:46:58,273
You scared the crap out of me.

731
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,779
They're here to date,
and we're here to work.

732
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,072
You know that, right?

733
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,951
What-- Yeah, of course.

734
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,621
As a writer, you should never look
at any of them too fondly,

735
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,665
or hate any of them for that matter.

736
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,793
I do not want to see romance in your eyes
when we're working, okay?

737
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,963
What are you talking about?

738
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,758
Well, Ha-young said
she'd prod Ki-baek into action for sure,

739
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,385
so snap out of it.

740
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,262
Okay?

741
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,457
HEAVEN HOUSE

742
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,626
You didn't get a single message, did you?

743
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,919
NO ONE CHOSE YOU

744
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:04,631
By the way,
why did you send a message like that?

745
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,552
It's not like I wanted to do it.

746
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,886
But you wrote it.

747
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,390
What are you talking about? Are you okay?

748
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,809
I'm sorry.

749
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,062
It's fine if you want to
come across as quirky,

750
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,815
but you need to
at least get your message across.

751
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,108
Seriously.

752
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,901
What was that? That was so random.

753
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,154
Hey, turn off the camera.

754
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,365
We still have time.

755
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,493
We can film your interview anytime.

756
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,663
Just relax and be yourself.

757
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,625
You're doing your job very well right now.

758
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,711
My job?

759
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,504
You're provoking Kim Jeong-heon.

760
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:50,761
Are you saying my role here is
to provoke Kim Jeong-heon?

761
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,554
That's your weapon.

762
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,849
Stay right next to him,
even going forward.

763
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,686
And it wouldn't be a bad idea
to play a villain, if you can do it.

764
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,521
You know enough about showbiz.

765
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,773
When playing a minor role,

766
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,525
it helps to craft an image
that is conspicuous and loud.

767
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,760
Mr. Song.

768
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,181
You're doing a great job.

769
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,433
Am I?

770
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,938
Am I doing my job well?

771
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,564
Yes, of course.

772
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,655
Ms. On.

773
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:01,540
What was the potential you saw in me?

774
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,753
I told you. With your
heartfelt emotions and sincerity--

775
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,130
No, not that.

776
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,173
The real goal.

777
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:13,719
What?

778
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,763
Forget it.

779
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,685
But…

780
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,325
Well, the trails aren't hard going at all,

781
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:41,997
so just think that you're going hiking
as a couple and follow the trails.

782
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:47,294
Follow the trail we built,
and you'll see a blue shed.

783
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:52,382
Inside, you'll find a hint for the quiz,
so make sure you bring it with you.

784
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,134
We'll get going now.

785
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:01,349
I didn't know we'd draw names
to choose partners.

786
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,518
Ki-baek, are we meant to be or something?

787
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,440
I don't know about that,
but I know someone's not loyal.

788
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,445
Oh, I have such weak cell reception here.

789
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,030
I swear I sent you a message.

790
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,073
I wonder what happened.

791
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,410
Come on. Let's go.

792
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,141
They said we were going hiking.

793
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:46,686
Why is it so spooky here?

794
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,940
Well, I guess
this isn't an ordinary hiking trail.

795
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,825
Oh, should we follow Jeong-heon too?

796
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:05,580
No, we'll go our own way.

797
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,748
What?

798
00:52:07,707 --> 00:52:09,918
But everyone else is going that way.

799
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:18,844
The couples' hiking adventure has begun.
Spook them and lure them to the shed.

800
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:20,887
Is the special effects team on standby?

801
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,472
That path looks easier.

802
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,808
It's better to go this way. Trust me.

803
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,659
Un-baek, don't do that here.
Do it over there.

804
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,327
Okay.

805
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,002
Un-baek.

806
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,005
Not too close.
They should reach over there.

807
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,923
Okay, I got it.

808
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,387
Oh, they're here.

809
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,722
-Here they come!
-Hide!

810
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,864
What is this place? It's so spooky here.

811
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:24,117
Don't you feel cold?

812
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,411
Oh, this is--

813
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:30,498
It's like the hidden camera prank,
which you often see on variety shows.

814
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,667
Just stay calm and follow me.

815
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,712
I am following you, but…

816
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,341
What?

817
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:42,719
My God! Ki-baek, your face.

818
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:43,678
What?

819
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,138
My face?

820
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,598
What about it? Why?

821
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,433
Hurry up and follow me.

822
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,311
-What is it?
-Come on!

823
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,647
Why? What about my face? What is it?

824
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,773
Wait up.

825
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:58,026
-Don't touch me, please.
-Sorry? Why?

826
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,862
-Moving toward Park Seong-jun.
-What is that on your face?

827
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,864
What's wrong with my face?

828
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,533
Ki-baek.

829
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,411
I don't even see a trail here.
Can we keep going like this?

830
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,915
I really hate stuff like this. I'm scared.

831
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,125
Ki-baek, let's stop here.

832
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,586
Come on, Ki-baek.

833
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,463
Let's head back down, okay?

834
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:23,301
They said we'd get there in half an hour,
so let's just find the shed.

835
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,387
We need the hint, you know.

836
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,974
I'm right here, so don't worry.

837
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,895
Your face is scaring
the crap out of me right now.

838
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,855
We can do this, okay?

839
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,609
So let's just get that hint
and head back down. All right?

840
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,986
Man, this is nuts.

841
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:47,450
-Wait up.
-All right.

842
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,667
I'm scared.

843
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,920
We're okay. We'll be all right.

844
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,934
What?

845
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:13,893
What is it?

846
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,937
Ki-baek!

847
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,815
Ki-baek!

848
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,497
He fell and rolled off the trail? Where?

849
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,543
Well, we just followed the red rope, but…

850
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,378
Hey, call the police.

851
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,172
No, call 911 first.

852
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:46,009
No, no. Check the memory card
from Yu-yeong's camera first.

853
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,802
Hey, Woo-ju.

854
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,388
Woo-ju! Where are you going?

855
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,393
Mr. Song!

856
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,229
Mr. Song!

857
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,733
Mr. Song!

858
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,527
Where is he?

859
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:07,447
Mr. Song!

860
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:18,291
Mr. Song! Where are you? Mr. Song!

861
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,669
Hi. We're by the parking lot
at Mount Seongak.

862
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,380
-I couldn't find him.
-We searched but couldn't find him.

863
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,591
-A member is injured…
-This is nuts.

864
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:29,385
The guy who went missing in the woods.
Is it my brother?

865
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,388
I'm sorry.

866
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:34,307
Don't worry.

867
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,561
He won't die like this.
It's too embarrassing for him.

868
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,618
Director Chae.

869
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,203
Yes.

870
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,289
Why didn't you prepare thoroughly?

871
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,333
I'm sorry,

872
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:07,757
but we ran multiple simulations,
and I came here several times myself.

873
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,556
A cast member
has gone missing in the woods,

874
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,350
and the head writer went
into the woods without a plan.

875
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,145
Director Chae, aren't you in charge here?

876
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:21,729
I'm sorry.

877
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,107
-I have nothing to say.
-So, Ms. On--

878
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,195
Go and find them both, right now.

879
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,533
Or I'll blow up this damn show.

880
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:41,082
Ki-baek. Where are you?

881
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,709
Where--

882
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,464
Ki-baek! Mr. Song Ki-baek, where are you?

883
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,513
Mr. Song Ki-baek!

884
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:02,896
A shoe?

885
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,143
I just twisted it slightly. I'll be fine.

886
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:43,436
I'll just sleep it off.

887
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:47,732
I…

888
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,236
That hurt.

889
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,238
Oh, hey. I'm sorry.

890
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,660
Well…

891
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,714
Did we have a fight?

892
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,341
Nope.

893
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:17,637
But you won't even look at me.
And what about what you said earlier?

894
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,267
You've been acting strange
since yesterday. What's going on?

895
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:24,978
Don't you regret your decision?

896
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:39,951
Am I performing well enough
according to your plan?

897
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,872
You said I should do something,
and when you asked me

898
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:48,001
if I wanted to do it,
my heart skipped a beat.

899
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,005
Because everyone said it was all over,

900
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,215
but you said I should start afresh.

901
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,182
But who knew that new beginning--

902
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,394
meant that I had to let someone
use me as her tool?

903
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:09,105
What are you talking about?

904
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:11,024
When did I use you as a tool?

905
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,900
It was because of Kim Jeong-heon.

906
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,613
Everyone's a pro in this game,

907
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,282
so you needed an amateur
who could provoke Kim Jeong-heon

908
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,159
in an unpredictable manner.

909
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,912
And that's me, Song Ki-baek.

910
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,543
Look, I think there's been
a serious misunderstanding.

911
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,753
You know, I'm hurt.

912
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,257
I mean, I get it.

913
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,260
But you, Ms. On, you really hurt me.

914
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,263
But you know what?

915
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:45,391
I can't quite figure out why I'm hurt.

916
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,772
What was the potential you saw in me?

917
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,358
What was it that you saw in me?

918
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,078
My heart fluttered.

919
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,043
And right now…

920
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,756
my heart is fluttering.

921
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,595
FRANKLY SPEAKING

922
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:08,474
Sorry. I've never once thought
it could be true love.

923
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:12,311
Please welcome the new member.

924
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,439
The new girl is really something.

925
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:18,359
Is there someone you like here?

926
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,487
Are you all right? If you're having
a hard time, talk to someone.

927
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,697
You can talk to me too.

928
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,700
I like her even more now. Way more.

929
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:30,413
-Just say it. Don't keep it bottled up.
-I'm hurt, okay? I'm upset.

930
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,791
There's something I want to do.

931
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,877
Woo-ju, we've got a really big problem.

932
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:44,510
