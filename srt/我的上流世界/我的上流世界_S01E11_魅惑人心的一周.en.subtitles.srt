1
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,356
I found…

2
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,317
Han Ji-yong dead.

3
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,698
And there was someone else
at the top of the stairs.

4
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,453
15 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

5
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,038
-What was the ruling?
-How did it go?

6
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,748
-What was it?
-Please comment!

7
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,167
-Move aside!
-How did it go?

8
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,710
Please tell us!

9
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,504
-What was the ruling?
-Please move!

10
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,756
Please say a word or two!

11
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,674
-Move aside.
-Please!

12
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,719
Hawon Gallery, please.

13
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,388
-I have Bible study.
-Yes, ma'am.

14
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,310
Let's…

15
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,521
end our marriage.

16
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,108
I'm leaving Hyowon
and taking Ha-joon with me.

17
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:17,178
EPISODE 11
SOME ENCHANTED WEEK

18
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,576
I'm leaving Hyowon.

19
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,078
I will take Ha-joon with me…

20
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,622
and find a way to get over the high wall…

21
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,792
surrounding this place.

22
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,252
I will tell you…

23
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,713
how…

24
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,465
you can do that.

25
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,347
KANG JA-KYEONG

26
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,474
Hello?

27
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,145
How is…

28
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,273
Ms. Seo?

29
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,609
You have no right to ask about her.

30
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,571
Don't you ever show yourself
in front of Ha-joon, Hi-soo, or me again.

31
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,990
Ignore my warning,

32
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,577
-and I'll make you pay.
-Please…

33
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,579
Please tell me where she is.

34
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,289
Why do you want to know that?

35
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,291
There's something…

36
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,712
I have to tell her.

37
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,381
I beg you.

38
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,731
Leave at once.

39
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,578
You can go now. I want to be alone.

40
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,660
The doctor said
you should have seaweed soup.

41
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,496
Did I give birth?

42
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,582
I lost a baby.

43
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,252
I have no right to eat this.

44
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,922
And you have no right to be doing this.

45
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,841
You don't have anyone right now.

46
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,303
And you don't want…

47
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,014
anyone to see you like this.

48
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,267
You can't even tell your mother

49
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,560
or visit her.

50
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,230
I've been in your shoes.

51
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,692
So let me take care of you.

52
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,321
Leave at once.

53
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,282
Do you know how selfish you're being?

54
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,618
Do I have to tolerate you

55
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,704
just so you can ease your guilt?

56
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,457
Put up with it!

57
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,669
You need to be strong
if you want to fight against him.

58
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,383
So please eat something.

59
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,968
You need to be strong…

60
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,097
if you want to kill me or Han Ji-yong.

61
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,658
FAVORITES
MY SON HA-JOON

62
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,373
Mom.

63
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,169
I heard you went to Grandma's.
Why didn't you take me with you?

64
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,463
Are you eating well?

65
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,089
What about your homework?

66
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,635
You're not eating a lot of sweets
since I'm not there, are you?

67
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,970
Ask one question at a time.

68
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,307
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,352
I'm bombarding you with questions,
aren't I?

70
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,814
Mom, I want to go there.

71
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,320
I'll be staying here for a few more days.

72
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,533
Soo-young and Yu-yeon
will be taking care of you,

73
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,953
so be a good boy, okay?

74
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,707
Mom, I've prepared some Jonathan apples
for you.

75
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,127
What a good boy.

76
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,383
You're the kindest boy ever.

77
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,970
I love you, Mom.

78
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,098
Me too.

79
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,559
I love you too.

80
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,881
Doing this won't make me forgive you.

81
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,676
I don't expect you to.

82
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,312
After I found out I was pregnant,

83
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,773
I lived in hiding for a month.

84
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,527
Even from my mom.

85
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,865
Because I knew she'd care about me
more than the baby

86
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,868
and tell me to abort it.

87
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,122
But the moment he kicked…

88
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,834
and I felt a bond,

89
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,712
I encountered a whole new world.

90
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,343
I know I'm being shameless, but I beg you.

91
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,387
Please save Ha-joon…

92
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,766
from that hell and his father.

93
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,020
Please.

94
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,355
I beg you.

95
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,817
You should eat.

96
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,611
How long do you plan on staying here?

97
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:58,157
Until when will you cook for me
and take care of me?

98
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,663
How long will you be staying here?

99
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,710
One week.

100
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,254
I always needed a week…

101
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,841
to clear my head.

102
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,345
Then I'll stay…

103
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,972
for a week as well.

104
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,371
Eat with me.

105
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,025
Hi-soo.

106
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:25,578
I'll have Ms. Lee Hye-jin make
a custody transfer request.

107
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,125
You want me to hand Ha-joon over to her?

108
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,587
The public needs to acknowledge
that you're qualified

109
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,505
to be Ha-joon's mother.

110
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,258
You'll win the lawsuit in the end anyway.

111
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:44,430
It's crucial that we leave legal records
that'll taint Ji-yong's reputation.

112
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,975
After that, I'll file for divorce…

113
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,146
and leave the family with Ha-joon.

114
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,276
Should I address you as Kang Ja-kyeong…

115
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,236
or Lee Hye-jin?

116
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,323
Hye-jin.

117
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,575
Don't you feel…

118
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,411
terrible for Hi-soo?

119
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,791
-I do.
-Then…

120
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,668
do what I tell you.

121
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,380
Claim that they took Ha-joon from you…

122
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,175
and file a lawsuit against Hi-soo.

123
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,427
There's no doubt you'll lose.

124
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,888
I want you to start a losing fight.

125
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,224
Why must I do that?

126
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,850
For Ha-joon…

127
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,102
and for Hi-soo.

128
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,522
What do you think?

129
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,815
You have no choice, do you?

130
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,834
Ms. Lee hasn't tried to get him back
for the past six years.

131
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,336
After all this time,

132
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,963
she shows up and wants him back?

133
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,714
The father of my son, Han Ji-yong,

134
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,342
brought me in as my son's tutor.

135
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,344
Is Ms. Lee telling the truth,

136
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,973
-Ms. Seo?
-Yes. It's true.

137
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,125
-Hello.
-It's been a while, ma'am.

138
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,585
I want a necklace made.

139
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,255
-With a date engraved on it.
-Yes, ma'am.

140
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,177
She engraved the date of her baby's death…

141
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,222
on the necklace.

142
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,226
The baby she lost was engraved…

143
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,104
in her heart.

144
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,374
She prayed one last time for the baby…

145
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,504
she had parted ways with.

146
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,525
Let's go to Querencia.

147
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,027
I have something to give you.

148
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,947
Ms. Seo.

149
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,078
Thank you.

150
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,374
And…

151
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,877
I'm truly sorry.

152
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,156
This is Ha-joon's first tooth.

153
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,246
I think you should have it.

154
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,667
After all, you helped it grow.

155
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,261
A week's worth of time

156
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,180
is an enchanting gift

157
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,475
given by God.

158
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,728
In that time,

159
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,897
He created the heavens and the earth.

160
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,083
Something that's truly yours
that you'll leave behind in this world…

161
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:28,881
I sincerely hope you can find it
in this lifetime.

162
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,843
That'll be all.

163
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,766
Mother.

164
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,229
I'm afraid I won't be attending
Bible study for some time.

165
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,152
The media will report shocking news
about my family soon.

166
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,949
And contrary to what we've talked
about during our Bible study,

167
00:17:56,575 --> 00:18:01,246
I'll have no choice but to spew words
full of vengeance and hatred.

168
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,958
Please pray…

169
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,711
for my safe return.

170
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,756
It will be a righteous fight.

171
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,509
I'll pray hard and root for you.

172
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,094
I believe in you.

173
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,387
-I do too.
-Me too.

174
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,056
Thank you.

175
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,568
Han Ji-yong…

176
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,071
does not deserve to be his father!

177
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,533
Although the years I spent
with Han Ji-yong were lies,

178
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:42,496
every single moment I spent
with Ha-joon was real.

179
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,083
I'm leaving Hyowon
and taking Ha-joon with me.

180
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,129
Mr. Cho.

181
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:54,091
Summon the PR and legal teams
to the meeting room.

182
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,008
Yes, sir.

183
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,385
Wait.

184
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,139
Scratch that.
Summon only the two team leaders.

185
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,431
I prefer a small meeting.

186
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,975
I hate the hustle and bustle.

187
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,768
Understood, sir.

188
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,320
Hello?

189
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,698
Yes.

190
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,741
Sure.

191
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:21,952
Let's meet.

192
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,964
Maybe we should move Hyowon E&M
to this building.

193
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,050
That way, I can see you more often.

194
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,597
I heard those in management were replaced.

195
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,973
You're hard at work.

196
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,730
Do you believe you're qualified
to be the chairman?

197
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,074
The media is intimidated by you

198
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,161
and won't release anything
regarding the lawsuit.

199
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,079
And they never will.

200
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,583
But even if they do, it won't matter

201
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,627
because I have countermeasures in place.

202
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,672
Those weak countermeasures of yours
will only backfire on you.

203
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,550
Whether or not it was intentional,
you helped me.

204
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,677
Why?

205
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,263
Why did you fail to convince Soo-hyuk

206
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,766
and let me take this position?

207
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,229
Were you eyeing Jin-ho's position?

208
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,606
Or did you think you'd become

209
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:36,401
the chairwoman if you ousted Soo-hyuk?

210
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,489
You know very well
that you're unqualified.

211
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,702
Because I'm not part of the bloodline?

212
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,247
You know that's not why.

213
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:52,542
Then is it because of my unusual love life
that you mentioned before?

214
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,881
Do you think that can compare

215
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,092
to your unethical passions?

216
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,640
How could someone so lacking
in discernment

217
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,101
aspire to become Hyowon's chairman?

218
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,108
If you're truly concerned about our family

219
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,360
and don't want to taint Hyowon's image,

220
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,197
then you should be helping me.

221
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,575
As a senior member of our family,
you should strive to protect us

222
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,994
from these issues.

223
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,413
You should stand in
for your alcoholic husband

224
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,581
and protect us with all you've got.

225
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,878
We shouldn't be rivals, Seo-hyun.

226
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,046
Han Ji-yong.

227
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,049
Step down before you're forced to.

228
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,971
You know very well how much damage
a CEO's unethical actions

229
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,931
could cause to the company.

230
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,100
Ethics?

231
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,980
Can you name me one wealthy man
who's not promiscuous?

232
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:59,192
One's work ethics and private life
are different issues.

233
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,278
Cut the bullshit, Ji-yong.

234
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,738
You didn't hesitate to bring

235
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:06,074
your son's mother into the home
where you live with your wife.

236
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,203
Is that something that can be taken
lightly as a private matter?

237
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,040
Do you truly think so?

238
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,752
My father, whom you admire so much,
was no different.

239
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,512
So?

240
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,182
Are you saying it's like father, like son?

241
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,143
But that's impossible.

242
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,485
People will gradually find out
how despicable you really are.

243
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,322
Try to defend yourself.
Let's see what you can do.

244
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,785
I've given you the option.
The choice is yours.

245
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,914
Feel free to expose anything about me.

246
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,332
I've been waiting…

247
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,001
but haven't heard anything yet.

248
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,675
I unintentionally helped you
become the chairman.

249
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:07,969
So…

250
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,224
I'll take responsibility for it
at all costs.

251
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,870
No!

252
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,288
Jin-ho!

253
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,207
NEW EMPEROR OF HYOWON, HAN JI-YONG

254
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,959
Jin-ho!

255
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,045
My poor son…

256
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,675
Jin-ho! My poor son…

257
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,182
I swear someone called my name.

258
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,642
It's a withdrawal symptom.

259
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:59,563
HOPE
SMOOTH LIFE WITHOUT ALCOHOL

260
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:04,693
By the way, you said you're the eldest son
of Hyowon, right?

261
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,820
But I saw on the news today…

262
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,699
that the second son is chairman now.

263
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,742
I guess you missed it.

264
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,955
You're the only one

265
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,833
who goes by the rules
and hands in his phone.

266
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,335
Can you do a web search?

267
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,421
Sure.

268
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,923
Look.

269
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,344
HAN JI-YONG CONFIRMED
AS NEW LEADER OF HYOWON

270
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,934
Where are you going?

271
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,649
LETTER OF APOLOGY

272
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,864
Hello?

273
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,117
I'm taking time for self-reflection.

274
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,120
What did you say?

275
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,582
Are you serious?

276
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,169
How could they hold a board meeting
without us?

277
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,046
That's ridiculous.

278
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,465
Dad ordered them to hold it without us.

279
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,967
Damn it.

280
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,471
He just stormed out.

281
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:18,391
He was so worked up
that we couldn't stop him.

282
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,560
I understand.

283
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,313
Please have him discharged on paper.

284
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,648
I'll call you back.

285
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,944
HYOWON E&M
CEO JUNG SEO-HYUN

286
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,575
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

287
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,872
Mr. Kim, come here.

288
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,166
It's Code Red. The chairman…

289
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,753
I mean, Mr. Han Jin-ho
escaped from the treatment center.

290
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,171
He made a great escape.

291
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,547
What?

292
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,675
Then is he coming home?

293
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,926
I guess so.

294
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,814
HOPE
SMOOTH LIFE WITHOUT ALCOHOL

295
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,984
I've spotted the target! Over!

296
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,860
-Already?
-I'm hanging up!

297
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,491
Hey! Turn the car!

298
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,076
Turn it? Okay, turning it.

299
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:30,255
-Is Soo-hyuk home?
-No, he's not. He's at work.

300
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:33,633
About that maid….
The one Soo-hyuk has been seeing.

301
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,385
Have her come to my study.

302
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:40,223
-Answer me.
-Yes, sir.

303
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,858
-Ms. Yang.
-Yes?

304
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,068
Mr. Han Jin-ho is home.

305
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,612
-What?
-He escaped from the center.

306
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,933
Stay there.

307
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,769
I'll go down.

308
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,197
What's your name?

309
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,449
It's Kim Yu-yeon, sir.

310
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,368
Okay. Ms. Kim Ho-yeon.

311
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:45,622
I'll just cut to the chase.
Leave my house by the end of the day.

312
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:50,543
I'm a rational person when I'm sober,

313
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,253
and I'm very rational right now.

314
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,671
So leave.

315
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,925
I don't understand why I have to leave.

316
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,178
There's no reason! Just do as I say!

317
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,430
No. I won't.

318
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,100
-What?
-I don't understand

319
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,684
why I have to.

320
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,523
-Are all kids like this these days?
-Generally speaking, yes.

321
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,567
I…

322
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,985
I'm flabbergasted.

323
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,571
I've been fulfilling

324
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,491
all my contractual duties.

325
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,326
You seduced my son.

326
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,245
That's a good enough reason.

327
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,206
If having feelings for Soo-hyuk is
the reason I'm getting fired,

328
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,874
I think it's inappropriate.

329
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,753
Because firing me
won't stop me from liking him.

330
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,923
This just shows how ill-mannered you are.

331
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:39,759
How dare you talk back to him?

332
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,137
Do you think

333
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,140
it makes you seem smart and educated?

334
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,559
Do you think doing this makes you

335
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,437
seem like someone with high self-esteem?

336
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,563
You little…

337
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,065
It's obvious

338
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:59,529
you're trying to hit the jackpot and climb
the social ladder by seducing Soo-hyuk.

339
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,950
I'm old enough to see through you.
You can't fool me, you wench.

340
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:04,993
Get out at once!

341
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,995
I saw his true feelings.

342
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,498
I didn't fall for him because he's rich.

343
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,708
What a load of garbage.

344
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,004
Everyone in this family
is materialistic to the bone.

345
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,717
There's no way you can see
the lack of love and the pain he feels.

346
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,052
How much do you want?

347
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,388
I know you're after his money.

348
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,516
You want to seduce him
so you can live comfortably.

349
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,186
-That's not true.
-Don't lie!

350
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,313
You'll only make his life miserable.

351
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,273
Is that what you want?

352
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,361
He'll cut ties with his family and forgo
the right to become the heir to Hyowon.

353
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,947
Do you want to live in a tiny apartment
and make ends meet?

354
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,826
That'll be his fate if he refuses
to end it with you.

355
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,661
I'll see to it!

356
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,540
He's incapable of earning a single penny
on his own.

357
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,294
Kick her out at once.

358
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:01,758
Must I explain myself this much
just to fire one maid?

359
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,971
Tell Soo-hyuk I want to see him later.

360
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,349
You little…

361
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,921
PLAINTIFF: LEE HYE-JIN
COUNSEL: KIM NAM-TAE

362
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,173
I'm here to see Han Ji-yong!

363
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,844
What are you doing? What the hell is this?

364
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,561
Ms. Han is causing a scene.
She's demanding to see you.

365
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,437
-Don't let her in.
-Yes, sir.

366
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,280
He doesn't want to see anyone.

367
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:07,740
What?

368
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,702
I'm sure you've read the announcement
that anyone who causes

369
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,038
a scene will be punished
and dealt with by the personnel committee.

370
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,010
When you're angry,

371
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,597
carry the anger on your back like a baby
and comfort it.

372
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:36,227
Take three steps forward
and three steps back.

373
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,063
Move.

374
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,524
I'm trying to calm myself down.

375
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,617
Hey, Ji-yong! Open this door!

376
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,285
Open it! Now!

377
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:55,204
Let go of me!
What do you think you're doing?

378
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,040
How dare you touch me?

379
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,541
Let me go!

380
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,214
It's quite strange.

381
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,551
The press was at the courthouse…

382
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,471
but there's no news article about it.

383
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,974
I thought your comeback and the lawsuit
would be the talk of the town.

384
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,559
But all the main articles…

385
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,355
are about Mr. Han Ji-yong becoming
the chairman of Hyowon.

386
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:27,070
They'll release an online exclusive
at 6 p.m.

387
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,577
You can't release this article. Got that?

388
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:35,912
You may leave.

389
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,717
Hello?

390
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,095
I'm not allowed to post the article.

391
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,722
Why not?

392
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,476
All of the articles about the lawsuit
have been rejected.

393
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,895
If we post anything unfavorable
about Mr. Han,

394
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,356
Hyowon will stop sponsoring us.

395
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,316
They're intimidating us.

396
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:10,363
As you know, he's from a wealthy family
and he graduated from Seoul University.

397
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,825
Thanks to that,
he has a wide range of connections.

398
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:17,286
He has people in the press
and legal circles who are on his side.

399
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,205
We've been ordered by the higher-ups

400
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,332
not to write a word

401
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,543
about the lawsuit.

402
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,672
I'm sorry.

403
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,718
It's okay.

404
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,928
Thank you for your effort.

405
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:36,973
Thank you.

406
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,192
Thank you for everything.

407
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,528
-I hope we get along.
-Congratulations.

408
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,530
-Congratulations.
-I'll do my best.

409
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,282
-Congratulations.
-I'll work hard.

410
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,076
-Congratulations.
-I'll give it my all.

411
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,871
Excuse me. Let me take this.

412
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,205
Excuse me.

413
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,291
All right, then.

414
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,461
Hello?

415
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:13,259
DIRECTOR JUNG SEO-HYUN

416
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,434
It'll make you feel better.

417
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:23,811
Thank you.

418
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,197
This is S.H. Museum's event schedule
for this week, ma'am.

419
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,493
Give Skansky Ballet Company
an additional day to perform.

420
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,411
Pay for their accommodation as well.

421
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,498
They're poor artists.

422
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,209
Provide them with top-quality meals.

423
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,460
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,689
She left this piece for you.

425
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,526
She's leaving the country soon.

426
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,907
She looked like Suzy Choi…

427
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,243
but she denied it.

428
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,872
She was thankful for your support
and wanted you to have that.

429
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,054
KANG JA-KYEONG

430
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,640
Can I see you today?

431
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,490
Who is it this time?

432
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,451
It's your father. He kicked Yu-yeon out.

433
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:09,250
I'm going to make Soo-hyuk
the HR team leader at the hotel.

434
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,210
I should at least make him work hard.

435
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,129
He has no sense of reality.

436
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,175
I'm hanging up.

437
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,348
Is that the best you can do?

438
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,727
Do you know why
I've put up with everything?

439
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,312
I may not be qualified,

440
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,815
but I had high hopes for you.
It was all to give you the position.

441
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,984
-I don't want it.
-What did you say?

442
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,110
Did you hit my mom too?

443
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,529
You bastard.

444
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,703
I wanted an ordinary life.

445
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,208
I didn't want a life where I had too much
of one thing and too little of another.

446
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,584
I wanted to live…

447
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,545
like everybody else.

448
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,382
I finally know what I truly want,
so what's it to you?

449
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,259
That's no way to talk to your father.

450
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,595
You've gone insane.

451
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,555
I'm your father, you punk.

452
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,891
I have the right to meddle in your life.

453
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,393
-"What's it to me?"
-You're my father?

454
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,897
I didn't know
being a father was that easy.

455
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,607
Disown me.

456
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,651
I don't need a father…

457
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,778
like you.

458
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,115
I'm leaving this house.

459
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,493
Goodbye.

460
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,632
You've done well.

461
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,761
Now, what do you need me to do?

462
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:48,307
Did you sincerely ask Hi-soo
for forgiveness?

463
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,350
That one week…

464
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,103
we spent together…

465
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,772
wasn't enough.

466
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,982
You're right.

467
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,068
One week is too short.

468
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,112
Don't you think so?

469
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,406
You…

470
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,950
want to break Ji-yong, don't you?

471
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,206
Do what I tell you, just one more time.

472
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,999
HAN JI-YONG CONFIRMED
AS NEW LEADER OF HYOWON

473
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,509
JI-YONG

474
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,595
Yes?

475
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,431
I need to hand over an interesting story

476
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,601
in return for embargoing articles
regarding the lawsuit.

477
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,230
And I heard that your girlfriend
will be doing an interview.

478
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,277
What should I do?

479
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,822
I can't believe the leader of Hyowon is

480
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,450
threatening his sister-in-law
with her private matters.

481
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,828
I truly worry about Hyowon's future.

482
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,039
Do as you please.

483
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,923
Let me tend to everything
that goes around in this house.

484
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,426
Why all of a sudden?

485
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,388
I've been neglected
both at home and at work.

486
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,182
It's a chain reaction.
Everything has gone awry.

487
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,976
We hired a girl like Yu-yeon
and let Soo-hyuk rebel.

488
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,936
See?

489
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:59,397
Even Ji-yong's ex-lover
set foot in our house.

490
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,731
What are you saying?

491
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,943
Are you going to become
a househusband or something?

492
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:07,863
I want to be the one who hires
and fires the workers, at the least.

493
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,865
I want to manage them.

494
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,202
Speaking of which,
I'll find Yu-yeon's replacement.

495
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,871
And how exactly will you do that?

496
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,791
We need to fill her spot quickly
so she can't come back.

497
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,628
The girl who was doused with wine.

498
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,130
Do you mean Ju-hee, sir?

499
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:26,590
The one who recorded my voice?

500
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,509
-Bring her back.
-I won't allow it.

501
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,845
It's better to have someone
with experience. Bring her back.

502
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,972
Darn it. I said no.

503
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,974
Listen to me, will you?

504
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,310
I'm sure she's working elsewhere now.

505
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,895
She'll still come back.

506
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:42,898
She said this job was super interesting.
Or was it super fun?

507
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,609
Anyway, she'll come back
if you want her to.

508
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,238
Ms. Jung is home.

509
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,739
Ms. Jung is home.

510
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:13,804
Was there something more pressing
than receiving treatment?

511
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,556
How dare you send me to that center?

512
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,309
Soo-hyuk looks down on me because you do!

513
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,979
Are you and Ji-yong in on this?

514
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,106
After the engagement broke off,

515
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,066
you let him fall for that maid.

516
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,195
How much power and control
do you really have?

517
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:32,448
If you're ignorant,
you should at least not be reckless.

518
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,242
-What?
-I fired Yu-yeon.

519
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,869
You should've done that sooner.

520
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,913
You don't care since he's not your son.

521
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:43,167
I would kill her if I could.
She completely ruined it for him!

522
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,176
You don't think…

523
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,472
I'm qualified to be his mother, do you?

524
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,556
Of course not.

525
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,434
You don't think
I genuinely care for him, do you?

526
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,229
-If you did, this wouldn't have happened.
-If you knew that,

527
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,606
how could you…

528
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,568
not have understood his sincere
desires and thoughts

529
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,488
as his real father?

530
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,910
Do what you want. I won't stop you.

531
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,370
I was going to.

532
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,372
I'll do as I please.

533
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,749
However…

534
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:28,003
you must take responsibility
for your actions.

535
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,922
Don't forget that.

536
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,277
Yu-yeon.

537
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,920
I missed both lunch and dinner today.

538
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,424
What were you doing?

539
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,024
Are you surprised I eat so well?

540
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,734
-Yes.
-It's delicious.

541
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,469
One day, I'll give you this drawing.

542
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,512
Promise you'll meet with me.

543
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,432
You should complete it.

544
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:09,104
This will be the first and last drawing
we make together.

545
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,948
You draw the other wing…

546
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:25,162
because you're the only one
who can set your soul free.

547
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,690
Can I spend the night here?

548
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,276
Sure.

549
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,072
I'll get you clean bedsheets.

550
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,581
-Is that you?
-Yes.

551
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:11,834
You're so beautiful.

552
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,263
That was before the Lord called me.

553
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,144
I used to be an entertainer at Aesanggak,

554
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,770
a famous restaurant.

555
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,524
One of the entertainers…

556
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,652
was extremely gorgeous.

557
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,863
She was called Cheong-a.

558
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,407
But her real name was Kim Mi-ja.

559
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:50,122
She ended up falling in love
with a young customer there.

560
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,500
And she became pregnant with his child.

561
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,923
And I was the only one at Aesanggak
who knew about it.

562
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,092
Then…

563
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,637
a young businessman…

564
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,142
by the name of Han Suk-chul,
who owned a small mill,

565
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,269
visited the restaurant one day.

566
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,523
I fell in love with him at first sight…

567
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,695
but he fell head over heels for Mi-ja.

568
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,366
More importantly,

569
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:31,330
I heard she's carrying
her betrothed's baby.

570
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,167
Out of jealousy,

571
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:40,214
I told him that she was carrying
someone else's baby.

572
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:44,718
People heard about it soon,
and she was kicked out.

573
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,680
The man had two children.

574
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:50,849
However…

575
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,980
he loved her with all his heart.

576
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,193
So he had her move into his home.

577
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,196
And the baby was born.

578
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,784
He even added that boy
to his family register

579
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,661
and gave him a name.

580
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,331
Han Ji-yong.

581
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,885
After that incident,

582
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,596
I left the restaurant…

583
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,600
and decided to devote myself to the Lord.

584
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:40,023
I was destined to cross paths with you.

585
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,322
You are standing at the end…

586
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,536
of a long chapter in my life.

587
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,960
How could this be?

588
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,963
I'm sorry…

589
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,632
for not telling you sooner.

590
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,592
Hey. Who are you?

591
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,512
Who are you?

592
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,256
Father.

593
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,135
I'll convince Soo-hyuk,

594
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,430
so please withdraw the board's decision.

595
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,892
I promise to teach him well.

596
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,561
I know you don't trust me.

597
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,479
But he's different.

598
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,527
I'm okay with the fact
that you didn't choose me

599
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:33,780
because you chose Soo-hyuk instead.

600
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:38,410
And I'm truly grateful for that.

601
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:42,122
Please give him another chance.

602
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,292
You didn't attempt to persuade him once
and just gave it to Ji-yong.

603
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,085
Love…

604
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,090
Ji-yong.

605
00:50:53,925 --> 00:51:00,348
I've done him wrong one too many times.

606
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,684
What in the world are you talking about?

607
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,937
He's different from you.

608
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,274
I know. I'm aware of that.

609
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,860
That's why you always chose him over me.

610
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,821
Ji-yong…

611
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,242
is my son.

612
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,510
Do you really like me?

613
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,392
Am I not just your excuse to rebel?

614
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,478
What do you mean?

615
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,065
Do you really like me for who I am?

616
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:54,611
Or did you just grab my hand
because I was on your way out?

617
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,072
Women have a way of asking
confusing questions.

618
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:02,244
Why do people blame me
for your refusal to become chairman?

619
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,914
You refused because you didn't want it.

620
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,123
But they blame me.

621
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,417
I'm sorry.

622
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,463
I wouldn't be surprised if you get sick
and they blame me for it.

623
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,048
I left that house.

624
00:52:15,131 --> 00:52:16,800
And what will you do now?

625
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,143
I was interested in you
because you were handsome and kind.

626
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,521
But this is too tough for me to handle.

627
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,066
Bye.

628
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,377
I'm sorry for what you had to go through
because of me.

629
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,255
I promise to do better.

630
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,133
I…

631
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,678
love you.

632
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,131
I'll get going.

633
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,366
-Hello?
-It's me.

634
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,828
You have an interview today
before leaving, right?

635
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,954
Yes.

636
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,541
You can tell them about us.

637
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,128
I finally have…

638
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,257
the courage to fight
against the prejudice of this world.

639
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,479
Since Ji-yong became the ruler of Hyowon,

640
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,357
everyone has been trying to win his favor.

641
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:21,317
And it'll just get worse.

642
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,445
He hasn't been officially appointed yet.

643
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,571
That's true,

644
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,073
but the board is already on his side.

645
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,201
I'm going to hold a shareholders' meeting.

646
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,455
There's someone…

647
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,833
I'd like to support with my shares.

648
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:38,877
Who is it?

649
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,880
Jung Seo-hyun.

650
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,145
-Hello.
-Hello.

651
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,190
I wondered who you really worked for.

652
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,067
As I expected.

653
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:07,572
Why are you filing for divorce now,
after the custody transfer request?

654
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:10,825
You could've done it much sooner.

655
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,745
Because I wanted to leave with Ha-joon.

656
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:17,832
Getting a divorce
wouldn't have been a problem.

657
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,003
But taking him with me wasn't possible.

658
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,048
After all, I'm not his real mom.

659
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:28,593
I needed the court's acknowledgement

660
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:31,096
that I'm qualified to be his mother.

661
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,431
Also…

662
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,810
because of the power I have.

663
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,190
Before leaving Hyowon,
I wanted to exercise my shareholder power.

664
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,776
Had I gotten a divorce first,

665
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,529
they would've taken my shares
away from me.

666
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,951
Please help me exercise my rights…

667
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,870
as effectively as I can.

668
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,665
Understood.

669
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:13,388
Did you and Hi-soo join hands
to screw me over?

670
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:19,060
The moment I learned about the lawsuit,
I did expect that might happen.

671
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:21,729
But I thought there was nothing

672
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,400
you two could do.
So I just sat back and watched.

673
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,447
If you don't stop here,

674
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,574
I'll really kill you.

675
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,164
Has it ever occurred to you
that you could be the one to die?

676
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,833
Get lost.

677
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,711
Come around here one more time

678
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,880
and I'll kill you.

679
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,535
Hello?

680
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,496
Where are you?

681
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,372
You're carrying my child.

682
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:24,375
You shouldn't go out as you please
without my permission.

683
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,714
I was all over the place,
so I couldn't ask.

684
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,382
Can you come home now?

685
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,676
Wait a little. I'll be right there.

686
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,731
I'm looking for Inspector Hwang Hyeong-su.

687
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,650
He's over there.

688
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:57,158
Oh, hello. Please.

689
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:04,999
INVESTIGATION REPORT

690
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,752
Thanks to his rap sheet,
it didn't take long to find him.

691
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,381
Name, Kwak Su-chang. Age, 37.

692
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,427
He has four previous convictions
for robbery, theft, and murder.

693
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,721
We checked his call log,

694
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,432
and he had called this number
this morning.

695
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,643
It turned out to be a corporate phone.

696
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,353
This is my brother's number.

697
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:31,150
We can't know the details
of the calls or texts, right?

698
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:34,737
If you want to formally charge him,
you need something solid.

699
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,824
The fact that he roamed around your house

700
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,742
isn't enough to charge him.

701
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:42,745
What the hell is his deal?

702
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,457
Can you at least give me his number?

703
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,180
RESTRICTED NUMBER

704
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,976
HAN JI-YONG IS NOT
THE CHAIRMAN'S BIOLOGICAL SON

705
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,858
He's different from you.

706
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:15,111
I know.
That's why you always chose him over me.

707
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:19,324
Ji-yong is my son.

708
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:28,082
Hello, my name is Lee Hye-jin.

709
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,127
I would like to tell you

710
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,005
about Mr. Han Ji-yong's
unforgivable actions

711
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:38,718
toward Ms. Seo Hi-soo and me.

712
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,025
I just sent you a file.

713
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:55,485
Yes, ma'am.

714
01:00:55,568 --> 01:01:00,323
Trim the video to two minutes and
secretly share it with the board tomorrow.

715
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,116
And lastly…

716
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,745
to Ji-yong as well.

717
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,121
Yes, ma'am.

718
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:22,804
Hello?

719
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,306
You know Han Ji-yong, right?

720
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,102
I caught you roaming around my house
yesterday.

721
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,521
I know about everything. I'm his brother.

722
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:33,981
Let's meet.

723
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,484
How do you know my brother?

724
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,153
-Are you guys--
-I'm planning to give him

725
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,489
the same fate he's given my brother.

726
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:42,949
What are you on about?

727
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,075
Hey…

728
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,662
You're…

729
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,124
not on my brother's side, are you?

730
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,793
Then we have to meet.

731
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,838
That bastard is my enemy too.

732
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,902
The chairman is home, ma'am.

733
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,490
"Chairman"?

734
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,381
Please think of the baby, will you?

735
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:42,175
You're right.

736
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,220
I should put the baby first…

737
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,975
but I just don't think
I can live with you anymore.

738
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,480
I won't divorce you.

739
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,734
-Why not?
-You're carrying my child.

740
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:00,735
Why…

741
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:04,280
Why are you trying to be a hindrance
to my future?

742
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:05,406
You're right.

743
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:09,452
I've become a hindrance

744
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,537
when I should be congratulating you.

745
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,543
If you truly want a divorce,

746
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:21,047
have the baby and leave it here.

747
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,675
-It's mine.
-I don't think that's possible.

748
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,805
I've been quite busy.

749
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,811
The nursery is ready.

750
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,187
Do you want to see?

751
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,457
Is my baby…

752
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:40,543
all right?

753
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,092
Do you mean…

754
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:50,636
my baby?

755
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,265
It's gone.

756
01:04:57,977 --> 01:04:59,145
It's dead.

757
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,733
You killed…

758
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,776
my baby.

759
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,070
You…

760
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,239
Nothing will go your way.

761
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,575
I'm going to get rid of people
who aren't on my side one at a time.

762
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,245
Just tell the reporter
what Han Ji-yong did.

763
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,706
You cannot entrust him with Hyowon Group.

764
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,332
Your emotions cannot sway your decision.

765
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:46,168
You know where the secret place
at Cadenza is, right?

766
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:47,753
How dare you take over the company?

767
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:49,588
Do you think you deserve
to be the chairman?

768
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:53,050
I will take responsibility for my actions.

769
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:54,051
It's all over now.

770
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,637
I will reveal the true face
of Han Ji-yong to the world

771
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,556
and make him face judgment.

772
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,560
