00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,762
EPISODE 4
STRAIT IS THE GATE

2
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,848
"Enter in by the narrow gate.

3
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,770
For the gate is wide and the way is broad
that leads to destruction,

4
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,814
and there are many who enter in by it.

5
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,701
How the gate is narrow and the way is
restricted that leads to life.

6
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,622
There are few people who find it."

7
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,350
Ms. Seo is on her way out.

8
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,519
I want a security guard with her.

9
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,561
I'm so sorry.

10
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:27,605
I got a medical report from the hospital.

11
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,440
My teeth hurt.

12
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,693
My doctor said my nerves might be damaged.

13
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,654
MEDICAL REPORT

14
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,408
I don't know what to say.

15
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,994
I tried to understand you
because I'm a mother, too.

16
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,788
So I had my son apologize to your son.

17
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,875
Not because I was scared of you,

18
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:51,004
but because I'm also a mother
and I could relate to you.

19
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,840
But you send someone
and resort to violence?

20
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,887
I guess your family can't resolve anything
without violence.

21
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,598
I am sincerely sorry.

22
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,602
You may not believe me,
but I didn't ask her to do that.

23
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,270
Then who did?

24
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,314
No one asked her to do it.

25
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,231
What?

26
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,111
Ha-joon's tutor is just overly loyal.

27
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,946
Unbelievable.

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,949
So you expect me to believe
that a tutor did

29
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,410
something like this
without her employer's order?

30
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,829
I can't let this slide.

31
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,873
I'll do anything you want.

32
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,459
I don't want our kids
to get hurt by this incident.

33
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,171
Ji-won and Ha-joon shouldn't become
victims of this.

34
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,716
What can I do to make it up to you?

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,887
First of all, have that crazy bitch
get on her knees, apologize to me,

36
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,598
and let me slap her
the way she slapped me.

37
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,683
Must you go that far?

38
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,562
This is between adults.
Can't we solve it more rationally?

39
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,607
No. I don't think I can do that.

40
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,694
No matter how hard I try,
I just can't understand this.

41
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,281
How could a mere tutor get
so emotional like that?

42
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,283
It felt as if…

43
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,830
Are you crazy?

44
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,959
Are you out of your mind?

45
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,088
Crazy bitch.

46
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:16,965
…she was a mother.

47
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,051
A mother who lost her mind over her son.

48
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,472
I still remember the look in her eyes.

49
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,105
Let's talk.

50
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,690
Yes, ma'am.

51
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,906
How long have you been working here?

52
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,867
This is my tenth year here.

53
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,955
You've been here long.

54
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,623
Yes, I have.

55
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,918
Then you must know everything about us.

56
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,428
But…

57
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,890
you don't know what happens to people
who know everything about us.

58
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,686
Your son works at Hyowon Hotel.

59
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,230
And your younger sibling works
at Hyowon Media, right?

60
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,107
Yes.

61
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,319
I want our families to work together
for a long time.

62
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,280
But if I get the feeling

63
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,408
that rumors of this place
stem from your extensive knowledge

64
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,577
everyone will have a hard time.

65
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,456
I'll be sure to keep that in mind.

66
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,209
I'm firing Yu-yeon tomorrow.

67
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,587
Have everyone keep their lips sealed.

68
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,881
Yes, ma'am.

69
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,887
Ms. Jung was like a chess player

70
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,140
who could control how the game played out.

71
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:54,228
And she was controlling everyone
without them knowing.

72
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,304
I just talked to Ji-won's mother.

73
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,181
Do you know what she said?

74
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,433
She wanted you to get slapped

75
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,352
and apologize to her on your knees.

76
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,855
I'll handle it.

77
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,483
That was intended
for this family, not you.

78
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,903
No. She was insulting me.
Do you understand that?

79
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,616
How did you find her house?

80
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,537
I asked Mr. Kim, your driver.

81
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,833
I will kneel…

82
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,626
and apologize.

83
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,921
Listen, Ms. Kang.

84
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,382
I don't want that.

85
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,093
I can't let someone who works for me
get humiliated.

86
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,137
Kneel in front of her? I can't have that.

87
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,307
I'll take care of it,

88
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,852
so please don't get involved.

89
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,105
How will you do that?

90
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,523
What's going on?

91
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,884
Is it true?

92
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,261
Is it?

93
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,765
Did you sleep in his room?

94
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,145
Answer me right now.

95
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,358
Did you sleep in Soo-hyuk's room?

96
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,279
-Yes.
-You!

97
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,533
How dare a dirty girl like you

98
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,117
seduce my Soo-hyuk?

99
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,953
How dare a lowly maid like you--

100
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,371
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,166
But I don't think I deserve
to get slapped.

102
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,001
What? You impudent brat!

103
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,295
Mother, please stop that!

104
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,506
-Mother.
-No. Not my precious Soo-hyuk.

105
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:13,553
Hey, you. My husband, your husband,
and even Jin-ho may have,

106
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,181
but I can't let my precious Soo-hyuk
fall for a lowly wench like her.

107
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,599
No!

108
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,477
You! Get rid of her at once!

109
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,939
Didn't you bring her in?
I want you to kick her out now!

110
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,567
Make her leave this house right now!

111
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,151
Right now! Do it at once!

112
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,913
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,833
I apologize on her behalf.

114
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,548
But why did you sleep there?

115
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,720
It's okay. You can tell me.

116
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,015
Did something happen between you two?

117
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,934
Nothing really happened.

118
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:02,935
We just…

119
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,106
swapped rooms at night.

120
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,025
But why?

121
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,988
Because he said that was
the only way he could sleep.

122
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,242
But I shouldn't have.

123
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,625
Strangely, we slept well
in each other's rooms.

124
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,794
That's why we switched rooms.

125
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,172
Even though I knew it was wrong.

126
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,177
I must've been out of my mind for a bit.

127
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,263
This is serious.

128
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,060
You found refuge in each other's rooms.

129
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,437
I know what that means.

130
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,600
You didn't answer your phone.

131
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,769
I know it's out of line,
but I came to see you.

132
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,145
"Out of line"?

133
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,814
Is that what you just said?

134
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,651
Why are you here? To settle?

135
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,404
See you at the police station.

136
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,447
Wait.

137
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,825
May I enter?

138
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,788
Whatever you decide to do,
please accept my apology, ma'am.

139
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,390
Why did you do that?

140
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,309
Why did you take it so personally?

141
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,603
Did you want a bonus?

142
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,481
-I'm sorry.
-On your knees!

143
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,525
Can't you hear me?

144
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,402
Kneel. And I'll slap you.

145
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,863
Hey!

146
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:21,991
Unbelievable.

147
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,411
Can you handle the consequences?

148
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:26,829
What?

149
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,831
You were a florist before you got married.

150
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,417
You fabricated your identity.

151
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,377
But you did a sloppy job.

152
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,046
Did you think
changing your name would be all?

153
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,507
You…

154
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,427
were the best at Hydra.

155
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,346
Was your husband a client there?

156
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,312
I was wondering why the mother of a son
who goes to an elite elementary school

157
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,440
behaved like such a lowly bully.

158
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,026
So I looked into your past.

159
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,528
Does your son

160
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,531
know about your past?

161
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,658
Should I tell him?

162
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,953
It does say this
in first-graders' textbooks.

163
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,331
"All jobs are equally honorable."

164
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,126
Should we see if he agrees
with what he learned?

165
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,004
If you mess with me again,

166
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,298
I'm going to email your son

167
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:25,304
the names and information of every single
one of the sixty clients you had.

168
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,936
If your son ever bullies my son…

169
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,526
out of jealousy
for his highest marks again,

170
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,279
I will crush your son's soul…

171
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,740
with my own two hands.

172
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,369
Remember that.

173
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,895
My son,

174
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,231
Ha-joon.

175
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,026
Let me hold him just once.

176
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,571
That's all I want.

177
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,031
I thought that would be enough.

178
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,201
But…

179
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,537
it wasn't.

180
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,144
It took so long to train her…

181
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,616
-That's a good spot.
-Did something happen?

182
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,453
Tell me what happened.

183
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,705
Well…

184
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,002
your grandmother found out
that the new maid, Kim Yu-yeon,

185
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,171
slept in your room.

186
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,172
And?

187
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,383
So your grandmother kicked her out.

188
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,510
Where did she go?

189
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,597
We don't know that.

190
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,227
Did my grandmother hit her?

191
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,190
Yes, she did.

192
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,525
Ms. Seo took the maid with her,

193
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,527
but she's not at Rubato.

194
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,349
Listen.

195
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,352
Don't think about doing anything with him.

196
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,073
Hello?

197
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,413
Yes, that's right.
She is with me right now.

198
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,792
No. It's too late.

199
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,752
Come back tomorrow morning and talk--

200
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,213
Hello?

201
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,007
Hello?

202
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,536
Hello. I'm Han Soo-hyuk.

203
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,329
I know.

204
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,207
Hi-soo told me. Ms. Kim is here, right?

205
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,670
I tried to tell you on the phone,
but you just hung up on me.

206
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,132
You could have come in the morning.

207
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,760
If it's not too much trouble,
may I come in?

208
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,055
No, you may not. This is where nuns live.

209
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,265
Men aren't allowed to come inside.

210
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,852
Wait outside for a minute.

211
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,691
Please let me take her back.

212
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,319
All right.

213
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,033
I think she knew you were coming and left.

214
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,621
Maybe she left
while I was in the prayer room.

215
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,165
Where would she go?

216
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,627
Seeing how she took all her belongings,

217
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,712
I don't think she's coming back here.

218
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,885
It's better to leave her alone.

219
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,304
For you

220
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,974
and for Yu-yeon as well.

221
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,019
-I want to know where she lives.
-I don't know.

222
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,603
I went to see Father.

223
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,022
Is he getting better?

224
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:54,193
No. I think we should prepare ourselves.

225
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,487
Do you know anything

226
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,075
about your father's will?

227
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,203
Only Mr. Choi, his lawyer, knows.

228
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,704
I don't know anything.

229
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,627
Thank you for keeping your promise.

230
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,679
Good night.

231
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,956
That jerk Ji-yong never drinks with us.

232
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,916
Does he have a mistress?

233
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,751
As if.

234
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,545
He's so devoted to his wife.

235
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,092
Have you been to Seorae Village lately?

236
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,594
I'm talking about Chwiseondang.

237
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,514
You know, where your Hui-bin lives.

238
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,933
It's over.

239
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,229
We can't talk for more than 20 minutes.
So I get bored.

240
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:14,940
Talking is the most important
aspect for me.

241
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,024
Of course.

242
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,484
I know that firsthand.

243
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,071
She's speaking Korean,
but you can't communicate.

244
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,783
You're with her,
but you still feel like you're alone.

245
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,665
I know you and I are
kind of on the same path,

246
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,293
but I'm on my sister's side.

247
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,378
If you truly love your sister,

248
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,505
please help me divorce her.

249
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,300
Tell her to divorce the man
who doesn't love her.

250
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,635
Please talk to her.

251
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,430
How come Jin-hee and I have
such messy lives?

252
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,224
Both of us are lonely.

253
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,643
But we don't really get along well either.

254
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,188
But Ji-yong really is…

255
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,066
quite different, isn't he?

256
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,068
You don't seem related.

257
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,238
Having different mothers
really makes a difference.

258
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,367
I can't see through Ji-yong.

259
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,661
He's very murky.

260
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,888
I will bring Ms. Kim back.

261
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,141
You can't.

262
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,643
You don't care about me.

263
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,856
I know I'm your stepmom,
but don't you think I should at least try

264
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,444
to fulfill my obvious duties
and obligations as a mother?

265
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,446
What would

266
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,865
mothers do at times like this?

267
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,911
They'd make you get engaged to A-rim.

268
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,333
Is that all?

269
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,503
Are you going to follow

270
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,840
in the footsteps of the men
in this family?

271
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,551
You want a mistress?

272
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,016
In any case…

273
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,103
I will bring her back.

274
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,597
Mother Emma, I'm sorry
for leaving without saying goodbye.

275
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,813
I'm quitting that job.

276
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:37,434
I'm sorry.

277
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,020
I dropped it while dozing off.

278
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:47,986
Is there a reason

279
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,072
we should keep this a secret?

280
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,157
Yes, I…

281
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,744
I live from paycheck to paycheck

282
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,454
so I can't afford to lose this job.

283
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,248
But then again, you wouldn't understand.

284
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,500
I had a good night's sleep
for the first time in your room.

285
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,463
This is the last time.

286
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,049
-I can't promise you that.
-Hey.

287
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,468
Do you think I'm a joke?

288
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,514
No. Not at all.

289
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,702
That's the young master.

290
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,290
Young Master.

291
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,297
She was getting room and board here

292
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,633
because her house was too small?

293
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,676
Yes.

294
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:57,430
So there's no point going to her house.

295
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:03,103
Her father is deep in debt,
so she was hiding from loan sharks.

296
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:06,773
I heard that she was paying it back
with the money she made here.

297
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,820
Do you have feelings

298
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,614
for Yu-yeon?

299
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,241
-It's not like that.
-Come on.

300
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,076
I'm just sorry.

301
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,037
Jesus once said,

302
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:24,291
"Knock, and it will be opened for you.

303
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,667
Seek,

304
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,794
and you will find."

305
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,050
Do you go to church?

306
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,010
No.

307
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,220
I just like Jesus.

308
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,391
I see eye to eye with him on many things.

309
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,437
I'll see if I can find out her address.

310
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,230
Okay.

311
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,239
Young Master,

312
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,116
hang in there.

313
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,927
How is it? Do you like your job?

314
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,680
Of course. I'm very happy here.

315
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,643
Did you officially introduce yourself to
my mother-in-law? I don't think you did.

316
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,485
I did.

317
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,695
-You did?
-Yes.

318
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,406
But she doesn't even remember your name.

319
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:45,997
As I've said before, please let me know
if you have any problems.

320
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,415
I say this because

321
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,336
I'm the one who introduced you
so I would be partially responsible.

322
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,713
Of course. I haven't forgotten that.

323
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,925
-You may go.
-Okay.

324
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,245
Hey.

325
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:29,416
Tell Chef Jung to cook
spaghetti aglio e olio for me today.

326
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,333
Yes, ma'am.

327
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,294
I want to go see No-deok.
Follow me with the tray.

328
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:38,967
Bread.

329
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,412
As you wished,

330
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,582
I made Han Jin-ho the president.

331
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,754
But this is just temporary.

332
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,423
Don't let your guard down.

333
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,306
Mother did?

334
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,434
There's one more thing.

335
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,186
A few days ago,

336
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,607
Seong-tae saw Ms. Kang and Mr. Han Ji-yong
together in the garden.

337
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,650
What about that?

338
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,402
The mood between them was…

339
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,198
There's something
suspicious

340
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,784
about Kang Ja-kyeong.

341
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,081
Get me the Rubato maids
without Hi-soo knowing.

342
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,208
Yes, ma'am.

343
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,644
And go down.

344
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,066
Now, come back up.

345
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,444
Lower your hip forward.

346
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,655
Put your hand next to your foot.

347
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,824
And raise the other hand vertically.

348
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,994
Five, six,

349
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,872
seven, eight, nine…

350
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,876
HAN JIN-HEE RESIGNS
WILL THE BOYCOTT STOP?

351
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,255
CEO OF HYOWON BAKERY,
HAN JIN-HEE, RESIGNS

352
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,006
What is this?

353
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,139
Jin-ho.

354
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,183
Step down from all your positions.

355
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,394
Ji-yong will take over
Hyowon Bakery for now.

356
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,396
Ji-yong, that jerk.

357
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,401
Our stocks have been plummeting
for two days because of you.

358
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,237
Jin-ho, but…

359
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,406
Jin-ho.

360
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,700
Jin-ho.

361
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,244
Damn it. Come on.

362
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,917
Thank you.

363
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,882
-Ma'am.
-You can't do this to me.

364
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,803
Had you stopped that article,
it wouldn't have blown up like this.

365
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,890
Do you know how hard I've worked
for that bakery?

366
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,059
Why must I lose everything I worked for
because of one mistake?

367
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,311
Why?

368
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,272
You're jealous of me, aren't you?

369
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,608
You didn't think I would know?

370
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,903
You and Ji-yong have
an inferiority complex towards me!

371
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,322
Who has what?

372
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,074
You want me to do the same thing?

373
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,492
-What?
-You!

374
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,120
You're the one
with the inferiority complex.

375
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:57,498
You act like a delinquent teenager
who was never properly educated.

376
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,959
Because of your senseless behavior,

377
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,296
the image of the company and me
got crushed like that cream bun.

378
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,214
Know your place!

379
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,217
I've held back because I thought
you had psychological problems.

380
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:11,137
But if you yell at me
or mistreat me in any way again,

381
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,139
I'll beat you up.

382
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,768
What are you looking at?
Get out of my house right now.

383
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,188
I don't want to waste my time
being mad at you.

384
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,356
I said leave!

385
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,692
Did she lose…

386
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,282
I haven't acted in a while. It's hard now.

387
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,955
How was my acting?

388
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,083
What?

389
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,126
That was you just now.

390
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,045
Should I show you again?

391
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,714
She must've gone mad.

392
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,677
Whenever you need to vent,
come to Rubato like today.

393
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:52,804
I'm going upstairs.

394
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,939
Ma'am.

395
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,374
Here.

396
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,378
Thank you.

397
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,300
I'm waking up now.

398
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,136
Your acting is still flawless.

399
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,887
That was so cool.

400
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,056
You shouldn't think that way.

401
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,768
Resolving an issue with well-balanced
emotions and rational minds is cool.

402
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,395
But I can't do that with her.

403
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,731
So I must go down to her level.

404
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,608
It's an exhibit for autistic painters.

405
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,736
-Not too heavy, please.
-Okay.

406
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,572
MR. CHOI, LAWYER

407
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,287
Yes, Mr. Choi.

408
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,707
Did you look into Kang Ja-kyeong?

409
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:07,253
She's been working as a tutor
and guardian for over ten years.

410
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,422
She previously worked
for Iyeon Group's family.

411
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,340
She even went with them to Canada

412
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,594
and took care of their children
at a boarding school for five years.

413
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,679
She's known to have a deep attachment

414
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,891
and sense of responsibility
for the children she looks after.

415
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,561
I see. Thank you, Mr. Choi.

416
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,445
"Responsibility."

417
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,036
-Right. Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am.

418
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,330
If anyone asks you about the places I go,

419
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,748
ask me before telling them.

420
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,878
Ms. Kang told me
that you gave her the address…

421
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:53,424
of the house I visited
in Seongbuk-dong a few days ago.

422
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,259
I never told her any address, ma'am.

423
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:01,057
Why would I ever disclose such information
without your permission?

424
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,476
I never did that.

425
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,853
How did you find her house?

426
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,563
I asked Mr. Kim, your driver.

427
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,203
I think you should get
another stem cell transplant.

428
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,413
I'll draw some blood today.

429
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,924
I'll pay the 100 million won
for the 3 treatments up front.

430
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,059
Jin-hee.

431
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,813
Hang in there.

432
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,817
Scandals are bound to blow over.
It'll go away soon, so hang in there.

433
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,986
I'm fine.

434
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,362
Stop pretending.

435
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,990
Even little children are watching
the video and laughing.

436
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,700
How could you be fine?

437
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,744
Your cream bun scandal went viral
for days.

438
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,039
You never intended to console me, did you?

439
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,041
Just prepare yourself for a divorce.

440
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,836
Everyone knows
that you beat up your husband.

441
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,839
That's a false accusation.
I don't beat up people.

442
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:18,050
I'm a pacifist. I only throw things.

443
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,219
What's the difference?

444
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,726
I don't know about others,
but I'm on your side.

445
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,521
I saw how kind you were
when you were a kid.

446
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,109
And you were always nicer to me
than to my sister-in-law.

447
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,670
WEAK GPS SIGNAL
MOVE TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION

448
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,996
Is this Kim Yu-yeon's house?

449
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,249
Yes.

450
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,167
Is she home now?

451
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,253
No. She's not here.

452
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,965
-Are you--
-She's my big sister.

453
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,259
Who are you?

454
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,260
Right.

455
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,929
I'm someone who needs to meet your sister.

456
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:51,227
She works at a very nice company.
You can meet her there.

457
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,981
It's in the U.S. so she can't come home.

458
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,816
And she earns a lot of money, too.

459
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,319
She said we'll be able to move in a year.

460
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,031
Is that so?

461
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,094
-Welcome.
-Thank you for everything.

462
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,805
Hi, Mother Emma.

463
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:30,516
-I'll go and look around first.
-Excuse us.

464
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,393
-Isn't this place great?
-Hello.

465
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,602
-Hello.
-Hi.

466
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,397
Look at that.

467
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,399
-Hi, Jin-kyoung.
-Hi, Jin-kyoung.

468
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,652
-This is such a great exhibit.
-Thank you.

469
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,862
-See you later.
-See you.

470
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:43,946
Thanks.

471
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,742
I loved these artworks.

472
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,952
I'm so glad we did it.

473
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,841
-Ha-joon.
-Dad!

474
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,822
-Thank you so much for coming.
-We should be thanking you.

475
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,949
Thank you for sharing your wonderful art.

476
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,201
-Honey.
-Hey.

477
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,954
Oh, my.

478
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,665
I'm so proud of you. This is so cool.

479
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:39,043
Gosh, stop it.
There are a lot of people here.

480
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,087
Who cares? I can hug my wife.

481
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,594
That's Ji-won and his mother.
The one I told you about.

482
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,679
The one Ms. Kang slapped.

483
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,057
We should go and be nice to her.

484
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:57,978
Hey.

485
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,564
Hello, ma'am.

486
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:05,111
My gosh. Ms. Seo,
thank you so much for inviting us.

487
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,570
It's such an honor.

488
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:09,949
Well, then.
We'll enjoy the exhibition now.

489
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,575
Let's go.

490
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,044
Where did he go?

491
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,921
-Mom.
-Yes?

492
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,090
Is Ha-joon's mom really dead?

493
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,341
No.

494
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:32,221
You can't say that to anyone ever again.

495
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,475
Ha-joon's mother is not dead. Okay?

496
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,648
Then is she really Ha-joon's mother?

497
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,318
Of course. She's his mother.

498
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:53,576
Just like that, these people used
someone else's secrets to hide their own.

499
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,119
However…

500
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,080
there were secrets
that couldn't be covered up

501
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,373
even with others'.

502
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,062
You're here.

503
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,107
Hello, ma'am.

504
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,360
Why are you two here alone?

505
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,453
I'm going upstairs.

506
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,466
Gosh. Seo-hyun!

507
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,802
I knew you would come.

508
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,847
So people won't gossip about our family.

509
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,350
We must show that we get along just fine.

510
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,478
I mean,
Jin-hee did cause such big trouble.

511
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,899
I've seen couples pretend to get along,
but not sisters-in-law.

512
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,984
Fine, I'm in. Let's do that.

513
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,992
-Hello.
-Hello, sister.

514
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,118
Enjoy the exhibit.

515
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,345
MY LOVE

516
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,089
MY LOVE

517
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,915
THE NARROW GATE

518
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:35,589
That painting changed the hearts of many.

519
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,551
An elephant stuck
in a narrow gate and crying.

520
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,097
This elephant may exist in all of us.

521
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:46,183
And…

522
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,563
there was someone
who acted on that feeling.

523
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,210
-Hello?
-Soo-hyuk, it's me.

524
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,212
I know where Yu-yeon is.

525
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,631
I just heard from Mother Emma.

526
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,802
She's working
at a fast-food restaurant at night.

527
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,181
Soo-hyuk.

528
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,020
Follow your heart.

529
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,568
It's encouraging to see you buy artworks
at a high price

530
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,571
from this meaningful exhibition.

531
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,823
I wanted to support the good cause.

532
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,202
Is Uncle well?

533
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,328
Of course.

534
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,830
I'll go see him soon.

535
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,665
You're always welcome.

536
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:55,335
I hope you can understand
why I can't address you as Aunt.

537
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,506
That's fine. I don't expect you to.

538
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:10,142
Director Seo Jin-kyoung, who seemed
to have nothing to do with them,

539
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,061
was in fact, closely tied
to Hyowon Group's family.

540
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:15,355
Seo Jin-kyoung's husband was

541
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,192
Yang Soon-hye's older brother.

542
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,404
However,
no one ever addressed her as Aunt.

543
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,283
That was the only agony
of a mistress of a rich family

544
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,118
as well as her only freedom.

545
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,956
Where have you been?
You didn't answer your phone.

546
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,249
Were you looking for me?

547
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,377
I was on the phone with people from work,
so I couldn't answer it.

548
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,505
I'll get going first.

549
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:41,256
Will you be home early?

550
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,467
I will. I'm swimming with Ha-joon today.

551
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:45,469
Okay. Bye.

552
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,763
I'll leave quietly.

553
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,630
-"Each one of you is to love
-"Each one of you is to love

554
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,465
-his wife as himself,
-his wife as himself,

555
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,593
-and the wife is to respect her husband."
-and the wife is to respect her husband."

556
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,886
-Amen.
-Amen.

557
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:35,727
I hope we all have a good week.

558
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,938
And keep this quote in mind, too.

559
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,481
-Okay.
-Mother Emma.

560
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,277
-I have something to confess.
-Yes, Jasmin.

561
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,654
I want my husband to die.

562
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,118
So I bought a black tracksuit
and gave it to him as a present.

563
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,497
You see,
my husband goes jogging every night.

564
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,416
If he runs in a black tracksuit,

565
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,376
it's easier to get hit by a car.

566
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,381
So did your husband go jogging
in that tracksuit?

567
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,509
No. That pig has gotten fatter.

568
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,261
So it doesn't fit.

569
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,889
I know I'm a total bitch.

570
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:15,976
But I really hate my husband.

571
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,147
He blatantly cheats on me
and looks down on me.

572
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,442
Still, you can't wish
for your husband's death.

573
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:24,401
You'll be punished.

574
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,279
You can't think that way.

575
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,615
How could you wish
for your husband's death?

576
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,325
You should never do that.

577
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,995
How about you have an affair too
to get back at him?

578
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,956
Cheat on him like he does.

579
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,501
Yes.

580
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,088
I mean, commit the sin that's less grave.

581
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:49,384
For the disgusting sins
that the law can't punish,

582
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,137
I believe we're allowed

583
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,931
to take a little revenge.

584
00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:00,020
Trends are changing.
The Lord isn't that old-fashioned.

585
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,690
But that's not the answer.

586
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,484
Then what should I do?

587
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,070
You said you wanted your husband to die.

588
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,946
-Right.
-Then…

589
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,240
live your life
thinking your husband is dead.

590
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,663
Pretend it's his memorial service

591
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,165
and prepare a sumptuous feast for him
every day.

592
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:23,085
And stick a spoon
in the center of his rice bowl.

593
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,213
Try your best to be
a good wife to him every day.

594
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:28,090
What if they make up?

595
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,675
Then bring him back to life.

596
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,595
That's what it means to be saved.

597
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,598
The gate to salvation is narrow,
but it's open.

598
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,311
The Bible study

599
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,897
began from a charity called Ilsin.

600
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,694
A group of 12 who sponsored
the Daoom Welfare Foundation,

601
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:51,488
a foundation for single moms
set up by the elite.

602
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,325
They were called Ilsin.

603
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:08,588
THE DAOOM WELFARE FOUNDATION

604
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:11,508
I don't see the name
Kang Ja-kyeong on the list.

605
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,676
That's not necessary.

606
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,261
"That's not necessary."

607
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,013
I'm sure it was the same voice.

608
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,474
Her name was…

609
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,768
What was her name?

610
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:26,440
Right. It was Lee Hye-jin.

611
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,652
It's not Kang Ja-kyeong.

612
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,656
Lee Hye-jin…

613
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,201
NAME: LEE HYE-JIN
CHRISTIAN NAME: BONA

614
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,261
Excuse me. When does Kim Yu-yeon get here?

615
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,175
It's all my fault.

616
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,344
I'm sorry.

617
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,887
Why are you apologizing to me?

618
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:41,765
-Because of--
-I need to work.

619
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,029
Enjoy.

620
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,364
Thank you.

621
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:02,953
A burger and Coke, please.

622
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:45,787
I have self-respect
and feelings that can get hurt too.

623
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,665
I wasn't treated fairly.

624
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,836
I get jealous and sad.

625
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,089
I have all the same feelings
you guys have.

626
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,341
That was such a high-paying job.

627
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,802
Of course, I want it back.

628
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,054
So let's go back.

629
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,556
I thought you were sleeping.

630
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,477
Do you usually talk at length like that
to someone asleep?

631
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,355
I wouldn't have if I knew you weren't.

632
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,029
I won't get in your way,
so come back to your high-paying job.

633
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,868
But your family is unpleasant.

634
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,703
I find them unpleasant too.

635
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,709
I went to your house.

636
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:39,424
Think about the effort I made to find you.
Can you please come back?

637
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:45,305
The person who hit you is doing just fine,
but you're suffering out here.

638
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,310
I'm sorry.

639
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,066
I told my stepmother
that I would bring you back.

640
00:53:58,818 --> 00:53:59,986
If you don't come back,

641
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:02,238
I'll stay here and eat burgers all day.

642
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,905
There are elephants that are bound

643
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,282
to be stuck inside.

644
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:09,389
I've been working really hard lately,
although I don't know how long it'll last.

645
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,685
They say positions shape people.

646
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:15,353
I hope you'll change.

647
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:16,980
Ms. Jung.

648
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,566
Give me both the carrot and the stick.

649
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,859
Not just the stick.

650
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,822
We're so different, you know.

651
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:30,744
You have no idea what's going on
in this family,

652
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,871
so it forces me to know everything.

653
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,289
What happened this time?

654
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:43,631
How about you make a close friend
at work and at home?

655
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,301
It's hard to find someone
on the same wavelength.

656
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:53,516
Won't it be much better
if you and I become close friends?

657
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,521
I think that will be too difficult.

658
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,323
Gosh.

659
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:12,243
She's so mean. Seriously.

660
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,421
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

661
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,967
Look over here, Ha-joon.

662
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,388
You're so cute.

663
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,648
One, two, three.

664
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,776
So cute.

665
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:55,745
You look great.

666
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,332
Great.

667
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:02,836
That looks great.

668
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,214
That's enough for today, my prince.

669
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:09,300
No. Ms. Kang said I could play more.

670
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,011
Why stop now? We're having fun.

671
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,013
It's not that late yet.

672
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,807
Come out now. You'll catch a cold.

673
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,813
I need to talk to you.

674
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,065
Okay.

675
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,029
You must be cold.

676
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,660
Ms. Kang.

677
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,245
Yes.

678
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,372
You should leave.

679
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,377
I believe your resignation

680
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,254
will be best for everyone.

681
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,840
Is it about what I did to Ji-won's mother?

682
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,635
That's one reason.

683
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,846
More importantly,

684
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:58,808
I don't feel comfortable.

685
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:00,935
Strangely,

686
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,230
-you get--
-Do I get on your nerves?

687
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,152
I was looking for another expression.

688
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,653
But will it be okay?

689
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,324
-What do you mean?
-For Ha-joon, I mean.

690
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,037
Of course. It's just like having
new teachers every year at school.

691
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,122
The level of attachment must be different.

692
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,500
That's it. The level of attachment.

693
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,378
It makes me uncomfortable.

694
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:31,925
Okay.

695
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,887
If I make you that uncomfortable,

696
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:38,932
I will leave.

697
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,978
You'll get full pay for this month.

698
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,594
Do you need to talk to me?

699
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,683
I need to ask you something.

700
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,061
Ask me gently. Go easy on me.

701
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,066
You said Ha-joon's birth mom…

702
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,279
died in a car accident, right?

703
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:36,823
Yes.

704
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,866
How did you two meet?

705
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,834
You don't want to talk about it.

706
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,379
Forget it. I don't want to know--

707
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,172
She was my horseback riding coach.

708
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,135
And my horse trainer as well.

709
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:58,636
Horse?

710
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,638
Yes.

711
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,474
I see.

712
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,354
Can I ask you something too?

713
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,398
Yes.

714
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,986
What did you talk about with Ms. Kang?

715
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,156
I asked her to quit.

716
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:20,283
Why?

717
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,243
She's just…

718
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,621
too much.

719
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,206
She's too attached to Ha-joon.

720
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,418
Way too attached for a professional tutor.

721
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,212
You might think that I'm overreacting,

722
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,008
but it feels like she's coming
between Ha-joon and me.

723
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,344
This is ridiculous.

724
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,097
It upsets me
that I'm even thinking about this.

725
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:46,059
Pretend you didn't hear it.
Anyway, she makes me uncomfortable.

726
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,437
How could you fire someone
for personal reasons like that?

727
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,191
What's with you?

728
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,278
I mean…

729
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,907
With Jin-hee's scandal and everything,

730
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,034
firing employees for no good reason

731
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:04,911
won't be good for Ha-joon.

732
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,706
You fired the previous tutor over nothing.

733
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,249
Why the double standard?

734
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,378
I have my reasons for being like this.
Respect that.

735
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,830
KANG JA-KYEONG

736
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:56,963
Hello?

737
01:01:57,046 --> 01:01:58,506
It's me, Ms. Jung.

738
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,883
I think I have to quit.

739
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,971
What's wrong?

740
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:08,057
I think I got
on the wrong side of Ms. Seo.

741
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,726
I guess I'm…

742
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:12,395
not qualified for this job.

743
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:14,731
I'm sorry.

744
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,066
Okay.

745
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:20,319
If that's what Hi-soo decided,
I will respect her decision.

746
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:34,459
How irritating.

747
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:03,279
She wants me to leave.

748
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,401
How long will you follow me?

749
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,737
Until you accept my apology.

750
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,749
Hit me.

751
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,629
You got slapped because of me,
so you can slap me.

752
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,675
But your grandmother slapped me.

753
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,718
Slap me instead of her.

754
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:22,775
Have you ever been slapped?

755
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,823
Where are you going?

756
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,204
Home.

757
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,290
Whose home?

758
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:40,084
Yours.

759
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,925
Let's go together.

760
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,212
Thank you.

761
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:27,882
I'm coming back to the job,

762
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,843
but I don't want anything to do with you.

763
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:38,100
As you probably saw,
we live in different worlds.

764
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:42,271
My world is exhausting and suffocating.

765
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:44,482
In your eyes,

766
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,526
does my world look any better?

767
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:54,909
Let's go inside to this unpleasant family.

768
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,091
Grandmother.

769
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:12,969
Yes.

770
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,972
What brings you here?

771
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,933
I brought back the girl you kicked out.

772
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:21,435
What?

773
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,270
Don't bully her. Leave her alone.

774
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,940
No, I won't. I'll bully her.

775
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,193
-I can't let her stay here.
-No.

776
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,947
Don't hurt her ever again.

777
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:40,871
Soo-hyuk.

778
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:44,000
I couldn't sleep anywhere but in her room.
I started it.

779
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:45,876
Slap me instead.

780
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:48,629
No. There's no way
you caused such trouble.

781
01:06:48,713 --> 01:06:51,257
I'm sure that bitch seduced you, right?

782
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,299
No, she didn't!

783
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,802
Soo-hyuk, don't pity those people.

784
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:57,805
That's just their fate.

785
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:02,852
Then…

786
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:05,062
leave her alone.

787
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,608
If you don't,
I won't get engaged to A-rim.

788
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,360
-But--
-And please…

789
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:15,322
don't hit people who work here ever again.

790
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,244
Wait, Soo-hyuk.

791
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,436
Good morning.

792
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:47,605
Why did you kick her out?

793
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:51,358
Why did you fire such a nice tutor?

794
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:53,194
Are you turning into Aunt Jin-hee?

795
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:55,112
Han Ha-joon.

796
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,865
That's no way to talk to your mother.

797
01:07:58,449 --> 01:08:01,118
She hurt herself trying to save me!

798
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,664
I almost got hurt when I fell
from my horse, but she kept me safe!

799
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:10,086
Why are you punishing such a good tutor
instead of rewarding her?

800
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,751
Did you know Ms. Kang Ja-kyeong
before I hired her?

801
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,630
Who's Kang Ja-kyeong?

802
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:56,966
Ha-joon's new tutor.

803
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,890
-She's quitting.
-She is?

804
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,227
It was hard getting in here. Why quit now?

805
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,981
How do you know it was hard? I hired her.

806
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,068
I must be aware…

807
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,947
of everything that goes on
in this household.

808
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,366
So tell me.

809
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:43,387
Here you go.

810
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,890
Luckily, a security camera caught it.

811
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,186
I was told not to inform you.

812
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:52,479
I'm sorry, ma'am.

813
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,442
She was my horseback riding coach.

814
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,320
And my horse trainer as well.

815
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:01,530
You have beautiful legs.

816
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,240
Were you an athlete?

817
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,242
I used to ride horses.

818
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,745
I think Ha-joon has a knack for it.

819
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:11,123
The level of attachment.
It makes me uncomfortable.

820
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:13,292
We found a great tutor this time.

821
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,921
A real mother can never react
so rationally.

822
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:21,175
Do you truly love Ha-joon?

823
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:22,718
Thank you.

824
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,554
It feels like she's coming
between Ha-joon and me.

825
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:27,556
-One, two, three.
-Do I get on your nerves?

826
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:50,537
Don't leave.

827
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:04,093
The narrow gate at Hyowon Mansion

828
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:08,055
led to an inescapable destruction.

829
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,811
SPECIAL THANKS TO KWON SO-HYUN

830
01:11:32,913 --> 01:11:35,082
Is Ha-joon's birth mother really dead?

831
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:37,501
What kind of question is that?
That's harsh.

832
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,253
It's nothing compared to what
I'm going through.

833
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:40,379
Answer me.

834
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,506
I'm Im Seong-su from
Shinilgan Entertainment News.

835
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,009
Can you confirm the story
regarding Seo Hi-soo's son?

836
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,051
Why are you with me?

837
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,012
If we get divorced,
everything that you just mentioned

838
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,680
will be known to the whole world.

839
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,516
I shouldn't have hired Yu-yeon.

840
01:11:52,599 --> 01:11:54,435
There's someone else
that shouldn't have been hired.

841
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:55,978
Kang Ja-kyeong.

842
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:59,857
She's ominous as if
she's hiding something big.

843
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:03,819
