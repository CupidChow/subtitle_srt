EPISODE 10
THE REAL MOTHER

2
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,131
You must be Ha-joon.

3
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,151
How precious.

4
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,575
Nothing…

5
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,411
can take you away from me.

6
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,785
Are you in there?

7
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,547
Ji-yong. Ji-yong!

8
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:59,137
Ji-yong. Stop it right now!

9
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,600
Stop!

10
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,900
Goodness.

11
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,277
What? What happened?

12
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,919
What do you think you're doing?

13
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,963
You think life is that easy?

14
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,549
If you toss people away as you please,

15
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,968
do you think you won't face
any consequences?

16
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,223
You have no right to punish that woman.

17
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,892
Both she and I are your victims here.

18
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,896
I'm the only one who can punish her.

19
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,398
So don't you lay a finger on her.

20
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,148
Yes.

21
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,901
I went to the hospital as you ordered,
and he's not dead.

22
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,569
Okay.

23
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,868
How dare he?

24
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,766
How did you find out who I am?

25
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,852
I should know who killed my brother.

26
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,186
What a good brother.

27
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,857
Why didn't you go easy on him then?
I guess you didn't like him that much.

28
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,150
You killed him.

29
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,694
Did I beat him up?

30
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,487
You did.

31
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,324
Even if you wanted money,
you should have stopped.

32
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,701
-So you'll do anything for money?
-Damn you.

33
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,175
Hey.

34
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,427
Do you think I'm a joke?

35
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,263
If you know who I am,
you should know what I can do.

36
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,689
Low-lives like you

37
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,650
only know half the problem.

38
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,110
You useless fool.

39
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,655
Hey, do you think I would do this

40
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,283
without running a background check on you?

41
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,702
I choose losers like you
who deserve the beating

42
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,038
to make it more satisfying to watch!

43
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,917
You rotted in jail for ten years
for theft and murder.

44
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,585
Did you miss it?

45
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,884
Why did you tell me
that he's dead when he's alive?

46
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,262
He's dying. He's as good as dead!

47
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,933
You shouldn't say someone's dead
when they're alive.

48
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,518
Never.

49
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,687
Save my brother.

50
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,610
It's not up to me.

51
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,945
It's up to God.

52
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,395
Yes, doctor. Hello.

53
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,065
Really?

54
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,575
Who are these bastards?

55
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,661
Mr. Han! Come out!

56
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,038
Code red. It's code red!

57
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,331
What is it?

58
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,876
He already had his will ready.

59
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,627
Why wake up now?

60
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,212
How awkward.

61
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,132
But the doctor said
that you were the one who saved him.

62
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,051
Me?

63
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,388
Your father is conscious now.
What happens with the will?

64
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,932
We're back to square one, right?

65
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,853
You and I should go back
to square one too.

66
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,439
Jin-hee.

67
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,608
There is no square one for us.

68
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,402
Think about the day you first met me.

69
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,822
You fell for me at first sight.

70
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:11,824
I did?

71
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,203
Don't distort the past.

72
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:18,331
You were the one who chased after me.

73
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,084
Anyway, if you don't file for divorce
by the end of this week,

74
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,711
I'll do it myself.

75
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,923
I don't want to get a divorce.

76
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,216
I'd rather…

77
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,396
-Hello?
-Ma'am.

78
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,358
Mr. Han has regained consciousness.

79
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,109
He's conscious?

80
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,785
Now that the chairman is conscious,

81
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,079
shouldn't we put everything back
the way it was?

82
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,792
Yes, but he has to stay at the hospital.
And Ms. Yang found out about this place.

83
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,335
He won't be able to come here.

84
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,588
Since it's not a secret now,
it won't be fun for him anymore.

85
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,759
Hey.

86
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,011
Are you dating Kyeong-hye?

87
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,516
I wouldn't say that. It's just a fling.

88
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,352
You steal a diamond together
when it's just a fling?

89
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,021
I only did it with her
because we're not serious.

90
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,108
My ideal type is an honest woman…

91
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,361
with strong principles.

92
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,699
I thought you were gay.

93
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,451
Why would you assume that?

94
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,413
Well, you know,
you just seemed like it to me.

95
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,876
Well, I'm not. But I know someone who is.

96
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,673
I wasn't going to say anything
because I'm tight-lipped.

97
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,134
-Then don't.
-Come on. Listen.

98
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,344
Mr. Han Ji-yong…

99
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,346
is gay.

100
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,474
Stop giving me that nonsense.

101
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,226
Why would a gay man have two women…

102
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,395
Gosh. Forget it.
Why am I telling you this?

103
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,189
Two women? Who? Are you--

104
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,232
That's enough!

105
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,325
Do you want to have a drink with me?

106
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,535
I'll fix a nice drink for you.

107
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,829
Are you crazy?

108
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,582
Shut up. Shut your mouth.

109
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,417
Rock, paper, scissors!

110
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,753
Your toes won't spread.

111
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,173
-Goodness.
-Gosh. This is--

112
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,217
-Oh, my. What's that?
-What?

113
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,471
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

114
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,776
Very good.

115
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:57,281
His temperature and blood pressure
are normal. Sir, can you make a fist?

116
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,325
Yes. A strong grip.

117
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,831
He's conscious now,

118
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,416
but we must keep observing him.

119
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,876
His pupillary reflex is good.

120
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,170
And so are his temperature
and blood pressure.

121
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,217
Ma'am, you saved his life.

122
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,735
Is she trying to save him

123
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,112
or kill him?

124
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,448
But why does he have bruises?

125
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,610
Ms. Seo, the date for pleading
has been scheduled.

126
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,447
I'll come to you now.

127
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,457
Now, will you tell me why you chose me?

128
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,669
Her lawyer has an impressive record.

129
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:35,671
He's known as a nutjob lawyer.

130
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,966
Wearing a white button-down shirt
with a tie in court

131
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,801
is an unwritten rule.

132
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,512
But he wore hanbok to court once
and pissed off the judges.

133
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,308
A nutjob for another nutjob.

134
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,354
I know why you were fired
from the legal team at Hyowon Group.

135
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,234
You sided with the union when there was
an accident at Hyowon Chemicals.

136
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,070
You suggested compensating the workers.

137
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,697
That was only the reason on paper.

138
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,367
In fact, the chairman wanted
to compensate them as well.

139
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,745
The legal team didn't fire me.

140
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,415
Mr. Han Ji-yong did.

141
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

142
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,170
Go ahead.

143
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,006
Well, I was against helping him

144
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,425
launder money for his slush fund.

145
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,635
Keep going.

146
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,642
Yes.

147
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,895
Sir, I looked into the lawyer
Ms. Seo contacted.

148
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,188
Who is it?

149
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,523
It's Hwang Bo-in.

150
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,734
He was kicked out of our legal team
last year.

151
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,819
Who?

152
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,954
Han Ji-yong.

153
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:55,501
I will make you regret coming after me.

154
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,008
Seol-hwa.

155
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,306
Yes. It's me, Seol-hwa.

156
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,732
No-deok.

157
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,776
No-deok.

158
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,779
Oh, my goodness.

159
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,824
Is it the homing instinct?

160
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:13,829
There must be some genes in its brain
that enable neocortex expansion.

161
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,583
We should report it to Science.

162
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,670
How can a peacock leave
and come back on its own?

163
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,088
On the day Father woke up.

164
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,345
Wait.

165
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,308
Hold on.

166
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,144
Look at it closely. This…

167
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,189
This isn't No-deok.

168
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:44,944
This peacock's beak
looks different from No-deok's.

169
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,986
I can tell.

170
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,865
Right here. Its beak and eyes.

171
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,033
They look different.

172
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,327
This isn't No-deok. I'm sure of it.

173
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,955
Then what?

174
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,832
This bird came here,
pretending to be No-deok?

175
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,584
Hiding its true identity?

176
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,461
What?

177
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,116
Are you happy?

178
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,629
ALARM
WAKE UP

179
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,841
Where's my wife?

180
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,718
She went out with Ha-joon.

181
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,345
I don't know where they went.

182
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,555
Ms. Kim.

183
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,058
Aren't you Ha-joon's temporary tutor now?

184
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,601
I am.

185
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,146
From now on, you must report to me
whenever someone takes Ha-joon.

186
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,731
Even if that person is his mom.

187
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,691
Yes, sir.

188
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,836
A cow eats a lemon and it's really sour.

189
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,173
So the cow is frowning.

190
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,176
Do an impression.

191
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,322
That's so ugly. Gosh.

192
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,993
Stop.

193
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,080
Sir.

194
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,500
If you're drunk, just go to bed.

195
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,086
This is inappropriate.

196
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,597
Goodness.

197
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,398
What do you think you're doing?

198
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,316
Gosh. Look who's here.

199
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,824
The epitome of class,
elegance, and dignity.

200
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,033
My goddess.

201
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,786
Hello, Ms. Jung Seo-hyun.

202
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,665
Remember what I said?

203
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,084
I said if you drank again,

204
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,129
I wouldn't let it slide. Didn't I?

205
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,672
So what? What will you do?

206
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,340
Tell me!

207
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,301
Do you know who I am?

208
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:41,763
I'm Han Jin-ho, the most powerful man
in Hyowon Group.

209
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,764
How dare you?

210
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,476
You're nothing more than a drunk.

211
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,233
I'm sorry, Ms. Joo.

212
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,070
You can't slap him, so I did it for you.

213
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,906
Though it won't ease your anger.

214
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,742
Seong-tae.

215
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,244
Get this man away from here.

216
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,121
To where?

217
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,498
He got drunk in the bunker,
so put him there.

218
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,251
-Hey.
-Everyone, help Seong-tae.

219
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,046
Drunk people become a lot stronger
than usual.

220
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,882
-Let go.
-All right.

221
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,635
You assholes. Put me down.

222
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,178
Hey.

223
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,805
Hey, that hurts.

224
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,728
I'm truly sorry.

225
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,563
No, ma'am.

226
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,608
It's not like you slapped me.

227
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,319
Well, you know gratitude and apologies

228
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,031
aren't always expressed
by the right people.

229
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,701
I'm sure someone else has apologized
for my mistakes.

230
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,123
How's your cheek? Are you okay?

231
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,501
Yes, Ms. Jung.

232
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,760
I'll give you a number.

233
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,638
Ask for Director Park Hyeon-sang.

234
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,474
And tell him to send some of his people
to our house.

235
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,600
Okay.

236
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,852
Where exactly am I calling?

237
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,145
An alcohol treatment center.

238
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,230
Pardon?

239
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,129
Is it cool?

240
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:43,343
I used to be a hip and famous actress
just like the rappers you love.

241
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,933
Ha-joon, how about we have ramyeon today?

242
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,602
I really wanted to try it.

243
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,521
Ta-da.

244
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:58,275
Ramyeon tastes best
when you eat it from the lid.

245
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,319
But there's only one. What will we do?

246
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,864
Let's play rock-paper-scissors for it.

247
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,033
We'll only play one round. No sore losers.

248
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:06,950
Of course.

249
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,369
Rock, paper, scissors.

250
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,746
Yes!

251
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,291
All right.

252
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,587
Here.

253
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,017
Is it good?

254
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,602
How can it be this good?

255
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,657
When I did
my first solo exhibit in Havana,

256
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,413
a collector bought my artwork
at a very high price when I was a nobody.

257
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,626
That's when people started
to pay attention to my art.

258
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,255
Did you think I wouldn't know it was you?

259
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,468
That was the only thing
I could do for you.

260
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,097
And the easiest thing I could do…

261
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,933
with what I had.

262
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,477
You decided to change

263
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,814
this place little by little
instead of running away.

264
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:23,110
That was admirable. It was so you.

265
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,405
I just want you to be happy.

266
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,534
Is that really all you want?

267
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,215
Let's draw each other…

268
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:47,592
like the old days.

269
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,429
You are…

270
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,807
my painting.

271
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:58,103
Longing for you has become
a part of my life.

272
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,742
Thank you.

273
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,996
For the rest of my life,

274
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:19,374
I'll be longing for this moment.

275
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,104
Would you like some tea, ma'am?

276
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,775
Did Soo-hyuk…

277
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,029
Did he look happy with Yu-yeon?

278
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,823
Yes, he did.

279
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,534
That's a relief.

280
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,289
So he was happy…

281
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,293
That's all that matters.

282
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,673
You can go.

283
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,343
I'll go in later.

284
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,055
I'd like to be alone.

285
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,431
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,990
Kwak Hyeon-dong is being treated
at a nursing hospital in Gayang-dong.

287
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,075
-How is he?
-He's in a coma.

288
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:26,501
I want to save on some taxes,
and give it to those in need.

289
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,545
Who would criticize me for it?

290
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:32,090
I feel bad for them.
The brothers are both in debt.

291
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,343
Since they were convicted of theft,
they won't be able to get a job.

292
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,054
So I'm helping them.

293
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,349
But how do you know them?
Why are you going this far to help them?

294
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,102
Are you interrogating me?

295
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,521
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

296
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:47,647
You can go.

297
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,950
-Hello?
-It's me.

298
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,661
I have a hearing tomorrow.

299
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,663
Yes.

300
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,874
I thought you'd be curious.

301
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,461
You know that I hired Mr. Hwang Bo-in
to represent me.

302
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,547
How come you don't ask me why?

303
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,591
I was waiting for you to tell me.

304
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,387
Because whistleblowers are the scariest.

305
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,683
This is one of the best ways
to catch thieves.

306
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,852
Hire a man who used to be
a robber as a guard.

307
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:29,606
The lawyer who is well aware
of Hyowon's weaknesses

308
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,316
should represent us.

309
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,029
That way, we can stop scandals from
leaking from unexpected sources.

310
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,989
We don't know where they might come from.

311
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,409
Leave it to me.

312
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,410
Okay.

313
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,746
I will.

314
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,769
Is it good?

315
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:15,944
Hello.

316
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,197
-How have you been?
-Good.

317
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,575
Ha-joon, say hello.

318
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:26,037
He's a journalist who writes
all those stories in newspapers.

319
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,666
Hello. I'm Han Ha-joon.

320
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,922
No wonder why you were trying
so hard to protect and cherish him.

321
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,632
What a handsome boy.

322
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,968
Of course. He's my son.

323
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,223
This fight is between his birth mom
and the mom who raised him.

324
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,892
I'll handle this. You stay out of it.

325
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:51,563
She's the one fighting a losing fight.

326
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,149
She wants to take back Ha-joon now?

327
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,484
The fact that I am Ha-joon's father,

328
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,863
and that she left Ha-joon with me is true.

329
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,364
And what else is true?

330
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,410
I can just say
whatever she says is not true.

331
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,913
Like you said, she has no evidence.

332
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,792
I can just deny everything.

333
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,381
If she tells them
that our family hired her as a tutor,

334
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,008
what will you say?

335
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,926
I'll deny it.

336
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,929
The court won't leave him
with such an immoral dad.

337
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,098
On top of that, I'm a stepmom.

338
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,559
As a daughter-in-law of your family,

339
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,396
I should be able to turn the truth
into lies and the lies into truth.

340
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,648
I will not let that woman take my son.

341
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,202
I'm appearing in court soon.

342
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,748
Please emphasize that
I've been doing my best as his mother,

343
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,250
and don't write
about any scandalous gossip.

344
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,169
You must protect Ha-joon.

345
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,545
I give you my word.

346
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,756
And…

347
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,091
I'm coming back with a movie.

348
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,094
And I'll be in a drama series soon, too.

349
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,054
Really?

350
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,847
I want you to run it with that story.

351
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:11,059
But the lawsuit is huge,
so it might not get traction.

352
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,436
The two articles will create synergy.

353
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,105
The world will be busy…

354
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,025
talking about Hyowon Group
and my comeback.

355
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,860
Yes. Definitely.

356
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,324
Oh, my goodness.

357
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,994
I gave you a hard task, didn't I?

358
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,810
Who are you?

359
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,937
I called you three times.

360
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:57,939
I'm Han Jin-hee.

361
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,441
I told you I have no time to counsel you.

362
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,443
No. I must get counseling here.

363
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,445
My dad's conscious now.

364
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,322
He's going to check up on me.

365
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,785
If you're that busy,

366
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,998
just give me some document that says
I got counseling here with your signature.

367
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,875
Why did you come to me,

368
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,459
and not to a psychiatrist?

369
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,169
Because it'll be a problem later.

370
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,797
I must prove to the board
that I am management material.

371
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,716
And I have a lot to do.

372
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,303
People like you should not hold
important positions at a company.

373
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,846
Gosh.

374
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,599
You're quite sharp-tongued.

375
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,684
You know nothing about me.

376
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:39,188
This says everything about you.
You're rude, arrogant, and lack empathy.

377
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,901
And you have a big head!
You also look down on people.

378
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,404
How can a company succeed
when someone like you is in charge?

379
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,114
Even if the company succeeds,

380
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,658
the employees will be miserable to death!

381
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,788
You should try examining yourself
from an objective viewpoint.

382
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,461
My job…

383
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,924
is to comfort powerless people

384
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,469
who are treated unfairly
and can't get anything

385
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,471
despite their arduous efforts.

386
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,682
Arrogant and rude people like you
who got all their wealth

387
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,601
without making the tiniest effort

388
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,604
can just keep going on the path
they've been on.

389
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,481
I don't care if they go to hell!

390
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,819
Everyone in this world

391
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,696
was created equal.

392
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,991
People like you must hit rock bottom

393
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,910
and learn humility first!

394
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,580
Think about how many people you have hurt

395
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,833
and how you've broken their hearts
with your actions.

396
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,711
You ought to

397
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:47,924
seriously think about how you are going
to pay for your sins.

398
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,959
Open up!

399
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,628
Open up!

400
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,716
I can't breathe in here.

401
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,759
Let me out!

402
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,345
Please.

403
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,737
You can sit.

404
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,405
Okay.

405
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,951
Actually, I'm supposed to be praying now.

406
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,330
Take your time and gather yourself here.

407
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,707
Then, you should go home.

408
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,293
Okay. Thank you.

409
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,070
I can't determine its age
since it's a full-grown bird.

410
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,323
I'm a vet, not an ornithologist, you know.

411
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,494
-You specialize in dogs and cats, right?
-I told you to call a bird expert.

412
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,787
I specialize in dogs.

413
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,915
I thought you specialized in birds.
How could you get that wrong?

414
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,917
Birds. Dogs.

415
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,253
Can't you distinguish the two?
Are you deaf?

416
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,215
Mother. You said, "dogs."

417
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,425
Gosh. You're dumb as a bird.

418
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,968
I don't even have dogs.

419
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,639
Why would I ask for a vet
who specializes in dogs?

420
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,101
I thought you needed a vet
for another purpose.

421
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,602
Goodness.

422
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,105
Thank you. I'll call you later.

423
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,525
Goodness.

424
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,527
Besides, Mother.

425
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,196
There are no vets who specialize in birds!

426
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,407
I get why Jin-hee and you
are always fighting.

427
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,160
I can see Jin-hee takes after you.

428
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,037
Arrogant and lacking empathy.

429
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,040
What? How dare you say
such things to your mother-in-law?

430
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,292
And you can say I'm dumb as a bird?

431
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,461
You're frustrating. That's why I said it.

432
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,672
I don't just say things!

433
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,803
Let's have a look at its tail.

434
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,764
No-deok, spread your feathers.

435
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,058
Spread them. No-deok.

436
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,351
That won't work.

437
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,645
No-deok! Spread your feathers!

438
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,981
Do it!

439
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,983
Spread them!

440
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,124
Why did you want to see me?

441
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,631
I heard that
your birth mother loved this garden.

442
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,760
I don't know…

443
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,349
how to be a mother and I will never know.

444
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,101
But…

445
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:31,772
I don't think I've ever asked you
what makes you truly happy

446
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,568
and what you want to do with your life.

447
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,530
I know it's late, but let me ask.

448
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,325
What makes you happy?

449
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,743
Why do you care?

450
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,036
Tell me.

451
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,748
It took a lot of courage to ask you.

452
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,751
Give me…

453
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,172
a chance to be your real mother
at least once.

454
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,637
Do you really not want
to inherit Hyowon Group?

455
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,847
No.

456
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,061
I'd like to know why.

457
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,274
When I was young,

458
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,278
I went on a trip with my mom
to the Aegean Sea.

459
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,823
And when we got back, she left.

460
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,326
That's when I realized…

461
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,955
that when I gain something,
I must lose something in return.

462
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,039
And…

463
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,418
that I have to pay a bigger price
than others do.

464
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,965
I'll end up hurting some people
and paying a big price for it.

465
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,717
I don't want that.

466
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,804
Inheriting the company…

467
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,807
means I have to pay
an even bigger price for it.

468
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,148
I'll have to hurt the person I love
and never see her again.

469
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,985
What's the point of that?

470
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,081
Are you sure you won't regret it?

471
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,125
Yes.

472
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:17,295
Okay.

473
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:30,516
I bought this place with the money
I made from my first lead role.

474
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,311
This is Querencia.

475
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,774
Whenever I had a tough time,
I found comfort here.

476
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,194
I came here to cry whenever I wanted.

477
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,039
Mom, when do you want to cry?

478
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,625
When something breaks my heart…

479
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,004
in an unexpected way.

480
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,883
Right. That's when I want to cry, too.

481
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,594
Have you ever cried alone?

482
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,474
-I don't want to tell you.
-Why not?

483
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,684
If I do,

484
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,313
you'll come here and cry again.

485
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:20,066
Are you thinking about something
that might break my heart?

486
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,616
Yes.

487
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,785
Ha-joon.

488
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,914
You can tell me anything.

489
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,084
It's okay if I cry a bit.

490
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,212
I'm an adult,

491
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:43,547
so even if I cry, I can smile again.

492
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,801
I don't want there
to be any secrets between us.

493
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,054
Okay. No secrets.

494
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,682
Pinky promise.

495
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:55,935
Pinky promise.

496
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,733
But I won't tell you now.

497
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,237
Okay, but you have to tell me
some other time.

498
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,911
In return for your pinky promise,

499
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,373
I'll tell you about my plan
that I told no one else about.

500
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,041
I'll start acting again.

501
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,668
Do I have your blessing?

502
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,586
Of course!

503
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,588
That's so cool.

504
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,508
-Will you be on TV?
-Yes.

505
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,346
I think you're the prettiest in the world.

506
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,933
Ha-joon.

507
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:40,896
I want to be a mother you are proud of.

508
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,024
And…

509
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,695
whatever happens,
we have to get through it.

510
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,240
I'm going to protect you.

511
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,244
But even if someone takes me
away from you…

512
00:40:56,829 --> 00:41:00,541
and we can't be together,
don't be scared. Okay?

513
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,173
You're the coolest and bravest son
in the whole world.

514
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,428
Okay. I won't be scared.

515
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,850
Come here.

516
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,742
-There he is.
-He's out.

517
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,244
Mr. Kim, tell us what happened in court.

518
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,371
-Mr. Kim.
-A comment, please.

519
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,790
It's confirmed the plaintiff is
the birth mother.

520
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:43,959
We submitted the DNA test result today.

521
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,628
Did Ms. Seo know about the result?

522
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,379
-No comment.
-Will that be a problem?

523
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,548
-What do you think?
-Do you think you can win?

524
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,037
I'm sorry, Father.

525
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,416
Don't read the newspapers
or watch the news for now.

526
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,752
You need to recover.

527
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:28,921
And…

528
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,883
about Soo-hyuk…

529
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,304
He doesn't want to comply
with your wishes.

530
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,393
His engagement to Yeongwon's daughter
has been broken off, too.

531
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,146
He likes someone else.

532
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,400
Father.

533
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,526
I…

534
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,155
respect Soo-hyuk's wishes.

535
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,827
Ji-yong…

536
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,247
Bring him here.

537
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,833
No, Father.

538
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,713
It's not because he's not your son.

539
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:15,134
That man should never take your place.

540
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,385
Bring him here.

541
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,932
He's the only one.

542
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,728
You should give Jin-ho a chance instead.

543
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:26,687
Please.

544
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,277
Call Ji-yong here.

545
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,676
HOPE
SMOOTH LIFE WITHOUT ALCOHOL

546
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,304
-You should color that purple.
-Okay.

547
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,222
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

548
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,350
All right.

549
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,562
-I'm so cold.
-Hey.

550
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,231
I can't be here right now.

551
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,445
I'm Han Jin-ho of Hyowon Group.

552
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,741
My company is in a crisis.
My brother created a huge mess.

553
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,701
You know who I am, right?

554
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,996
Don't you keep up with the news?

555
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,917
Do you know who I am?

556
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:32,711
Scofield.

557
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,425
I know a way out of here.

558
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,512
Hey.

559
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,642
They're all alcoholics
who drank their lives away.

560
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,143
They don't care about the news.

561
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:49,937
Keep it down.

562
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:52,398
I might die if I stay here.

563
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,443
I've seen people who died
from alcohol poisoning,

564
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,197
but no one has died while being treated
here for the past ten years.

565
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,991
And I'm telling you
that I might be the first one.

566
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,495
“Those who seek death shall live.
Those who seek life shall die.”

567
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,040
You won't die. You won't.

568
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,919
What?

569
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,174
Damn it. This is driving me crazy.

570
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,139
LAW FIRM KIM & HWANG

PLAINTIFF: LEE HYE-JIN

573
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,664
-Hello?
-It's me.

574
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,499
Yes.

575
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,294
Father wants to see you.

576
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,422
Can you come over?

577
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:02,050
Okay.

578
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,899
MR. CHOI, LAWYER

579
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,279
It's me.

580
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,032
We need to meet.

581
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,536
-To my father's hospital.
-Yes, sir.

582
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,418
Hello?

583
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,045
Soo-hyuk is going to officially

584
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,422
notify the board
that he won't inherit the company.

585
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,133
And the chairman is aware of this.

586
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,552
Okay.

587
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,490
Father asked for Ji-yong.

588
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:10,869
The chairman told me
he is withdrawing his will.

589
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,455
I think he chose Ji-yong.

590
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,960
I didn't see this coming.

591
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,837
Why did he suddenly make such a decision?

592
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,636
We have to proceed with plan B.

593
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,597
I'll get it ready.

594
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:04,756
Suk-chul, do you fancy Mi-ja?

595
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,674
Yes.

596
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,469
Seol-hwa,

597
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:13,807
can you introduce me to her?

598
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,605
But…

599
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,275
she's already betrothed to someone.

600
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,197
More importantly,

601
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:34,161
I heard she's carrying
her betrothed's baby.

602
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,905
Father.

603
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,533
I'm so grateful that you're conscious.

604
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,786
Father.

605
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:20,874
There hasn't been a single moment
when I didn't consider you my father.

606
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,418
I have no one else.

607
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,464
My birth mother already left me.

608
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:32,177
If you leave me too,
I'll be completely alone.

609
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,721
Father.

610
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,473
Please…

611
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,227
live a long life.

612
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,032
I'm sorry for everything.

613
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,536
Father.

614
00:49:58,912 --> 00:49:59,746
Father…

615
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,044
Father.

616
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,551
Father…

617
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,659
Ji-yong…

618
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:40,746
Please…

619
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,458
take good care of Ji-yong to the end.

620
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,047
He's a poor soul.

621
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:56,762
I know.

622
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,597
I know that you will never…

623
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,641
choose me under any circumstances.

624
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,022
That no matter how competent I am,
as I'm not your biological son,

625
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,650
I can never inherit Hyowon Group.

626
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,154
I won't covet it.

627
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,033
Are you sure he's your son?

628
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,493
Yes.

629
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:22,913
So do you want to bring in only the baby?

630
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:25,540
Yes.

631
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,000
I…

632
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,338
will let your son carry my family name.

633
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,757
Raise him well.

634
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,927
Don't do what I did to you.

635
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,763
That will never happen…

636
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,765
because he's really mine.

637
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,310
You are my son, too.

638
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,105
I know…

639
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,358
that I'm not.

640
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:01,201
What? An alcohol treatment center?

641
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:02,786
Yes.

642
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,288
Did Seo-hyun send him?

643
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,083
He slapped me.

644
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,795
What? To punish him for slapping you,

645
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,380
she sent him to the center?

646
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:17,801
Your son has been drinking like a fish
in the chairman's secret bunker.

647
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,803
Ms. Jung had us remove
all the liquor there

648
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,097
and put everything back to how it was.

649
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,682
What?

650
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,560
Are you telling me
you've plastered the walls

651
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:29,437
with Kim Mi-ja's photos again? Is that it?

652
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:33,358
Goodness. I can't live like this.
This is driving me crazy.

653
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:36,611
What a miserable life I have!

654
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,530
Do you want to call Jin-hee over

655
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,907
-and have a cream bun fight with her?
-Shut up!

656
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,203
Jin-ho.

657
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:50,458
Jin-ho.

658
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:03,179
There's something
I haven't told you, Hi-soo.

659
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:05,891
Han Ji-yong…

660
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:08,435
is not Father's son.

661
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:12,355
His late mother who was also his nanny

662
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,859
started seeing Father when she was
already pregnant with Ji-yong.

663
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,616
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

664
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,244
Does Mother know?

665
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,371
Only Father and I know.

666
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,499
So that's why…

667
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,045
he could never inherit the company.

668
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,631
Ji-yong and Father…

669
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,216
have a complicated relationship.

670
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,928
Father loved her,

671
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:47,557
but he couldn't love the son
that she had with another man.

672
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,559
He was a selective romantic.

673
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,313
What a miserable fate Ji-yong has.

674
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,775
Not that I pity him.

675
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,443
That's why you must…

676
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,820
win this lawsuit.

677
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,074
You can do anything.

678
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,743
I'll be right behind you.

679
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,787
Okay, Seo-hyun.

680
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:10,872
I'm not scared because I have you.

681
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,673
-There they come.
-They're out.

682
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:26,221
-What was the focus of today's hearing?
-When will Ms. Seo appear in court?

683
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,891
I don't think it'll damage the reputation
of you or the company.

684
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:40,402
The plaintiff will appear in court
at the next hearing.

685
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,196
Ms. Seo will attend the hearing herself.

686
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,449
-Any other comment?
-A comment, please!

687
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,660
-What do you think will happen next?
-Wait!

688
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,296
All rise.

689
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:06,196
Case number 2021-31086.

690
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:07,989
Let's begin.

691
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,701
Plaintiff, tell us the reason

692
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:15,038
you decided to file this lawsuit.

693
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,750
Actually, this isn't a complicated case.

694
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,669
My client gave birth to the boy
and raised him for 18 months,

695
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,089
but Mr. Han Ji-yong took him
without her consent.

696
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,882
So she wants to get her son back.

697
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:30,220
Ms. Lee hasn't tried to get him back
for the past six years.

698
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,222
After all this time,

699
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:35,308
she shows up and wants him back?
How can she demand that?

700
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:37,268
This is unacceptable.

701
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,604
The boy is doing very well now.

702
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,649
We must take into consideration
the confusion the 8-year-old boy

703
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,984
will have if his surroundings change.

704
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,737
His birth mother, Ms. Lee,
is the one who built his body,

705
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,240
soul, and roots
for the first year and a half.

706
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:55,829
Here's the baby journal Ms. Lee wrote for
the first year and a half after his birth.

707
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,623
She recorded everything by herself,

708
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:02,794
from his birth to the first day he
crawled, rolled over, and had baby food.

709
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,463
FOR MY TINY BABY

710
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,929
AT 16 WEEKS

711
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,348
Ms. Lee Hye-jin.

712
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,767
If you have anything to say, go ahead.

713
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:23,982
After…

714
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,068
giving birth to him,

715
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,530
I raised my son by myself

716
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,824
for a year and a half.

717
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,662
During that time,
I couldn't even reach the baby's father.

718
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,917
Then my son got sick,

719
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,297
and I was so scared.

720
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,758
So I hurried over barefoot

721
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:53,344
and knocked on the iron gate
of Hyowon Mansion.

722
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,014
But the gate didn't open.

723
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,726
And I was sent somewhere with my son.

724
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,061
And in the end,

725
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,148
I had to leave my baby there.

726
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,320
Then, did something happen recently

727
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:13,448
that made you want to get your son back?

728
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:16,910
The gate opened again.

729
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:22,123
The father of my son, Han Ji-yong,
brought me into his home.

730
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,960
So the father brought you

731
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:28,338
into his home himself. Is that correct?

732
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,255
Yes.

733
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,884
He brought me in as my son's tutor.

734
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,553
That's not all.

735
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:39,224
He even told people that I was dead
when I was alive.

736
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:43,770
He made my son believe
that I, his birth mother, was dead.

737
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,232
How can I possibly let such a man
raise my son?

738
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:52,529
Han Ji-yong does not deserve
to be his father!

739
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,408
Then why did he hire you as a tutor
six years later,

740
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,369
after he told people you were dead?

741
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:03,706
You gave birth to him,
and Hi-soo raised him.

742
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,167
I want both of you to take care of him.

743
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,294
That way, my son will become flawless.

744
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,215
He told me
that my son would become flawless

745
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:15,927
if his wife and I raised him together.

746
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,597
Don't let that get to you.

747
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,307
Just do as we prepared.

748
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,312
Is Ms. Lee telling the truth,

749
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,480
Ms. Seo?

750
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,402
If she tells them
that our family hired her as a tutor,

751
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,028
what will you say?

752
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,446
I'll deny it.

753
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,907
Like you said, she has no evidence.

754
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,411
I can just say
whatever she says is not true.

755
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,080
I can just deny everything.

756
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:45,957
Ms. Seo?

757
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,053
Yes. It's true.

758
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:05,893
Ms. Seo.

759
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,230
Do you want to raise the child?

760
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,189
Yes.

761
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:13,234
Let's hear from you, Ms. Seo.

762
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,156
I met my son, Ha-joon,

763
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:22,535
after he already came into this world.

764
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,873
He was born
to Mr. Han Ji-yong and Ms. Lee Hye-jin.

765
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,960
So everyone says he's not my son.

766
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,464
My blood type is O.
Han Ji-yong's blood type is A.

767
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,424
And Ha-joon's blood type…

768
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:38,885
is B.

769
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,221
But the person who raised Ha-joon

770
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,807
for all these years
isn't his father or Ms. Lee.

771
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,770
It's me. I am his mother.

772
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,731
People won't understand me.

773
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,570
They won't get why I am fighting
for the child I didn't give birth to.

774
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:03,201
My son is eight years old now.

775
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,954
This critical phase will build
his character, and he'll need

776
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,667
emotional nourishment to live his own life
when he becomes an adult.

777
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,878
This is the time he needs
my love and care the most.

778
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:18,591
For the past six years, I have devoted
myself to raising Ha-joon well.

779
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,093
And I'll continue to do so.

780
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:23,429
I can't let someone like Han Ji-yong
raise him and make him a monster!

781
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,431
I will not let that happen!

782
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,392
I will not let my child get hurt

783
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,268
by a woman who only gave birth to him

784
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,397
or by a dishonest father.
I will never let that happen.

785
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:38,111
While raising Ha-joon,

786
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,572
I've gladly poured my blood, sweat,
and tears into him.

787
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,867
Because I didn't give birth to him,
I had to shed more tears.

788
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:48,162
I had to give myself up
to prove my love for him.

789
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,792
Although…

790
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,462
the years I spent
with Han Ji-yong were lies,

791
01:01:57,797 --> 01:02:02,218
every single moment I spent
with Ha-joon was real.

792
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,972
There's only one reason why
I can be true to Ha-joon.

793
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,725
It's because…

794
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,271
I'm his mother.

795
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:23,698
The court will now rule
regarding the custody transfer request.

796
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:28,619
It's confirmed that the plaintiff is
the biological mother of Han Ha-joon,

797
01:02:28,703 --> 01:02:30,788
the child the defendant is raising.

798
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:34,834
And like the plaintiff's claim,
the court acknowledges

799
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:39,881
that the child cannot receive
the best care from his father.

800
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:41,340
However, the plaintiff

801
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:45,678
has not made an effort
to take her son back for a long time.

802
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:49,056
And considering the fact
that the wife, Ms. Seo,

803
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,185
is fully devoted to raising the child,

804
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,146
we had to question if sending the child

805
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:59,025
to his birth mother now
would give the child the best environment

806
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,027
to grow up in.

807
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:06,657
Therefore, as for the custody
transfer request, the court has decided

808
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:10,286
to dismiss it.

809
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:32,517
COURT IN SESSION

810
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:53,496
Okay.

811
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,498
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

812
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:01,879
Hi-soo.

813
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,010
Han Ji-yong…

814
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,680
is the next chairman now.

815
01:04:12,223 --> 01:04:15,142
The entire board is on Han Ji-yong's side.

816
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,854
It will be hard to change it overnight.

817
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,147
But go ahead with the plan.

818
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,108
I'll do my best to turn the tables.

819
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,236
That's actually better.

820
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:29,991
The higher he goes, the more he will lose.

821
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,059
Congratulations,

822
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,021
Chairman Han Ji-yong.

823
01:05:00,104 --> 01:05:02,481
-What are you trying to do?
-Han Ji-yong.

824
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:04,525
It's over.

825
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,404
As you can see, I will be raising Ha-joon.

826
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:09,822
Let's…

827
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,409
end our marriage.

828
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:18,247
I'm leaving Hyowon
and taking Ha-joon with me.

829
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:02,875
I saw on the news today
that the second son is chairman now.

830
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,544
Han Ji-yong is being too quiet.

831
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,339
You'll need to prepare
for a difficult time.

832
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:10,675
She left this piece for you.

833
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:11,926
She's leaving the country soon.

834
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:16,347
We've been ordered by the higher-ups
not to write a word about the lawsuit.

835
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,933
How much power and control
do you really have?

836
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:22,853
We can't beat him if we don't think
outside the box.

837
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,647
You want to break Ji-yong, don't you?

838
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,190
Do what I tell you, just one more time.

839
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:29,485
