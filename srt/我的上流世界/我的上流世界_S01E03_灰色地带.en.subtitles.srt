1
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,702
I was here when this was moved here.

2
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,255
How much is that in Korean won?

3
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,423
It's 1.5 billion won?

4
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:55,573
Gray areas that are neither black
nor white exist in this world.

5
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,369
The gray areas that weren't gray
since the beginning

6
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,664
but could seem both black and white.

7
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,319
EPISODE 3
THE GRAY AREA

8
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,513
I will announce
the directorate's decision.

9
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,143
The newly-appointed president
of Hyowon Group will be…

10
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,778
Han Jin-ho, the current CEO
of Hyowon Hotel.

11
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,421
Okay.

12
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:49,145
That's what the directorate decided,
so let's all follow the decision.

13
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,733
Should we invite the directorate
over for dinner?

14
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,987
It's only a temporary position
in case Father doesn't recover soon.

15
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,406
Please don't make a big deal of it.

16
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,119
Congratulations.

17
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,746
Thanks.

18
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,124
You too.

19
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,001
I don't care about the result.

20
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,128
However,

21
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:17,840
it's only natural for Jin-ho to be chosen
since he's the eldest son.

22
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
Ma'am.

23
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,827
Yes?

24
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,878
Drink this, ma'am. It's jasmine tea.

25
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,674
Thank you.

26
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,014
Jasmine tea is good for soothing
a troubled mind.

27
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:11,019
Aren't you disappointed
that your husband wasn't chosen?

28
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,566
Why would you say that?

29
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:21,321
And how are you so well aware
of our family matters?

30
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,031
It's for Ha-joon's well-being.

31
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,367
I keep myself updated
on everything regarding Hyowon.

32
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,661
I believe it's my duty.

33
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,832
Fine.

34
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,710
I won't lie.

35
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,087
I am a bit disappointed.

36
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,466
I knew he wasn't greedy, but…

37
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,928
Do you think you know everything
about your husband?

38
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,390
Of course. I can always see through him.

39
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,269
I saw every side of him.

40
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:56,856
Has it ever occurred to you that
you might've seen only what he showed?

41
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,443
What are you implying?

42
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,404
It's just…

43
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,532
something from experience.

44
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,577
There's always more than meets the eye.

45
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,124
You're right.

46
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,753
There is always more than meets the eye.

47
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,728
Hello?

48
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,357
Lunch?

49
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,943
Prepare yourself.

50
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,611
You have a lot to explain.

51
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:01,003
I wonder why the directorate supported
Jin-ho instead of Ji-yong.

52
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,049
Mr. Han Ji-yong asked the directorate

53
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,885
to pick Mr. Han Jin-ho instead.

54
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,557
That's exactly what I'm wondering.
Why would he do that?

55
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,188
You may leave.

56
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,649
Book the tickets for the Basel Fair.

57
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,527
And tell them how many of us
are going as well.

58
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,528
Yes, ma'am.

59
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,345
Take this.

60
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,562
CASHIER'S CHECK
ONE MILLION WON

61
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,900
What is this money for?

62
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:07,987
The chairman's study, Jin-ho's study,
and Mother's bedroom.

63
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,364
If you find anything
while cleaning these rooms…

64
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,242
I'd like you to tell me.

65
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,664
Soo-hyuk's room as well.

66
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,796
If you do the job well,
I'll also give you an incentive.

67
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,719
I hope we get along.

68
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,557
You may leave.

69
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,539
CASHIER'S CHECK
ONE MILLION WON

70
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,966
-Welcome, you, who's come for me
-Welcome, you, who's come for me

71
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,967
Welcome

72
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,679
-I've been waiting for you
-I've been waiting for you

73
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,100
-Welcome
-Welcome

74
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:24,105
-I want to be your flower
-I want to be your flower

75
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,439
-Let's spread love
-Spread love

76
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,359
That's enough. You're done for the day.

77
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,152
-Have a good day.
-You too.

78
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,946
I feel great.

79
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,367
No-deok.

80
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,660
Spread your feathers.

81
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,997
Spread them for me.

82
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,666
Spread them.

83
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,210
You brat. Spread them.

84
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,588
Spread them now!

85
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,925
Ma'am,
you shouldn't raise your voice outside.

86
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,554
But he's refusing to spread his feathers.

87
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,390
It's like he's a chicken, not a peacock.

88
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,269
Manage the maids better, okay?

89
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,521
Make sure they don't record my voice

90
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,274
like that wench who got kicked out.

91
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,317
Got it?

92
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,402
Of course, ma'am.

93
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,781
I want some bread.

94
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,199
Yes, ma'am.

95
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,838
Let's see.

96
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,180
-Ms. Joo.
-Yes, ma'am?

97
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,974
I want you to look something up for me.

98
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,227
Find articles about Jin-ho's appointment.

99
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,439
I don't have my phone with me.

100
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,483
Why not?

101
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,069
We're no longer allowed to carry a phone
while working.

102
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,070
What?

103
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:00,618
Please use this
to summon the maids from now on, ma'am.

104
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,537
You just need to press
one of these five buttons.

105
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,915
Press them, and you'll know which maid--

106
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,291
Goodness.

107
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,672
Is this a system upgrade? How nice.

108
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,215
Goodness.

109
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,514
Having been at the center of controversy
for throwing a cream bun,

110
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,392
President Han of Hyowon Bakery
and the video of her assault

111
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,644
continues to shock the public.

112
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:31,190
In the video, you can see her
punching the manager's chest

113
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:35,403
because the cream buns
have had bad reviews lately.

114
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,738
She smears the cream on his body

115
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,657
-as she gets furious
-Hey!

116
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,617
and curses him out.

117
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,412
-Then she curses the other employees
-Hey!

118
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,122
-out as well…
-Hey!

119
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,217
Do you know…

120
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,846
how much I love Ha-joon?

121
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,265
Of course.

122
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:06,934
Do you love him?

123
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,478
How could you even ask that?

124
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,773
Because it doesn't seem to me
like you care about him at all.

125
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,609
What do you mean?

126
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,863
Why did you give the position
to your brother?

127
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,284
Give me a convincing reason

128
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:25,327
so I can understand you.

129
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,629
Ha-joon will never be the heir.

130
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,173
Because…

131
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,633
he's like me.

132
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,094
-Ji-yong--
-He's not your son.

133
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,848
Hear me out first.

134
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,350
He's an illegitimate child.

135
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,771
It was never announced,
but all the directors are aware of it.

136
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,814
It's an open secret.

137
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:58,068
If I become the president,
he will be the center of attention.

138
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,321
Then the issue will naturally surface.

139
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,949
In the end, he'll get hurt.

140
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,662
I don't want him to go through…

141
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,832
what I went through.

142
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,129
You don't know

143
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,007
what kind of ambitions he'll have.

144
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,385
Rejecting an opportunity
out of one's own volition,

145
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,096
and being rejected from the get-go
are very different.

146
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,474
I want to provide him
with everything I can.

147
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,351
Maybe you just want the crown.

148
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,939
-I'm sorry. I--
-Wait.

149
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,067
Do you think I'm using him
to get what I want?

150
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,862
You of all people
shouldn't treat me like this.

151
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,781
Do you even know what I've done for him?

152
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,789
The sushi reeks.

153
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,416
I can't eat it.

154
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,967
And Ha-joon…

155
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,345
is my son.

156
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,491
They're all so cruel.

157
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,792
As you wished,

158
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,712
I made Han Jin-ho the president.

159
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,280
What are you doing here?

160
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,698
Hello, ma'am.

161
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,826
One of Ha-joon's textbooks is missing.

162
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,412
I thought it might be here.

163
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,669
MOTHER

164
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,757
I'll be busy today.
Please keep Ha-joon away from Cadenza.

165
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,175
Yes, ma'am.

166
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,975
-Hello?
-Didn't I tell you to fix it?

167
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,645
You call yourself a celebrity when you
can't even fix something like this?

168
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,021
I'll come over right now.

169
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,566
Let's talk face to face.
You'll like that better.

170
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,458
Explain this to me.

171
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,503
I let you break the ten family rules

172
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,922
so you could meet with the reporter.

173
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,383
Then you should've stopped him
from covering this!

174
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,927
I told you
that I wouldn't be able to stop it.

175
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,014
I heard you gave him permission
to cover it!

176
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,183
Have you gone crazy? Have you?

177
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,102
Why won't you answer me?

178
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,813
Are you trying to drive me up the wall?

179
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:06,817
He demanded something bigger
in return for the scandal.

180
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,361
What was it? Tell me.

181
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,947
Just hand it over to him.

182
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,242
What? Is it about you and your husband?

183
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,162
Is it? Or what?

184
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,873
You always speak your mind!

185
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,667
Why can't you say anything now? Why?

186
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,879
What was it?
Did he ask about your past dating life?

187
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,298
You should've just spilled the beans.

188
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,342
What's there to be embarrassed about
for a former actress?

189
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,891
At this crucial time
where Jin-ho is going to be the president,

190
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:43,353
how could you let this happen
and ruin everything?

191
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,066
You won't be able to understand,
so I won't tell you.

192
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,196
-You can just scold me.
-Understand what?

193
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:53,989
Understand what?

194
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,616
Just say it! I'll understand!

195
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,701
Tell me! Just say it!

196
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,953
Even though no one appreciated it,

197
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:06,668
Hi-soo was willing to do anything
to protect Ha-joon.

198
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,008
-There she is!
-There she is!

199
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,636
-Is it true?
-Please say something!

200
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,221
Please comment!

201
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,098
Please share a word or two!

202
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,599
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,976
Is this how you run your company?

204
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,478
Please say something!

205
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,396
Please comment on the incident.

206
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,857
What's your take on the boycott
of your bakery?

207
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,819
The citizens are furious.
Are you repenting?

208
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,487
Say something to the victim.

209
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,115
I'm truly sorry.

210
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,699
-Excuse us.
-Do you mean that?

211
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,868
-Excuse us.
-Please move.

212
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,912
How do you feel about the boycott?

213
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,581
-Please comment.
-How do you feel?

214
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,208
Please say something!

215
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,085
How do you feel?

216
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,586
-Please!
-Ma'am!

217
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,464
What did that reporter want from her?

218
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,466
It was regarding Ha-joon.

219
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,428
A story about him
not being her biological son.

220
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,391
She decided to protect him

221
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,434
and allow Hyowon to get attacked instead.

222
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,645
Goodness, Hi-soo.

223
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,690
You're so different from me.

224
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,276
Okay.

225
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,987
DIRECTOR JUNG SEO-HYUN

226
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,906
Ma'am, we have an emergency.

227
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,081
We're truly sorry.

228
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,751
I brought my kids here on my day off.

229
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,671
She thought this was an ordinary chair.

230
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,464
It had a big "do not touch" sign,

231
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,633
but I think she missed it.

232
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,974
Did you miss the sign,
or see it and still sit on it?

233
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,893
I didn't know that "do not touch" meant

234
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,812
do not sit as well.

235
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,231
You thought you could sit on it

236
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,108
as long as you didn't touch it?

237
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,777
Yes. I thought

238
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,739
it'd make a funny sound if I sat on it.

239
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,747
I'm sorry.
We should've been more descriptive.

240
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,249
It's worth 200 million won.

241
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:13,253
It's 190,000 dollars.
Are you just going to let them go?

242
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,796
It was our fault.

243
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,383
Have a great day with your children.

244
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,304
Thank you.

245
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,181
Thank you.

246
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,518
Write about what happened
and send the chair to S.H. Museum.

247
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:32,314
We can use it as a special chair
in the terrace cafe.

248
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,027
Doesn't it suit the multicultural complex?

249
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,197
Wire the money to the artist.

250
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,491
S.H. Museum will be the buyer.

251
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,412
Sir, please look this way.

252
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,499
This time with a nice, big smile.

253
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,376
Great, that's perfect.

254
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,002
All right, sir.

255
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,797
Why don't we try another angle this time?

256
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,716
Look this way and smile.

257
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,141
Enjoy your food, sir.

258
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,393
-You too.
-Enjoy.

259
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,520
-May I sit here?
-Sure.

260
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,772
-Enjoy your food.
-Enjoy your food.

261
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,943
-Enjoy your food.
-Enjoy your food.

262
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:18,986
You too.

263
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,497
-There she comes!
-There she comes!

264
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,126
How will you compensate the victim?

265
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,919
Please say something.

266
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,297
Please share a word or two.

267
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,048
How do you feel?

268
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,842
How will you compensate him?

269
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,343
-Hold on!
-Move aside!

270
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,262
-What will you do?
-What will you do?

271
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,222
-Please move!
-Say something.

272
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,265
-She's out!
-She's out!

273
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,933
-How will you compensate?
-She got out!

274
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,604
Excuse me!

275
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,403
Let me through!

276
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,285
Excuse me, coming through.

277
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,620
Let us through.

278
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,957
Excuse us, let us through!

279
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,051
This buggy shakes too much!

280
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:25,927
Damn it.

281
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,390
Don't follow me.

282
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,899
Gosh, what a poor woman.

283
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,109
What did I say?

284
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,279
Didn't I tell you to behave?

285
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,824
I told you to control your anger.

286
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,994
Who do you think I learned it from?

287
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,247
Are you saying it's me?

288
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,417
Didn't you know? You're unlikable.

289
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,377
Did you not know?

290
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,297
How dare you say that to your mom?

291
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,508
You shouldn't say that!

292
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,384
How could you eat cream buns right now?

293
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,054
-I got this temper from you.
-Ms. Yang's here.

294
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,680
Do you know what they call me?

295
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,058
Little Yang Soon-hye!

296
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,894
Where do you think I learned
to act like this?

297
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,938
How dare you talk back to me?

298
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,148
I learned this from you when I was a kid!

299
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,149
Enough!

300
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,819
That's enough!
Do you want everyone to know?

301
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,074
She says I'm unlikable.

302
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,785
-Unbelievable.
-This is all because of her.

303
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,079
Did you speak with Hi-soo?

304
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,997
Why did she do that?

305
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,292
She always felt inferior to me.

306
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,669
Damn it!

307
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:43,964
She's happy that I'm suffering, right?

308
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,132
That's not true.

309
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,259
-Then what is it?
-What is it?

310
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,555
Up until this moment,

311
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,183
Ms. Jung neither sided with
nor understood Hi-soo

312
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,436
because she had no interest
in getting involved in any conflicts.

313
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,815
That's how she felt until then.

314
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,319
Anyway, stop causing a scene
and just leave.

315
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,071
Jin-hee.

316
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,657
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

317
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,784
Don't come for the time being.

318
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,036
What?

319
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,709
What should I do now?

320
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,593
We're back.

321
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,182
Hi, Ha-joon.

322
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,771
Ha-joon.

323
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,357
I had a long day today.

324
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,860
Cheer me up.

325
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,658
Ha-joon.

326
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,330
It's best to give him space

327
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,332
when he wants it.

328
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,195
All right.

329
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,084
LOTTERY
500 MILLION WON

330
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,583
I want you to buy a piece.

331
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,585
Not under the gallery's or my name.

332
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,088
Buy it under yours.

333
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,923
It's my gift for you.

334
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,553
The piece is going to become
very valuable soon.

335
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,808
I'll send you the link.

336
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,743
Are you asleep?

337
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,515
What are you doing here at this hour?

338
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,559
I couldn't sleep.

339
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,814
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

340
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,358
Why don't we take a walk?

341
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,445
Yes, you can just leave it there.

342
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,457
Is there a reason

343
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,543
we should keep this a secret?

344
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,627
Yes.

345
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,506
I live from paycheck to paycheck

346
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,008
so I can't afford to lose this job.

347
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,052
But then again, you wouldn't understand.

348
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,391
Come out for a minute.

349
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,479
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,091
My goodness.

351
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,761
They're so plump.

352
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,958
You're still in a bad mood.

353
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,211
It's written on your face.

354
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,255
Ha-joon's been strange lately.

355
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,132
How so?

356
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,513
He doesn't seem to be in a good mood,
but he won't talk to me.

357
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,308
He's never kept anything from me.

358
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,519
Don't worry too much.
We have Ms. Kang now.

359
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,896
What do you mean?

360
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,315
Don't worry because we have her?

361
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,276
She's an expert.

362
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,444
She's not here to raise our son.

363
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,530
She's just our assistant.

364
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,990
Isn't that what you said?

365
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,410
Yes, I know.
It's just that she seems trustworthy.

366
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:14,455
What makes you say that?

367
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,834
It's just…

368
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,170
She seems sincere towards Ha-joon.

369
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,799
We'll see about that.

370
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,011
In my opinion, she's a bit too much.

371
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,680
It feels like she crosses her boundaries.

372
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,101
-Anyway--
-Just think of Ha-joon.

373
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,188
Just think about his well-being.

374
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,104
You startled me.

375
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,398
What are you doing here?

376
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,650
What about you? Why aren't you asleep?

377
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,069
I couldn't sleep, so I took a bath.

378
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,279
Look at her.

379
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,703
We found a great tutor this time.

380
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,850
So you're saying
they were together all night?

381
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,520
Yes, ma'am. He went to Yu-yeon's room
at around 11 p.m.

382
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,607
and returned to his room
in the early morning.

383
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,445
Okay.

384
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,406
Wait.

385
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,036
How did you know that Ms. Joo

386
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,289
was recording everything that was going on

387
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,208
in this house?

388
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,462
It's okay. You can tell me.

389
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,216
I stumbled upon her watching some video.

390
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,723
What kind of video was it?

391
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,226
I'm not sure.

392
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,728
All I saw was the interior of this house.

393
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,942
Okay. You may go.

394
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,884
I don't want cream buns anymore!

395
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,386
Give me a different dessert.

396
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,430
Chef Jung!

397
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,974
Chef Jung!

398
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,077
Is there anything you should tell me?

399
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,506
No, ma'am.

400
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,885
Are you sure?

401
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,222
Yes, ma'am.

402
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,726
You have to take responsibility
for your own actions in this house.

403
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,688
Here.

404
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:03,776
I can eat on my own.

405
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,611
You told me

406
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,823
that I should do that
once I started school.

407
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,075
You should still eat what I give you.

408
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,743
You can eat it.

409
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,748
Ha-joon.

410
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,959
Is something wrong?

411
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,464
I'm done eating.

412
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:28,300
Come on. You shouldn't skip breakfast.

413
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,343
It tastes bad.

414
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,989
I'll take care of him today.

415
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,158
But I don't think he'd like that.

416
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,702
I'll take him to school today.

417
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,915
Let's go.

418
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,925
I had your favorite rapper
sign this CD for you.

419
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,930
It wasn't easy to get this.

420
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,364
-Hello. Please take good care of him.
-Sure.

421
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,158
-Study hard.
-Okay.

422
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,368
-Bye.
-Bye.

423
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,125
One minute, Mr. Kim.

424
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,228
Did you get your mom's autograph?

425
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,897
I told you that my mom wants it.

426
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:08,692
What's wrong? Did she refuse
because she's not your real mom?

427
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,862
Say something.
Why aren't you saying anything?

428
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,114
Make sure you have her autograph tomorrow.

429
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:16,575
-Ha-joon!
-It's his mom!

430
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,506
Why didn't you tell me?

431
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,008
We agreed not to keep secrets.

432
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,302
How was I supposed to tell you?

433
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,347
What was I supposed to say?

434
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,683
I'm terrified

435
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,521
that it might turn out that you're fake.

436
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,566
I'm not fake.

437
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,569
I'm your one and only mom.

438
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:53,779
I am your real mom.

439
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,283
Let's go.

440
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,079
I'll walk you to your classroom.

441
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,854
Ji-won said he didn't invite Ha-joon
to his birthday

442
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:31,317
because he doesn't have
a biological mother.

443
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,327
Soo-young, it's me.

444
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,079
I'm meeting
with Ha-joon's classmates' parents.

445
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,457
Please pick him up after school.

446
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,795
-Welcome.
-Hi-soo, you're here.

447
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,089
-Hello.
-Have you been well?

448
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,271
Oh, my.

449
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,190
-Do you recognize me?
-Of course.

450
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,941
You're actress Seo Hi-soo.

451
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,568
You're wrong.

452
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,528
I'm Ha-joon's mom.

453
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:20,366
Please tell Ji-won's mom
that I'm here to give her an autograph.

454
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,799
Why do you look
like you've just seen a ghost?

455
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,844
Oh, right. Ji-won said…

456
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,473
that Ha-joon's real mom is dead.

457
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:47,184
Why would he make
such a thoughtless comment?

458
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,687
Who are you calling thoughtless?

459
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,605
It's true that she's dead.

460
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,856
I see.

461
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,067
You're the one who's thoughtless.

462
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:58,362
Don't you know
the consequences you'll face?

463
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,907
It's not like I made it up.
What consequences would there be?

464
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,410
Then would you like to find out?

465
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,915
You can bash me as an actress
since I got used to it during my career.

466
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:14,378
However, what you did is
badmouth me as Ha-joon's mother.

467
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,296
I'm seeing red right now.

468
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,175
Do you want to be banished from Korea?

469
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,052
Should I make an issue of it?

470
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:27,182
Would you like your little son to be known
for verbally assaulting his classmate?

471
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,520
Do you think you're a mom
because you gave birth?

472
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,356
What kind of mom leads her child
down the wrong path?

473
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:38,527
Tell him to apologize to my son at once.

474
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:42,656
If he does, Ha-joon will forgive him.

475
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:47,202
Because I raised him that way.
As someone who knows how to forgive.

476
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,123
I can't give you much time.

477
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:53,709
I hate to see him in pain
for a minute longer.

478
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,093
I'm afraid I can't attend the party.

479
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,929
We have to go to our in-laws. I'm sorry.

480
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,349
I'm sorry. Something suddenly came up.

481
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,310
I forgot about a dentist appointment.

482
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,103
I'm sorry.

483
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,397
I'm afraid Ji-won won't be having

484
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,274
a birthday party this year.

485
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,109
No one will be coming.

486
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,906
Because everyone will be getting
VIP tickets to Hyowon World that day.

487
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,699
Except for your son.

488
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,122
But if he apologizes,
he can have his party.

489
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,116
Ha-joon!

490
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,179
Ha-joon!

491
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,515
Hang tight!

492
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,350
Hold the reins tightly!

493
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:18,854
Ha-joon!

494
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,606
Hold tight!

495
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,827
Ha-joon!

496
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,964
Ha-joon.

497
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,342
Ha-joon. Are you okay?

498
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,180
You're okay now.

499
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:07,903
Ha-joon.

500
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,073
How was horseback riding?
Was everything okay?

501
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,033
Yes.

502
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,662
It was fine.

503
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,417
I think he has a knack
for horseback riding.

504
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,004
Go rest up.

505
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,047
Okay.

506
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,844
Ma'am.

507
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,431
Could you attend
the English camp orientation?

508
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,810
He's not in a good mood today.

509
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,687
I'll stay with him.

510
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,897
What are you talking about?

511
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:46,817
His mom should be with him.

512
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,944
I don't think that'll help.

513
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,487
What did you just say?

514
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,824
After all, I'm a professional tutor.

515
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,202
We need to talk, Ms. Kang.

516
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,136
What are you trying to do?

517
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,265
I heard about what happened to Ha-joon
at school.

518
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,683
Ms. Kang.

519
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,395
I appreciate you cherishing my son.

520
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:25,480
I really do.

521
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,859
I'm not sure if I'm oversensitive
or misconstruing this.

522
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,695
But you're crossing the line.

523
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,739
Please be careful.

524
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:36,825
You just invaded my territory.
I am his mother.

525
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,369
But he's in pain.

526
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:41,747
Who is?

527
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,167
-Ha-joon?
-Yes.

528
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,921
-Why do you think that way?
-No matter how much you cherish him,

529
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,716
you're still not his real mom.

530
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,140
Listen. I don't know
what you've heard, but--

531
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,184
You can't hide this.

532
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,145
-Look, Ms. Kang.
-You've been married for six years,

533
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,563
but your son is eight.

534
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,399
Did you think they wouldn't know?

535
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:12,736
I don't care.
I will protect him no matter what.

536
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:15,781
I will never publicly announce that.

537
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:19,242
The moment I admit it,
Ha-joon will get hurt.

538
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,828
Do you truly think you're protecting him?

539
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,332
Then you think I should tell him

540
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,126
his birth mother is dead?

541
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,795
What if she's still alive?

542
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,924
What do you mean?

543
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,010
I'm sorry.

544
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,304
I just…

545
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,223
I'm his real mom.

546
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,434
Yes, his birth mother died in an accident,

547
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,228
but I am his real mom.

548
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,396
And I will protect him.

549
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,566
He's my son no matter what anyone says.

550
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:56,071
My heart is ripped into pieces
whenever I see him in pain.

551
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,364
Do you…

552
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,368
truly love him?

553
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,369
Of course.

554
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,539
I can do anything for him.

555
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,083
I can endure
any kind of humiliation for him.

556
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,543
So please.

557
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,090
Please don't let him know
about any of this.

558
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,385
Thank you.

559
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,181
Then I'll go attend

560
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,642
the camp orientation.

561
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,090
Do you have something to say?

562
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:58,884
I do.

563
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,102
I don't think I can accept this money.
I apologize.

564
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,236
You'll be needing it soon.

565
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,713
Tell Mother…

566
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,549
everything you told me.

567
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:41,885
Yes, ma'am.

568
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:49,059
No one wanted to get blood on their hands.

569
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,978
They probably had no idea back then

570
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,941
that the blood would spatter
on everyone's hands.

571
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,098
Ha-joon.

572
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:33,311
Should we order in some fried chicken
without anyone knowing?

573
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,232
If you want,

574
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,194
I'll tip-toe around the tight security
to get it.

575
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:44,239
Forget it. Don't do that.

576
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,286
My son.

577
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,498
Do you need more time?

578
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:01,715
But don't stay gloomy for too long.

579
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,064
Then you think I should tell him

580
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,358
his birth mother is dead?

581
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,485
What if she's still alive?

582
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,091
Does it really not hurt?

583
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:48,136
No, it doesn't.

584
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,931
You didn't get hurt.

585
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:54,684
That's all that matters.

586
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,853
Why do you act like my mom

587
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,314
when you're not?

588
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:04,944
Thank you.

589
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:13,995
Ha-joon.

590
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,874
Let's keep what happened today
a secret, okay?

591
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:20,877
-Even from my mom?
-Yes.

592
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:25,673
She'll be heartbroken if she finds out
that you were in danger.

593
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,094
Okay.

594
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,026
Why did you yield the position to me?

595
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,655
Tell me the truth.

596
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,992
Because it's only right.

597
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,121
We need to be in our right places

598
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,873
to bring peace.

599
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,382
You belong there for now.

600
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,178
For now?

601
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,098
Does that mean
you'll take it from me someday?

602
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:00,018
Are you saying you call the shots?

603
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:02,854
I know you're smart,

604
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,732
but that doesn't mean
you'll always get your way.

605
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,067
What an impudent bastard.

606
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:19,454
That asshole.

607
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,632
Thanks.

608
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,060
Something's wrong, isn't it?

609
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,686
I can see it in your face.

610
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,441
I can never hide anything from you.

611
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:49,901
What's wrong?

612
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,737
It's about Ha-joon.

613
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,574
He's been strange lately.

614
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,413
I'm telling you, he's your entire world.

615
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,257
Say hello.

616
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:15,802
This is Mother Emma from Daoom,
a foundation for single moms.

617
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:20,348
And this is Ms. Kang Ja-kyeong,
Ha-joon's tutor.

618
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,058
I see.

619
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,436
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

620
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,107
Please take good care of our prince.

621
00:59:29,857 --> 00:59:31,276
I'll do my best.

622
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,863
Thank you for today.

623
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,449
I'll take care of him for a few days.

624
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,951
You can take some time off.

625
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:43,413
Ha-joon is sensitive nowadays.

626
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,456
That's not necessary.

627
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:49,919
Okay, then.

628
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:02,682
Ma'am.

629
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:08,313
We appreciate your donation,
but you should attend our meeting

630
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:11,024
and visit the foundation as well.

631
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,859
That's not necessary.

632
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:25,496
TO HA-JOON
WOO WON-JAE

633
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:31,961
Ha-joon.

634
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:38,593
You shouldn't listen to
such depressing songs when you're down.

635
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:40,637
Okay.

636
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:23,971
This necklace brings luck.

637
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:28,643
They say it keeps you safe
from any misfortunes.

638
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,730
Someone gave it to me as a gift.

639
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:37,360
I had no idea
it'd circle back to you, though.

640
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,698
Will you accept it?

641
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,710
Ha-joon.

642
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:58,673
What did you say was the name
of the boy who bullied you?

643
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:24,949
Are you Ji-won's mom?

644
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:26,826
Yes. What is it?

645
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,749
Are you crazy?

646
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:07,867
Perhaps the difference between
art and furniture is the number of people

647
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,287
required to move it.

648
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,457
Ma'am. Here.

649
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,714
NOBLESSE OBLIGE

650
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:26,427
DIRECTOR JUNG SEO-HYUN APOLOGIZES
FOR LACK OF BETTER DESCRIPTION

651
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,889
This isn't what I wanted.

652
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,726
Will this help
Jin-hee's cream bun scandal subside?

653
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:35,978
Or…

654
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,690
will I be criticized
for media manipulation?

655
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,540
I won't be coming home tonight.

656
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,251
Okay. See you tomorrow then.

657
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,713
If you have trouble sleeping
while I'm away,

658
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:05,967
-feel free to sleep in my room.
-No, I'm good.

659
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,428
Take care of yourself while I'm gone.

660
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,639
Eat and sleep well.

661
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:14,642
Wait.

662
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,646
We're not friends.

663
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,648
I never said we were.

664
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:35,746
Okay.

665
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:46,173
You visited Ji-won's mom?

666
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,050
Why?

667
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:52,930
That's my job, not yours.
I told you not to cross the line.

668
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,100
In that case,

669
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:01,188
you should've done it properly.

670
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:02,982
What?

671
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,817
Do you really love Ha-joon?

672
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,780
You took care of it too rationally
since you don't truly love him.

673
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,074
A real mom wouldn't do that.

674
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:14,285
What do you mean?

675
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:15,536
A real mom…

676
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:18,998
can never react so rationally.

677
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:23,502
Do you have a child?

678
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:28,507
Because you sound like you do.

679
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,764
I was so emotional that
I felt like I was embarrassing myself.

680
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:38,935
You're a mere tutor,
so how dare you act like his mom?

681
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,978
Were you like this
at your previous job too?

682
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:43,272
Do you know that you've worsened
the situation?

683
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:45,399
Get a hold of yourself
and don't cross the line!

684
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:50,738
You are just an employee.

685
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:57,036
I need to reconsider.

686
01:05:58,204 --> 01:05:59,038
Reconsider what?

687
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,415
Whether you should be here.

688
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:06,837
I'm sorry.

689
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,216
We'll see…

690
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,344
whether you truly mean that

691
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,513
or if you're just saying it
to get out of this.

692
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:44,750
The people of Hyowon Group
were gradually turning gray.

693
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,380
Black mixed with white,

694
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:52,675
and white was tinged with black.

695
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:57,680
And yes. They were unaware of this change.

696
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,316
SPECIAL THANKS TO KANG YOUNG-MIN OF 1S1T

697
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,753
It's better to leave her alone.

698
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:30,463
For Yu-yeon as well.

699
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:34,258
I'll send the related files now
so please find out as much as you can.

700
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:36,385
I need the most sensitive information.

701
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,262
Mother did?

702
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:41,307
Something about Kang Ja-kyeong feels off.

703
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:44,602
How could a mere tutor get
so emotional like that?

704
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:46,937
I still remember the look in her eyes.

705
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,440
I think I got
on the wrong side of Ms. Seo.

706
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:53,069
Ms. Kang. You should leave.

707
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:57,031
