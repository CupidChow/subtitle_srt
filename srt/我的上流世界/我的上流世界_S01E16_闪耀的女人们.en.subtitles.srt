1
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,487
The Commissioner General ordered us
to close the Hyowon Case.

2
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,866
Their maid made a statement saying she got
a lethal dose of sleeping pills for him.

3
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,244
That's the only evidence we have,
and it suggests suicide.

4
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,299
Ms. Seo.

5
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,677
You killed him, didn't you?

6
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,555
I don't remember anything.

7
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,017
I really don't.

8
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,700
As we weren't able to find
conclusive evidence of murder,

9
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,247
the investigation of Han Ji-yong's death
is closed.

10
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,334
Why did you try…

11
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,838
to secretly leave in the dead of night?

12
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,634
Tell me everything.
Don't keep anything from me.

13
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,595
I'll let you go.

14
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,120
I'm so lonely.

15
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,957
Seriously. There isn't anyone
I can connect with in this house.

16
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,550
LOTTERY
500 MILLION WON

17
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,900
YOU'VE WON FIVE MILLION WON

18
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,743
I won. Gosh.

19
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,705
Hey.

20
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,590
Ta-da.

21
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,344
YOU'VE WON FIVE MILLION WON

22
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,262
-Five million…
-It's yours.

23
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,933
I've been scratching tickets
for 18 months.

24
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,601
And I finally won.

25
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,520
I guess this is why people say
effort won't betray you.

26
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,272
Why are you giving this to me?

27
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,358
I don't need that money.

28
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,321
Thank you so much! I'll use it well.

29
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,327
But…

30
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:09,624
what must I do for you in return?

31
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,376
Is there anything I should do?

32
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,919
You don't have to do anything.

33
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,549
Just…

34
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,012
take a bath with me once in a while.

35
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,681
Pardon?

36
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,058
I'm really lonely.

37
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,997
I finally won some money
on scratch tickets.

38
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,840
For the first time in your life,
you made money

39
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,717
with persistence and diligence.

40
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,094
Congratulations. Good job.

41
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,223
I wanted to test my luck.

42
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:12,061
People tell me that I was born
into a rich family because I was lucky.

43
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:13,855
And they treat me

44
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:18,151
as if I haven't achieved anything
on my own in my life.

45
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,569
I wanted to prove them wrong.

46
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,903
It is true…

47
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,824
that you're lucky in this life,

48
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,077
seeing that you and Seong-tae

49
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,248
didn't end up killing Ji-yong.

50
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,794
How did you know?

51
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,381
Okay.

52
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,761
I did tell Seong-tae to kill Ji-yong.

53
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,682
At that moment,
I really wanted that bastard dead.

54
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,768
Stop thinking about it. It's over now.

55
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,728
Who did it, then?

56
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,397
Who killed Ji-yong?

57
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,066
It's better that you don't know.

58
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,486
As always.

59
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,162
Right.

60
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,539
I don't need to know.

61
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,917
I don't need to know.

62
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,628
I don't.

63
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,905
You told me it's not an affair.

64
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,252
-Hello?
-Are you coming? Hurry up.

65
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,211
Okay.

66
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,324
You haven't settled it yet?

67
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,160
This is worth being in the tabloids.

68
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,579
You want to dump him on each other.

69
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:39,000
Well, it's unfortunate,
but we should end our Bible study here.

70
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,210
We don't deserve
to study the Bible together.

71
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,921
It's a shame because we just started
the New Testament.

72
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,923
I want to continue to do it if she leaves.

73
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,801
Shut up.

74
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,388
Do you think it makes any sense
for a sinner like you to study the Bible?

75
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,223
You should study the Kama Sutra instead.

76
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,767
Keep it down. You're at a gallery.

77
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,022
Anyway, Father Paul will be here.

78
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:05,276
Mother Emma wanted it,
so I agreed to meet him with you guys.

79
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,403
But how will we tell him we're quitting?

80
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,071
He should be here by now.

81
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,263
We should finish studying
the New Testament, right?

82
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,848
That's the best part.

83
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,017
I never said I was quitting.

84
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,612
Please take a seat.

85
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,702
Hello. I'm Father Paul.

86
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,622
Mother Emma told me about this group.

87
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,624
So I'm here to help you study the Bible.

88
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,209
-Okay.
-All right.

89
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,350
HOLY BIBLE

90
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,023
Don't look at me. Let's look at our Bible.

91
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:27,858
Okay.

92
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,403
Turn your Bibles to John.

93
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,446
Chapter one.

94
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,409
"This is the testimony of John…"

95
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,494
If life were

96
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,080
to go as we expected,

97
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:44,125
we wouldn't even believe in God.

98
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,334
We're here.

99
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,523
Mother Emma, someone's waiting for you.

100
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,696
A good friend of mine gave this to me.

101
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,489
I've had this for 20 years.

102
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,785
I think I should let go of this now.

103
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,246
Can I give it to you, Agatha?

104
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:45,811

110
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,884
Is your mother getting better?

111
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,553
Yes.

112
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:03,514
Her surgery went well thanks to your help.

113
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,434
Thank you for everything, Ms…

114
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,938
I'll remind the maids

115
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,400
that they must treat you with respect
since you'll be my daughter-in-law.

116
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,527
You don't have to do that.

117
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,905
Being treated and respected properly
needs some getting used to.

118
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,950
But you must show
that you deserve it first.

119
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,121
You're not the girl you used to be
anymore.

120
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,708
Even if you liked
to keep things casual before,

121
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,710
you can't do that anymore.

122
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,671
I'll get you a private tutor.
Study English first.

123
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,590
Take art and cooking classes, too.

124
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,384
Improve yourself until you deserve
to make your own choices.

125
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,179
You can go against me then.
I'll gladly let you.

126
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,056
Understood?

127
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,808
Yes. I will.

128
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,519
Let's eat together when Soo-hyuk's back.

129
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,480
Okay.

130
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,813
Thank you
for taking good care of my horse.

131
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,068
No wonder my horse has gotten gentle.

132
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,237
It's all thanks to you.

133
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,958
This necklace will keep you safe.

134
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,078
You'll be a good boy, won't you?

135
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,873
You'll be brave in the US, right?

136
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,126
Yes. Don't worry.

137
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,379
Mom.

138
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,174
You remember everything now, right?

139
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,385
Not just the lyrics, right?

140
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,306
If your memories haven't come back yet,

141
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,349
I want to tell you something.

142
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,562
Don't forget how cool you are, Mom.

143
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:02,192
You told me
that only you can protect yourself.

144
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,238
Whatever problems you face,
you must protect yourself.

145
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,034
You have to. Okay?

146
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,832
Okay. I'll keep that in mind.

147
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,002
When did you grow so much, my son?

148
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,006
-You're so cool.
-Of course. I'm your son.

149
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:50,324
Those who have left are no longer with us,
but we must move on with our lives.

150
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,910
And newcomers must be welcomed.

151
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,790
We should all start afresh
with a clean slate.

152
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,999
Let's eat.

153
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,089
From now on,

154
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:09,093
you must be careful
about what you say and do. Okay?

155
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,220
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,848
I'd like to keep Ha-joon's room at Rubato
while he studies abroad.

157
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,686
Please let him stay here
when he comes back during school breaks.

158
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,232
Ha-joon is a brother to me.

159
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,111
I'll always take care of him.
I just wanted you to know that.

160
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,779
Okay.

161
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,949
Ha-joon is our family.

162
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,118
That's what I think, too.

163
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,871
I'm grateful that you all think so.

164
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:38,914
Of course.

165
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,250
We're sending Ha-joon abroad,

166
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,878
so he can learn more
and broaden his horizons.

167
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,130
And when he comes back,

168
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,842
I'm sure he will be capable
of helping Hyowon Group grow.

169
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,886
I'm on the same page with you.

170
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:57,641
However, we need Hi-soo's consent.
We can't decide on it as we please.

171
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,436
After all, Ha-joon is Hi-soo's son.

172
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,188
I thought his birth mother
was going with him.

173
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,648
She's going as his tutor.

174
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,942
He can't have two mothers.

175
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,529
Ha-joon's mother is Hi-soo.

176
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,879
If it is the Lord's will…

177
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,423
for it to end this way,

178
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,177
I must accept it.

179
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,555
Thank you for your hard work,
Detective Baek.

180
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,944
Please forgive…

181
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,863
our sins.

182
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,189
-Seong-tae.
-Put it there.

183
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,523
-Are you okay?
-Okay.

184
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,441
Be careful.

185
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,692
-Don't trip.
-Careful.

186
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,777
Everything is out, right?

187
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,654
-Be careful getting up.
-Hurry.

188
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,988
-Okay.
-Ms. Joo.

189
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,698
-Is this it?
-Put it there.

190
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,368
-Over there and here.
-Good choice, Chef Jung.

191
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,869
-Thanks.
-Look.

192
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,913
-Seong-tae.
-Right here.

193
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,289
What's up with you today?

194
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,582
I…

195
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,796
Thank you!

196
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,416
Congratulations.

197
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:45,137
It feels good…

198
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,390
to receive a gift from my son.

199
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,415
It looks beautiful.

200
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,931
You're right. It does.

201
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,975
Thank you.

202
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,105
Yu-yeon and I will work hard together.

203
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,941
And you deserve to be the chairwoman.

204
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,486
Please make the best of it.

205
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,368
Thank you…

206
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,539
for raising me well.

207
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:58,418
Mother.

208
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,509
Hey, Jung-do. Where--

209
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:31,887
Sorry?

210
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,686
Okay.

211
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,127
Your brother wants to see you
in the bunker at Cadenza.

212
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,627
Ms. Jung, I have something
to discuss with you.

213
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,085
Why did you want to see me?

214
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,466
Jin-ho!

215
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:51,943
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave a…

216
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,407
Yes.
This is Park Jung-do's brother-in-law.

217
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,117
I'm on my way there.

218
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,411
Is his injury serious?

219
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,292
Mr. Kim!

220
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,295
Hey!

221
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,721
Hey.

222
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,390
Mr. Kim.

223
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,601
Mr. Kim!

224
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,733
TURN YOURSELF IN
OR I'LL SEND THIS TO THE POLICE

225
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,166
Turn yourself in,

226
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,128
or I'll send this to the police.

227
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,964
Han Ji-yong…

228
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,098
SEO HI-SOO

229
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,861
-Hello?
-You…

230
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,698
Hello?

231
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,701
Ji-yong!

232
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,536
Ji-yong, what's wrong?

233
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,742
Damn it.

234
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,118
Shit.

235
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,709
What? Why won't it open?

236
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,793
This…

237
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:29,298
Gosh. Damn it. Oh, no.
He's really going to die now.

238
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,511
Damn it. Oh, no.

239
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,104
Damn it.

240
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,001
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

241
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,252
I will…

242
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:14,469
I'm sorry.

243
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,152
What happened?

244
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,828
It was you, wasn't it?

245
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,788
Please turn yourself in!

246
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,249
The moment people find out who I am,

247
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,335
the world will abandon me.
So I'll protect what's mine.

248
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,087
Ji-yong.

249
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,421
I…

250
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,466
I have never had anything
that was truly mine!

251
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,802
Now, everything is mine.

252
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,762
Why are you ruining my life? Why?

253
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,807
Then did you hand over that file

254
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,934
to the police, Mr. Choi?

255
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,144
Die!

256
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,815
I'll call you back.

257
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,778
Just die.

258
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,157
Die!

259
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,988
Where's Brother Han Ji-yong?

260
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,991
Cadenza.

261
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,244
There are people outside.
We can't be seen.

262
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,247
Let's go to my study on the second floor.
I'll call Dr. Kim.

263
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,514
Stay here for a moment.

264
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,555
Oh, no.

265
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,191
Oh, no. Hey.

266
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,610
There was an incident.

267
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,737
Wait. Someone has…

268
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,405
Please call an ambulance.

269
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,116
Mother Emma, please calm down.

270
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,245
-What…
-A man is passed out on the floor.

271
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,121
Hurry. Make a call right now.

272
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,832
Okay.

273
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:31,924
Stay here.

274
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,594
Don't follow me inside.

275
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,591
Dr. Kim, please come to Cadenza right now.

276
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,009
There's been an accident.

277
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,098
Die!

278
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:37,990
Hi-soo.

279
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,868
Trust me.

280
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:46,624
Stay here for a bit. I'll be back soon.

281
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,055
Dr. Kim will be here soon.

282
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,225
Let me know as soon as he arrives.

283
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,602
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,696
Take care of the rest.

285
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,201
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,714
Is…

287
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,134
Is Ji-yong okay?

288
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:07,639
I cannot disclose anything
that happens in this house.

289
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,518
We called for the doctor,

290
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,939
so please calm down
and leave quietly for now.

291
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,649
But…

292
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,131
Why did you open the door for him?

293
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,844
You should have followed through
with your plan.

294
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,846
Why did you stop, you bastard?

295
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,181
Was it you?

296
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,434
Did you…

297
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,228
kill Mr. Han?

298
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,525
Why would I kill him?

299
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,777
Why would I kill him?

300
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,071
I opened the door for him!

301
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,410
You shouldn't have opened it.

302
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,622
Or you should've opened it sooner
if you were going to.

303
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:45,922
He's dead because he inhaled the gas.

304
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:49,926
Do you think the staircase is high enough
for someone to fall and die?

305
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,720
But still…

306
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,307
If he hadn't fallen,

307
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,102
he wouldn't have died. Never!

308
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,729
You…

309
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,287
Fine.

310
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:23,168
Let's say that I'm the one who killed him.

311
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,047
Run away from this house.

312
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,509
And don't ever come back.

313
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,648
Give me the blue diamond before you go…

314
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:51,071
since I'm the one who killed Han Ji-yong.

315
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,783
Hi-soo.

316
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,328
I'll come back
after I handle things at home.

317
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,707
And…

318
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,253
don't worry. I'll take care of everything.

319
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,987
I've never been a good husband to you.

320
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,448
This is all my fault.

321
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:39,745
Father.

322
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,542
Father, Ji-yong…

323
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,964
Ji-yong fell from the second floor.

324
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:54,843
And he…

325
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,721
He died on the spot.

326
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,767
His blood vessels ruptured.

327
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,851
Father.

328
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,114
Call Dr. Kim.

329
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,241
He's already here.

330
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,077
I…

331
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,455
I'll take care of this.

332
00:51:23,538 --> 00:51:24,539
Okay.

333
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,210
What…

334
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,881
Hey. We need help here!

335
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,049
Goodness. Sir!

336
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:37,886
Hurry.

337
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,467
Life is difficult.

338
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:23,098
Yes, and everyone writes
the answer to life in their own way.

339
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,685
What is the answer you're writing?

340
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,649
Well, I used to live extravagantly

341
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:36,027
as an entertainer at Aesanggak,
filled with vanity.

342
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:39,698
And I've lived as a nun
despite my shortcomings.

343
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,324
In any case,

344
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,997
I've followed my heart, and every decision
I made has made me who I am today.

345
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,292
Mother Emma.

346
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:55,547
I've lost my life and heart.

347
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,218
I feel like I have nothing now.

348
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,016
I have…

349
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,311
nothing left.

350
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,692
That's not true.

351
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:19,529
You thought you had everything,
but you didn't, right?

352
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:23,700
Just like that, you feel as if
you've lost everything, but you didn't.

353
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,288
You didn't lose anything.

354
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,346
Don't forget how cool you are, Mom.

355
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:50,060
You told me
that only you can protect yourself.

356
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,469
You're quitting?

357
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,263
Yes, sir.

358
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,557
How sad.

359
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,896
I feel like
everyone is leaving one by one.

360
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,486
There's a reason you're leaving, right?

361
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,407
Yes, sir.

362
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,874
Seo Hi-soo…

363
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,711
didn't kill him.

364
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,814
Why did you do it?

365
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,151
Ms. Seo was in danger,

366
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,279
so I grabbed the fire extinguisher…

367
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:29,409
When I said that I would be loyal to you,

368
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,996
this wasn't what I had in mind.

369
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,750
Ms. Joo.

370
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:42,797
You know too much about our family.

371
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,179
Leaving is the only option you have left.

372
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:13,953
I will comply with your decision.

373
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,629
The blue diamond necklace…

374
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,340
If you take it,

375
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:30,887
you will be Han Ji-yong's murderer.

376
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:36,101
But if you leave it here,

377
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,062
you were just trying to help Hi-soo.

378
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,611
Ms. Joo.

379
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,074
It's up to you.

380
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,619
Ms. Joo.

381
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,163
Yes, sir?

382
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,714
There's something I must give you
before I leave.

383
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:19,102
I should return it to its rightful owner.

384
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,322
How…

385
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,201
did this necklace end up with you?

386
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,121
Somehow…

387
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,667
it ended up with me.

388
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,672
I'll come by to say hello
from time to time.

389
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:51,050
-Take care of yourself, sir.
-Okay.

390
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,094
You take care of yourself, too.

391
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,888
Okay.

392
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:18,995
Thanks.

393
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,958
You'll see us off at the airport, right?

394
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,668
Of course, I should.

395
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,837
Please tell me…

396
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,717
why you pretended
to have lost your memories.

397
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,974
During my marriage,

398
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,268
I've put on an act twice.

399
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:45,188
Both times for Ha-joon.

400
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:50,151
Han Ji-yong…

401
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,364
tried to kill me.

402
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:58,493
I couldn't say that to the police.

403
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,329
His dad's death was painful enough

404
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,290
for Ha-joon.

405
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,877
I couldn't let him find out that his dad

406
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,505
tried to kill his mom.

407
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,300
That was the only reason.

408
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:18,137
People might think it's trivial or silly.

409
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,308
But it was an important reason for me.

410
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:24,978
It's not trivial.

411
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,313
Not at all.

412
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,067
To mothers,

413
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:36,030
it's more than enough reason.

414
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,367
If I go to hell because of my lies,

415
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,579
I will gladly go.

416
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,248
Thank you.

417
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,793
I'm just caring for my son.

418
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,130
Why do you always thank me for it?

419
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:01,347
Thank you for giving birth to my son.

420
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,433
Ha-joon…

421
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,520
is your son.

422
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,317
I will not…

423
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,194
forget that.

424
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:35,340
Ttak-sun and her friends
have been pecking all over the place.

425
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:38,092
We repair the walls,
but they do it again and again.

426
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,386
I think they're building a nest inside.

427
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,308
It's like all the woodpeckers in Seoul
are gathering at Hyowon Mansion.

428
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:49,937
Not just in Seoul. I'm sure woodpeckers
from Gyeonggi Province are coming too.

429
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,693
Well, birds are migratory,
so they don't have hometowns. Right?

430
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,279
Right. Gosh.

431
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:01,115
Having no roots can be simpler at times.

432
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:05,244
What's the point of being rich?
We can't even stop a mere woodpecker.

433
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,997
I finally got it.

434
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,708
Why is it so banal?

435
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,919
Ms. Yang.

436
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:15,713
Stay healthy.

437
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,511
The necklace is shining even more brightly
now that it's on its true owner.

438
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,431
Is it pretty?

439
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,854
Are you really leaving?

440
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,023
Yes.

441
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,026
Goodbye, then.

442
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,119
You know, none of the guys I met
while studying abroad

443
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,162
did their military service.

444
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:52,667
But I did to set an example.

445
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,585
This is an example of noblesse oblige.

446
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,838
Where did you serve?

447
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:58,923
The Defense Forces.

448
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:01,759
-The Defense Forces?
-That's what it was called back then.

449
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,846
It sounds more military-related
than "public service workers."

450
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,389
I wonder why they changed it.

451
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,183
Where did you serve?

452
01:02:09,767 --> 01:02:10,810
I was…

453
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,147
in the Marines.

454
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,736
You must have been looking down on me.

455
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,489
No. The Defense Forces are so cool.

456
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,660
Let's get out. My body feels too soaked.

457
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:20,213
SLEEPING PILLS

458
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,973
Why did it have to be like this?

459
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,939
Not everything was a lie, right?

460
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:42,235
I can't forgive you.

461
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,197
But I will forget you…

462
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,283
for my own sake.

463
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,193
Ms. Joo.

464
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,488
Thank you…

465
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,910
for what you did that night.

466
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,516
Ms. Seo.

467
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:57,935
Take care of yourself.

468
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,398
You too.

469
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,235
And…

470
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,197
Ms. Jung thought

471
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:15,745
that you were the one
who killed Mr. Han Ji-yong.

472
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,709
So she was trying to protect you
to the very end.

473
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,775
The chairwoman is coming in.

474
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,574
Was it me you were trying…

475
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,160
to protect?

476
01:05:58,287 --> 01:05:59,538
And were you…

477
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,125
trying to protect

478
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,588
Ha-joon?

479
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,432
I wasn't trying to cover up your crime.

480
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:20,810
I trusted you.

481
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,482
And I just did what I had to do.

482
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,026
Thank you.

483
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:31,988
I won't forget that.

484
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:33,781
No.

485
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:35,992
You should.

486
01:06:55,344 --> 01:07:01,600
6 MONTHS LATER

487
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:14,655
Rubato is empty.

488
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,825
We should have Soo-hyuk live there
once he gets married.

489
01:07:17,908 --> 01:07:21,037
And I think just one maid will be enough.

490
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,913
I guess home management suits you.

491
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,623
I think so, too.

492
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:26,876
-Aren't you going back to work?
-No, I'm not.

493
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:29,086
-Gosh.
-A happy home is everything.

494
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,714
We have to get our family matters
in order first.

495
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:35,968
By the way, don't you think
we should send Ttak-sun away?

496
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,220
-What?
-Should we have a family meeting?

497
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,848
She's been pecking at our house.

498
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:47,813
Hello?

499
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,107
Where are you?

500
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,777
Okay. I'll be right over.

501
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:56,655
Hey. No one can find out
that we're hanging out. Okay?

502
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,116
Okay.

503
01:08:00,326 --> 01:08:02,912
Who are you seeing this time?

504
01:08:02,995 --> 01:08:04,246
Gosh.

505
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:15,674
Goodness.

506
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:20,137
You should have some food.

507
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:22,139
-Okay.
-Okay.

508
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:32,066
Hey, do we have our team?

509
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,902
You seem much better now.

510
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:38,948
You're the only friend I have left.

511
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,991
Same here.

512
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,538
You divorced my sister,
but I see you more often than her.

513
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:49,166
I can't even play golf now.
I'll just settle for computer games.

514
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,878
You should. I'll play with you.

515
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,047
Two lonely people together.

516
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,050
Hearing that makes me feel more miserable.

517
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,844
Stop that. Seriously.

518
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,683
Gosh, that punk. He must be really lonely.

519
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:14,608
When people tried to stone an adulterer,
Jesus said,

520
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:18,362
"Let the one among you who is guiltless

521
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:21,157
be the first to throw a stone at her."

522
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:23,492
That's what he said.

523
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:32,042
Do any of you have
the right to stone anyone?

524
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:33,043
Yes.

525
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,677
I see.

526
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:45,055
I get it. Why don't we pray?

527
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:49,685
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

528
01:09:49,768 --> 01:09:51,312
-Amen.
-Amen.

529
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,794
I missed you.

530
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,048
Oh. Hold on.

531
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:41,028
How long have you been

532
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,322
working here?

533
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,372
Damn it!

534
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,792
Why am I getting kicked out again?

535
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:57,378
Is getting kicked out
a constant theme in my life?

536
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,338
Just wait and see.

537
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,217
I'll come back no matter what. I will.

538
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:14,979
CHAIRWOMAN JUNG SEO-HYUN

539
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:58,063
SEO HI-SOO MAKES HER COMEBACK
WITH A DRAMA SERIES CALLED MINE

540
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:06,322
MINE, EPISODE 1

541
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:12,536
Hi-soo.

542
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,334
Our first shoot has been scheduled.
It's next Monday.

543
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,586
-Really?
-Hi-soo.

544
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,839
Are you ready to be
in front of people again?

545
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:26,884
Of course.

546
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,513
I can do anything now.

547
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,728
Ha-joon will arrive soon. Let's go.

548
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:41,899
A PLACE WHERE THE WIND
OF NEW LIVES BLOWS

549
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:56,038
My gosh. How grateful I am.

550
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:13,889
Let me apologize to you…

551
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:21,188
on behalf of the world
that forced you to stay in the closet.

552
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:23,774
I would like to apologize to you.

553
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,446
It's not a sin, but you had to
live your whole life hiding it…

554
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,907
as if it were a sin.

555
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,660
Don't do that now.

556
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:39,456
Thank you.

557
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:40,833
Oh.

558
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,293
Do you like kalguksu with perilla seeds?

559
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,504
That's the only dish I'm good at making.

560
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:46,588
Sounds good.

561
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,924
Hi-soo told me
that you make a mean kalguksu.

562
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:50,801
I'd love to try it.

563
01:13:50,884 --> 01:13:53,720
Let's go then.
You should bring Hi-soo too next time.

564
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:55,139
Okay.

565
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:24,751
You know, Deathman always says that

566
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:27,254
at the end of his songs.
It's like his signature.

567
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:31,008
I'll cook everything
you want to eat today.

568
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:32,968
Then I want your braised short ribs!

569
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,553
And I knew you'd say that.

570
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:39,308
Oh, my boy.

571
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:45,314
Thank you for everything.

572
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,566
Sure.

573
01:14:49,776 --> 01:14:50,611
Let's go.

574
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:59,453
Let's raise Ha-joon
the best we can together.

575
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:03,081
I'll give it my everything.
That's what I should do.

576
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:07,544
Let's help him become
the salt and light of the world,

577
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:09,838
and go our separate ways afterwards.

578
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:10,756
Okay.

579
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:13,133
Let's make sure to do that.

580
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:49,503
Seo-hyun.

581
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:51,505
Yes?

582
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:54,466
I heard about Hyowon E&M's investment
in this drama.

583
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,469
I'm a businesswoman.

584
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:01,348
I didn't do it for my ex-sister-in-law.
I did it because it's a good drama.

585
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:04,268
Do a good job.

586
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:08,021
-Seo-hyun.
-Yes?

587
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:09,648
You seem happy.

588
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:15,529
Have you found what's yours?

589
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:20,993
I won't ask for more details.

590
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:24,329
Whether you've found it or not,

591
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:28,458
the fact that Jung Seo-hyun is
a truly amazing woman doesn't change.

592
01:16:29,793 --> 01:16:31,628
I learned a lot from you.

593
01:16:32,296 --> 01:16:35,674
You love others beyond yourself,

594
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,594
which is how you can love yourself
even more.

595
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:40,804
That's what you taught me.

596
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,598
You learned that yourself.

597
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:47,644
And I'm where I am now thanks to you.

598
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:52,149
Our relationship was indeed special.

599
01:16:53,984 --> 01:16:55,444
Thank you, Hi-soo.

600
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:07,372
Ms. Seo, we're shooting soon.

601
01:17:58,465 --> 01:17:59,883
Suzy, it's me.

602
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,637
I will…

603
01:18:05,722 --> 01:18:07,432
come to see you next week.

604
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:11,186
I miss you.

605
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:20,987
You're not scared, right?

606
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,948
You fell before. Are you okay?

607
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:24,908
Okay.

608
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:26,410
All right. Go ahead.

609
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:28,537
There you go.

610
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,373
One, two.

611
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:32,749
Relax your shoulders.

612
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,335
You're doing very well.

613
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,671
You're so cool.

614
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:27,804
Mother Emma…

615
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,850
I think I've found the answer.

616
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:39,691
The ability to love myself
despite having lost everything.

617
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:44,821
That's the answer.

618
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:48,617
Mine.

619
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,875
FINAL EPISODE
GLORIOUS WOMEN

620
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,563
SPECIAL THANKS TO SONG SUN-MI
