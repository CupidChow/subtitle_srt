1
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,930
It's me.

2
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:58,850
Is it true?

3
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,020
Are you really…

4
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,481
pregnant?

5
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,341
Yes, I am.

6
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,220
I was going to tell you tonight.

7
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,515
Hi-soo, I'll look for Ha-joon.

8
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,725
You can't drive now.
Don't stress yourself.

9
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,144
So I need you to pull over right now.

10
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,229
No.

11
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,648
I can find him.

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,400
Let's talk after we find him. Bye.

13
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:50,985
Hi-soo.

14
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,445
Hi-soo!

15
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,840
Her name was Lee Hye-jin?

16
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,134
I heard that the woman left Ha-joon here

17
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,678
and got into an accident not long after.

18
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,097
Did you know Ms. Kang Ja-kyeong
before I hired her?

19
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,891
Who's Kang Ja-kyeong?

20
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,853
What do you think happened to her?

21
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:30,692
Our mother-in-law is the only person
who has seen her.

22
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:34,487
I guess only Ha-joon's dead mother
would know the truth.

23
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:39,033
She recently asked
for her records to be deleted?

24
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,122
She's alive.

25
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,000
Mr. Han Ji-yong asked the directorate

26
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,878
to pick Mr. Han Jin-ho instead.

27
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:55,049
So Hi-soo and I have been fooled
by the little act

28
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,053
Mother and Han Ji-yong put together?

29
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,061
EPISODE 6
THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH AND FALSE PEACE

30
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,462
CALLS

31
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,048
HAN JI-YONG, SOO-YOUNG,
MAID JOO MIN-SU

32
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,635
HAN JI-YONG

33
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,976
Why did you call me so many times?
Did something happen?

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,144
Where's Ha-joon?

35
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,396
Did Ha-joon go missing?

36
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,649
How could you do that
if you truly care for him?

37
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,484
I know you're behind the news article!

38
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,081
Where are you, Ha-joon?

39
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,416
You were bound to face it at some point.

40
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,836
You're strong just like me.
You are, aren't you?

41
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:19,842
Please locate a phone.

42
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,135
I'll send you the number.

43
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,513
You have to hurry!

44
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,850
I have to find him. It has to be me.

45
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,689
Go and find him at once!

46
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,276
We believe someone has taken the bird.

47
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,485
What?

48
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,530
Did you check if the cage was closed
after No-deok got his shot?

49
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,447
He did.

50
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:44,117
Did you check?

51
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,576
Did you close the cage?

52
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,622
Yes. I believe the bird ran away…

53
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:55,003
I think No-deok ran away
from the cage on his own.

54
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,504
What? Run away on his own?

55
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,841
My gosh. No-deok is a bird.
He's a stupid bird for God's sake!

56
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,051
No-deok can't run away on his own.

57
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,304
I've been so nice to him!

58
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,764
If he has a bit of a conscience,
he can't leave me.

59
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,349
A bird has no conscience.

60
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,350
Hey!

61
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,854
How dare you talk back to me?

62
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,565
That really hurts.
The mansion has tight security.

63
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,485
I believe it's impossible
for anyone to steal the bird, ma'am.

64
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,488
Exactly. So No-deok must be
somewhere around the house.

65
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,116
Go search every nook and cranny.
Check the trees.

66
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,242
Search everywhere!

67
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,245
-Hurry. Go and find my bird!
-Yes, ma'am.

68
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,664
Go find my bird. Goodness.

69
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,126
-Mother.
-What?

70
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,753
Ha-joon went missing.

71
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,047
Your missing peacock isn't the issue now.

72
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,383
Shouldn't you be worried about Ha-joon?

73
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,219
There are people looking for him.

74
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,514
Besides, Ha-joon is such a smart boy.

75
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,641
I'm sure he will come home on his own.

76
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,102
But he went missing
after the article was released.

77
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,479
I know that.

78
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,939
But I'm sure his parents will find him.

79
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,107
Why worry about him?

80
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,026
I should worry about my parentless bird.

81
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,611
Ha-joon has two mothers…

82
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,905
What do you mean?

83
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,115
"Two mothers"?

84
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,826
I meant to say…

85
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,996
She takes care of Ha-joon

86
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:16,250
as if she's his mother. That's all.

87
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,401
Hello?

88
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,904
I got the last known location
of the cell phone.

89
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:45,822
Where was it?

90
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,398
-Ms. Seo.
-Yes.

91
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,732
Are you his guardian?

92
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,693
Yes.

93
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,070
Thank you. Thank you so much.

94
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,052
Did you have fun at the concert?

95
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,930
Was Woo cool in person?

96
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,976
Aren't you hungry?

97
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,103
Aren't you thirsty?

98
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,304
Are you sure you're not hungry?

99
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,849
Should we eat something?

100
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,865
Aren't you cold?

101
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,409
No. I'm good.

102
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,413
How old are you?

103
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,207
I'm 27.

104
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,211
You're a year older than me.
Sorry for dropping the honorifics.

105
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:07,797
But…

106
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,717
I don't think
I can address you with honorifics now.

107
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,889
As you wish.

108
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,017
I'll drop the honorifics, too.

109
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,233
What will you call me?

110
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,614
Han Soo-hyuk.

111
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,834
I have to get going now.

112
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,176
Here.

113
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,146
My brother gave it to me.

114
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,191
When I feel down, I look at that.
And it makes me smile.

115
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,321
If you're always sad,
it'll become second nature.

116
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,074
Bye.

117
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,130
-No-deok.
-No-deok.

118
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,674
-No-deok.
-No-deok.

119
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,760
-No-deok.
-No-deok.

120
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,475
-No-deok.
-He's not here. Goodness.

121
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,398
No-deok. No-deok!

122
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,216
Seo-hyun.

123
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:58,926
Hi-soo.

124
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,303
Say hello.

125
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,684
-We'll go inside.
-Okay.

126
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,089
You used to be a tiny baby.
When did my prince grow so much?

127
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,471
Look at your arms.

128
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,725
Your bones are nice and strong.

129
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,562
When Dad comes home,

130
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,441
say that you are sorry first.

131
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,292
-Where's Ha-joon?
-He's on the second floor.

132
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,902
Roll up your pants.

133
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,988
Did you not hear me?
Roll up your pants now!

134
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,032
Who taught you to do that?

135
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,577
How dare you go to a concert by yourself
without even telling your parents?

136
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,204
And you turned off your phone too!

137
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,581
What are you doing?

138
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,502
-Step back.
-No. You step back.

139
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,217
How could you hit my son?

140
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,927
Who said you could do that?

141
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,514
We should ask why he went there
without telling us first.

142
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:09,932
Do only your feelings matter?

143
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,518
What about Ha-joon's feelings?
Do you know how he feels?

144
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,854
He's my son.

145
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,275
And I won't let anyone
lay a finger on him.

146
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,110
Even if it's you.

147
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,508
Ha-joon.

148
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,138
Let's just sleep tonight.

149
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,767
Tomorrow will be different.

150
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,483
So let's just go to sleep
together like this tonight.

151
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,187
That day, as she observed Ms. Seo,

152
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:43,734
she experienced all kinds of
complicated feelings one could have.

153
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,281
Jealousy, rage, sadness,

154
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,160
gratitude for loving her son so dearly

155
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:56,080
and the irony of that gratitude.

156
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,918
And she also felt guilty
for hurting her son.

157
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,549
However, the emotion that eventually
consumed her in the end

158
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,762
was determination to take back
what she thought belonged to her.

159
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,855
"Where's the birth mother of Han Soo-hyuk,
the crown prince of Hyowon Group?

160
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,107
And how is she doing?

161
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,944
The eldest grandson of Hyowon Group is

162
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,447
also known to be
a love child of Han Jin-ho."

163
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,782
What?

164
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,160
SHE LEFT THE FAMILY DUE TO ABUSE,
AND HER WHEREABOUTS ARE UNKNOWN

165
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,831
"Jung Seo-hyun,
the director of Seohyun Gallery,

166
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,793
is known to have given up having children
for Han Soo-hyuk.

167
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,423
It was also rumored that the son
of actress Seo Hi-soo,

168
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,094
Han Ha-joon, was not her biological son.
And the rumor has been confirmed.

169
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,847
Could this be the Hyowon Group curse?"

170
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,600
These annoying gossipers. Unbelievable.

171
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,979
Tell me. Did they find Ha-joon?

172
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,649
Yes. He just came back home
and went to sleep.

173
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,777
Gosh. That's a relief.
I knew that they would find him.

174
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,112
And what about No-deok?

175
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,657
No-deok is… Well…

176
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,159
You couldn't find him?

177
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,287
Why can't you find my bird?

178
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,706
Where would the bird even go?

179
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,207
You couldn't find it?

180
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,610
No one imagined that
this deep, hidden door in the darkness…

181
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,866
"Knock,

182
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,034
and it will be opened for you."

183
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:33,172
would be able to be opened
with a cheap glass suction cup.

184
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,466
"Seek,

185
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,553
and you will find."

186
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:42,514
It resembled the nature of the universe
where the most difficult problem

187
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,224
is solved with the simplest method.

188
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,996
But not everything was as simple.

189
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,732
What were you doing in Ha-joon's room?

190
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,151
Did I do something wrong?

191
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,278
Isn't that obvious?

192
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,490
You're the one who did something wrong.

193
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,786
Ha-joon went to a concert
without even telling you.

194
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,580
That's what you mean to Ha-joon.

195
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,915
What did you say?

196
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,045
I've felt it for a while now.

197
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,340
Are you trying to get on my nerves
on purpose? Or are you--

198
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,009
-I'm actually--
-Hi-soo.

199
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,390
Is Ha-joon asleep?

200
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,142
Yes.

201
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,144
I'm sorry about earlier.

202
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,104
Ha-joon has never done this before,

203
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,023
so I lost my temper.

204
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,400
Is he okay?

205
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,360
He's fine.

206
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,449
Why are you still here, Ms. Kang?

207
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,076
Please go if you're done with work.

208
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,078
Let's go.

209
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,621
Okay.

210
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,631
I hope you weren't too shocked today.

211
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,051
I'm okay.

212
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,974
Hi-soo.

213
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,852
Thank you. And I love you.

214
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,272
You trust me, right?

215
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,443
Get rid of all the doubts
about me in your head.

216
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,404
I want you to only think
about yourself, me, Ha-joon,

217
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,323
and my baby.

218
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:47,866
I can…

219
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,746
trust you, right?

220
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,331
Of course.

221
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,292
I'm the one who loves you
the most in the world.

222
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,585
How can you not trust me?

223
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,590
And let's let the tutor go.

224
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,383
I don't like her.

225
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,512
She made you feel insecure.

226
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,972
And you doubted me for keeping her here.

227
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm telling her everything tomorrow.
Every single thing.

228
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,006
-I'll tell her.
-Tell her what?

229
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,758
That I am Ha-joon's mother, not her.

230
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,261
Ha-joon is my son.

231
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,097
I'm not asking for your permission.
I'm telling you.

232
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,765
She's pregnant.

233
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,853
Don't hurt her.

234
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,272
She's pregnant with my child.

235
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,315
She's carrying my baby.

236
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,862
You shouldn't have done anything
but take care of Ha-joon here.

237
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,572
Why…

238
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,907
Why are you so greedy?

239
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,577
I hate greedy women.

240
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,621
Don't do anything to her.

241
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,834
If you hurt her, my child will be hurt.

242
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,420
Then,

243
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:25,630
what about me?

244
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,507
You can go back to where you came from.

245
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,344
You died six years ago.

246
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,387
Ji-yong.

247
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,764
Don't try to get your way.
Only you'll get hurt.

248
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,850
And stop confusing Ha-joon.

249
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,065
My PR team will get this tomorrow.

250
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,029
Ha-joon's birth mother lived abroad after
giving birth and died in a car accident.

251
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,364
That's a fact.

252
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,445
Go ahead.

253
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,247
Let's go.

254
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,914
You died in a car accident.

255
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,506
So don't show up
in front of the baby ever again.

256
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,967
We will take him.

257
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,233
I'm not dead.

258
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,573
You protect your son.

259
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,742
I will protect mine.

260
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:03,163
I'll help your son Jin-ho
become the chairman.

261
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,080
No.

262
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,540
Yes, Hi-soo.

263
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,584
I need to tell you something.

264
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,378
Can I come over now?

265
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,004
No. I'll come over to you.

266
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,590
I need to talk to you too.

267
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,887
Thank you for coming.

268
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,015
No. It's time I came by.

269
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,102
We haven't had tea here in a while.

270
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,813
That's right.

271
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,991
-Hi-soo.
-Seo-hyun.

272
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,702
Actually,

273
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,414
I'm pregnant.

274
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,667
You must be surprised.

275
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,380
I no longer feel uncertainty
about my feelings.

276
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:23,595
I'm certain that even if I have a baby,
my love for Ha-joon won't change.

277
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,016
More importantly,
Ha-joon and I trust each other a lot.

278
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,772
Besides, Ha-joon feels lonely easily.

279
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,901
Okay.

280
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:39,861
I see.

281
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:44,365
I've been relying on you a lot
since marrying into this family.

282
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,868
I hope I can continue to do so.

283
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,123
Sure. You can do that.

284
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,216
You said you also had something to say.

285
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,095
It's nothing. Take care of yourself.

286
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,690
Gosh. This is a Lazare diamond.

287
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,026
You can't sell this.

288
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,152
What?

289
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,529
Why not?

290
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:27,242
This blue diamond was made by Lazare,
so it has a serial number.

291
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,410
What serial number? What's he saying?

292
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,496
-We can erase it.
-We can erase it.

293
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,249
If you sell this to anyone,
you'll get arrested right away.

294
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,212
-I see.
-Okay.

295
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,760
My goodness.

296
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,095
Be careful.

297
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,181
These lunatics.

298
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,850
Oh, my.

299
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:06,364
Find No-deok!
What have you been doing all night?

300
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,284
If we don't find him soon,
he'll eat random stuff

301
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,246
and become an unsophisticated bird.
Find No-deok. Find my No-deok!

302
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,458
My gosh. I'm sorry to tell you this, but…

303
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,751
What is it?

304
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,712
-No-deok…
-Yes?

305
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,798
flew away.

306
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,014
Get out!

307
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,266
No-deok. Get me No-deok!

308
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:34,642
Hey!

309
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,812
-What were you doing?
-Mother.

310
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,773
Be careful around Hi-soo from now on.

311
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,193
What do you mean?

312
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,280
She's pregnant.

313
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,117
She's pregnant?

314
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,827
Pregnant…

315
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,331
That's great.

316
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,042
We should let Ms. Kang go, right?

317
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,376
I suppose.

318
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,129
What?

319
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,257
What are you talking about?

320
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,719
I'm not asking for your permission.

321
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,638
I'll take care of this.

322
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,307
Everyone must…

323
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,852
take responsibility for their actions.

324
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,032
What a mess.

325
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,868
The bird flew away,
the blue diamond was stolen,

326
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,036
and Ms. Seo's pregnant.

327
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,621
What's going on?

328
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,040
No-deok flew away.

329
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,880
Ms. Han, please hang in there.
This will make you beautiful.

330
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,007
-You'll be beautiful.
-You'll become young.

331
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,801
-You'll become young.
-You'll become young.

332
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,564
I want milk tea.

333
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,067
Too much of anything is bad.

334
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,611
You should learn to be moderate.

335
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,613
Instead of transplanting
my own stem cells,

336
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,033
can't they transplant stem cells
of prettier and younger women?

337
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,412
That's been your problem
ever since you were a kid. Your greed.

338
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,956
I think you are greedier than me, Aunt.

339
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,417
Why are you calling me that now?

340
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,585
What should I call you, then?

341
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,090
Just stay married to your husband.

342
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:33,720
I want to but he wants to divorce me.

343
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,680
Exactly. So be nice to him.

344
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,059
He knew that you were a loose cannon
when he married you.

345
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,229
You were notorious in your social circle
for your nasty temper.

346
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,567
He must have thought he could handle you,

347
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,403
but it must have crossed his threshold.

348
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:55,700
Anyway, Jin-ho has been quiet these days.

349
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,285
You're right.

350
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,369
Hey!

351
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,705
How dare you go after my man?

352
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,750
-Do you think I'm a joke?
-Ma'am.

353
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,376
Ma'am, wait.

354
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,377
Please talk it out.

355
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,505
She wouldn't have done what she did
if we could talk it out.

356
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,050
What did he buy you?

357
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,093
A handbag? A necklace?

358
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,553
I'll pay for them.

359
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,307
Let me give you a piece of advice.

360
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,142
You're too young to be doing this.

361
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,643
-My gosh.
-Got that?

362
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,563
That's Hui-bin
from Chwiseondang in Seorae Village.

363
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,107
-You can date him, but I can't?
-Jin-ho's mistress?

364
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,735
-He's mine. He was mine!
-Jin-ho picked up another girl?

365
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,153
-This is embarrassing.
-Hey!

366
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,780
Who do you think you are?

367
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,239
Let go of me!

368
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,910
So his mistress is bullying
his other mistress?

369
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,119
It's not what you think.

370
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,704
When his wife couldn't care less?

371
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,665
Oh, my goodness.

372
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:53,925
Hey.

373
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,179
MAID JOO MIN-SU

374
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,474
Hello?

375
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,268
If you don't come back within 24 hours,

376
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,395
I'll call the police.

377
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:07,814
Ms. Joo.

378
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,734
And pick up some soy sauce
from Chairman Yoon's house of Palseong.

379
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,945
People think you two are out on an errand.

380
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,071
Okay.

381
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,782
What do we do?

382
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,700
Damn it.

383
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:24,080
We'll become her slaves.
I can't live like this anymore.

384
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,915
I feel the same way.

385
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:28,543
Let's go to Guatemala.
There's a lot of good food there.

386
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,253
We'll get caught by Interpol.

387
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,172
-We'll stow away on a ship.
-I get seasick easily. Never.

388
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:39,053
Besides, I want to be a law-abiding
citizen in the best way possible.

389
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,180
Law-abiding citizen? Seasick?

390
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:42,723
Have you gone mad?

391
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,101
That's bullshit. You stole a diamond.

392
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,190
We should go back for now, right?

393
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,239
Oh, my.

394
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,742
I apologize for showing up unannounced.

395
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,661
Do you have some time?

396
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,455
Of course. Sit down, please.

397
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,385
So tell me.

398
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,393
I found out the truth about someone.

399
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,397
If they find out that truth,

400
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,484
they will feel unbearable pain.

401
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,528
But…

402
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,198
they shouldn't be facing…

403
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,951
such pain right now.

404
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:48,956
If I keep my mouth shut,
this unstable peace can be maintained.

405
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,252
But when they find out the truth one day,

406
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,838
the pain will double.

407
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,007
No, it'll increase tenfold.

408
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,469
Should I tell that person…

409
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,639
the truth?

410
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,317
If you were in her shoes,

411
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,198
would you choose the uncomfortable truth
or false peace?

412
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,076
Which would you favor?

413
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,074
Have you just come back home?

414
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,035
Or have you not gone to work yet?

415
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:53,414
Whatever it is, come with me.
I need to talk to you.

416
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,044
She said she was going to
focus on raising Ha-joon

417
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,755
and wouldn't have her own child.

418
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,175
I don't know what's gotten into her.

419
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,468
But that's great.

420
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,305
No wonder Ji-yong was happy
these past couple of days.

421
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,349
Things have gotten complicated.

422
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,850
Why is this complicated?

423
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,146
You know Ha-joon's birth mother, right?

424
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,274
I haven't met her in person,
but I know of her.

425
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,360
Wasn't she Ji-yong's riding coach?

426
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,903
That woman is alive.

427
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,155
What?

428
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,283
You said she died in a car accident.

429
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,326
She's alive.

430
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,205
Guess where she is now.

431
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,998
-Where is she?
-In our house.

432
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,125
-What?
-She's Ha-joon's tutor.

433
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,799
Ji-yong promised to put you
in control of the company

434
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:49,804
in exchange for keeping her existence
secret from Hi-soo.

435
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,974
Why did you say she was dead
when she was still alive?

436
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,579
Did you bring the soy sauce?

437
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,082
-Yes.
-Okay.

438
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,625
Good job.

439
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,746
I just…

440
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,459
wanted to see you.

441
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,463
I think I can go to sleep now.

442
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,631
I think I can, too.

443
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,301
Good night.

444
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,227
I'll take you to the museum, ma'am.

445
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,563
No. I need to go somewhere else.

446
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,942
MANAGING DIRECTOR HAN JI-YONG

447
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:15,824
Seo-hyun.

448
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,953
I checked with your secretary
that you were alone.

449
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,917
What is it? I didn't know you were coming.

450
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:30,798
I needed to talk to you.

451
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,884
Kang Ja-kyeong…

452
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,806
No. How could you let Ms. Lee Hye-jin
into our home?

453
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,185
What kind of deal
did you make with Mother?

454
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,938
Why is she trying so hard
to hide this fact?

455
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,107
And what's your plan now?

456
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,652
After causing this unimaginable disaster?

457
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,785
You found out everything.

458
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,580
I should kick her out.

459
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,291
Hi-soo is pregnant.

460
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:08,294
I will protect the woman
who's carrying my child.

461
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,171
Are you trying to protect Hi-soo

462
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,590
or yourself?

463
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,343
If Hi-soo didn't get pregnant,

464
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,805
would you have kept her at the house
while deceiving the whole family?

465
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,897
You must tell Hi-soo yourself…

466
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,650
and let her make her own choice.

467
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,361
Before it's too late.

468
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:45,331
I thought you of all people
would understand my situation.

469
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,588
Love comes in many forms.

470
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,217
And some forms of love
can't be understood by everyone.

471
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,679
I'm sure you know that.

472
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,977
I was going to let her stay
as Ha-joon's tutor.

473
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,647
But you see, my plan

474
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,067
kept changing based on the feelings
and situations of the people involved.

475
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,944
Gosh. I really hate that.

476
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,614
And look what happened.

477
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,658
It's because she got greedy.

478
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,666
Fine.

479
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,462
I dreamed of ruling Hyowon Group.

480
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,423
No one in the family has what it takes
to lead the company.

481
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,716
No one.

482
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,261
But who do you think
was my biggest threat?

483
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,388
So…

484
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,224
did you look for my weakness?

485
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,184
I wasn't trying to find your weakness.

486
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:51,438
I just had to know
what your family had in mind.

487
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,941
I needed to know.

488
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,569
I think we've gotten pretty close

489
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:01,240
now that we shared pretty heavy secrets
about each other.

490
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,171
Hi-soo.

491
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,591
Representatives from the PR
and legal teams are waiting for you.

492
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,095
Okay, I'll be there soon.

493
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,139
INFORMATION ON REPORTER IM SEONG-SU
OF SHINILGAN ENTERTAINMENT NEWS

494
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,099
He's a full-time reporter for Shinilgan

495
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,852
and his performance
was rated fairly highly in this field.

496
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,397
He is currently under review by
the ethics committee, as you requested,

497
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,023
for the problems with his methods.

498
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,608
Have you found the source?

499
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:40,195
They remain hidden behind
the protection of news sources.

500
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,782
Let's file a lawsuit.
Then we can find out everything.

501
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:47,286
I'm familiar with these situations
from my time as an actress.

502
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,999
I don't want to make this a bigger deal.

503
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,209
Yes, ma'am.

504
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,211
That doesn't mean I'm willing
to let it go.

505
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,173
Because Ha-joon is involved,

506
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,717
I want to make it absolutely sure

507
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,094
that something like this
doesn't ever happen again.

508
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:09,308
Getting those reporters to talk
is actually quite simple.

509
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,811
I understand.
Please give us a little more time.

510
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:27,117
I will keep my eye on you
and see how well you can grow

511
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,411
your culture business.

512
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,124
Let me make it clear
that you're also a valuable candidate

513
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,710
for the chairman of Hyowon Group.

514
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,966
I know why you married my brother.

515
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,592
And I also know that

516
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,012
you will not remarry if you get a divorce.

517
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,305
And even if you do,

518
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:34,851
your partner won't be a man.

519
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,522
You are a sexual minority.

520
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,694
But what's wrong with that?

521
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,572
I support you. The problem is…

522
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,909
that you've shamelessly deceived
my brother and the world.

523
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,124
In that sense, you and I have committed
sins of the same degree.

524
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,837
So we shouldn't try to
bring each other down, should we?

525
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,176
What do you think?

526
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,470
Seo-hyun?

527
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,873
I will leave this place as you wish.

528
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,043
But I need to talk to you one last time.

529
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,920
Meet me at the parking lot.
Can't you do that for me?

530
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:33,095
Ms. Seo, it's only right that I leave.

531
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,015
But I would like to say goodbye
before I leave.

532
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,643
I'll wait for you at the parking lot.

533
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,788
I'll do what you asked.

534
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,374
I'm leaving.

535
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,751
Where are you going?

536
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,086
I'll go back to Canada.

537
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,254
That woman…

538
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,214
The real Kang Ja-kyeong.

539
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,217
Make sure to keep her mouth shut.

540
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,511
Don't worry.

541
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,266
I'm going back now
as if nothing ever happened.

542
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:26,982
What are you doing?

543
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,723
Honey.

544
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,893
What are you doing here?

545
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,354
I forgot something in the car.

546
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,065
It's cold.

547
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,297
MOTHER EMMA

548
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,646
It's an activity vehicle,
so I got it tuned a bit.

549
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,568
Yes, Mother Emma.

550
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:56,446
Hello?

551
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,407
Hello?

552
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,535
Can you not hear me?

553
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,465
I'll attend the event.

554
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,259
Yes.

555
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:19,719
I'll see you then.

556
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,731
What are you trying to pull?

557
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,360
You said I got on your nerves.

558
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,989
Then it'll be better if I'm not here.

559
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,866
That's why I'm quitting.

560
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,911
I heard that you are pregnant.

561
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,667
Congratulations.

562
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:55,213
I hope you give birth to a healthy baby.

563
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,466
Do you mean that?

564
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,801
Of course.

565
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,178
A new life is such a blessing.

566
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,806
I know that.

567
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,688
I want to tell you something
before I leave.

568
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,065
I don't want to hear it.

569
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:15,901
Pardon?

570
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,736
This is why broken trust is worrisome.

571
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,865
Whatever you say will only make me
more suspicious.

572
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,659
I don't want to add to my suspicions.

573
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,788
Because my anxious thoughts
will affect my baby.

574
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:33,251
I've been blessed with this precious baby.

575
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,670
So I must be careful, too.

576
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:39,090
A mother should be able to choose
to think and talk about

577
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,884
only good things for her baby.

578
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:47,265
Is what you want to tell me
something I should hear right now?

579
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,769
Please consider that, woman to woman.

580
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,489
No.

581
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,282
I'll tell you…

582
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,077
next time we meet.

583
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:10,664
I'll get going now.

584
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,171
Thank you.

585
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,593
For being understanding.

586
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:28,723
And thank you for loving my son, Ha-joon.

587
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,720
Ha-joon, I'm alive.

588
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,556
Wait for me.

589
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,890
Do you think we can continue?

590
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,352
Yes.

591
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,279
If you were to go back to that day,

592
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:09,824
what would you do?

593
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:14,454
Even if I could go back to that day,

594
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,499
I'd make the same decision.

595
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,878
I was born, educated,

596
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,922
and raised like that.

597
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,758
I've had everything…

598
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,762
but that's all I know.

599
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:39,938
I didn't come to you for an answer
or for salvation.

600
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,565
I just needed someone…

601
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:47,612
Just one person I could talk to
about who I really am.

602
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,657
Please…

603
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,120
just listen to my story.

604
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:06,631
Only you can help and save yourself.

605
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,475
It was two years ago.

606
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,147
That was the last time I saw her.

607
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:24,107
She's here.

608
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:47,797
I missed you.

609
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:55,805
Even when we were together,
no one suspected us.

610
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,934
People probably thought
that we were just friends.

611
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,564
What did she…

612
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,567
mean to you?

613
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,575
She was mine.

614
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:16,052
You are the first person I confided in
about her.

615
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,890
Now that I'm ready to talk about her,

616
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,727
I think it's really time…

617
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,482
to let her go.

618
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,452
Really? Is that so?

619
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:44,080
Mr. Han, I miss you a lot.

620
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,832
Yes. I miss you, too.

621
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:48,751
-How much longer must I wait?
-Just a bit longer.

622
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,962
Let me see your handsome face better.

623
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:55,466
-Is this good?
-You're so handsome.

624
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:01,556
Mr. Han?

625
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,934
The screen is dark. I can't see anything.

626
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,187
Are you in a movie theater?

627
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,190
Mr. Han?

628
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,651
Mr. Han?

629
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,237
Did it disconnect?

630
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,909
Did something happen to her?

631
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,412
What? Nothing happened to Chae-yeong.

632
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,790
No. I wasn't talking about you.
I was talking about Ms. Jung.

633
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,209
I mean, my wife.

634
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,295
When will you come see me?

635
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:34,547
-Are you coming tonight?
-Should I?

636
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,197
I need to ask you something.

637
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:03,076
Ms. Joo, did something happen to Ms. Jung…

638
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:04,827
recently?

639
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,837
What did Ms. Kang say
when she was leaving?

640
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,174
She didn't say anything.

641
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,926
We'll find a new tutor.

642
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,721
Ms. Kang is leaving.

643
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,182
Who's my real mother?

644
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:12,603
She's dead.

645
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:15,314
She's in heaven.

646
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,609
Don't lie to me. I know that's not true.

647
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:23,114
The news article is not true.

648
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,116
Han Ha-joon.

649
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,328
Just like you,
your grandmother isn't my real mother.

650
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:34,625
My real mother also died just like yours.

651
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:41,674
God always takes away something
from special people like you and me.

652
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:44,135
But fortunately,

653
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,514
you have a mother
who truly loves you, unlike me.

654
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:53,895
Ha-joon, your mother is pregnant
with your younger sibling.

655
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,063
Really?

656
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:59,108
You and I must protect the baby.

657
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:00,860
Okay?

658
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:23,883
Let's go.

659
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,305
-You're here.
-Yes.

660
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,351
Dad came to pick me up.

661
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,603
I'll go upstairs.

662
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,983
Let's go and wash up.

663
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,236
Mom.

664
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:49,992
Mom.

665
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,662
Don't ever leave me.

666
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,920
What are you talking about?

667
01:04:02,463 --> 01:04:05,800
You're the only one I have.

668
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:11,764
You're the only mom I have
in this universe.

669
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:18,980
And you are my universe, Ha-joon.

670
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,773
I mean it.

671
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,859
I can make 100 pinky promises.

672
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:27,154
I like you the most in this world.

673
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,203
If I could turn back time,

674
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,457
I'd want to be in your belly.

675
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,461
From day one.

676
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,594
I wish I could have been with you.

677
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:55,641
Mom.

678
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,981
Once the baby's born,

679
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,067
I'll feed the baby milk,

680
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,486
play together,

681
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,073
and study together too.
I'll do everything.

682
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,827
You can't get sick. Okay?

683
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:38,059
ILSIN SPONSORED CHARITY EVENT
THE DAOOM WELFARE FOUNDATION

684
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:40,811
By the way, the green onions…

685
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:42,271
-I got it.
-What?

686
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,398
-Should I add more?
-Yes.

687
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,370
ILSIN SPONSORED CHARITY EVENT

688
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,746
THE DAOOM WELFARE FOUNDATION

689
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,301
I found out the reporter's source.

690
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:15,137
Okay. Who is it?

691
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,723
Her name is Lee Hye-jin.

692
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,312
What's…

693
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:27,775
-her name again?
-Lee Hye-jin.

694
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,988
Is Ha-joon's birth mother really dead?

695
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,740
Yes. She's dead.

696
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:41,956
What's her name?

697
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:44,000
I should at least know her name.

698
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:46,335
After all, she gave birth to Ha-joon.

699
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:53,676
Lee…

700
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,303
Hye-jin.

701
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:11,193
I think we've gotten pretty close

702
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,697
now that we shared pretty heavy secrets
about each other.

703
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:19,702
I've been relying on you a lot
since marrying into this family.

704
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,079
I hope I can continue to do so.

705
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:27,251
Cancel my entire schedule for today.

706
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:32,256
Mr. Seo, call Soo-young and find out
where Hi-soo is now.

707
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:08,000
Hi-soo.

708
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,089
Seo-hyun, what brings you here?

709
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,137
I'm…

710
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,516
going to tell you an uncomfortable truth.

711
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:25,935
Can you handle it?

712
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,734
Tell me.

713
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,946
Delaying the truth doesn't mean
I can avoid it.

714
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:46,455
I plan to face it head-on.

715
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,126
Seo-hyun.

716
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,837
I found out something, too.

717
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,091
Lee Hye-jin, Ha-joon's birth mother,

718
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,262
is alive.

719
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:02,471
That Lee Hye-jin is

720
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:06,851
Ha-joon's tutor, Kang Ja-kyeong.

721
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,238
Hello.

722
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:03,741
I'm Lee Hye-jin.

723
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,067
When I first discovered them,

724
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:41,153
there were two people on the floor.

725
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,407
But when I came back…

726
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,642
Think only about Ha-joon and yourself.

727
01:11:11,725 --> 01:11:14,061
I'll do what you want to do instead.

728
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:15,813
They're holding
an emergency board meeting.

729
01:11:15,896 --> 01:11:17,564
Ji-yong can't do that to me.

730
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:19,275
He should keep his promise!

731
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:21,402
Are you going to record us talking

732
01:11:21,485 --> 01:11:22,569
and send it to Han Ji-yong as well?

733
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:24,196
Why is she suddenly being transferred?

734
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,739
You should stop now, Soo-hyuk.

735
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,284
I'm saying this not for your sake,
but for hers.

736
01:11:28,367 --> 01:11:31,453
You need to be smart about what to protect
and what to let go.

737
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,747
Stop what you're doing right now.

738
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:36,083
You might really die this time.

739
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,921
