1
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,310
Is my baby…

2
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,604
all right?

3
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,230
It's dead.

4
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,941
You killed…

5
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,027
my baby.

6
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,529
You…

7
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,413
Did you kill my baby?

8
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,373
What?

9
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:25,251
Why did you lie to me all this time? Why?

10
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,921
You of all people
don't get to say anything about lying.

11
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,215
Aren't you the biggest liar?

12
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,133
Let's end this.

13
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,636
A quiet divorce would be best

14
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,722
for the sake of you, me, and the company.

15
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:41,059
What do you want?

16
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,894
I already told you the other day.

17
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,396
I'm taking Ha-joon with me.

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,818
I'm divorcing you so that he won't turn
into a monster like you.

19
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,822
Even if you neglect him,
he'll pick up on your behavior.

20
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,366
Just the thought of that drives me insane.

21
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,327
Don't use him as leverage.

22
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,164
Do you know why I told Ms. Lee
to request a transfer of custody?

23
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,917
You may be Ha-joon's biological father,

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,088
but I wanted the court to recognize
I'm the one who's actually raising him.

25
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,048
To make my next step easier.

26
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,259
The court values precedents very much.

27
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,012
Why are you making
such a foolish decision?

28
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:24,018
Seeing people like you gain such power

29
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,728
makes me feel hopeless.

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,148
But you see…

31
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,443
It strangely gives me a thrill.

32
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,281
Having a powerful opponent
makes me fight harder.

33
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,868
I'm looking forward to this fight
and you should too.

34
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,246
It doesn't look like you'll consent.

35
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,540
So I'll file for divorce.

36
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,608
Why…

37
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,444
Why…

38
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,239
Why is this happening to me? Why?

39
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,700
Why?

40
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,119
Why…

41
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,237
What happened?

42
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,584
What?

43
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,671
Are you telling me you had a miscarriage?

44
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,923
Yes.

45
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,593
Then why did you pretend
that you were fine?

46
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,512
Because I had a plan of my own.

47
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:25,306
And I'm divorcing Ji-yong.

48
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,810
Did he agree to it?

49
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,103
Of course not.

50
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,730
So we'll end up going to court.

51
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,734
I've been your daughter-in-law
for six years.

52
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm informing you out of loyalty and duty.

53
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,200
I figured you were sick of hearing
this kind of news through the newspapers.

54
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,787
I don't understand why you're doing this.

55
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,872
I know that you didn't give birth to him,

56
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,625
but you should've raised him right.

57
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,587
You! How dare you talk to me like that?
How impudent!

58
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,881
I raised Ji-yong into a fine man!

59
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,883
How could I do a better job than this?

60
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,220
It was Ji-yong who stabbed me in the back!

61
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,722
Exactly.

62
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,599
He betrayed you.
That means you didn't raise him well.

63
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:13,104
I don't want Ha-joon to turn out like him,

64
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,814
so I'll raise him by myself.

65
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,192
If he stays here,
he'll be just like his father.

66
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,987
And I learned what not to do from you.

67
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,197
So…

68
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,075
you're telling me
you're going to raise Ha-joon?

69
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,912
You seem shocked to hear it
when it's the obvious thing to do.

70
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,626
Having you as my mother-in-law…

71
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,172
has been very difficult.

72
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,224
You…

73
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,230
Chef Jung!

74
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,775
Chef Jung!

75
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

76
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,293
-Hello.
-Hi.

77
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,003
I heard you'll be in the new drama.

78
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:20,922
-Hello.
-Hello.

79
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,720
-I loved the script.
-I see.

80
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,055
I'm happy to hear that.

81
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,809
Congratulations
on your husband's appointment.

82
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,603
That has nothing to do with me.

83
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,814
Because I'm divorcing him.

84
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,441
That's why I'm coming back.

85
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,236
It's a boring turn of events,
but it happened that way.

86
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,989
What? Then why is
Hyowon Group against this?

87
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:50,535
What do you mean?

88
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,873
Hyowon Group has been pressuring
every TV station to prevent you

89
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,251
from coming back to the industry.

90
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:01,420
There's nothing I can do.

91
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,138
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-YONG

92
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,938
Your brother picked men…

93
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,400
and made them fight each other here.

94
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,946
And he watched.

95
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,871
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-YONG

96
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:22,418
We had to fight like dogs,
so it was called a dogfight.

97
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,711
He told us to become dogs.

98
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,882
If we broke something,
we would get paid more.

99
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,801
So we had to destroy
a part of our opponent.

100
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,597
The more we bled, the more we got paid.

101
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,767
And I ended up fighting my brother.

102
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,479
Kill him!

103
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,522
Kill him!

104
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,982
At that moment, I lost it.

105
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,152
I beat up my bleeding brother
until he passed out.

106
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,864
So…

107
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,951
all the men on his secret phone

108
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,161
fought in this ring?

109
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,371
If my brother dies,

110
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,250
I'll kill your brother right here.

111
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,343
EPISODE 12
CRIME AND SIN

112
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,069
Being able to do whatever you want in life

113
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,196
is a privilege.

114
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,074
I'm embarrassed to call you my son!

115
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,660
Try to be half as capable as Ji-yong!

116
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,454
This is why you will never succeed.

117
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,040
That's the reputation you've built.

118
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,084
No one finds you trustworthy.

119
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,885
Do you have something to tell me?

120
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,599
You're not Father's real son, are you?

121
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,435
I knew something was off.

122
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,937
A different mother wouldn't make
such a difference.

123
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,733
How did you find out?

124
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,362
I put up with you
because you were my half-brother.

125
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,073
If I knew that we didn't share
a single drop of blood,

126
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,825
I would've kicked you out long ago. No.

127
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,744
I would have killed you.

128
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,163
Because I always wanted to.

129
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,544
You shameless bastard!
How dare you take over the company?

130
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,838
Do you think you deserve
to be the chairman?

131
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,634
A bastard without any pedigree like you
covets the crown of Hyowon Group?

132
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,261
You piece of trash!

133
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,226
Look.

134
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,065
Should I tell the world about your hobby?

135
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,318
Then the company my stupid father built

136
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,945
will fall apart.

137
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,655
But I'll do it anyway.

138
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,950
I'll destroy it
if it means catching a bastard like you.

139
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,536
That's all I amount to anyway, right?

140
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,540
Yes, that's right.

141
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:51,293
That's why you lost the company
to a bastard who's not even related.

142
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,420
What?

143
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,797
Do you think
you can take my seat with that?

144
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,425
I don't care about that.

145
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,344
Soo-hyuk deserves the position.
You'd better give it up.

146
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,973
But Soo-hyuk doesn't want it!

147
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,810
You can't even control your own son.
Don't make me the bad guy.

148
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,854
Do you think
you can blackmail me with that?

149
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,232
Why? Will you go to the press with it?

150
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,362
Go ahead. Do whatever you want.

151
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,490
Before you know it,

152
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,703
reporters will be publishing stories about
how your ex ran away from an alcoholic.

153
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,248
Come to your senses
and think carefully about what you can do.

154
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,668
-You son of a bitch.
-Han Jin-ho.

155
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,129
Listen to me carefully.

156
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,799
You're just a loser.

157
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,385
You'll be a lunatic making up stories

158
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,471
because of an inferiority complex.

159
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,432
So you escaped
from an alcohol treatment center?

160
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,102
Who would believe a man like you?

161
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,315
Maybe you shouldn't have lived like that.

162
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,357
You bastard.

163
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,819
I won't let you get away with this. Never.

164
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,491
Do you remember what I said before?

165
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,619
What do you have to do
to get what you want?

166
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,747
I said you'd have to kill me.

167
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,959
There's nothing you can do.

168
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
So just keep your mouth shut.

169
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,675
My inauguration is in nine days.

170
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,722
But I didn't invite you since I feel bad.

171
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,849
Get out.

172
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,227
Take care.

173
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,203
My brother escaped
from an alcohol treatment center.

174
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,913
So he's a bit unstable.

175
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,291
He's fragile right now,
so be gentle with him.

176
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,377
Take care of yourself.

177
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,670
You bastard.

178
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,422
I'll…

179
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,383
kill you.

180
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,932
Let go of me. I'll leave on my own!

181
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,393
Damn it.

182
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,459
-Hello?
-It's me.

183
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,837
Did you know?

184
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,339
That Ji-yong isn't Father's real son?

185
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,466
Yes.

186
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,802
Then why didn't you tell me?

187
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,054
Well, you know now.

188
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,641
Do you think knowing this sooner
would have made any difference?

189
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,268
Of course!

190
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,565
If I knew he wasn't even my half-brother,

191
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,151
I would've tried my best

192
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,445
to make Father approve of me.

193
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,281
Whose side are you on?

194
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,285
You're not on his side, right?

195
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,745
No.

196
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,959
What should I do now?

197
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,170
Seo-hyun.

198
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,505
Help me.

199
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,799
Help me bring down Ji-yong.

200
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,636
You should…

201
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,096
take over the company instead.

202
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,933
It's humiliating for me either way.

203
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,519
But I'd rather have you lead the company.

204
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,689
I don't want to take the position
just to stop him from taking over.

205
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:45,194
However, I will
take responsibility for my actions.

206
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,989
I let Ji-yong take the position
instead of persuading Soo-hyuk.

207
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,575
I'm responsible for that.

208
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,010
Is something wrong?

209
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,055
Han Ji-yong…

210
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,351
Forget it.

211
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,270
-You're pregnant right now.
-Say what you were about to say.

212
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,232
It's fine.

213
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,799
Have someone tail Jin-ho.

214
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,635
Should I assign one of our own
or contact an agency?

215
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,098
-One of ours would be better.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,225
Oh, right.

217
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,520
I have to visit my father at the hospital.

218
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,147
Get the car ready.

219
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:20,330
I'm going to disclose this to the public.

220
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,125
I don't have any reason
to protect him anymore.

221
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,587
He's not my real brother.
He's like a complete stranger.

222
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,298
The same goes for you, too.

223
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,300
Do you know where this place is?

224
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,388
This dogfighting ring.

225
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,737
It's me.

226
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,032
Can you come somewhere with me?

227
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,242
I'll pick you up at your place.

228
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,126
Hurry up!

229
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,795
When will you finish?

230
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,297
The chairman is getting discharged today!

231
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:24,728
Damn it.

232
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,463
Move all this stuff to the other house.

233
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,758
If he likes Mi-ja's son that much,
he can go live with him.

234
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,220
Ji-yong and Hi-soo are
getting a divorce anyway,

235
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,306
so he can use Hi-soo's study.

236
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,934
-A divorce?
-Forget it.

237
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,187
Call all the maids and move it all.
Everything!

238
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,147
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,568
But ma'am,

240
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,279
Mr. Han needs medical treatment.

241
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,407
-If you stress him out--
-What about my stress?

242
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,286
What about the 50 years of stress
I've received while living with him?

243
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,497
Do you know how I feel right now?

244
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,458
I'm about to go insane right now.

245
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,671
Are you telling me
I should put up with him

246
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,217
being cooped up in the bunker
to be with Mi-ja even when she's dead?

247
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,304
Why is everyone taking his side?

248
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,139
What about me?

249
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,892
Who will understand my feelings?

250
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,523
I've led a miserable life.

251
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,779
I wanted to join my brother
when he passed away.

252
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:05,329
What's the point of living
when all I feel is misery after misery?

253
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:11,001
The son that I raised all my life
as my own betrayed me.

254
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,464
And Hi-soo stabbed me in the back today.

255
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,509
What's wrong?

256
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,428
All right.

257
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,849
Pack up all of the chairman's belongings!

258
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,850
What?

259
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,479
Why do you think I doted on No-deok?

260
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,066
Because I was so sick of people!

261
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,109
I thought birds would be different.

262
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,196
But that bird is no different!

263
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,864
It's a male, after all.

264
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:44,409
The day my husband woke up,
No-deok came back home.

265
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,453
That awful bird.

266
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,705
Even if I died tomorrow,

267
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,667
I would have no regrets.

268
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,169
I just want to die!

269
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,754
Chef Jung!

270
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,048
-Chef Jung!
-Yes, ma'am.

271
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,841
Make some Buddha's Temptation for me.

272
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,135
I need to regain my strength.

273
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,637
Add in a seal penis.

274
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,056
I'm going to have a double portion.

275
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,266
Yes, ma'am.

276
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,227
Double portion?

277
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,874
The chairman is home, ma'am.

278
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,201
Take him to your house.

279
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,579
Since…

280
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:15,625
you love your son, Ji-yong, so much,
you can go stay with him.

281
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,585
Why would I?

282
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,004
You'd better go as I say!

283
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,674
Before I destroy that bunker with a bomb!

284
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,468
How did you--

285
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,470
Leave!

286
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,139
Let's do as she says, Father.

287
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,767
He'll stay with me.

288
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,770
I think that will make me
feel more comfortable, too.

289
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,981
Ms. Joo.

290
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,568
-Yes?
-You should come with us too.

291
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,156
What do you think you're doing?

292
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,533
The house Father lives in
is the main house.

293
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,578
And it's only right
that Ms. Joo works there.

294
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,707
Who said you could take Ms. Joo
as you please?

295
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,377
Ms. Joo, let's go.

296
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,631
Mr. Kim, escort my father
with the buggy car.

297
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,591
Yes, sir.

298
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,064
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

299
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,774
Wait.

300
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,789
Be careful.

301
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,965
-Grandpa!
-Hey.

302
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,716
Good to see you.

303
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,593
His back still hurts, Ha-joon.

304
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,512
Have you been well?

305
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,013
-Yes.
-Good.

306
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,723
What about your mother?

307
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,101
Let's go inside.

308
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,272
We'll set up a new room on the first floor
to make it easier for you.

309
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,398
We'll start tomorrow.

310
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:05,569
No, it's all right. Going up and down
the stairs will be good exercise.

311
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:07,237
But you should still be careful.

312
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,282
I'm fine. All right.
Let's go upstairs together.

313
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,366
Let's go.

314
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:23,128
We should hire a caretaker for my father.

315
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,714
Yes, sir. I'll look into it right away.

316
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,466
I'm also looking for a tutor for Ha-joon.

317
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,927
I'll interview them myself.

318
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:34,723
-Yes, sir.
-Fire Soo-young tomorrow.

319
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,849
Pardon?

320
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,019
But Ms. Seo hired her herself.

321
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,897
She was Ms. Seo's manager from before.

322
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,649
I said to fire her.
What more is there to talk about?

323
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,946
-Nothing, sir.
-Fire her right away.

324
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:51,489
Yes, sir.

325
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,493
Tell Mr. Yoon to bring the car around.
I have to get back to work.

326
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:57,078
Yes, sir.

327
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,853
Mr. Han Ji-yong fired
Ms. Oh Soo-young yesterday.

328
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,692
Okay. You can go.

329
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,291
I would like to tell you
about Mr. Han Ji-yong's

330
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,754
unforgivable actions
toward Ms. Seo Hi-soo and me.

331
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,680
All the directors who are on your side
have received Ms. Lee's video.

332
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,807
What should I do?

333
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,977
Don't do anything. Just leave it.

334
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:09,526
DIRECTOR CHA GYEONG-TAEK

335
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:12,320
Yes, Mr. Cha.

336
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,325
You must be shocked
after watching the video.

337
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,120
I'm embarrassed to say this.

338
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,956
But she's insane.

339
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,250
No need to pay her any attention.

340
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,920
No-deok.

341
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,300
You know how I feel, right?

342
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,307
Of course, you don't.
You're a male, after all.

343
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,854
My life is…

344
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,857
so bleak.

345
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,485
I was miserable enough when I had to
raise someone else's son. And now this?

346
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,703
What's that?

347
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,089
That's an egg!

348
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,426
It's an egg!

349
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,181
Oh, my. Some bird laid an egg here.

350
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,016
Whose egg is that?

351
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,728
No-deok must've come back
to raise the baby in a rich family.

352
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,272
-But No-deok is a male bird.
-What?

353
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,608
Did his lover lay the egg and leave?

354
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,736
What are you talking about?

355
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,739
As if having to raise someone else's son
wasn't enough,

356
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,367
even birds are dropping their babies
at my house.

357
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,826
My gosh.

358
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,246
Hey, you go inside and get rid of it.
Get rid of it now!

359
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,082
Gosh, this is such a curse!

360
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,293
Does bad energy flow on this land or what?

361
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,670
Even so, every life must be cherished.

362
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,215
Get rid of it now. Do it now!

363
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,009
If we throw it out
when we don't know who the mother is,

364
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,677
it might cause a problem later.

365
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,096
A problem?

366
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,933
Are you telling me the mother bird
will come back and complain?

367
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,394
I mean, what if the bird comes back
like Ms. Kang?

368
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,521
The bird might ask you to give back…

369
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,689
What? What did you say?

370
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,192
How dare you say such a thing?

371
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,569
A reporter will come here tomorrow.

372
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,570
What?

373
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,489
Don't worry.
Your identity won't be disclosed.

374
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,492
Just tell the reporter
what Han Ji-yong did.

375
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,079
-I can't do that.
-Why not?

376
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:11,499
Because I'll have to go to prison again.

377
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:14,294
I'll make sure you don't have to go back.

378
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,841
Don't you want to destroy my brother
like he destroyed yours?

379
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,093
Just do as I say.

380
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,929
Let's destroy him together.

381
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:35,565
Mr. Han Jin-ho met with Kwak Su-chang
at the hospital just now.

382
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,424
Ji-yong.

383
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,619
This is the address I got from Jin-ho.

384
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:33,182
BUSINESS PLANS FOR PERFORMANCE START-UPS

385
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,396
CEO JUNG SEO-HYUN

386
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,031
Hello.

387
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,491
I'm Jung Un-yeong,
the chairman's secretary.

388
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,620
He hasn't been inaugurated yet.
You already call him chairman?

389
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,624
Why are you here?

390
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:02,128
The chairman instructed us to move
Hyowon E&M's office to the headquarters.

391
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:07,550
He made such an important decision
without talking to me first?

392
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,177
It's the chairman's decision.

393
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,681
Tell him I don't plan to move.

394
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,600
That I'll stay here.

395
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,394
To make things easier for you,

396
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,064
should I make a scene?

397
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,734
Han Ji-yong.

398
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:26,778
Know your place.

399
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:31,240
Tell him exactly that.

400
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,758
Were you eyeing Jin-ho's position?

401
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,636
You know very well
that you're unqualified.

402
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,513
You are a sexual minority.

403
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:57,684
In that sense, you and I have committed
sins of the same degree.

404
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,938
So we shouldn't try to
bring each other down, should we?

405
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,740
Mr. Choi.

406
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:16,411
We have to bring down Han Ji-yong
as soon as possible.

407
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,956
Schedule a luncheon with the presidents

408
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,751
of our main subsidiaries except for
Hyowon Hotel, Electronics, and Bakery.

409
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,004
Don't invite Han Ji-yong.

410
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,348
Is she moving her office now?

411
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,560
Well, Ms. Jung said a few things to you

412
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,062
that I'd rather not say

413
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,857
and refused to move.

414
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,234
What did she say?

415
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,738
She told me to tell you
exactly what she said, but…

416
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,698
It's all right. Just say it.

417
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,742
"Han Ji-yong.

418
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,745
Know your place."

419
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,498
She asked me to relay that message to you.

420
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:03,791
I'm sorry, sir.

421
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,338
Okay. You can go now.

422
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,142
Everyone's losing it.

423
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,894
They haven't learned their lesson.

424
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,355
I'm so tired.

425
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,151
If Ms. Joo stays at Rubato,

426
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,986
what's going to happen to us?

427
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,405
Then who's the most powerful person here?

428
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,365
I don't know who I should listen to.

429
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,658
Exactly.

430
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:40,953
They're all on bad terms,
so we're suffering in the middle.

431
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,997
We should listen to Ms. Jung.

432
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,457
No.

433
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,375
We should listen to Mr. Han Ji-yong now.

434
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:47,960
The director…

435
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:52,215
I mean, Mr. Han Jin-ho said he would
take care of everything that goes on here.

436
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,926
-Attention, everyone.
-What is it?

437
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,554
I'm back.

438
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,389
Have you been well?

439
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,518
-Gosh, it's so good to see you!
-Gosh.

440
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,353
What are you staring at?

441
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,160
What's with him?

442
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,266
Yes?

443
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,226
Everything is going as planned.

444
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,813
Be careful tonight and stay low.
Don't underestimate Ji-yong.

445
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,481
Okay.

446
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,449
Han Ji-yong.

447
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,120
It's over, you asshole.

448
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,584
TAEWON DAILY

449
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:20,136
RESTRICTED NUMBER
I WANT TO MAKE A TIP-OFF

450
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,351
Go to the States with Ha-joon.

451
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,356
Get him out of this house
as soon as possible.

452
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,943
I can't have Ha-joon
under the care of such a man…

453
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,655
even for a day.

454
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,157
What do you plan to do?

455
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,535
I will reveal the true face
of Han Ji-yong to the world

456
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,788
and make him face judgment.

457
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,541
Take care of Ha-joon for me.

458
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,002
I'll stay and do what I can here.

459
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,880
Leave.

460
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,840
I'll take care of the rest.

461
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,014
-Stop.
-Hurry.

462
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,933
Go over there. Why are you following me?

463
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,101
Over there.

464
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,019
-Where?
-There.

465
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:11,020
Here?

466
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,192
Soo-hyuk.

467
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,694
-Yes?
-What do you want to do in five years?

468
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,614
In five years?

469
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,576
I'm not sure. I haven't thought about it.

470
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:30,248
Your father told me that you won't be able
to make any money on your own.

471
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,627
The same goes for him.

472
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,172
Don't worry.
I'll go out and face the world.

473
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,591
You made me want to do that.

474
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,429
What about you?
What do you want to do in five years?

475
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,891
-You have a dream, don't you?
-Of course.

476
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,560
No one wants to work as a maid forever.

477
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:57,692
First of all, I'm going to pay off
my dad's debt and move to a new house.

478
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:01,320
In five years, I'm going to study more
about social welfare.

479
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:02,989
And…

480
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,033
my dream is to set up a shelter for kids.

481
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,076
That's cool.

482
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,248
Hold on.

483
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,208
What? Hey.

484
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,779
Are you sure
about your feelings for Yu-yeon?

485
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,489
Yes, I'm sure.

486
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,075
I feel at ease when I'm with her.

487
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,286
Then…

488
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,749
introduce her to the family
and make it official that you're dating.

489
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,543
I'll help you.

490
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,211
Really?

491
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,713
Yes.

492
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,843
It's a miracle for two people
to meet and fall in love.

493
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,971
Falling in love should be pure.

494
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,182
On your last day,

495
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,143
that's the memory you'll hold onto.

496
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,395
Although…

497
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,858
I failed to do so…

498
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,530
you should live the life you want.

499
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,164
Soo-hyuk.

500
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,043
Han Ji-yong hasn't…

501
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,296
officially been appointed chairman yet.

502
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,425
Help me oust him.

503
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,180
Leave with Ms. Kang first.

504
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,350
I'll join you in ten days.

505
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,520
What about Dad?

506
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,356
When will he come?

507
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,693
You know he's busy.

508
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,947
I think I'm going to miss him.

509
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:12,535
I heard Dad became the most powerful
man at Grandpa's company.

510
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,578
Isn't he really cool?

511
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,582
I look up to him the most in the world.

512
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,670
You look up to him?

513
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:25,923
Why?

514
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,801
-Because he's your dad?
-No.

515
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:32,096
He reads five newspapers every day

516
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,764
and works hard at everything.

517
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,308
And everyone likes him.

518
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:41,188
That's why Soo-hyuk listens to him
more than he listens to Uncle.

519
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,483
Dad is so cool.

520
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,404
I'm so proud to have him as my dad.

521
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,324
I want to be just like him when I grow up.

522
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:29,528
Mr. Park, drive me to the airport.

523
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,613
Yes, ma'am.

524
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,818
Seo-hyun.

525
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,884
I never…

526
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,762
had a chance…

527
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:39,932
to tell you this.

528
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,436
Thank you…

529
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,943
for being in my life.

530
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,240
Be happy.

531
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:58,867
You have to be happy…

532
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,370
for me.

533
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:10,087
Why didn't you say anything about us
in your interview?

534
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,383
Because I don't care about other people.

535
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,761
It doesn't matter as long as…

536
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,763
you and I…

537
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,851
remember how much we loved each other.

538
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,272
What I wanted…

539
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,191
wasn't approval from the world.

540
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,321
I just wanted you…

541
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,449
to muster up your courage.

542
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,162
So I'm happy now.

543
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,040
Wherever I am,

544
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,709
I'll remember…

545
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,794
your face today.

546
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,089
You couldn't help…

547
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,217
but run over to me.

548
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,347
That look on your face.

549
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,391
How you look today.

550
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,479
That's all I need.

551
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,777
No.

552
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,530
Give me…

553
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,663
just a bit more time.

554
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,342
Where's my father?

555
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,803
He's in the study.

556
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:26,557
Mr. Han.

557
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,189
Don't you have…

558
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,526
anything to tell me?

559
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,319
Like what?

560
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,865
I did everything you told me to do.

561
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:46,785
But Ms. Jung found out about it.

562
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,455
Of course. I'm the one who told her.

563
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:57,254
That's no way to treat a human being.

564
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,507
If you toss me out like a piece of gum
that you're done chewing,

565
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,634
what am I supposed to do? Tell me!

566
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:08,432
That gum will want to cling to
the bottom of your shoe…

567
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,895
and pester the heck out of you.

568
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,570
Ms. Joo.

569
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,489
You just called me. What is it?

570
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:24,823
Right.

571
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:29,161
Do I have to stay here, Mr. Han?

572
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,079
I mean… Sir?

573
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,042
Stay here until I say otherwise.

574
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,168
Yes, sir.

575
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,932
Did you have dinner?

576
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,143
Yes.

577
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,939
It's been a while
since I thoroughly enjoyed a meal.

578
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,316
Chef Hwang is pretty good.

579
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,445
The room on the first floor
is ready for you.

580
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:10,077
Please try to understand your mother.

581
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,204
She…

582
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:15,999
eventually found the place…

583
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,796
where I used to secretly
meet your real mother.

584
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,217
And I'm sure she was livid
beyond my imagination.

585
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:29,304
Since I know how angry she must be,

586
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,933
I'm not upset
that your mother kicked me out.

587
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,144
I did put her through a lot.

588
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,108
The woman who gave birth to Ha-joon.

589
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,152
And Hi-soo who raised him.

590
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,863
Be grateful to them.

591
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,158
Don't hurt anyone.

592
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,746
Because you are at fault.

593
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,751
Good night.

594
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,421
HI-SOO

595
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,768
HI-SOO

596
00:48:58,977 --> 00:48:59,978
Hello?

597
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,107
-What are these photos?
-Han Ji-yong's double life.

598
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,920
Were you waiting for me?

599
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,505
I need to tell you something.

600
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,424
It's about Ji-yong.

601
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:31,927
I know about it.

602
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,348
-You do?
-I saw what you found out.

603
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,519
I guess I can benefit
from your rage sometimes.

604
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,605
Good job.

605
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,347
Ms. Joo.

606
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:18,724
Yes, sir.

607
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:23,145
You know where the secret place
at Cadenza is, right?

608
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,483
Hello, Ms. Jung.

609
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,994
I need to talk to Father.

610
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:54,176
Should I take you there right now?

611
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,262
Yes.

612
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,494
Ji-yong.

613
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,330
I'm…

614
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,085
I'm sorry.

615
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,256
It's too late.

616
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,216
Why…

617
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,428
Why did you do that to me?

618
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:30,665
Even when the whole world
turns its back on you,

619
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,878
if you have just one person
who believes in you,

620
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:38,924
you can go on living.

621
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,093
But…

622
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:46,681
he never had that one person.

623
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,568
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

624
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,779
I received a tip-off
regarding Mr. Han Ji-yong.

625
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,657
No.

626
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,909
Did you know about the dogfighting ring?

627
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:10,288
It's shocking to find out
what kind of person he is.

628
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,166
Please stop it.

629
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,877
Please.

630
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,756
I must protect my son.

631
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:20,840
You really…

632
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,010
only think about your son.

633
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,679
I'll do my best.

634
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,279
You need to make up your mind
and decide as soon as possible.

635
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:51,621
Get some rest, Father.

636
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,274
You should get some sleep.

637
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,776
I have to drive Mr. Han Ji-yong
back to Rubato.

638
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,653
No. Don't!

639
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:25,864
Just leave him there.

640
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,742
What do you mean? Leave him where?

641
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,037
He's in the bunker right now.

642
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,496
The chairman's bunker.

643
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,915
And the door is closed.

644
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,670
What? No way.

645
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,506
But it can't be opened from the inside.

646
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,591
That's not my problem.

647
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:49,012
When people cross me, I get upset too.

648
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,389
Do you know
what it's like to be humiliated?

649
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:54,851
It's impossible not to feel humiliated
when you work here.

650
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,353
Put yourself in my shoes.

651
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,522
And do as I say.

652
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,277
-Answer me!
-Okay.

653
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,697
Drive.

654
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,164
I told Father everything.

655
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:22,420
I have to protect Hyowon Group,
so I can't reveal Ji-yong to the public.

656
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:24,214
And I have to protect Ha-joon.

657
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,801
That's all I can think about now.

658
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,845
I'm sending him abroad.

659
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,389
Ms. Lee will take him.

660
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,642
Okay.

661
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,853
I think that's wise.

662
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,732
I'm about to lose it.

663
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:46,361
When I think about Ha-joon, I'm terrified.

664
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,238
I can't do anything.

665
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,241
I have to end this marriage

666
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,785
and escape from this family
as soon as possible.

667
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,747
I have to separate Ha-joon
from such a monster.

668
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:05,171
But I can't bring myself to destroy
the perfect image he has of his father.

669
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:08,508
If he finds out
what his father is really like,

670
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,553
he'll be traumatized
for the rest of his life.

671
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,890
I change my mind every second
because of this terrible dilemma.

672
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,184
I think I'm going insane.

673
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,228
Don't beat yourself up.

674
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:24,149
You're in a dilemma no one should be in.

675
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:28,111
No one can make a better decision
than you.

676
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:30,280
I can't advise you on what to do either.

677
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,615
It's only natural…

678
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,785
that you're suffering.

679
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,791
I've been in a similar place before.
Do you know whom I went to for help?

680
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:44,294
Mother Emma.

681
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:50,717
But…

682
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:57,557
there is one person in this family
who has never gotten counseling from her.

683
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,019
Han Ji-yong.

684
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,313
That's understandable.

685
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,024
-He's given up to be human--
-No.

686
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:09,277
Mother Emma knew Han Ji-yong
before she knew anyone else here.

687
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,739
She has known him…

688
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,450
for a very long time.

689
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:18,828
How?

690
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,624
She and Han Ji-yong's birth mother
were very close.

691
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:27,754
They were close for decades.

692
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,174
But…

693
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,552
why have they…

694
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,600
pretended not to know each other?

695
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,364
Hey, open up.

696
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,660
Is anyone out there?

697
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:00,578
Ms. Joo!

698
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,061
That bastard.

699
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:26,771
Damn it.

700
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,608
Poor thing.

701
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,624
I heard you fired Soo-young…

702
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,502
in a rude and disrespectful way.

703
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,506
I'm going to get rid of people
who aren't on my side one by one.

704
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,051
I'll be in a drama soon.
Don't get in my way.

705
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,761
Nothing will go your way.

706
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,767
Should I give you
a taste of your own medicine?

707
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,271
I know you like making people fight.

708
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:12,859
How far does your inhumanity extend?

709
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:21,701
I'm not going to protect you now because
you're not carrying my child anymore.

710
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:25,413
Why don't you get in the ring
instead of watching like a coward?

711
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,415
Speaking of which,

712
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,126
we can't…

713
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,670
let Ha-joon watch this fight.

714
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:36,049
And to prevent that,
I'm sending him abroad to study.

715
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,634
What?

716
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,762
It's only a matter of time
before the world finds out about you.

717
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:44,432
Ha-joon can never find out
what kind of person you are.

718
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,975
He's my son.

719
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,269
You can't do as you want.

720
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:52,315
A father paid men to fight
and enjoyed watching them.

721
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:55,318
How do you think his child would feel
when they find out?

722
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,612
Why must that child be Ha-joon? Why?

723
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,284
You'd better stop here.

724
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,371
If you don't, I'll kill you.

725
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:24,991
You cannot entrust him with Hyowon Group.

726
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,494
Your emotions cannot sway your decision.

727
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,246
He is…

728
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,665
a destroyer.

729
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:49,807
Kill him.

730
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:35,770
Hello?

731
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,313
Hello.

732
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:40,399
This is Inspector Hwang Hyeong-su
from Gwangun Police Station.

733
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,692
Hello.

734
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:42,902
Last night,

735
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,280
Kwak Su-chang was found dead.

736
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,951
But the last person
he talked to on the phone

737
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:51,744
was you, Mr. Han.

738
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,039
I need you to come down to the station.

739
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,016
THE REASON HAN JIN-HO GOT PASSED OVER

740
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,476
"TURNS OUT TO BE AN ALCOHOLIC"

741
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:29,782
Did you want to see me?

742
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,789
I want you…

743
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,542
to kill Ji-yong.

744
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,402
Ha-joon.

745
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,200
Don't go on the internet
with your phone today.

746
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,036
Why not?

747
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,792
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

748
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:23,878
Yes.

749
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:27,757
He's dead?

750
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,886
Mom, the light.

751
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:35,932
My gosh.

752
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:46,025
Han Ha-joon.

753
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:49,070
You're the only person
who can protect yourself.

754
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,489
So you have to be strong. Okay?

755
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,742
Whatever happens,
I'll be right behind you.

756
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,244
So don't be afraid of anything.

757
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:25,398
Wait.

758
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:32,154
You should meet the tutor who will
take Ha-joon abroad before you leave.

759
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:00,474
Hello.

760
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:02,435
I'm Ha-joon's tutor,

761
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:04,812
Lee Hye-jin.

762
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,002
Hello, Ms. Joo.

763
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,171
It's been a while.

764
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:31,839
This way.

765
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:51,275
Who do you think should take the position?

766
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:56,906
I'll do it.

767
01:07:58,365 --> 01:07:59,658
I will protect Hyowon Group…

768
01:08:00,284 --> 01:08:02,203
at all costs.

769
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:11,712
10 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

770
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:16,926
10 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

771
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,545
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM JUNG-HWA

772
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:15,276
Do you think you can go on living
like nothing happened?

773
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,694
Just stay quiet.

774
01:09:16,777 --> 01:09:20,447
You should know to be afraid
if you know what kind of person I am.

775
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:22,616
What are you planning behind my back?

776
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,452
Just stay still and don't do anything.

777
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,705
There were a total of three people
at the scene.

778
01:09:27,788 --> 01:09:32,418
Ms. Seo Hi-soo, the late Mr. Han Ji-yong,
and one more person. Who could it be?

779
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,587
I don't remember anything.

780
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:39,258
All the memories I had
after meeting Han Ji-yong are gone.

781
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:43,262
