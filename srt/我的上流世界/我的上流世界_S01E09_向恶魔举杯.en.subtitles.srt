1
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,636
Death…

2
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,765
is inevitable.

3
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,990
Ji-yong.

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,451
You shouldn't have been born.

5
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,621
You are also my son.

6
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,082
Sir.

7
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,545
I'm carrying someone else's baby.

8
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,839
Let's raise the baby as mine.

9
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,426
Let's keep it between you and me.

10
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,054
I won't let anyone else know about it.

11
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,064
-Come out. We'll talk outside.
-Let go of me!

12
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,863
I thought Hi-soo should know, too.

13
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,996
Hi-soo, I'm sorry. Don't stay here.

14
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,207
You can't get stressed. I'll handle it.

15
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,502
I'm fine. I should know what's going on.

16
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,213
Why are you here?

17
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,758
To get Ha-joon back. He's my son.

18
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,344
Have you gone mad? He's not your son!

19
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,637
He's my son!

20
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,182
You're an awful dad.
And she's not his real mom.

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,976
Screw you.

22
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,938
-Let go.
-Get out.

23
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,648
-Don't touch me.
-Get out!

24
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,858
Don't touch me!

25
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,076
Don't mess with me.

26
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,372
I'll kill anyone who tries to take
what's mine.

27
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,238
I should've killed you back then.

28
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,152
Shouldn't we have a family meeting?

29
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,822
We need to protect Ha-joon.

30
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,374
Ms. Jung, the chairman's will
is going to be disclosed.

31
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,016
WILL

32
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,893
To my wife, Yang Soon-hye.

33
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,021
I was never a good husband.

34
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,649
For you to enjoy your later years,

35
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:38,194
I give you the mansion in Seongbuk-dong
and the land in my hometown.

36
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,906
"Having shares in the company

37
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,618
will make your life miserable, not happy."

38
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,664
That damn geezer!

39
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,924
To my eldest son, Han Jin-ho.

40
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,803
All my life, I've taught you
how to run a company

41
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,638
by entrusting you with the hotel.

42
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,350
But I've never thought to help you
discover your aptitude. I'm sorry.

43
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:14,188
To help you find it, I encourage you
to go to graduate school.

44
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:18,776
I'll pay for all your school expenses
until the day you graduate.

45
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,780
To my eldest daughter-in-law,
Jung Seo-hyun.

46
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,200
As the eldest daughter-in-law,

47
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,120
you were responsible
and maintained your dignity.

48
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,874
I give you
all my Hyowon Electronics shares

49
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,793
and appoint you as the CEO of Hyowon E&M.

50
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,216
To my one and only daughter, Han Jin-hee.

51
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,469
I know you had to yield

52
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,638
to your older brother
and manage Hyowon Confectionery.

53
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,807
-It's supposed to…
-However,

54
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,644
I think highly of your sense
of responsibility for your job.

55
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:58,524
Therefore, I give you
all my shares of Hyowon Confectionery.

56
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,526
But there's one condition.

57
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,238
You must receive counseling regularly.

58
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,659
To my second daughter-in-law, Seo Hi-soo.

59
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:12,121
You were a kind daughter-in-law
who gave me plenty to laugh about.

60
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:17,710
I hope you'll stay by Ha-joon's side
so he can grow into a fine young man.

61
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,838
For you and your son,

62
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,592
I give you 30,000 shares
of Hyowon Trading Corporation.

63
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,020
CALLING
HA-JOON'S TUTOR

64
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,111
To my youngest son, Han Ji-yong.

65
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,282
Forgive me for not giving you enough love.

66
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,954
I blame myself
for the lack of love and virtue

67
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:58,042
and hope you'll become the light
and the salt of the world unlike me.

68
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:03,256
So I encourage you
to do some volunteer work

69
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,177
to learn that sometimes you can only
be loved by giving love.

70
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,849
Therefore, I appoint you as the director
of Hyowon Academy

71
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,687
hoping that you will grow
alongside your students.

72
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,901
To my eldest grandson, Han Soo-hyuk.

73
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:29,115
You will become the heir to Hyowon Group
once you turn 30.

74
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,076
Among the 308,000 shares that I have,

75
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,537
I give 150,000 of them to you.

76
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,039
As for the rest of my shares,

77
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,584
I donate them all to charity

78
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,628
and educational trust funds.

79
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,441
Hello?

80
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,235
Don't worry.

81
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,155
I'm not going to lose.

82
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,670
Hi-soo, I'm here to brief you
on your schedule.

83
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,130
Okay. Tell me.

84
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:27,924
Are you okay?

85
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:29,759
What do you mean?

86
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,844
Your husband…

87
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,265
About him not being chosen
as the heir to Hyowon?

88
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,518
Soo-young.

89
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,103
One must always be kind.

90
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,024
That is the truth of life.

91
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,570
Those who are evil…

92
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,073
shouldn't gain power.

93
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,368
So what's my schedule?

94
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,455
All right. Here are your phones.

95
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,748
Here.

96
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,586
When are you coming home, Yu-yeon?

97
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,629
No way.

98
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:10,383
The young master has been chosen
as the heir to Hyowon.

99
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,425
What?

100
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,761
Let me see.

101
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:16,639
-Goodness.
-Oh, young master.

102
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,561
-My goodness.
-That's unbelievable.

103
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,738
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

104
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,784
Do you think she came here
with an ulterior motive?

105
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,870
You're pretty much Cinderella.

106
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,708
Why are you still bringing up
such an old fairytale?

107
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,312
Soo-hyuk became the heir. Have you heard?

108
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,063
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,399
Let me give you a piece of advice,

110
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,612
as someone who's older than you,
not as his mother.

111
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,241
People will be calling you Cinderella
from now on whether you like it or not.

112
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,455
And they'll want
your glass slippers to shatter.

113
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,667
Ask yourself if you're courageous enough
to fight against

114
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,127
the prejudice of this world.

115
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,505
Put yourself before anything else.

116
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,385
I hope you make the right decision
for yourself.

117
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,099
Yes, ma'am.

118
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,177
Damn it. I really hoped I'd be wrong.

119
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,429
That bitch's birthdate is the passcode?

120
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:55,506
Father.

121
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,094
This is to celebrate your wise decision
to not choose Ji-yong

122
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:01,637
as the heir.

123
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:08,602
And this is for the fury I have

124
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:11,439
for being deceived by you.

125
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,449
And this one is for Soo-hyuk.

126
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,076
This is for my son.

127
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,704
I'll down all of it.

128
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:32,376
To sum up,
I'm both thankful and irritated.

129
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,296
That's how I feel.

130
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,618
Begin!

131
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,575
Kill him.

132
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,913
Kill him!

133
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,938
Kill him!

134
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,540
Ji-yong.

135
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,961
You shouldn't have been born.

136
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,466
If you were a legitimate Han,

137
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,596
our lives would've turned out differently.

138
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,224
You shouldn't have been

139
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,603
born to begin with.

140
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,039
Have you looked into it?

141
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,458
Mr. Han Ji-yong is trying
to become president

142
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,460
through approval by the board.

143
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,378
They've drawn their sword.

144
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,673
We should draw ours too.

145
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,674
What should we do?

146
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,471
Disclose my father-in-law's will
during their meeting.

147
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,642
Let's find out who'll be
the last one standing.

148
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,367
EPISODE 9
A TOAST TO THE DEVIL

149
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,214
Hello?

150
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,300
Hello, my name is Han Jin-hee.

151
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,635
I texted you earlier.

152
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,720
Mr. Han Jin-ho…

153
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,348
-My brother introduced you to me.
-I see.

154
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:19,645
You see, I've been put in a situation
where I'm obligated to receive counseling.

155
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,023
-Because of my father's will.
-I see.

156
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,234
I'd like to receive counseling from you.

157
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,237
From what I heard,
you ask people to donate

158
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,073
to the foundation for your counseling.

159
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,575
I like that.

160
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,954
When are you available?
The sooner, the better.

161
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,541
I'm afraid I'm fully booked.
Should I introduce you to someone else?

162
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,210
Did you just turn me down?

163
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,300
Just make it work, will you?

164
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:51,760
Make time for me.

165
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,845
Look here.

166
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,389
I'm a nun.

167
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,058
I'm not a counselor for your family.

168
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,602
And this is no way to treat someone.

169
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,732
You have no empathy indeed.

170
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,359
That's right.
You're a good judge of character.

171
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,155
That's my problem,
so I'm asking you to counsel me.

172
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,781
I told you, I have no time!

173
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:21,415
Gosh, I like her. She's so cool.

174
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,141
The blue diamond…

175
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,977
Where…

176
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,199
What?

177
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,872
What?

178
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,046
Because I can't

179
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,924
Forget her love

180
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,137
Must my heart

181
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,225
Cry again

182
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,729
Without a sound

183
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,815
Tonight

184
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,527
My love

185
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,823
My heartbreaking love

186
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,451
How have you

187
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:43,664
Come into my dreams

188
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,501
If this is the last time

189
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,547
I see you then I'd rather

190
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,757
Damn it.

191
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,512
And never open them again

192
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,641
I have loved

193
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,769
Someone I shouldn't have loved

194
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,607
Because loving her

195
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,819
Is an act of sin

196
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,406
911 EMERGENCY

197
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,576
I had them turn the siren off.

198
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,579
And he's been transferred
to the ward the chairman is in.

199
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,874
I've made sure
the maids keep their mouths shut.

200
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,295
There's no need for that.

201
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,215
Plugging a hole too tightly
may cause a leak elsewhere.

202
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,886
They should be allowed to gossip
about something.

203
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,681
After all, there will be a lot of scandals
regarding this family.

204
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,563
We must make wise decisions.

205
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,732
Yes, ma'am.

206
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,308
Hello?

207
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,477
He's in a coma.

208
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,731
They are brothers.

209
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,320
You should take care of that on your own!

210
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,572
How could I possibly do that?

211
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,994
How much?

212
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,581
Ask him how much he wants.

213
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,168
And don't you ever call me first.
I'll call you.

214
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,804
Damn it!

215
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,711
Mom.

216
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,213
Where are you going?

217
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,194
You stupid geezer!

218
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,071
How dare you smile?

219
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,617
Gosh!

220
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,971
Are you in-laws taking a tour together?

221
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,348
How nice.

222
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,558
I'm going to give her a painting
as a gift.

223
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,811
But not from my gallery.
I want to buy her one.

224
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,604
Then I should recommend the best.

225
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,022
This way.

226
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,025
What do you think?

227
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:26,321
They're Suzy Choi's. A Korean artist
who's popular in Western Europe right now.

228
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,991
This is the last in a series.

229
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,869
It's called Revolution Five.

230
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,622
I recommend this one.

231
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,915
Take your time.

232
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,925
-Aren't they spectacular?
-They are.

233
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,054
Take off the Corset.

234
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,266
Love Freely.

235
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,060
Achieve What You Want.

236
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,022
Shout to the World.

237
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,613
Break it Until You Win.

238
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,824
WINNER OF 2018 MARTIN JONES AWARD

239
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,786
You must know her well.

240
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,082
I'll buy you this one.

241
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,459
Okay.

242
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,588
I also want to break something.

243
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:27,465
What do you want to break?

244
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,467
What about you?

245
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,053
Prejudice.

246
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,248
Ji-yong was the one who faked your death,

247
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,625
not my family.

248
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,924
My mother-in-law is not meticulous
enough to pull off such a thing.

249
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,343
It was his doing?

250
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,386
Yes, it was him.

251
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,307
So take your revenge only on him,

252
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,060
not the entire family.

253
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,322
ANTICIPATING YOUR BABY

254
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,958
Are you okay?

255
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,127
What do you mean?

256
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,714
Your heart, your feelings. Are they okay?

257
00:25:56,346 --> 00:26:00,392
I wonder why your father didn't choose you
as the heir.

258
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,852
Are there…

259
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,107
any more secrets you're keeping from me?

260
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,490
"They say one's way of thinking
changes as they age.

261
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,870
Young people don't understand the elderly
since they have no experience.

262
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,958
And the elderly forget what it was like
when they were young,

263
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,128
and fail to understand young people.

264
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,005
But when death knocks on your door,

265
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:34,467
you get to see life as a whole."

266
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,555
These were lines from my last project

267
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,348
before we got married.

268
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,851
Want me to continue?

269
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,980
"This is why old people's wills are often

270
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,775
different from
what they've normally thought."

271
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:55,238
I'll stop quoting the lines…

272
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,074
and share my thoughts now.

273
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,747
An average person might think

274
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:07,208
that Soo-hyuk is too young

275
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,793
to become the heir.

276
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,339
But when writing the will,

277
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,133
your father looked at Soo-hyuk's life
as a whole,

278
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,052
so his age didn't matter.

279
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,973
We live in the present,
but your father doesn't.

280
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,770
In other words,

281
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,274
maybe your father knew your true colors

282
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,277
and saw your future.

283
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,200
He probably knew that
you were uninterested in being the heir.

284
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,539
Which side of you is true,
and which is fake?

285
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,459
What do you mean?

286
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,753
They say if you live a lie long enough,

287
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,756
it becomes the truth.

288
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,592
What are your true feelings?

289
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,678
Why did you forgive me?

290
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,308
Do you think I forgave you?

291
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,019
You're wrong.

292
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,271
How could I forgive you?

293
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,485
Did you really expect me to?

294
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,158
She wants to take Ha-joon.

295
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,829
I won't allow it. I have to protect him.

296
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,540
Let's just think about that.

297
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,466
Okay.

298
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,219
Thank you.

299
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,766
Are you wearing that perfume?

300
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,686
I know you like the smell.

301
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,692
-Hi-soo--
-Don't worry.

302
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,777
I'm only going to think about good things

303
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,279
for your child.

304
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,699
So help me do that.

305
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:08,288
I don't know what I'd do without you.

306
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,165
I know.

307
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:09,098
Congratulations on your son
becoming the heir.

308
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,726
It's too early. He's still young.

309
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,855
It must be very encouraging to know
that you'll be taking over

310
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,440
Hyowon E&M.

311
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,818
I'm sure he thought
stabilization takes priority.

312
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:22,153
After all,
I've been doing the same line of work.

313
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,198
But didn't everyone predict
that Mr. Han Ji-yong would

314
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,574
become the next chairman?

315
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,996
Aren't I right?

316
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,582
Yeongwon Group's Chairman Rho
and his family must be elated.

317
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,752
His future son-in-law
will eventually take over Hyowon.

318
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,629
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

319
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,592
How much did you get?

320
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,970
Not much. It's only the beginning.

321
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,557
-Hi, guys.
-Why are you late, Jasmin?

322
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,061
Why are you so busy?

323
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,938
Are you seeing someone?

324
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,148
It must be true.

325
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,693
Are you getting back at your husband?

326
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,902
Getting back at him?

327
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,781
Your husband could be in love as well.

328
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,616
Why do you think you're different?

329
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,742
Because I can.

330
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,913
Order something. It's Mi-joo's treat.

331
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,707
Excuse me.

332
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,877
I've received some shares
from my husband's company.

333
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,921
What does he do?

334
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,008
Are you sure he's not a fraud?

335
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,718
You should be careful.

336
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,720
We agreed not to get too personal,

337
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,764
-so I don't know a lot about him.
-Jasmin, be honest.

338
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,392
It's been a while, right?

339
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:38,271
You only joined our Bible study
to use it as an alibi, didn't you?

340
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,231
Aren't I right?

341
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,109
I'm not crafty like that.

342
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:47,280
Then you shouldn't criticize your husband.

343
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,532
You're no different than him.

344
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,909
That's not true.

345
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,745
I'm only cheating on him
because he did it first.

346
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,247
I'm different from you guys.

347
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,499
My hormones are exploding.

348
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,841
Hello?

349
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:19,896
Hello?

350
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,816
Suzy Choi has signed
with Hawon Gallery, ma'am.

351
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,903
Okay.

352
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,782
That's great.
You can stop keeping me posted on her now.

353
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,579
Ma'am…

354
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,333
Chairman Yang Chi-gon has
just succumbed to his chronic ailments.

355
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:42,961
Uncle has?

356
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,505
Life is so futile.

357
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,051
He was bound to bite the dust
just like others.

358
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,012
He should've treated me better.

359
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,140
All he has left is money.

360
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,059
He lived in vain.

361
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,561
One shouldn't live like that.

362
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,189
No. Never.

363
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,030
Are you sure I don't need to go?

364
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,866
You shouldn't go to a funeral
when you're pregnant.

365
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,368
Just rest at home.

366
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,537
You shouldn't be stressed or shocked.

367
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,085
Ha-joon, this is your grandma's
older brother's funeral.

368
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,670
People will be mourning.

369
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:29,257
Don't use your phone or fool around
while you're there, okay?

370
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,341
Okay.

371
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:36,055
Mom, can you order in some chicken for me
later tonight?

372
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,978
Sure, but only if you come home
after properly paying

373
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,105
-your respects there.
-Okay.

374
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,399
See you later.

375
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,525
Ha-joon.

376
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,224
Are you happy now?

377
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,646
You may not believe me,
but I am heartbroken.

378
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,607
You weren't even there when he passed.

379
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,442
You should at least shed a tear.

380
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,861
People will say
I'm weeping crocodile tears.

381
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:36,282
He left a larger inheritance to you
than to me, his wife.

382
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,619
And I'm the one who's crying.

383
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,499
Do you despise me?

384
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,252
Don't hold it back, and just slap me.

385
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,467
Will you let me?

386
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,010
Yes.

387
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,068
It's over now.

388
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,530
Yes, doctor.

389
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,077
His heart rate and blood pressure
are stabilizing.

390
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,538
He regained consciousness
for about 12 seconds.

391
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,081
That's very encouraging.

392
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,917
We'll keep a close eye on him tonight.

393
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,177
Mom.

394
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,182
Doesn't he look extremely disgruntled?

395
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,269
What an ugly toad.

396
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,104
But then again,

397
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,523
he has no right to be disgruntled.

398
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,692
None at all.

399
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,571
A chairman of a company
shouldn't have written

400
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,656
such an emotional will.

401
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,783
What a mad geezer.

402
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,163
Dare to wake up,
and I'll put you to sleep once again.

403
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,252
Just die!

404
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,638
-Is Soo-hyuk in his room?
-Yes, ma'am.

405
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,744
How will you fix it?

406
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,954
I'm talking about
the marriage being called off.

407
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,497
I called her and apologized.

408
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:53,085
You do know that your situation
has changed immensely, right?

409
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,715
Her family has already heard
about your grandfather's will.

410
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,134
It's easier for them to forgive you now.

411
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,845
I have no desire to follow his wishes.

412
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,182
You don't want Hyowon's crown?

413
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,643
-No.
-Were you always uninterested

414
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,520
or did something make you
change your mind?

415
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,315
I was chosen,
but that doesn't mean I want it.

416
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,358
Does that position

417
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,361
seem like a joke
because it was spoon-fed to you?

418
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,654
A joke?

419
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,531
I refuse because it's too burdensome.

420
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:25,117
I know very well what I must give up
if I take it.

421
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,828
Do you want that maid, Yu-yeon?

422
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,790
What do you think I would've done
if I were your real mom?

423
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,918
I would've sent her away.
Somewhere you'd never find her again.

424
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,544
Please…

425
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,382
don't anger me any more, Soo-hyuk.

426
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:41,926
Just once…

427
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,763
Can't you try to understand me just once?

428
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,308
Can't you just…

429
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,938
wish for my happiness?

430
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,597
Isn't that a script?

431
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:30,975
It is.

432
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,188
The president of my first agency
is producing a movie.

433
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,735
I thought he was a loser.

434
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,326
What's your definition of a loser?

435
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,536
Everyone experiences failure in life.

436
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,163
Are we all losers then?

437
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,419
You promised me you wouldn't act anymore.

438
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,673
Then did you keep
all the promises you made?

439
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,758
You didn't.

440
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,385
You're carrying my baby.

441
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,431
-So?
-Don't make any decisions by yourself.

442
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,726
You're going to shoot a film
when you're pregnant?

443
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:15,102
Are you insane?

444
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,315
Watch what you say.

445
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,526
Like you said, it's not good for the baby.

446
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,780
Fine.

447
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,576
I won't do it if you don't want me to.

448
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,076
Hi-soo.

449
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,373
Hi-soo.

450
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,711
Hi-soo.

451
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,955
LAW FIRM
KIM NAM-TAE

452
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,328
I want to file a lawsuit.

453
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,913
What's it about?

454
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,624
My child was taken from me
when he was 18 months old.

455
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,419
He's eight now.

456
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,296
Is he living with his father now?

457
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,673
Yes, and his stepmother.

458
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,883
Have you talked with them about it?

459
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,929
The father is the second son
of Hyowon Group.

460
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,599
Please help me out here.

461
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,560
I want to end my marriage with Jin-hee.

462
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,981
If I stay married, I might really die.

463
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:11,982
Then die.

464
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,860
I'd rather be a widow than a divorcée.

465
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,695
Besides…

466
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:21,116
you're the one who has been
an unfaithful husband. I never cheated!

467
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,869
But you've been physically and verbally
abusing me.

468
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,829
That's because you provoked me!

469
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,082
So let's just split up.

470
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,959
Shut up. Just put up with it.

471
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,504
No one's getting a divorce.

472
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,838
I've done my best.

473
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,632
Try living with her.

474
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,259
I did for over 30 years.

475
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,428
She was nothing but adorable.

476
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,434
If something about her displeases you,

477
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:51,605
you should strive to look
at her good sides.

478
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,691
You guys are so pathetic.

479
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,609
When will you grow up?

480
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,907
No woman can tolerate a cheating husband.

481
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,577
She should pull out all his ribs
and beat him with them.

482
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,889
PATERNITY AND DNA TEST RESULT

483
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,934
SPECIMEN A, FEMALE, MOTHER
SPECIMEN B, MALE, SON

484
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,565
LEE HYE-JIN, MOTHER
HAN HA-JOON, SON

485
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,947
But what exactly are you after?

486
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:43,490
It's not money, right?

487
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,910
-No, it's not.
-Right.

488
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,789
If that was the case, you and Hyowon
would've already settled it.

489
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,460
If they're not allowing you
to see your son,

490
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,921
you can apply for child visitation rights.

491
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,301
Then you'll be able to see him
two to three times a month.

492
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,682
I want to get full custody of him
and raise him myself.

493
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,392
I'll make sure of it.

494
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,896
You want to take him back?

495
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:19,693
In that case, you need to request
a transfer of custody.

496
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,654
But you didn't raise him all this time.

497
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:26,116
Sure, they took your son,
but that was six years ago.

498
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,244
Where have you been all this time?

499
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,079
Why do you want him back now?

500
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,875
This won't work.

501
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,628
Then make it work. No matter what.

502
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,421
I will take him back at all costs.

503
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,257
But why have you come to me?

504
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,051
Why an incompetent lawyer like me

505
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,094
to fight this difficult battle?

506
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,306
Because I thought

507
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,934
you'd do anything you could to win.

508
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:02,819
Chef Jung's sweet pumpkin soup
is delicious today.

509
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:08,033
Father is slowly recovering

510
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,993
and may wake up soon.

511
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,829
We need to show him
that we've been doing well.

512
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,002
Don't worry.

513
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,338
I'm fine.

514
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:25,217
I'll do anything to keep my children safe.

515
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,928
After all, I'm a mother.

516
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,890
I'm sure he feels the same way.

517
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,898
To keep peace within our family,

518
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:45,821
we should show him that everything's
been going fine when he returns.

519
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,157
But she's filing a lawsuit.

520
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,578
She wants to take Ha-joon back

521
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,914
and will request a transfer of custody.

522
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,084
Why would she start this fight

523
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,044
when she doesn't have a chance?

524
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,713
After six years have passed?

525
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,090
She's probably aware of that as well.

526
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,925
She just wants

527
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,303
to taint our reputation.

528
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:13,181
We can't let any more scandalous stories
about our family

529
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,559
get out.

530
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,228
She's Ha-joon's birth mother.

531
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:21,607
I'm sure she doesn't want him to get hurt.

532
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,027
So she won't reveal it
to the media thoughtlessly.

533
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,822
She once met with a reporter
and told him she was Ha-joon's birth mom.

534
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,116
I can't trust her.

535
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,953
You must not love her anymore.

536
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,247
-No more secret rendezvous?
-That's enough.

537
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,833
I am Ha-joon's mom.

538
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,960
I won't let him get hurt.

539
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,380
I'm not going to let her take him from me.

540
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,423
Hi-soo.

541
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,968
After finding out
what Ji-yong has done to you,

542
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,220
how has your love for Ha-joon not wavered?

543
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:55,349
You and Seo-hyun's attitudes

544
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,143
toward your stepsons
are so strikingly different.

545
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,271
I've always been curious. That's all.

546
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,231
I don't consider Ha-joon

547
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,360
and Ji-yong to be in the same category.

548
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:08,487
Ha-joon…

549
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,784
may have Ji-yong and Ms. Kang's DNA,

550
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,702
but I raised him.

551
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,497
I created his universe.

552
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,540
I took care of him.

553
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,709
We have an extremely strong bond.

554
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:28,340
Through this incident,
Ji-yong and I will become closer

555
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,925
and raise Ha-joon even better.

556
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,386
That's exactly why
this lawsuit is very important.

557
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,180
I'll help Hi-soo deal with the lawsuit

558
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,641
without any problems.

559
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:43,730
But aren't you pregnant, right now?

560
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,899
You don't seem to care about your baby.

561
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,651
You're all about Ha-joon.

562
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,404
You're going to raise Ha-joon even better?

563
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,073
Then what about your baby?

564
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,452
Are you really pregnant?

565
00:49:59,079 --> 00:49:59,955
Chef Jung.

566
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,249
Please serve the dishes.

567
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,378
Fruit purée is good for pregnant women.

568
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,214
It will benefit you
during the early stages of pregnancy.

569
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:11,425
We've prepared it just for you.

570
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,135
Thank you, Seo-hyun.

571
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,512
I'm glad you no longer have
morning sickness.

572
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:16,680
Eat up.

573
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,522
It's delicious.

574
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,961
I see sorrow in his eyes.

575
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,314
-Hey.
-Hey.

576
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,484
Right.

577
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,445
When will you show me the nursery?

578
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,739
Just wait a little longer.

579
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,575
Do you want to eat out today?

580
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,744
I'm volunteering at the foundation today.

581
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,704
Then I'll go out with Ha-joon.

582
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,831
I'm bringing him along with me.

583
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,211
I want to show him
the different walks of life.

584
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,379
And he needs to know

585
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:35,467
that not everyone is born the same way.

586
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,513
Some kids are born without a father.

587
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,223
And…

588
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,601
some without a mother.

589
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:46,895
Okay.

590
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,190
I respect that decision.

591
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,578
Let me remind you
that while you're working here,

592
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,330
you must consider yourselves deaf.

593
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:09,918
If you ever tell anyone about anything
that happens in this house,

594
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,337
you're good as dead. You know that, right?

595
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,964
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

596
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:14,923
Ms. Joo.

597
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,426
I'd like to take a day off tomorrow.

598
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,976
Sure.

599
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,519
Thank you.

600
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:33,984
I think she asked for the day off
to spend time

601
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,193
with the young master.

602
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,989
What's Seong-tae doing tomorrow?

603
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:44,286
So you want me to tail the young master
tomorrow?

604
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:46,538
Is that it?

605
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,208
That's right. Don't get caught.

606
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,127
You know you're clumsy, right?

607
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,921
Then why did you choose me for this task?

608
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,131
Come here.

609
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,219
Because I'm hoping you'll do a proper job
for once.

610
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,018
I'm really not cut out
for this kind of job.

611
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:10,896
Gosh, that startled me.

612
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,317
Mr. Choi.

613
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,735
Yes, ma'am.

614
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:20,739
I'd like a list of all the lawyers
Hyowon has fired in the past two years.

615
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,535
I think it's best for you
not to know the reason.

616
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,872
It's nothing too confidential
that you must know why, anyway.

617
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,207
Right.

618
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,418
I'll get it ready right away.

619
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,128
Thank you.

620
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,173
I also have a question.

621
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:42,218
When you gave me
the information on Ms. Kang,

622
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:46,806
why did you hand it over so easily,
without asking my husband first?

623
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,979
I've been working for the chairman
for 17 years now.

624
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:57,317
The first thing I need to do is make sure
I know whom I'm working for.

625
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,194
Does that mean…

626
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,781
you chose me over my husband?

627
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,535
I'm curious

628
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:11,247
as to whom you're actually working for
among this family.

629
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,756
You should honor the chairman's wish.

630
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,220
Right.

631
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:29,891
Brief me on Hyowon E&M's company analysis,
market prices, and last year's sales.

632
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,143
At the office tomorrow morning.

633
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,063
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,564
Father's will…

635
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:41,277
must've been a bolt out of the blue
for Ji-yong.

636
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:44,781
I'm sure he never imagined
the will would be disclosed.

637
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:45,907
I agree.

638
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,784
I spoke with Ms. Seo earlier today.

639
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,579
She wanted a list of fired lawyers.
May I give it to her?

640
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,374
Sure. Go ahead.

641
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,834
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,294
If anything new comes up,
I'll report it to you.

643
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,991
FROM SEONGNAM DISTRICT COURT
TO HAN JI-YONG

644
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,546
HA-JOON'S TUTOR

645
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,635
Did you get the written complaint?

646
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,180
Why the hell is she being so reckless?

647
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:51,848
To expose it, I guess.

648
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:57,437
She probably wants the world to know
that she is Ha-joon's real mother.

649
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,441
It's not difficult for us
to cover that up.

650
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,570
She's not foolish enough
to do something like this.

651
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,199
Her first love dumped her,

652
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,827
fell in love with an actress,
and faked her death.

653
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:14,913
She was mercilessly thrown out.

654
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,041
She probably wants people to know that.

655
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,003
Does she have proof?

656
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,633
She's going to manipulate the media
and screw me over without any proof?

657
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,178
Stay out of this.

658
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:35,475
I think what matters the most for now is
whether I qualify as Ha-joon's mother.

659
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,103
Shouldn't we hire a lawyer?

660
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:39,771
I'll look into it.

661
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,148
Wait.

662
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,903
Are you confident?

663
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,280
Can I…

664
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,991
trust you?

665
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,585
I think I asked you the same thing
not too long ago.

666
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,379
You have to…

667
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,548
trust me.

668
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,305
Please raise the oxygen level
to 45 percent.

669
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,474
I'm a little short of breath.

670
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,517
Yes, ma'am.

671
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,484
All right.

672
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,489
This is sundae, liver, and lungs.

673
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,282
-Lungs?
-Yes.

674
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,617
-They're edible?
-Yes.

675
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,202
Try the sundae first.

676
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,125
-Do I eat it like this?
-Dip it in this.

677
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,091
-Isn't it good?
-It is.

678
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,425
-You like it?
-Yes.

679
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:21,766
I know how scrumptious that is.

680
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,394
He took a bite of the forbidden fruit.

681
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,146
There's no turning back now.

682
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,698
Ma'am, here you go.

683
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,540
They're great.

684
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,626
They blend well and look original.

685
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,045
I love them. Which gallery?

686
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,089
They're on display at Studio A9.

687
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,675
But the artist has no name.

688
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:57,677
-They don't?
-No.

689
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,766
I wonder if there's a reason for that.
I'm getting curious.

690
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,978
I'll go there myself.
You don't need to let them know.

691
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,187
Yes, ma'am.

692
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,482
This is how I get to see you.

693
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,496
Have you been well?

694
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,210
I guess…

695
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,799
I can't avoid you even if I try,
seeing how we cross paths again.

696
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,677
We were meant to meet again.

697
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,805
You've created the person I am today.

698
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,226
You gave me inspiration…

699
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,854
and passion.

700
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:18,192
I've been painting with the passion
you gave me,

701
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,194
so everything I've achieved

702
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,530
is all thanks to you.

703
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,453
I…

704
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,289
haven't changed.

705
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,461
I pretend to be brave,
but I'm still a coward.

706
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,757
I can never let go of what I have.

707
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,970
I've never forgotten about you,

708
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,016
but I've never wanted to see you again.

709
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:54,020
Because…

710
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,981
I knew I'd be…

711
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,526
swayed by you.

712
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:04,655
I've missed you.

713
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,496
Are you happy?

714
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:26,677
I thought…

715
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,597
I loved painting.

716
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:30,598
But…

717
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:33,518
I was wrong.

718
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,689
I only enjoyed the memories
of painting with you.

719
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:43,444
I couldn't paint anymore
after I let you go.

720
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,906
I couldn't do anything but…

721
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,576
pine for the days I spent with you.

722
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:56,916
You are…

723
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,210
my painting.

724
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,674
Longing for you has become
a part of my life.

725
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,176
Thank you.

726
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,847
For the rest of my life,

727
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:14,559
I'll be longing for this moment.

728
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,650
Thank you.

729
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,504
-Hello?
-It's me.

730
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,465
Who?

731
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,343
Mr. Han Ji-yong of Hyowon Group.

732
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,930
Do you take us for fools?

733
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,182
How did you get my number?

734
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,683
He's dead.

735
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,103
My brother is dead!

736
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:13,779
Ji-yong.

737
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,948
What are you doing--

738
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:22,121
You've ruined everything.

739
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,956
If you die, everything will be solved.

740
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,708
That bastard is dead.

741
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,128
So you should die as well. Just die!

742
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,251
Are you in there?

743
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,136
Ji-yong.

744
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,554
Ji-yong!

745
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,102
Stop!

746
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:27,603
Stop it right now!

747
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,087
I will make you regret coming after me.

748
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,589
He's conscious?

749
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:39,049
Your father is conscious now.
What happens with the will?

750
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:40,467
How did you find out who I am?

751
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:43,512
If you know who I am,
you should know what I can do.

752
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,640
Ji-yong… Bring him here.

753
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:50,352
The chairman told me
he is withdrawing his will.

754
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,478
Father.

755
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:53,856
You must report to me
whenever someone takes Ha-joon.

756
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:55,608
Even if that person is his mom.

757
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,276
I'm going to court soon.

758
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:58,944
You must protect Ha-joon.

759
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,990
