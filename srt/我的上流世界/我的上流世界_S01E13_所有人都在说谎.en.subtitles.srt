1
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,969
"The souls of the righteous
are in the hand of God,

2
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,180
and no torment shall touch them.

3
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:59,100
They seemed, in the view of the foolish,
to be dead.

4
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,519
Their passing away
was thought an affliction,

5
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,272
and their going forth from us,
utter destruction.

6
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:06,316
But they are in peace.

7
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,361
For if to others, indeed,
they seem punished,

8
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,655
yet is their hope full of immortality.

9
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,743
Chastised a little,
they shall be greatly blessed

10
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,913
because God tried them…"

11
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,755
Lead us

12
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,549
not into temptation,

13
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,638
but deliver us from evil.

14
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,661
I witnessed it.

15
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,206
Someone was bleeding to death.

16
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,959
It's a murder case.

17
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:16,010
7 DAYS AFTER THE MURDER

18
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,230
I found Han Ji-yong dead.

19
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,610
And there was someone else
at the top of the stairs.

20
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,072
It was Seo Hi-soo.

21
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,414
The case has been filed.

22
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,835
I'll question everyone
who was at the scene.

23
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,921
Revealing the truth won't be easy.

24
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,888
Everyone will lie.

25
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,190
EPISODE 13
THEY ALL LIE

26
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,234
I don't remember anything.

27
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,781
Not only what happened that night,

28
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,078
but all the memories I had
after meeting Han Ji-yong…

29
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,041
are gone.

30
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,254
I can't remember anything.

31
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,758
She's suffering from amnesia

32
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,260
due to the trauma she experienced
that day.

33
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,181
The autopsy report says
he died of a cardiac arrest.

34
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,475
But according to the witness,

35
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,937
he was bleeding to death.

36
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,315
Don't you think he fell to his death?

37
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,484
He fell after the cardiac arrest.

38
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,737
That's what the doctor said,

39
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,906
and we just carried out his funeral.

40
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,699
According to Mother Emma,

41
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,285
there were a total of three people
at the scene.

42
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,746
Ms. Seo Hi-soo, the late Mr. Han Ji-yong,

43
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,331
and one more person.

44
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,053
But when she returned to the scene…

45
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,393
the person next to Mr. Han Ji-yong
had disappeared.

46
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:37,026
-Who could it be?
-I wouldn't know.

47
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,446
Ms. Seo can't remember,

48
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,365
so we must find that missing person.

49
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,243
That person will know everything.

50
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,037
Please find them.

51
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,623
I'm dying to know as well.

52
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,297
It's retributive justice.

53
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,883
He would've gotten killed eventually.

54
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,138
I'm sure everyone
in this house wanted him dead.

55
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:31,372
11 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

56
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,590
PHOTOS

57
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,284
It's me.

58
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,078
Something feels off.
I think I'm being tailed.

59
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,149
You suddenly hung up. Where are you?

60
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,651
I almost got kidnapped just now.

61
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,695
Are you serious?

62
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,781
I think Ji-yong hired someone. Damn it!

63
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,242
Go to a nearby police station right now.

64
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,495
And calm down. You'll be okay.

65
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,010
10 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

66
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,306
-Hello?
-Hello.

67
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,184
This is Inspector Hwang Hyeong-su
from Gwangun Police Station.

68
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,393
Hello.

69
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,686
Last night,

70
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,731
Kwak Su-chang was found dead.

71
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,443
But the last person
he talked to on the phone

72
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,945
was you, Mr. Han.

73
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,991
I need you to come down to the station.

74
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,206
THE REASON HAN JIN-HO GOT PASSED OVER
"TURNS OUT TO BE AN ALCOHOLIC"

75
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,087
HAN JIN-HO

76
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,717
Thank you for your cooperation.

77
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,637
I'll look into them right away.

78
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,597
He must've hired a hitman.

79
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,475
I'm positive that it was Han Ji-yong.

80
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,980
Kwak Su-chang was supposed to be
interviewed by a reporter this morning.

81
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,066
And he was killed before it could happen.
Isn't it clear-cut?

82
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,944
Are you afraid since he's wealthy?

83
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,322
I'm the true bloodline of Hyowon.

84
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,865
He's a fake.

85
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,662
It's a crime to make people fight against
each other in a dogfighting ring.

86
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,206
Don't tell me…

87
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,167
you're already on the take.

88
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,794
Hey, watch what you say.

89
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,921
Then just put him behind bars!

90
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,550
We have to solve this murder case first!
But there were no security cameras.

91
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,759
-Damn it.
-Then…

92
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,928
visit Mr. Kwak's brother at the hospital.

93
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,722
I already did,

94
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,224
but he's still unconscious.

95
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,162
Hi-soo.

96
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,123
That man is dead.

97
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,252
The man who was supposed
to be interviewed today

98
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,296
has been murdered.

99
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,714
I heard.

100
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,468
-I'm sure it was Ji-yong's doing.
-Seo-hyun…

101
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,638
-Ms. Lee was tailed.
-What?

102
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,308
We don't know how far Ji-yong will go.

103
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,935
-He's gone haywire.
-Kang Ja-kyeong.

104
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,312
No, Lee Hye-jin.

105
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,191
I'm bringing her back into this house.

106
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,817
This time, I'll bring her in.

107
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,195
We must protect her.

108
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:58,157
THE REASON HAN JIN-HO GOT PASSED OVER
"TURNS OUT TO BE AN ALCOHOLIC"

109
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,201
Father.

110
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,958
It's Ji-yong's doing. What a dirty prick.

111
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,045
You raised a snake.
You've been completely duped.

112
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,963
That's enough.

113
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,466
I'm going to let the whole world know
who he is.

114
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,343
This is why I don't trust you!

115
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,178
He killed that man.

116
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:23,432
Put the company
before your personal feelings!

117
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,646
Soo-hyuk came by.

118
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,273
He met with you?

119
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:35,236
He said he was too inexperienced
to manage a business

120
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,071
and asked me for more time.

121
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,740
Why didn't he discuss it with me first?

122
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,742
Don't be rash and ruin everything.

123
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,871
Soo-hyuk said…

124
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,459
someone else should take the position,
not himself.

125
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,378
Who?

126
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,510
I don't care who it is
as long as it's not Ji-yong.

127
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,638
Damn it.

128
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,530
Do you think you can go on living
like nothing happened?

129
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,867
You killed Kwak Su-chang, right?

130
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,286
What makes you think so?

131
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,412
You bastard.

132
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,998
You're not even fazed.

133
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,542
It's true. I was right.

134
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,169
Hey, Han Jin-ho.

135
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:36,005
Chairman Han Suk-chul's real son.

136
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,467
Don't do anything foolish.

137
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,179
Just stay quiet.

138
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,726
You should know to be afraid
if you know what kind of person I am.

139
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,105
Prince Taejong and Prince Hwoean
fought ruthlessly for the throne.

140
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,108
But the former refused to kill the latter.

141
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,234
Do you know why?

142
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,695
They were biological brothers.

143
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,079
Father, I'm coming in.

144
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,638
Be careful.

145
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,473
Why are you here?

146
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:31,143
Because I realized that it's better
to kill than to be killed.

147
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,038
Hello.

148
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm Ha-joon's tutor,

149
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,209
Lee Hye-jin.

150
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,020
Did you kill him?

151
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,189
Yes.

152
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,903
Were you really…

153
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,114
going to kill me as well?

154
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,325
Yes.

155
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,411
Did you think I was joking…

156
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,039
when I said I'd kill you?

157
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,460
Those who can't die a peaceful death
have only themselves to blame.

158
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,046
Why are you trying to get yourself killed?

159
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,589
Stop here.

160
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,840
Stop what?

161
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,842
What did I do?

162
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,512
If you don't,

163
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,223
someone will kill you.

164
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,727
Let's turn back time.

165
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,315
Let's go back to the first day
you came here as a tutor.

166
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,692
As Ms. Kang Ja-kyeong.

167
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,277
Cut the nonsense.

168
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,695
Don't you want to live?

169
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,489
If you do,

170
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,408
kill Hi-soo.

171
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,081
Then you'll be able to raise Ha-joon here
like you wanted.

172
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,708
Isn't that what you always wanted?

173
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,380
You've truly gone crazy.

174
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,256
One of you has to die.

175
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,468
Like you said,
Ha-joon can't have two moms.

176
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,437
I want you to kill Ji-yong.

177
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,357
I'll help you sell the necklace.

178
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,030
You're kidding, right?

179
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,282
Why would I do that?

180
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:36,996
You must be. I mean, how could you ask me
to kill a human being?

181
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,706
That bastard is not a human being.

182
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,918
Kill him and flee to Monaco.
It's a great place to live.

183
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,920
I'll help you settle down.

184
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,173
You'll easily get 20 billion won.

185
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,718
Don't ever come back.

186
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,267
That's the true face of Han Ji-yong,

187
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,811
the man who has the right to veto

188
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,604
any of your decisions.

189
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,983
He uses people as tools for his amusement.

190
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,236
The sole witness who could testify

191
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,614
against him was murdered last night.

192
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,744
We are dealing
with an entirely different situation now.

193
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,414
Hyowon Group is at a crucial crossroads
at the moment.

194
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,417
There's someone
I'd like to support with my shares.

195
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,253
Jung Seo-hyun.

196
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:30,299
To keep Hyowon Group strong and alive,

197
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,509
I need all of you

198
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,555
to do your utmost best
and stay grounded more than ever.

199
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,223
I will…

200
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:42,644
take responsibility for everything
and lead Hyowon.

201
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,591
5 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

202
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,803
I can totally feel Hi-soo's absence.

203
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:16,970
Me too.

204
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,348
That's why we're welcoming a new member.

205
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,308
I told her not to be late.

206
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,687
Okay, sit here.

207
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,652
You're joining our Bible study?

208
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,029
But she's not a member of Ilsin.

209
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,656
She joined us by donating.

210
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,492
From now on,
she'll be a part of this group.

211
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,828
I can see you're trying.

212
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,832
By the way, you look familiar.

213
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,708
Yes, she's from the cream bun incident.

214
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,628
She's Han Jin-hee,
the power-tripping woman.

215
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,088
Hi-soo's sister-in-law.

216
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,428
Hello.

217
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:04,685
I have lived a reckless life.

218
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,895
But after meeting Mother Emma,

219
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,439
I've finally begun
to learn about the world.

220
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,943
I learned that in order to be respected
by others,

221
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,320
I should respect them first.

222
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,824
I look forward to studying with you all.

223
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,538
Let's welcome our troublemaker
with a round of applause.

224
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,463
We have a new member today.
Why don't we have some coffee together?

225
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,551
I love your hair.

226
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,471
They're like twins.

227
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,353
Do you have any interest
in getting married again?

228
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,690
If there's a man so great and handsome

229
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:56,153
that I wouldn't even think about worrying
he might be after my money,

230
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,155
then yes.

231
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,741
I heard Hi-soo's getting a divorce.

232
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,410
Ha-joon's real mom filed a lawsuit
against her,

233
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,953
and Hi-soo won.

234
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,706
Let's refrain from gossiping or sharing

235
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,708
uncomfortable news.

236
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,879
And don't ask her anything.
She'll take the bait and spill everything.

237
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,342
Goading someone into it
is worse than spilling the beans.

238
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:22,930
Hello?

239
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,057
Hi, babe.

240
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,809
I'm having teatime with my girls.

241
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,188
I'll call you when I'm done.

242
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,065
I love you, babe.

243
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,695
After attending Bible study
and digesting the word of God,

244
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,073
you speak with your secret lover
on the phone?

245
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,367
Shouldn't you pick one or the other?

246
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,953
You met him on the golf course, right?

247
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,413
Don't you know it's teeming with scammers?

248
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,832
Make sure you do a background check
on him.

249
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,000
Mi-joo.

250
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,337
We're going through the same thing.

251
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,297
This hellhole of a marriage life.

252
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,007
Why is it a hellhole?

253
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,551
Because his wife is a crazy woman.

254
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:05,013
Then why hasn't he divorced
that crazy woman?

255
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,307
Because that crazy woman won't let him.

256
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,892
So do you want him

257
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,313
to divorce that crazy woman
and marry you instead?

258
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,150
I'll never get a divorce. What for?

259
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,445
Of course. Getting a divorce
is easier said than done.

260
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,615
But I get the feeling
that he wants to get divorced

261
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,785
to live with me instead,
and it makes me feel uncomfortable.

262
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,706
Things are bound to get dirty
if an affair doesn't go your way.

263
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:31,999
It's not an affair.

264
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,169
It's just an affair.

265
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:45,387
I have a strong feeling that this meeting
is going to become really exhausting.

266
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,434
Are you confident?

267
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,937
I'm counting on you.

268
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,157
PLAINTIFF: SEO HI-SOO
DEFENDANT: HAN JI-YONG

269
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,075
PLAINTIFF DEMANDS A DIVORCE

270
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,962
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-YONG

271
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,551
You knew Hi-soo would be sending me this,
didn't you?

272
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,097
You introduced Hwang Bo-in,
Hyowon's former lawyer, to her.

273
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,475
You kept my father's will secret

274
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,227
and scheduled the board meeting
with Seo-hyun.

275
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,563
I know it was all you.

276
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,775
Once you're done monitoring
the OLED fair-trade risk

277
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,985
next week,

278
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,571
I'd like you to leave Hyowon Group.

279
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,367
You see, you should always pour
new wine into a new bottle.

280
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:54,539
We expected this.

281
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,919
Thank you for everything, Mr. Choi.

282
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,297
Please keep those files safe
as we discussed.

283
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,008
And…

284
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,637
be safe.

285
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,431
We don't know
what Ji-yong might do to you.

286
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,653
The HR team leader
and the head of the press are outside.

287
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,071
Should I bring them in?

288
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:29,574
Tell them to come back tomorrow
at the same time.

289
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,036
Before I release this news,

290
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,124
I need to tell someone about it.

291
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,376
Understood, ma'am.

292
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,059
It's me.

293
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,020
Let's meet right now.

294
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,160
What?

295
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,328
He's gone?

296
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,417
-Ask his doctor.
-I think they hid him away.

297
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,920
The security cameras were off,
and the doctor has no idea either.

298
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,800
How's that possible when the hospital
is teeming with security cameras?

299
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,946
What did you want to tell me?

300
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,157
We have to…

301
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,118
bring Ji-yong down as soon as possible.

302
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,953
You don't need to tell me that.

303
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,956
I'll even kill him if I must.

304
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,666
You sound like you mean it,

305
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,877
so I'm a bit flustered.

306
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,879
Yes. I mean it.

307
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,060
Tomorrow…

308
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,772
I'll be doing an important interview.

309
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:28,193
I thought I should tell you beforehand.

310
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,527
After all,

311
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,696
we are married.

312
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:33,907
What important interview?

313
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,076
Don't rely on the media.
That was my mistake.

314
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,246
I should've just reported Ji-yong
to the police.

315
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,413
Had I done that,

316
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,333
that fighter wouldn't have been killed.

317
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,836
Ji-yong must've found out
about the fighter's interview.

318
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,381
I'm…

319
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,509
a lesbian.

320
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,638
What?

321
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,057
The person in my heart…

322
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,103
My one and only love is…

323
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,397
a woman.

324
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,942
No way.

325
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,445
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

326
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:15,907
If you want,

327
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,119
we can get a divorce.

328
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,372
But it's not a good time right now.

329
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,500
Please wait until I…

330
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:27,585
bring Ji-yong down.

331
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,798
Have you been

332
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,385
seeing that woman throughout our marriage?

333
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:36,970
No.

334
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,555
Have you ever…

335
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,059
slept with her since you married me?

336
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:46,646
No.

337
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,067
Then it wasn't an affair.

338
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,527
No.

339
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,531
Then you're better than me.

340
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:59,492
But I deceived you when we got married.

341
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,578
It's more than enough reason
for a divorce.

342
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,372
I'll respect whatever decision…

343
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,250
you make.

344
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,836
You know what?

345
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,423
I think this is better

346
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,218
than hearing you had an affair
with another man.

347
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,598
I always suspected you and your secretary.

348
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,310
My hunch is never right.

349
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,187
Ji-yong knows about this.

350
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,440
Hold on.

351
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,526
Why do you guys always keep me
in the dark?

352
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,904
You all deal with things
without telling me.

353
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,739
I'm sorry.

354
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:42,202
I have no reason to apologize to anyone
for my sexual identity.

355
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,289
But I am sorry that I deceived you.

356
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,001
I guess you had no choice.

357
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,962
It's not like you can control it.

358
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,885
I'm a simple man.

359
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:03,056
Why must I face such a difficult issue
that I have no solution for?

360
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,058
Right.

361
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,105
I'm sorry about that too.

362
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,236
I never imagined
you'd ever apologize to me for anything.

363
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,780
How refreshing.

364
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,702
As you know,

365
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,497
the entire world has learned
about my alcoholism.

366
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,750
If you have that interview tomorrow,

367
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,253
it'll become global news.

368
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,713
I'll be humiliated,
and you'll be criticized.

369
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,801
We'll become
the laughingstock of the world.

370
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,136
Don't do it.

371
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,973
I want to be honest with everyone
before I do this.

372
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,016
Do what?

373
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,477
I'm going to…

374
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,896
become the chairwoman.

375
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:56,025
To drag Ji-yong down,
someone needs to fight for the position.

376
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,904
Let me take responsibility for my actions.

377
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,167
Okay.

378
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,462
You have my support.

379
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:22,177
But must you tell the world
when your husband's fine with it?

380
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,681
Your sexual identity
has nothing to do with your competence.

381
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,728
And know that I won't divorce you.

382
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,147
It'll be humiliating.

383
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,570
Let's eat.

384
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,239
Let's enjoy this meal.

385
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,242
It's been a while since we ate out alone.

386
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,979
Turn yourself in.

387
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,399
Pay for what you've done.

388
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,609
Turn myself in?

389
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:23,071
What did I do wrong?

390
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,990
All that I did was feel pure joy
from spectating.

391
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,451
We've been married for six years.

392
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,329
I wondered if I played any part

393
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,415
in what you have become.

394
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,920
I even prayed and asked God.

395
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,507
At first, I was enraged
that I'd been deceived so helplessly.

396
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,928
But at some point,

397
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,889
I started pitying you…

398
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,685
and wondering,

399
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,272
"How did he turn into such a monster?"

400
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,360
This is the last chance I'm giving you.

401
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,573
Don't be arrogant.

402
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,782
You were just…

403
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,745
like an accessory.

404
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,623
Like the blue diamond Father purchased

405
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,085
at Christie's auction house.

406
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,004
But I no longer need you.

407
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,589
Please think about Ha-joon.

408
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,799
He's mine.

409
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,134
Don't you dare touch him.

410
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,303
He doesn't belong to anyone.

411
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,763
He's neither yours, mine, nor Hye-jin's.

412
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:34,183
I'll help him grow
into a healthy, young man

413
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,768
and bring him back.

414
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,730
Never. He's mine.

415
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,026
He's leaving for Boston in two days.

416
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,196
If not, he'll find out everything
once the news spreads.

417
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,074
Nothing will happen.

418
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,660
No one can touch me!

419
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,256
No.

420
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,926
You're wrong.

421
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,137
If you don't turn yourself in
after he leaves,

422
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,514
I'll disclose everything.

423
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,352
PERSONAL DETAILS

424
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,561
Cho Gyeong-cheol?

425
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,190
We suspect him to be the broker
behind Han Ji-yong's dogfighting ring.

426
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,696
He was convicted twice
of fraud and embezzlement.

427
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,115
I'm sure someone else did the deed.

428
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,495
This is what I've gathered.

429
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,334
I won't let it take too long.

430
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:45,880
So don't go too far.
Maybe get some rest in Jeju Island.

431
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,299
Yes, ma'am.

432
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,891
What did I do wrong?

433
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,601
Do you have proof?

434
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:02,188
Kwak Hyeon-dong, the brother
of Kwak Su-chang whom you murdered.

435
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,399
He…

436
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,484
regained consciousness.

437
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,945
He's with me.

438
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,530
He will testify to everything…

439
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,408
you've done.

440
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,536
Then he'll dig into his brother's death.

441
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,163
You won't get away with this.

442
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,375
It's all over now.

443
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,565
No-deok.

444
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,858
4 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

445
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,860
Spread your feathers, will you?

446
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,279
Spread them wide.

447
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,406
You are No-deok, right?

448
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:54,824
No-deok.

449
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,328
Gosh.

450
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,915
Goodness. See you later.

451
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,272
Hey.

452
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:59,806
I was told that I'd only need to follow
Chairman Han Ji-yong's orders.

453
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,683
He's not the chairman yet.

454
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,605
So you're a caregiver
for Chairman Han Suk-chul?

455
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,648
That's correct.

456
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,609
Where is he right now?

457
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,986
He's taking a bath.

458
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,864
Then I'll go tend to him.

459
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,034
We already have a live-in male nurse

460
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,995
who's tending to him at all times.

461
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,747
They're in the bathroom right now.

462
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,584
Once he's done bathing,
you can formally introduce yourself.

463
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,629
I told you.

464
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,091
I only follow
Chairman Han Ji-yong's orders.

465
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:38,010
He said he will fire the male nurse today.

466
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,520
Ma'am, let me introduce her to you.

467
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:51,023
Mr. Han Ji-yong hired her

468
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,151
as the chairman's caregiver.

469
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:57,363
She says she'll only follow
Mr. Han's orders.

470
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,948
Hello, my name is Ko Bo-hui.

471
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,366
Please get out of our house.

472
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,537
We can't hire my father-in-law's caregiver
without a background check.

473
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,833
We can't trust you even more
if Mr. Han hired you.

474
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,961
I was told to only obey his--

475
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,337
I told you to get out now!

476
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,343
Must I report you to the police
for breaking in?

477
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,013
I can't trust you.

478
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,890
Isn't that enough of a reason?

479
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,559
Leave at once.

480
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,195
Let me escort you to the study.

481
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,323
Go back to Cadenza.

482
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,533
Father doesn't want to go.

483
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:43,951
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,668
Goodness.

485
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,838
I'm glad you're here, my puppy. Goodness.

486
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:58,716
Sit down.

487
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,512
Goodness.

488
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,272
Gosh. I've been eating
for the past 70 years.

489
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,234
Now, there are no dishes I haven't tried.

490
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,154
I wonder what aliens eat these days.

491
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,281
I have a few things to tell you.

492
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,908
I've filed a divorce suit.

493
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,620
But…

494
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,375
another concern has been brought up.

495
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,918
Ji-yong…

496
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,880
will be questioned by the police.

497
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,176
As a murder suspect.

498
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,890
I must protect Ha-joon,

499
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,934
so he'll be flying out tomorrow.

500
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,021
I can't let him hear the news
about his own father.

501
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:58,067
Ms. Lee Hye-jin, his former tutor,
will accompany him.

502
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,904
And of course, I'll continue
to take full custody of him.

503
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,740
Wait. Do you think…

504
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,243
that makes any sense?

505
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,536
Before that,

506
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,330
how has Ji-yong become a murder suspect?

507
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,082
We'll talk about that later.

508
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,751
We need to come up with effective ways

509
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,379
to protect our company also.

510
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,466
Are you saying…

511
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:26,262
that Ji-yong is evil enough…

512
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,265
to commit murder?

513
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,227
He's capable of doing much worse.

514
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,521
I'm sorry, Father.

515
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,233
I had no choice but to tell you about it,
but it also…

516
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,862
breaks my heart.

517
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,991
The media is already talking
about him becoming the chairman.

518
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,660
His inauguration is already scheduled.

519
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,787
A day before the inauguration,

520
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,041
we are planning to celebrate
Soo-hyuk's engagement.

521
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,753
We need to divert people's attention
to the engagement.

522
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,837
And…

523
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,798
Ji-yong mustn't find out about this.

524
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,343
To protect himself,

525
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,763
he won't think twice about harming Hyowon.

526
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,599
I'm sorry.

527
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,061
Are you really not going to honor
your grandfather's wishes?

528
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,146
No.

529
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,107
Someone more competent than I am
should take the position.

530
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,779
Then I'd like to recommend Seo-hyun.

531
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,451
I'm going to give all my shares to her.

532
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,495
-What?
-Jin-ho!

533
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,955
I'm still a part of this family.

534
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,167
I'd like to support her with my shares
as well.

535
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,211
Me too.

536
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,339
-What?
-What is this?

537
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,341
You've already joined hands?

538
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,759
You should too.

539
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,803
She's better than Ji-yong.

540
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,098
-You should too.
-What?

541
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:01,107
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-YONG

542
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,322
Find Kwak Hyeon-dong.

543
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,699
He's not at our medical center.

544
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,910
I'll give you a list of hospitals.

545
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,954
Find him at once and bring him here!

546
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,848
Father has decided
who he will hand over his shares to.

547
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,559
Mr. Choi will announce it
during the shareholders' meeting.

548
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,146
I'm going to hold the meeting
on the day of the inauguration.

549
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,316
I need to tell you something.

550
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,819
You have to know this.

551
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,238
I'm starving. Don't stress me out.

552
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,656
Let's eat first.

553
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:54,493
Ji-yong isn't Father's biological son.

554
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,876
They're not related by blood.

555
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:03,961
What?

556
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,632
Ji-yong's mother
was already pregnant with him

557
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,010
when she started seeing Father.

558
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,138
What… What did you say?

559
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,348
I only found out recently.

560
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,728
So you're telling me

561
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,022
that Ji-yong…

562
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:29,570
is not biologically related
to your father?

563
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,830
That crazy geezer!

564
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,123
-Ms. Joo!
-Hold on!

565
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,834
He wasn't even his son!

566
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,629
So why did he have me raise him?

567
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,255
My kids…

568
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:51,592
Raising my own kids was already demanding!

569
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:54,887
Ma'am.

570
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,892
Han Suk-chul! Die!

571
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,144
-Mom, calm down.
-Just die!

572
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,522
-Ma'am, sit down.
-Come on.

573
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,858
Why? He wasn't even his son!

574
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,614
Ma'am, breathe.

575
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,533
Hello?

576
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,452
-Hello, detective.
-What does that make me?

577
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,620
The crime scene?

578
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,080
-I know where it is.
-Breathe.

579
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:24,500
-Unbelievable.
-I'll send you the address. See you there.

580
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,752
I'm sure he's in hiding somewhere.

581
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,758
-Hello?
-Sir.

582
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,970
Inspector Hwang Hyeong-su
from Gwangun Police Station called.

583
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,263
Should I put him through?

584
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,268
Yes.

585
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,603
Is this Mr. Han Ji-yong?

586
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,107
I'd like to question you
about Kwak Su-chang's death.

587
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,943
Do you know him?

588
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,404
No, I don't.

589
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,782
Didn't you frequent Jangsu Building
in Sacheon-gil, Jungdong-gu?

590
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:01,287
Whether I did or not, that's private.

591
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,623
Why must I answer that question?

592
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,793
Anyway,
I don't see the need to meet with you.

593
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:08,711
Give me that.

594
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,213
Hey.

595
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,883
This is where you paid them to fight
and violated their rights.

596
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,844
Don't expect to squirm out of this.

597
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,345
I know you killed him!

598
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,514
God damn it. Give me that.

599
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:21,890
Hello?

600
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,854
Hello? Why would you yell at him
like that?

601
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:27,938
Damn it.

602
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:31,942
Can't you just indict him

603
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,237
for encouraging people to fight here?
It's illegal.

604
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,781
There's no law that'll punish him
for doing that.

605
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,826
That's absurd. How's that possible?

606
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,578
Mr. Han graduated from law school.

607
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,663
He knows the law
like the back of his hand.

608
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,417
Consensual fights
aren't considered illegal.

609
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,670
And there weren't any spectators,
so he wasn't gambling either.

610
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,840
This is driving me up the wall. Damn it.

611
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,841
But…

612
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,137
why would he kill Kwak Su-chang?
What could he have been afraid of?

613
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,057
His honor.

614
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,476
Tainting his dignity.

615
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,021
For those who have everything,
that's the worst fear.

616
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,898
Except me.

617
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,983
"Digty"?

618
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:18,989
Hello?

619
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,741
Sorry?

620
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,452
Yes, sir.

621
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:25,663
Understood, sir.

622
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,710
They don't want me poking my nose
into Hyowon.

623
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,587
That's downright ridiculous!

624
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,799
Don't go easy on him
just because he's wealthy!

625
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,803
You should investigate fair and square
with no exceptions!

626
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,638
Don't you know times have changed?

627
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,973
Damn it.

628
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,064
KYOUNGAM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
STRIVES FOR A BRIGHT FUTURE

629
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,945
Who are you?

630
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,530
We will escort him.

631
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,656
Who are you?

632
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:01,657
Answer me!

633
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,659
-Chairman Han Ji-yong's orders.
-Ms. Kang!

634
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,577
-What are you doing?
-Ms. Kang!

635
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,788
-Ha-joon!
-Ms. Kang!

636
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:08,747
-Ha-joon!
-Ms. Kang!

637
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,958
Ha-joon!

638
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,335
-Ms. Kang!
-Let go of me!

639
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,003
Ha-joon.

640
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,465
Ha-joon!

641
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,663
Han Ji-yong…

642
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:05,220
LEE HYE-JIN

643
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,057
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable…

644
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,270
MS. SEO

645
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,815
MS. JUNG

646
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:28,076
LEE HYE-JIN

647
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,832
-Hello?
-Help me.

648
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,503
They took Ha-joon.

649
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,630
Who did?

650
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:41,673
They were Han Ji-yong's men.

651
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,426
Please… Please help me find him.

652
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,596
I'll look into it. Wait.

653
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,271
Mr. Seo.

654
00:46:56,855 --> 00:47:00,484
Bring Mr. Han Ji-yong's head secretary
to my office as soon as possible.

655
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,862
I'm going to kill…

656
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,907
your husband.

657
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,081
I'm sorry.

658
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,669
If you really are, then kill him for me.

659
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,865
Do you know why you're here?

660
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,368
No, ma'am. I don't.

661
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,037
Do your loyalties lie with Hyowon Group…

662
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,291
or with Han Ji-yong?

663
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,045
Let me say one thing
to help you make up your mind.

664
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,381
Han Ji-yong…

665
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:06,675
is done for.

666
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,845
You know what I mean, don't you?

667
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,514
Stand behind me…

668
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,393
and you won't die.

669
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,321
Ha-joon.

670
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:12,074
Tomorrow, you'll be…

671
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,243
flying to the States…

672
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,579
with me.

673
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,544
Thank goodness.

674
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,005
You're not taken aback.

675
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,633
Mom told me.

676
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,343
Is that okay?

677
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,220
She said she'll come soon.

678
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,014
So I'm fine.

679
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:39,434
I'm okay…

680
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,479
as long as my mom is by my side.

681
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,572
How wonderful…

682
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,034
that you have such a great mom.

683
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,163
Thank you…

684
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,419
for bringing me into the world.

685
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,010
No.

686
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,013
Thank you for growing up…

687
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:19,683
so well.

688
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:45,667
Ha-joon's tutor tracked him down.

689
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,712
-What?
-I'm sorry, sir.

690
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,840
I couldn't make him turn off his phone.

691
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,885
He kept crying, so…

692
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,929
Damn it.

693
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,815
Is something wrong?

694
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,361
Ji-yong tried to take Ha-joon away.

695
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,948
-What?
-Thankfully, he's safe now.

696
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,951
And he doesn't seem too shook up.

697
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:22,412
That's a relief.

698
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,247
Thank you.

699
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,750
Okay.

700
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,596
Mother Emma.

701
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,974
I need you to come here.

702
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,976
You have to.

703
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,979
I'll send a car over right now.

704
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,732
Okay.

705
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:09,376
The chairman wants to see you at Cadenza.

706
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,837
Why did you fire the caregiver?

707
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,298
The chairman's always chosen
his caregiver himself.

708
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:19,594
We can't let someone not vetted
into the house so rashly, sir.

709
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,847
"So rashly"?

710
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,559
How dare you say that
when I hired her myself?

711
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,106
"Give someone an inch
and they'll take a mile."

712
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,315
Will you…

713
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,235
fire me as well?

714
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:45,579
What were you going to do with Ha-joon?

715
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,164
I just wanted to take him away
from you two.

716
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,710
Hi-soo wants to take Ha-joon with her
after our divorce.

717
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,879
What nonsense is that?

718
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,424
I need to keep him with me
to prevent that from happening.

719
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,802
How could you call yourself his father?

720
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,014
Ha-joon's leaving tomorrow.

721
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:08,810
You may never get to see him again.

722
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,563
So bid him goodbye.

723
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,986
He's my son.

724
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,281
Neither you nor Hi-soo
can truly be called his mother.

725
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,287
Shut up.

726
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,915
You're not even his father.

727
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,030
Do you have anything to tell me?

728
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,950
No, sir.

729
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,620
Did you ever go through my study?

730
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,872
No, sir.

731
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:16,211
Then who on earth could've gone
through my drawers

732
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,879
and messed with my phone?

733
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,174
And who could've handed it over to Jin-ho?

734
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,802
Are you suspecting me?

735
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,390
Yes.

736
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,143
Why… Why do you suspect me?

737
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:35,730
Because you two are close.
You even bathe together often.

738
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,692
How did you know that?

739
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,028
I know everything.

740
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:46,032
I know every little thing
that happens here.

741
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:48,952
Who do you think

742
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,163
resents me the most in this house?

743
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,500
I… I don't…

744
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,419
It's okay. You can tell me.

745
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,462
How would I know that?

746
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:01,756
That's strange.

747
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,884
They said you'd know.

748
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,770
Are you saying
someone could've murdered Mr. Han Ji-yong?

749
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,522
How would I know?

750
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:22,861
But many people wanted to kill him,
that's for sure.

751
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,780
How did he get along
with the housekeepers?

752
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,451
I wouldn't know about that.

753
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,580
But I heard you were in charge
of managing them.

754
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,873
That's right.

755
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:38,418
But they're housekeepers,
and I'm their employer.

756
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,547
So I can't possibly know
how they all feel. Nor do I need to.

757
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,134
Wait, sir.

758
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,220
There is…

759
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,681
another door.

760
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,367
UNLOCKED

761
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,395
I want you

762
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,773
to kill Ji-yong.

763
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,733
You'll easily get 20 billion won.

764
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,485
Don't ever come back.

765
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,787
Mother Emma is the sole witness

766
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,582
to Mr. Han Ji-yong's death as of now.

767
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,459
According to her,

768
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,587
she was utterly shocked
when she spotted him

769
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,631
and ran outside to ask for help.

770
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:09,175
And when she came back,

771
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:13,805
the person lying unconscious next to him
was gone.

772
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:27,777
Wait. Someone has…

773
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,028
Please call an ambulance.

774
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:31,698
Mother Emma, please calm down.

775
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,991
Make a call right now.

776
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,034
Okay.

777
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,499
Stay here.

778
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,419
Don't follow me inside.

779
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:54,137
When she asked him to call an ambulance,
he wasn't taken aback at all.

780
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,308
As if he already knew that Mr. Han Ji-yong
was lying unconscious in there.

781
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:02,687
You should ask him about that directly.

782
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,272
Why are you asking me?

783
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:08,943
You testified that you got the photos of
those fighters from Mr. Kim Seong-tae.

784
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,028
That's right.

785
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,073
He said he had found an old phone
in Ji-yong's study

786
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,159
and those photos were in it.

787
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:21,080
Are you saying that a mere housekeeper
dared to do such a thing on his own?

788
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:24,501
Don't ask me.

789
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,086
Ask him yourself.

790
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,881
Isn't that your job?

791
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:34,093
It so happened that he left for Monaco
the day after Mr. Han's death.

792
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:37,096
Interpol won't put him on a wanted list
since he isn't a suspect.

793
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:43,811
Hello?

794
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,272
Okay.

795
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,110
A search warrant has been issued.

796
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,531
I'd like to visit your residence.

797
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,952
Oh, right. On the day Mr. Han died,

798
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,246
why were you at another hospital?

799
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,373
I was visiting my brother-in-law.

800
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:07,418
The day of the incident,
he had a car accident.

801
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,047
How coincidental.

802
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,675
It was a hit-and-run.

803
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,773
Who do you think was lying unconscious
next to Mr. Han Ji-yong?

804
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:29,941
Who knows?

805
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,319
How would I know that?

806
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,281
Around 7 p.m.,

807
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:41,369
the hospital called to tell me
my husband had an accident.

808
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:44,163
But I missed the call,
so Jin-ho went instead.

809
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:48,167
I was in the garden at Cadenza.

810
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,546
I had drunk almost
an entire bottle of wine.

811
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,925
But Jin-ho didn't drink at all.

812
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,511
Not even one sip.

813
00:59:58,595 --> 00:59:59,804
Hey, Jung-do. Where--

814
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,391
Sorry?

815
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,144
What?

816
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:13,651
Okay.

817
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,404
Your two brothers
weren't on good terms, were they?

818
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,409
Your older brother hated him
so much that he wanted him dead.

819
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:23,620
Are you suspecting Jin-ho?

820
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,496
Detective.

821
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:30,335
Ji-yong deceived all of us.
Turns out, he wasn't even my brother.

822
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,589
It's only natural that Jin-ho hated him.

823
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,926
He may have wanted him dead,
but he could never do that.

824
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,429
Had he been that courageous,

825
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:43,723
he would've never let Ji-yong

826
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,933
take the chairman position.

827
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,518
Based on what you just said,

828
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,936
you must also think

829
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,773
that Mr. Han was murdered.

830
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,733
I'm not sure.

831
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,985
But you know what?

832
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:59,614
I'm sure everyone
in this house wanted him dead.

833
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:04,452
The one who was most desperate
to kill him…

834
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,288
is over there.

835
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,377
Her husband is now dead,

836
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:16,297
so why is she still here
when she was hell-bent on divorcing him?

837
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,299
Her doctor told her…

838
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:22,261
that remaining at her former residence

839
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,598
would help retrieve her lost memory.

840
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:29,894
She loved Ha-joon more than anyone.

841
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:33,231
But now, she doesn't even recognize him.

842
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,693
Okay. Thank you.

843
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,250
No-deok.

844
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,976
We're off to his chess lesson.

845
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:11,978
Okay.

846
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:13,730
Mom.

847
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:15,732
I'll see you later.

848
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:17,942
Mom.

849
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:22,071
Do you really not recognize me?

850
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,576
I'll try my best to remember you.

851
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:56,814
Ms. Seo.

852
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,527
-Hello.
-Hello.

853
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,571
How are you feeling today?

854
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:10,953
Didn't you part your hair to the right
that day?

855
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:14,582
You wore a beige jacket and gray pants.

856
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,794
The shoes are the same.

857
01:03:20,004 --> 01:03:22,173
You're right. You have a good memory.

858
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:23,841
As I told you,

859
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:26,761
all the memories
between the day I met Ji-yong

860
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,554
and the day of the incident are gone.

861
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:33,059
Maybe it's because I remember so little

862
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,062
that what I remember is so vivid.

863
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,317
Do you not remember your son?

864
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,361
I heard you loved him dearly.

865
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:44,987
Apparently so.

866
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:47,198
Detective.

867
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:49,283
Please do a proper investigation.

868
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,244
You see, I'm really curious.

869
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,997
Was my husband murdered?

870
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,460
Or was it really a cardiac arrest?

871
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,879
Okay. I will.

872
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,142
The police have begun investigating

873
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,020
the death of Mr. Han Ji-yong of Hyowon
a week after his death.

874
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,439
On the 3rd,
the day before the shareholders' meeting

875
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,692
to approve his new position
as the chairman,

876
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:26,320
the late Mr. Han died of a cardiac arrest
in his home at the age of 39.

877
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:29,365
His funeral was held privately
as his family wished.

878
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:32,910
However, as a witness testified
about what happened that day,

879
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,037
the police started an investigation.

880
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,040
He was the second son
of Chairman Han Suk-chul of Hyowon

881
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:40,751
and would've been
the youngest leader of a conglomerate.

882
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,461
But unfortunately, he passed away.

883
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:46,465
Father, Ji-yong fell
from the second floor.

884
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,946
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT

885
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:32,053
When she asked him to call an ambulance,
he wasn't taken aback at all.

886
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:36,098
As if he already knew that Mr. Han Ji-yong
was lying unconscious in there.

887
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,976
You should ask him about that directly.

888
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:40,603
Why are you asking me?

889
01:05:49,236 --> 01:05:52,365
Seo Hi-soo, who was enraged
that her six years of marriage

890
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,741
to Han Ji-yong were a lie.

891
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,202
I don't remember anything.

892
01:05:56,827 --> 01:06:00,831
Let's start from the day
you were hired as Ha-joon's tutor.

893
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,210
Kang Ja-kyeong, who came into Hyowon

894
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,129
plotting revenge after her child
was taken away by Han Ji-yong.

895
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,762
We must find that missing person.

896
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:17,640
That person will know everything.

897
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:20,726
-Who could it be?
-I wouldn't know.

898
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,853
Jung Seo-hyun, Han Ji-yong's biggest rival

899
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:26,232
and the one who controls everything
in Hyowon.

900
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,442
We just have to find one person.

901
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:12,153
The other person who fell to the floor.

902
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,780
One of them died
and the other came out unscathed?

903
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,449
Get out of my house.

904
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,868
Why are you causing this ruckus
after only listening to that nun?

905
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,912
Has the possibility that she might
be lying not crossed your mind?

906
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:22,913
I can't reach Kim Seong-tae.

907
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:26,584
We really need his statement.
He's the one holding the key.

908
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:30,796
If my mom can't remember me,
what should I do?

909
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,798
The one who survived
must have visited the hospital.

910
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,383
Look up Seo Hi-soo's medical record.

911
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,846
