1
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,815
The incident took place in Cadenza.

2
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,700
When I found them…

3
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,163
the two of them were passed out
on the floor.

4
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,927
What are you doing?

5
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,470
Yes, ma'am?

6
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,945
Why don't we switch rooms?

7
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,196
It'd be fun.

8
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,452
I can't sleep in my room, but you can.

9
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,539
So sleep in my room tonight.

10
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,707
No, Young Master…

11
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,962
I can't do that.

12
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,271
EPISODE 2
THE WINGS OF ICARUS

13
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,013
Why can't he sleep in this nice room?

14
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:58,339
Why is Soo-hyuk late for breakfast?
He's rarely late.

15
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,966
He must be sleeping.

16
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,802
He must be getting over jet lag.

17
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,555
Wake him up and bring him.

18
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,891
Let him sleep.
I'm glad he's sleeping well.

19
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,852
Chef Jung!

20
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,564
I'm going to skip soup.
Just give me the meat.

21
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,202
Didn't I tell you
I always want hangover soup?

22
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,194
This is weird.

23
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,322
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

24
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,412
Mr. Kim. Ms. Seo is on her way out.

25
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,541
She must be at Hawon Gallery by 10:30 a.m.
and her schedule will end before 5 p.m.

26
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,544
Did you move up tomorrow's schedule?

27
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:22,340
Yes. Young Master Han's fiancée
will come tomorrow for the first time.

28
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,343
So all the women will meet up in Cadenza.

29
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:31,349
Then, I shouldn't look too pretty,
so I don't steal the spotlight.

30
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,518
You need to look less pretty.

31
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,521
I can't help it.
Some things are just impossible.

32
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,690
-See you later.
-See you.

33
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,946
Ms. Kang.

34
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,863
Yes.

35
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,907
I was quite shocked yesterday.

36
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:52,203
I guess you are free-spirited
since you lived abroad for so long.

37
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,290
I'm sorry, ma'am.

38
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,750
I'll be more careful.

39
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,461
Text me when my son gets home.

40
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,756
And have him drink the A1 milk
before the violin lesson.

41
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,008
Heat it to 25 degrees. Don't microwave it.

42
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,844
Yes, ma'am.

43
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,098
You have beautiful legs.

44
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,102
Were you an athlete?

45
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,105
I used to ride horses.

46
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,232
I see. So you're muscular like a horse.

47
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,154
Should comments like these
be reserved for close friends?

48
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,573
You know what?

49
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,533
Let's have a drink tonight after work.

50
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,910
Let's take the time
to get to know each other.

51
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,829
Sure.

52
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,045
Is that brat Soo-hyuk ambitious

53
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,714
or just emotionless?

54
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,427
He's forced to marry a girl
he doesn't like, but not saying anything.

55
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,597
People are saying
that Father is faking his collapse.

56
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,602
There are people who are out to get us.

57
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,729
-You must behave.
-What do you mean?

58
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,024
Women, alcohol, gambling…

59
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,237
Just don't get caught.

60
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,364
Okay.

61
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:20,958
MOTHER EMMA

62
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,899
We should…

63
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,821
stop seeing each other.

64
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,419
We should…

65
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,173
stop…

66
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,635
seeing each other.

67
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,400
Hi-soo, I will meet with Mother Emma.

68
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,903
I will check my schedule
and let you know when I'm free.

69
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:36,826
Is it safe for me
to invite her to Cadenza?

70
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,915
Everyone in this family thinks
they are the center of the universe.

71
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,751
They don't care
about other people's schedules.

72
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:50,631
Isn't this amazing?

73
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,304
-I can't believe this.
-Look at this drawing.

74
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,972
It was done by a ten-year-old.

75
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,308
The child draws only
with pens and pencils.

76
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,395
And they drew the back of a clock
when asked to draw about time.

77
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,565
So all these artists have autism?

78
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,027
Yes. Why don't we do a joint project
with the Seoul branch? Please?

79
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,864
Let's make their dreams come true.

80
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:19,076
This exhibition deeply touched my heart.

81
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,704
I must do whatever I can
for the people who do that.

82
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,581
That's why I live with one of them.

83
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,708
I would love to.

84
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,462
But what about your sister-in-law,
the director of Seohyun Gallery?

85
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,382
If she finds out you're working with me,
she'll hate it.

86
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,843
I doubt that she's interested
in these exhibitions.

87
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,679
She mostly works
with famous international artists.

88
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,057
She's doing an exhibit with Demian Koons.

89
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,019
And she's very busy trying to launch
her multicultural complex.

90
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,773
It's a multicultural complex
with my name as its brand.

91
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,109
Both of them must be perfect
since those spaces are combined.

92
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,613
I see that you're finishing it up well.

93
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:56,656
Yes.

94
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,407
Why is the middle section empty?

95
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,325
Oh, there?

96
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,744
We left it vacant,
so we can plant some flowers.

97
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,372
-Take a look.
-Was that in the design?

98
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,415
-Right here.
-Right. Sorry about that.

99
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,545
I read this in the group chat
with other galleries.

100
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,048
The art exhibit of autistic kids
Ms. Seo is sponsoring

101
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,508
will be held at Hawon Gallery.

102
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,720
She can never see the bigger picture.

103
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,934
Reporters will call soon.
Tell them we have no comments.

104
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,018
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,326
IT'S OVER BETWEEN US NOW

106
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,453
I'M ON A CLIFF
AND NO ONE WILL LISTEN TO ME

107
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,290
MAID JOO MIN-SU

108
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,545
Hello?

109
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,673
Were you not informed that all the maids

110
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,300
must report to me
during lunchtime every Wednesday?

111
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:21,991
What's this about?

112
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,703
Ms. Kang Ja-kyeong?

113
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,123
Who was your last employer?

114
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:33,919
We are the foundation
and the artery of Hyowon.

115
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,381
We keep in close touch
and solve problems swiftly.

116
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,717
-And the people we serve--
-No.

117
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,927
Ha-joon is…

118
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,306
my only concern.

119
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,185
Do not call me about anything

120
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,270
other than that.

121
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,940
"Do not call me"?

122
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,901
Hey!

123
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,195
Get your head out of your ass!

124
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,989
Do not order me around!

125
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,702
How dare you?

126
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,248
Do not boss me around.

127
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,172
I must go and get
Ha-joon's study materials.

128
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,715
I will get going now.

129
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,347
What? That… Ha-joon…

130
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,100
What did she just say?

131
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:37,983
Who are you?

132
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,612
I'm Ha-joon's new tutor.

133
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,405
Wait.

134
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,080
Haven't we met before?

135
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,790
I don't think so.

136
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,212
Right.

137
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:02,508
How could we have met before?
We live in different worlds.

138
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,886
You just looked familiar.

139
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,222
Take good care of Ha-joon.

140
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,849
He's only half us,
so he needs a lot of help.

141
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,685
What does that mean?

142
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,979
You don't need to know. You can go.

143
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,321
The board will meet soon.

144
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,199
I can't stand Ji-yong
taking over the company.

145
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:31,579
But it is true that Ji-yong is
the right person for the job.

146
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:34,498
You want to give our company to the son

147
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,584
of Kim Mi-ja you hate so much?

148
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,043
Lower your voice.

149
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,631
I scheduled dinner with the girl

150
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,717
who's going to marry Soo-hyuk.

151
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,345
I should get them engaged first.

152
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,306
How many shares of Hyowon do they have?

153
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,019
Mom, don't tell me
that you're going to help Jin-ho.

154
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,400
Hello?

155
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,195
Our bread is being criticized online?

156
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,948
Where?

157
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,327
Hang up.

158
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,290
-What's wrong now?
-It's the bakery.

159
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,000
It's hopeless.

160
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,419
I should've gotten the hotel.
Why give it to Jin-ho?

161
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,546
Why did Dad give me
the one with so much work?

162
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,714
You fool.

163
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,927
Hey, your brother only has
three hotels in Korea.

164
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,096
And your bakery has 3,000 branches!
You fool.

165
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,476
Bring ten cream buns on your way back.

166
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,227
I'm craving sugar.

167
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,714
Don't cross it.

168
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,509
Don't cross the line.

169
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,054
I let you switch rooms with me,
not touch my things.

170
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,223
Don't touch my things.

171
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,657
SEARCH RESULTS FOR JUNG SEO-HYUN

172
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,077
JUNG SEO-HYEON OF SEOHYUN GALLERY
VOTED ONE OF 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE

173
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,255
Hello?

174
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:50,092
Hello. Ms. Seo told me
that you wanted to speak with me.

175
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,344
She urged me to give you a call.

176
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,345
Who is this?

177
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,347
This is Mother Emma.

178
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,852
Hello, Mother. This is Jung Seo-hyun.

179
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,562
Yes, I know.

180
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,107
Can I stop by your house today?

181
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,651
I told her I'd give her my schedule later.

182
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,947
I will be in the neighborhood anyway.
Let me stop by.

183
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,617
I thought it would be nice
to meet face to face.

184
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,911
Okay. Sure.

185
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,086
Hi-soo does whatever she wants.

186
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,301
Let's stop by McQinnis flower shop.

187
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,720
-What is this?
-Seriously?

188
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,722
-Unbelievable.
-I'm sorry.

189
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,600
-What is this?
-I can't believe they kicked us out.

190
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,108
Why is our cream bun
being criticized on social media?

191
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,527
You're not doing your job, are you?

192
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,946
Hey, answer me.

193
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,406
Did you lock the door?

194
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,658
Did you lock it,
so no customers can come in?

195
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,376
This one has too much cream.
This one has too little.

196
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,003
Is it supposed to be empty inside?

197
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,756
It's supposed to fall apart
when you gently touch it

198
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,219
and melt in your mouth. That's
what our pastry is supposed to be like.

199
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,138
But this feels like leather!

200
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,849
Did you even train your employees
properly? Did you?

201
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,019
Why are you pissing me off?

202
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,562
-Why?
-I'm sorry.

203
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,189
Why? Tell me!

204
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,802
Don't use a clear vase. Use a matte vase.

205
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,804
Use Master Ungsan's vase.

206
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,222
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,601
And Mother Emma is here to see you.

208
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,858
Apologize to her and ask her to come
again some other day. I'm too tired.

209
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,026
Yes, ma'am.

210
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,580
I'm sorry.

211
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,917
Ms. Jung is very exhausted.
She won't be able to meet with you today.

212
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,213
-Okay.
-Okay.

213
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,642
Well, would you like this, too?

214
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,978
I was eating them.

215
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,896
Right.

216
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,316
All right.

217
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,278
Thank you for these.

218
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,321
Sure.

219
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,625
Hi-soo.

220
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,794
I'm a bit hurt.

221
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,882
Why would you hold
such a meaningful exhibit at Hawon?

222
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,968
So you heard.

223
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,888
But it's not a major exhibition.

224
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,641
I'm renting the gallery for a few days
when it's available.

225
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,226
It won't be your style anyway.

226
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,478
Shouldn't you have
discussed that with me first?

227
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,606
To be honest…

228
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,525
I feared that you'd say no.

229
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,570
Did you weigh your desire to be
considerate of me

230
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:42,741
and the disappointment of rejection
before you decided?

231
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,286
No. I didn't weigh anything.

232
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,413
I'm not that sly.

233
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,624
That's exactly why I'm scolding you.

234
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,711
The moment this gets out,
the media will gossip about our family.

235
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,382
"Former Actress Seo Hi-soo Exhibits
Artworks of Autistic Children

236
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,509
at Another Gallery,
Not Her Sister-in-law's."

237
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,054
"Disputes Between Sisters-in-law,"
"Chairman Collapses, Who Will Take Over?"

238
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,309
Hi-soo.

239
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,771
-Did you want attention?
-Seo-hyun.

240
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,856
You are being too harsh.

241
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,192
You're reading too much into it.

242
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,819
I used to be an actress.

243
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,822
Attention?
I've had more than enough attention.

244
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:29,079
I will reflect on why my decision has hurt
your feelings this much.

245
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,622
I'll be off now.

246
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,090
Please stop taking this the wrong way.

247
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,745
Ms. Seo, would you like a ride?

248
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,540
I'm fine. I need to cool down
with some fresh air.

249
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,708
Okay.

250
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:44,112
They breathed in different air
and drank different water from us.

251
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,700
The oxygen saturation level of their air
was 15 times higher than ours.

252
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,995
And they drank water
from the glacier in Antarctica.

253
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,707
And let's do a lunge. One.

254
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,630
-Inhale and…
-Like the heavily concentrated oxygen,

255
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:05,342
the lives they must live
were heavy as well.

256
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,187
Of course,
their lives weren't equally heavy.

257
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,527
LOTTERY
500 MILLION WON

258
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,446
Does anyone even win this lottery?

259
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,726
Some of them

260
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,105
carried heavy secrets
like the air they breathe.

261
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:04,276
Diamond. My blue diamond.

262
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,154
The diamond.

263
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,947
My blue diamond.

264
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,533
And some behaved as if they breathed

265
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,995
in sulfurous acid gas
despite this extravagant air.

266
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:16,955
Damn it.

267
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,642
Is something stressing you out?

268
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,103
How did you know?

269
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,648
I read your old interview.
You jump rope when you're stressed.

270
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,525
That's right.

271
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,737
But you're a wife of a rich family now.

272
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,489
Shouldn't you do an exercise
that suits your class?

273
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,035
There's no class in exercising.
And how's such a wife supposed to act?

274
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,872
I won't lose myself. And that's
one of the hardest things to do here.

275
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,332
This is one of those things.

276
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,417
I love your swimsuit.

277
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:58,139
So you are going to sell all of the shares
you received from your father

278
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,476
and push ahead
with the new culture project?

279
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,355
Father, I do not want art and culture

280
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,691
to be enjoyed
only by the privileged class.

281
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:11,152
I'm not trying to run a business.
I want to create values.

282
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:15,115
And that will be
my business motto in the end.

283
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,926
What a beautiful thing

284
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,888
Is a sunny day

285
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:42,183
The air is serene…

286
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,900
We should…

287
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,779
stop seeing each other.

288
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,587
You are…

289
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,759
doing well now, right?

290
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,816
I'm curious.

291
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,944
I'm curious about you.

292
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,616
Can I ask you a personal question?

293
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,618
Yes.

294
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,538
Are you married?

295
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:48,833
No.

296
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,460
You've been in love, right?

297
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,087
Of course.

298
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,339
I loved him to death.

299
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,592
Yes. I've been in love.

300
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:01,596
Did you get over him?

301
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,555
No.

302
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,849
No matter how much time has passed,

303
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,352
I can't get over him.

304
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,396
Why did you two break up then?

305
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,357
I loved the sun when I had

306
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,984
wings that were bound to melt away.

307
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,403
I know this story.

308
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,197
The story of Icarus.

309
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,867
I think it's such a romantic story.

310
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,204
You're a cool girl. Cheers.

311
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,842
Do you think
your painful love still thinks about you?

312
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,637
I'm not sure.

313
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,348
Did you ever

314
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,768
regret falling in love?

315
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,398
I don't regret falling in love,

316
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,692
but if I were to go back,

317
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,903
I would make a different decision.

318
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,410
I won't ask more questions.

319
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,828
This is getting deep.

320
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,352
You drank.

321
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,315
I had a glass of wine with the new tutor.

322
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:40,487
Sleep in another room tonight, okay?

323
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,323
No.

324
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,450
I'll work after I tuck you in.

325
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,160
Gosh. That's not necessary.

326
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,517
Hi-soo.

327
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,145
Did you run a background check
on that new tutor?

328
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,523
I'm sure Seo-hyun vetted her properly.

329
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,440
Why worry?

330
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,487
Don't you think she's somewhat secretive?

331
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,532
Either she is or she isn't.
What do you mean by somewhat?

332
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,578
She showed up at Cadenza
when the maids were summoned yesterday.

333
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,957
She told the head maid
not to boss her around.

334
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,917
I got goosebumps.

335
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,711
She is a bit peculiar.

336
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,422
She seems free-spirited.

337
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,010
But don't tattle. It will become a habit.

338
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,554
I don't have such a habit.

339
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,389
Not you. Me.

340
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,850
When you tell me these things,

341
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,061
I want to ask you to do other things, too.

342
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:58,773
-Like what?
-Keep an eye on the tutor

343
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,692
and tell me if you find anything usual.

344
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,486
It makes me want to ask you to do that.

345
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,405
I want to do it for you.

346
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,492
You are so good
at reading between the lines.

347
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:16,416
Hi-soo. You're not wary of people at all.
You trust people too easily.

348
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,376
That's just how I lived my life.

349
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,921
I've never been seriously betrayed
by people.

350
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:27,010
Once I trusted someone,
they always changed to keep my trust.

351
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,020
-Would you like to come, too?
-Come where?

352
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,938
The eldest grandson of the family,

353
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,565
his fiancée is coming today.

354
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,234
You should take a look
with your sharp eyes.

355
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,278
The more opinions, the better.

356
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,033
She means to watch from afar.

357
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,952
It wasn't to sit at the table with her.

358
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,123
Let's go.

359
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,543
No. I will focus on my job.

360
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,107
When the guest arrives,

361
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,109
lower your head by 30 degrees.

362
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,321
Lead the guest to the house
by three steps and open the door.

363
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,405
Okay.

364
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,748
-This way, please.
-Okay. Thanks.

365
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,394
This way.

366
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,382
Ta-da. This is for you, Grandmother.

367
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,680
I personally asked a Japanese designer,
Eriko Matai.

368
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,599
This is gorgeous.

369
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,981
And this is for you, Mother.

370
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,945
It's vintage.
You must have won it at an auction.

371
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,113
That's right.

372
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:56,576
I know that you love wine, so I thought
you probably had all the good wine.

373
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,537
It's such a thoughtful gift. Thank you.

374
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,998
I'll put it in the center of our winery.

375
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,624
And this is for you.

376
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,964
My mother and I are both fans of you.

377
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,135
It's a fountain pen with the autograph
of Julianne Moore. I know you're her fan.

378
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,596
You didn't have to bring a present for me.

379
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,182
My gosh. I'm so touched. Thank you, A-rim.

380
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,770
And this is for you, Aunt.

381
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,648
It's a limited edition
from Gino's collection this season.

382
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:30,068
My gosh. This is a rarity.

383
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,866
I'm not sure if our dinner will
be as good as your presents,

384
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:37,992
but please enjoy.

385
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:42,205
Actually, being able to see Soo-hyuk
is a good enough present for me.

386
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,337
This must be new to you, Hi-soo.

387
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:54,300
You skipped an engagement ceremony.
You will be the first and the last person

388
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,761
to skip an engagement ceremony
in our family.

389
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,680
A spot on our family name.

390
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,850
It's not a spot on your family name,
but a legend.

391
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,145
Why tie each other down
unless you feel insecure?

392
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,147
Are they not that confident?

393
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:30,920
You're home, Ha-joon.

394
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,095
Ha-joon.

395
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,683
What's this poem about?

396
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,852
Did you write it?

397
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,937
I did write it, but…

398
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,898
Who said you could read it?

399
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,568
I didn't mean to,
but it was open on the desk.

400
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,403
Why did you write such things?

401
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,029
Is someone bullying you?

402
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:06,414
Is someone from school or this house

403
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,250
hurting you?

404
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,547
They are rap lyrics.

405
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,217
I like this rapper, Tanya.
They are from her new song.

406
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:21,512
I wrote them down to memorize them.
Writing them down helps.

407
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,890
IT'S OVER BETWEEN US NOW

408
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,808
I see.

409
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,810
Gosh. I was mistaken.

410
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,105
That's a relief.

411
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,163
Have you tried this before?

412
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,691
-The champagne sugar ball is so tasty.
-I'm glad you like it.

413
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,526
Did you first meet him in the States?

414
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,778
Yes.

415
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,239
We met at a chess club in Boston.

416
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,533
Soo-hyuk is a chess champion.

417
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,037
I didn't fall for him
because he's good at chess.

418
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,500
He didn't seem interested in me at all,
so I was attracted.

419
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,752
And I started having a crush on him.

420
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,921
My goodness.

421
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,132
Gosh. That's how men in this family are.

422
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,176
They're not interested in women.

423
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,015
You shouldn't do that to her again.

424
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,016
Okay.

425
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,104
Anyway, I'm full.

426
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,731
My doctor told me

427
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,651
I should walk around after a meal
if I want to live long.

428
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,278
Shall we all go for a walk?

429
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,115
-Women only.
-I'd like that.

430
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,826
I noticed that you have
such a lovely garden here.

431
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,079
Is it good?

432
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,127
Try this, too.

433
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:21,757
Good boy.

434
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,272
No-deok.

435
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,483
My gosh. My dear No-deok.

436
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:58,502
The new tutor seems
to genuinely care for Ha-joon.

437
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,429
Hey, it's me.

438
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,557
Hello, Mother. Did you sleep well?

439
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,977
You need to come over here right now.
I have to talk to you.

440
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,480
Okay. But let me have my breakfast first.

441
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,775
No, come over immediately!
Right this instant!

442
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,571
-What did she say?
-Well…

443
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,949
she told me to come right now,
but I said I would eat first.

444
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,620
Her anger level is at ten now,
but it'll be at eight after an hour.

445
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,955
Then go two hours later, so it's at six.

446
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,874
My gosh. No, you got it wrong.

447
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,959
If I do that, it will be at 15.

448
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,795
Oh, right. I get it.

449
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,837
Right?

450
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,256
Anyway, I wonder what it's about.

451
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,554
Hello?

452
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,766
What?

453
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,268
On the company bulletin board?

454
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,604
Jin-hee did what?

455
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,233
I think it's Jin-hee.

456
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,026
Yes, I think so.

457
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,945
-I'll get going now.
-Okay.

458
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,492
MS. HAN JIN-HEE,
ENOUGH WITH YOUR POWER TRIP

459
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,583
She dug her own grave.

460
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,876
Should I get the PR team?

461
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,044
No.

462
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:24,338
Don't.

463
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:41,981
The post was taken down from the board,
but the victim contacted a reporter.

464
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,152
Gosh, that brat. She did it this time.

465
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,613
JIN-HEE

466
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,453
Let her clean up her own mess.
It was bound to blow up at some point.

467
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,300
Everyone is dodging my calls!

468
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,186
What am I going to do?

469
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,901
You asshole!

470
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:49,131
I called her long ago.
What's taking her so long?

471
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,509
I'm sure she's on her way.

472
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,054
Mom, did you see the bulletin board?

473
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,264
What do I do?

474
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,476
Why won't Jin-ho and Mr. Choi
answer my calls?

475
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,772
-Did you want to see me?
-Good morning, ma'am.

476
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,691
You go out there and stop it.
You know what I mean, right?

477
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,612
Mother, this kind of power trip scandal
can't be covered up.

478
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,531
It requires an apology.

479
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,909
You should sincerely apologize
to the victim.

480
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,954
That jerk posted it online
and tipped off a reporter

481
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,455
to screw me over!

482
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,708
Why would I apologize to someone
who hates me this much?

483
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,378
How can he possibly like you?

484
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,004
He must feel wronged and enraged.

485
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:32,049
Why would he feel wronged?
He didn't do his job right.

486
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,177
You must treat people with respect.

487
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,138
How would you feel
if someone throws cream buns at you?

488
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,724
How dare anyone throw
cream buns at my daughter?

489
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:42,768
"How dare anyone"?

490
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:45,062
He's someone's beloved son
and father, too.

491
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,733
Fine. I'll just pay him.
Money will solve everything.

492
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,778
You go and meet the reporter.

493
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:55,698
-The reporter will only speak to you.
-Are you sure?

494
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,284
I will be breaking
one of the ten family rules.

495
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,245
I cannot have an interview
with any reporter.

496
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,413
My gosh.

497
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,584
Since when
did you obey our family rules so well?

498
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,006
Okay. I'll meet with the reporter,

499
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,342
although it won't resolve
the source of the problem.

500
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,512
Hey. You should resolve
the source of the problem.

501
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,056
I'm not the one who caused it.

502
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,892
You must fix this yourself
by apologizing to him.

503
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,644
I said I won't apologize.

504
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,271
-I won't.
-Jin-hee.

505
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:29,773
Please get some help.

506
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:33,402
If you keep this up,
you'll end up in prison, not a hospital.

507
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,112
-Hey!
-Hey!

508
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,449
You too, Mother.

509
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,117
You little…

510
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,457
You should behave.

511
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,967
Why does the reporter
want to meet with you?

512
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,683
I learned something
from my great sister-in-law yesterday.

513
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,228
She said I should take action
even if I'm scared of the results.

514
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,314
I'll meet with the reporter.

515
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,275
If not, it will be seen
as another power trip.

516
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,988
It's easier to decide
if you put yourself in their shoes.

517
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,299
Let's begin.

518
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,846
If you want to cover it up,
you must give me something big.

519
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,891
I'm not planning to do that.

520
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:52,564
I came here to find out
why you wanted to meet with me.

521
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,149
I see.

522
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:58,195
Actually, Hyowon's PR team forbade us
to ask about this.

523
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,782
It's about your son.

524
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,993
You've been married for six years,

525
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,455
but rumor has it
that you have an eight-year-old son.

526
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,333
So that's what you want.

527
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,628
You wanted to meet with me
to trade me the story for the scandal.

528
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,047
I can cover it up
if you let me run your story.

529
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,052
Is your son eight years old?

530
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,938
Yes, he is.

531
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,109
I've been married for six years,

532
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,070
but my son is eight years old.

533
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,073
Do you have a child?

534
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,783
Yes.

535
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,536
My son lost his birth mother
when he was 18 months old.

536
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,039
Then, he met his true mother

537
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:56,003
and has been living happily for six years.

538
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,217
He might know
that I am not his birth mother,

539
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,306
but we care for each other
to the point that blood does not matter.

540
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,016
But…

541
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,145
let's say this story ends up
in the papers…

542
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:20,152
Did you even consider the pain
he will have to go through?

543
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,578
What would you feel and do
if he were your own son?

544
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,957
Publish the cream bun story all you want.

545
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,002
Rich people must learn
power trips aren't acceptable.

546
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,254
That kind of behavior is outdated.

547
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,277
Mother Emma's coming.

548
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,656
She will be arriving at Rubato
in two minutes. Over.

549
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:09,785
Are you religious?

550
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,332
Yes. I guess you can say that.
I'm a fan of Jesus.

551
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,879
But food-wise, temples serve better food.

552
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,298
It's healthy. It's mostly vegetables.

553
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,384
I don't go to church though.

554
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:29,638
I speak directly to Jesus.
We have a hotline between us.

555
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:35,727
I just think that churches take
too much commission for our communication.

556
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,440
Right?

557
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,986
You are quite funny.

558
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,447
How is it working here? Is it fun?

559
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,158
Are you a nun because it's fun?

560
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,454
Jobs are never fun for anyone.

561
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,342
You must have been heartbroken.

562
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,933
By the way, how did you meet Ji-yong?

563
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,061
I was traveling in England.

564
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,357
Welcome. Are you alone?

565
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,317
Please sit.

566
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,527
I won an award at a film festival.

567
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,321
I felt like I achieved everything.

568
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,324
But my life felt so meaningless
at that time.

569
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,077
I was also tired from the pressure
and people's attention.

570
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,498
That's where I met him for the first time.

571
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,770
I really had no idea who he was
and who his family was.

572
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,065
He said that
he was a poor international student.

573
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:08,487
In fact, he was working
at some bookstore in London.

574
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:14,242
I went there every day and bought
so many English books I would never read.

575
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,915
Do you know what I decided then?

576
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,084
"Fine…

577
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:26,421
I'll marry him and provide for him."

578
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:39,267
But after marrying him,
people treated me and my accomplishments

579
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,980
like they were nothing.

580
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,151
I gave up going to college
for my acting career,

581
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,320
but it came back as one of my flaws.

582
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,367
Everything I had achieved on my own

583
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,829
was ignored as if they were nothing.

584
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,498
What did you do with the stone
they threw at you?

585
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,584
I caught the stone like a catcher

586
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,004
and threw it right back at the people
who threw it at me.

587
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,881
It fell right before their toes.

588
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,636
Good job.

589
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,894
Do you truly love your husband?

590
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,438
Of course.

591
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,568
How could I not love that man?

592
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,655
He used his entire body as a shield
to protect me,

593
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,492
and he used his entire soul as a sword
to fight for me.

594
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,328
I mean the world to him.

595
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:44,541
When I'm happy, he's happy.

596
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,587
When I'm sad, he is, too.

597
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:34,549
Did she beat you?

598
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,802
I want to live a decent life.

599
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,597
Same here.

600
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:42,849
Gosh, no.

601
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,810
You're not supposed to drink.

602
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,603
Stop drinking.

603
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,938
You're a mean drunk.

604
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,773
What's wrong with that?

605
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,691
What's gotten into you?

606
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:53,860
I didn't know I'd end up like this.

607
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,864
I had no idea that I would suffer
from this endless inferiority complex.

608
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,326
I'm always being compared to Ji-yong.

609
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,662
You don't know how it feels.

610
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,707
And I can feel
the directors look down on me at work.

611
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,750
Jin-ho.

612
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,002
Damn it. That's such a shitty feeling.

613
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:14,256
I'm not in the mood
to listen to your sob story.

614
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,675
I came here to talk about me.

615
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,301
Please…

616
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,597
help me divorce your sister.
I'm begging you.

617
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,351
She likes you.

618
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,187
Don't divorce her, you punk.

619
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,775
Jin-hee and I…

620
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,115
were never loved growing up.

621
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,538
Gosh. What's wrong with you?
Come on, don't cry.

622
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,041
I hate self-pity.

623
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,050
My first wife abandoned me.

624
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:04,306
She must have hated me so much
that she even left her own child.

625
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:12,314
I'm going through what your first wife
must have gone through.

626
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,942
Exactly. So don't leave my sister.

627
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,402
If you leave her,

628
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,448
she'll turn over a new leaf
just like I did.

629
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,826
She'll be a new person.

630
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:28,747
That doesn't make sense at all.

631
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:33,543
That means I should divorce her
to make her turn over a new leaf.

632
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,545
You're right.

633
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,840
That is true.

634
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,302
But don't divorce her.

635
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,763
What do you want me to do, then?

636
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:21,466
Ms. Seo must be tired. She's resting now.

637
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,680
And Ha-joon is ready to go to bed now.

638
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,224
Okay.

639
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,143
Is there…

640
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,564
anything I can do for you?

641
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,243
I'm fine.

642
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,704
All right.

643
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,414
Good night.

644
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,679
We're home.

645
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,396
Gosh.

646
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,275
Jin-ho.

647
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,317
Jin-ho.

648
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:24,946
We're almost there.

649
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,794
Hey, Jung Seo-hyun.

650
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:45,508
Your husband is home.
Don't just stand there!

651
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,678
I'm sorry.

652
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,265
I should have stopped him from drinking.

653
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,874
Jung Seo-hyun.

654
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:20,752
You…

655
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:24,422
Don't look down on me!

656
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,010
I'm fine. Go home.

657
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,012
Okay.

658
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,933
My goodness. He startled me.

659
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,491
My gosh.

660
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,451
Sir.

661
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,703
Sir.

662
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,291
Please wake up. Everyone is sleeping now.

663
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,590
You must get up on your own.

664
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,634
Okay?

665
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,060
-On three!
-On three!

666
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,979
-Lift him.
-Go upstairs.

667
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:26,980
Go!

668
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,982
-No.
-My goodness.

669
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,192
-Go to the guest room.
-To the guest room?

670
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,111
-One, two, three.
-Get up.

671
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,533
-Lift the front.
-Okay.

672
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,994
-Come on, pull it up.
-My gosh. My back hurts.

673
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,620
-Wait.
-Oh, my back.

674
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,041
Goodness.

675
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,752
Ms. Jung handpicked this vase.

676
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:55,216
Once you get to know their stories,
you end up pitying them.

677
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,426
Forget it.

678
00:59:56,509 --> 01:00:00,221
We're the most pitiful
for having to clean up after them.

679
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:06,561
By the way, is Ha-joon's birth mom

680
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:08,313
really dead?

681
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:10,607
-Yes. She died in a car accident.
-Gosh.

682
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:12,692
That poor woman.

683
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,485
Does Ms. Seo know about it?

684
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,237
Of course.

685
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,073
That's why she loves
and cherishes Ha-joon even more.

686
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,909
Because he'll never see
his birth mom again.

687
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,078
I feel worse for Soo-hyuk.

688
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,706
Ha-joon can't see his mom
because she's dead,

689
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:30,043
but Soo-hyuk can't see his mom
even when she's alive.

690
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:32,629
Right.

691
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,299
Don't touch my things.

692
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:41,220
I feel awful for everyone in this family.

693
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,766
Why do you keep pitying these rich people?

694
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,225
I pity you even more.

695
01:00:58,029 --> 01:00:59,072
Sister.

696
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,534
Relax and close your eyes.

697
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,667
Imagine that your heart is a closet

698
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,753
and open that closet.

699
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:56,587
You must open it.

700
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,856
What do you see inside?

701
01:03:31,015 --> 01:03:37,897
That day, Ms. Jung took off
the heavy mask she had been wearing.

702
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,149
Let's switch rooms.

703
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,653
No, I can't do that anymore.

704
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:32,451
I had a good night's sleep
for the first time in your room.

705
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:36,914
Let me sleep here.

706
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,418
No, sir.

707
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:50,386
Please.

708
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,774
This is the last time.

709
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:06,944
-I can't promise you that.
-Hey.

710
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,323
Do you think I'm a joke?

711
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,410
No. Not at all.

712
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:40,598
My gosh!

713
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:44,769
You're still up.

714
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,063
I wanted to check if Ha-joon was asleep.

715
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:52,651
Thank you, but his mom ought to kiss him
good night. You should go to bed.

716
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,005
Yes.

717
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,092
That's correct.

718
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:18,969
That's what I decided.

719
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,305
Please support my decision.

720
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:24,767
Yes.

721
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:43,220
SPECIAL THANKS TO HONG SONG-WON

722
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,904
Ha-joon's been strange lately.

723
01:09:59,987 --> 01:10:01,739
He won't talk to me.

724
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:04,116
Don't worry too much.
We have Ms. Kang now.

725
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,285
What makes you say that?

726
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:08,787
What are you doing here at this hour?

727
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:11,832
Is there a reason
we should keep this a secret?

728
01:10:11,916 --> 01:10:15,544
Having been at the center of controversy
for throwing a cream bun…

729
01:10:15,628 --> 01:10:17,046
This is all because of her.

730
01:10:17,129 --> 01:10:18,547
Why did she do that?

731
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:20,299
Were you like this
at your previous job too?

732
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,928
You are just an employee.

733
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:25,304
Get a hold of yourself
and don't cross the line!

734
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:29,391
