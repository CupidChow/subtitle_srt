1
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,054
No…

2
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,659
Seong-tae…

3
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,661
Go get Seong-tae.

4
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,727
I'm leaving Hyowon.

5
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,828
It won't be easy.

6
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,205
I'm not leaving
because it's the easy way out.

7
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,709
I'm leaving no matter what.

8
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:33,463
For Ha-joon

9
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,340
and me.

10
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,887
I want us to leave without getting hurt.

11
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:45,391
I'll help you do that by your side.

12
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,355
Don't forget that I'm on your side.

13
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,607
I'll help you…

14
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,151
do whatever you want to.

15
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,447
I will take Ha-joon with me…

16
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,369
and find a way to get over the high wall…

17
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,372
surrounding this place.

18
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,124
I will tell you…

19
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,544
how…

20
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,090
you can do that.

21
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:42,407
EPISODE 8
HOW AN ELEPHANT GETS THROUGH A DOOR

22
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,956
What is it?

23
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,458
You don't want to let go of the position?

24
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,960
What did you say, you jerk?

25
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,507
Did you use me as leverage,
so you can take my place?

26
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,051
Why did you let me become the president
to begin with?

27
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,346
Answer my questions.

28
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,892
You shouldn't have wasted your chance.

29
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:14,480
Father trained you with the best education
and prepared you early on to take over.

30
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,233
He pushed you harder when I was born…

31
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,236
in case I was more capable than you.

32
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,031
Because he really didn't want that.

33
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,451
That's why he made me go
to college in Korea.

34
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,162
I went to law school because of him too.

35
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,166
Though I did study in England
out of my own will after graduating.

36
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,917
What the hell are you talking about?

37
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,087
You know how he favored you over me.

38
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,423
How so?

39
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,467
Have you ever been scolded by him?

40
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,720
He always complimented you.
He did nothing but encourage you.

41
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:49,182
He always beat me up out of frustration
and compared me to you.

42
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,100
Did you know…

43
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:54,437
I envied you whenever you got scolded?

44
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,730
What?

45
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,441
I wanted nothing but to get scolded
by Father just once.

46
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,444
You might not understand,

47
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,781
but being able to do
whatever you want in life

48
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,491
is a privilege.

49
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,828
Not everyone gets to rebel against
or cross their parents.

50
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:15,333
Kids who think their parents might
leave them can't get in trouble.

51
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,459
Why?

52
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,921
They're scared of losing
any affection their parents might have.

53
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,047
Gosh.

54
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,094
In any case, answer me.

55
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,764
Why did you let me become the president?

56
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,642
I thought I should at least
give you a chance.

57
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,521
Father wouldn't want me
to become the president

58
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,232
while he's lying in the hospital.

59
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,399
That…

60
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,612
would be disrespectful
to the man who raised me.

61
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,198
-What?
-The board members told me

62
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,325
that you shouldn't be the president.

63
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,704
They said your back is too weak
to carry the weight of the company.

64
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,750
When Father wakes up,
he will have to accept that.

65
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,212
I gave you a chance to tell me the truth.

66
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,672
Why are you lying to me?

67
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:06,134
I heard you made me the president…

68
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,472
in exchange for bringing in
Ha-joon's birth mother.

69
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,520
Mother never keeps her promises.

70
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,023
She wasn't supposed to tell anyone.

71
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,537
If that was the deal,
you shouldn't bring me down.

72
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,247
You shouldn't oust me now.

73
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,499
You broke your promise first.

74
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,043
I kept my end of the bargain with Mother.

75
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,255
Keeping that position is
up to you and Mother.

76
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,424
And you're the one who failed.

77
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,968
Does your wife know?

78
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,514
Does she know that you deliberately
brought in Ha-joon's birth mother?

79
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,684
If you oust me from my position,

80
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,188
I'll tell your wife, you bastard.

81
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,107
This is why you will never succeed.

82
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,862
Do you think she'll believe what you say?
You of all people?

83
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,115
She'll only think
that you made it up because

84
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,409
you were livid about losing
your position to me.

85
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,328
That's the reputation you've built.

86
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,872
No one finds you trustworthy.

87
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,544
Now, you lost me too.

88
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,006
That's no way to treat your brother.

89
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,140
I…

90
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,560
don't want to get ousted.

91
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,029
Is that so?

92
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,281
You want to keep your seat?

93
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:54,992
Then…

94
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,538
kill me.

95
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,305
Do you think Jin-ho can keep
his position as president?

96
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,100
-What?
-You've been completely fooled.

97
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,518
What…

98
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,563
Does Hi-soo know about this?
Did you tell her?

99
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,023
Yes.

100
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,823
Ji-yong cannot find out
that you were the one who told Hi-soo

101
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,075
the truth.

102
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,660
Of course not.

103
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,038
But he's bound to find out.

104
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,957
Hi-soo won't let it slide.

105
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,876
If you were worried about that,
how could you tell her that?

106
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,420
And she's with child!

107
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,214
She barged in and demanded the truth.
What could I do?

108
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,469
Mother.

109
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,346
You need to learn to hold your tongue.

110
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,350
And you should read a textbook
on ethics for middle schoolers

111
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,935
if you have nothing better to do.

112
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,566
Hey, how could you be so mean?

113
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,913
What should I do?

114
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,849
Mr. Kim?

115
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,143
Where have you been?

116
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,561
Seong-tae.

117
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,565
You didn't see or hear anything today.

118
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,400
Okay?

119
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,319
Yes, ma'am.

120
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,700
I had an errand to run.

121
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:02,662
What errand needs you
to take Ms. Seo's car?

122
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,163
Did you get her permission?

123
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,790
Of course.

124
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:09,877
This…

125
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,170
-You can go now.
-Okay.

126
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,453
You want to keep your seat?

127
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,581
Then, kill me.

128
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,588
When you signed
your labor contract with us,

129
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,340
did you read the contract carefully?

130
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,092
Pardon? No.

131
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,095
I mean, yes.

132
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,806
You're forbidden from telling anyone

133
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,059
about anything that happens
in the mansion.

134
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:11,230
You know it's in the contract, right?

135
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,356
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,861
"As authoritative interpretations cannot
be made for events in the mansion,

137
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,697
you cannot interpret the events yourself."

138
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,574
That's the exact term.

139
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,286
Read that clause one more time
before you go to sleep.

140
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,747
Understood?

141
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,332
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,674
I know it's hard to be the only guy
in a group of women.

143
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:39,800
Thank you.

144
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,722
You can go.

145
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,806
Yes, ma'am.

146
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,414
Ms. Seo.

147
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,833
You have to eat something.

148
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,211
Do you have any cravings?

149
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,838
My baby is gone…

150
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,469
but why do I still crave Jonathan apples?

151
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,764
I thought

152
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,184
they were what my baby craved.

153
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,483
I guess it was just me.

154
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,236
Yu-yeon.

155
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,739
Can you go home and look after Ha-joon?

156
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,115
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,785
I'll look after him.

158
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:51,497
And I'll bring some cosmetics
and other necessities for you.

159
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,582
Thanks.

160
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,423
I'll get going then.

161
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,201
It's me. Please take good care of
my sister-in-law.

162
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,163
I'm sure you know
why I brought her to you.

163
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,917
Of course.

164
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,544
And doctor,

165
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,881
I want to increase
my donation to the pediatric ward.

166
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,675
Let's discuss it in person.

167
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,801
Okay.

168
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,439
MY LOVE

169
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,219
Ji-yong.

170
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,185
You shouldn't have been born.

171
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,833
I will take Ha-joon with me…

172
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,795
and find a way to get over the high wall
surrounding this place.

173
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,421
It won't be easy.

174
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,591
They'll all try to stop you
from getting what you want.

175
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,529
Where is Hi-soo? I don't see her.

176
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,949
She went to her mother's house.

177
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,911
Her mother is in San Francisco
at my brother-in-law's place.

178
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,123
She went to her mother's house
when no one is there?

179
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
Her morning sickness is severe.

180
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,669
And staying here is hard for her.

181
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,549
Why don't you leave her alone for a while?

182
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,135
She's in the early stage of pregnancy.

183
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,847
With all the hormonal changes,
she's quite sensitive.

184
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,575
So everyone started to tell lies.

185
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,996
They started to lie not for themselves,

186
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,582
but for others.

187
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,585
And these lies began to grow.

188
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,713
Yu-yeon.

189
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,757
Are you going home now, Soo-young?

190
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,177
I can't reach Hi-soo.
Do you know where she is?

191
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,848
This has never happened with her.

192
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,642
And she's pregnant so I'm worried.

193
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,479
Ms. Kim.

194
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,273
She didn't tell me…

195
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,193
or Soo-young.

196
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,446
She only told you before she left?

197
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,116
Do you expect me to believe that?

198
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,578
She discussed it with me.

199
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,501
If you find out, Ha-joon will too.

200
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,586
She wanted to go quietly,

201
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,254
so I let her.

202
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,048
Without telling me?

203
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,674
Put yourself in her shoes.

204
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,176
If you were Hi-soo,

205
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,011
would you have told yourself?

206
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,515
We're not alone here. This is enough.

207
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,437
Go your way.
The lights will be turned off soon.

208
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,490
Wait until Hi-soo makes her decision.

209
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:41,078
Don't even think about doing anything.

210
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,580
Be quiet as the dead.

211
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,378
I guess you're not scared of me.

212
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,172
If you keep provoking me,

213
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,758
I don't know what I'll do.

214
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,095
I'm not scared. Take your best shot.

215
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:10,274
"You cannot tell anyone
about anything that happens.

216
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,610
As authoritative interpretations cannot
be made for events in the mansion,

217
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,696
you cannot interpret the events yourself.

218
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,614
If you disclose any information,

219
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,117
you are to return all of…"

220
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,957
Oh, my God!

221
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,377
What are you doing?

222
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,963
The contract…

223
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,921
I know everything.

224
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,133
-What do you mean?
-What you did.

225
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,220
-Pardon?
-You sure dream big.

226
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,514
You stole the blue diamond.

227
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,810
Don't worry.
I won't report it to the police.

228
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,979
-It's a hassle.
-I'm so sorry, sir.

229
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,815
-Do you mean that?
-Yes.

230
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,234
Aren't you at Rubato now?

231
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:36,860
Yes.

232
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,323
Then,

233
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,826
watch Ji-yong's every move
and report back to me.

234
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,996
-Pardon?
-Why do you look so surprised?

235
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,709
"You cannot tell anyone
about anything that happens.

236
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,879
As authoritative interpretations cannot
be made for events in the mansion,

237
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,090
you cannot interpret the events yourself."

238
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,717
That's what it says in my contract.

239
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,096
Are you telling me to violate the clause?

240
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,473
I'm not just anyone.

241
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,433
Based on my authoritative interpretation,

242
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,645
Mr. Han Ji-yong
might consider you as such.

243
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,813
You're so smart.

244
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,108
You're quite smart for a thief.

245
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,070
Does it say in your contract
that you should steal diamonds?

246
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,446
Of course not.

247
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,739
But you stole one.

248
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,660
Don't bullshit me with the contract.

249
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:31,290
Watch his every move and keep me updated.

250
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:36,211
Go through the drawers in his study also.
And if you find anything,

251
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,463
I'll give you a big reward.

252
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,133
Understood?

253
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,843
And it's a secret between us.

254
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,470
Another secret?

255
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,519
I love this place.

256
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,146
I should come here often.

257
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:57,691
When I call you, this will be our spot.

258
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,942
Yes, sir.

259
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,947
-You should give me my clothes first.
-Right.

260
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:33,393
You think you're the control tower
of this family, don't you?

261
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,899
So you think you know everything
that's going on in this family, right?

262
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:44,029
Well, is that really true?

263
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,032
Get to the point before the tea gets cold.

264
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,910
Don't be too shocked.

265
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,121
Ha-joon's birth mother…

266
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,041
She's not dead. She's alive.

267
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,543
Isn't this shocking?

268
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,295
Do you know where she is?

269
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,715
-I do.
-You do?

270
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,258
Why didn't you tell me, then?

271
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,553
You don't even know the things
that you should be aware of.

272
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,138
Why must I tell you about that?

273
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,016
Compared to Ji-yong,

274
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,812
I'm very innocent. I'm an open book.

275
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:20,148
Can you change your mind about me?

276
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,487
How could he deceive us
for all these years?

277
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,745
You're not keeping a shocking secret
like that from me, are you?

278
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,875
Are you having…

279
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,295
an affair?

280
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,884
What am I thinking? Of course, you're not.

281
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:16,788
MY LOVE, HAN JI-YONG
7 MISSED CALLS

282
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,721
Say hello to Grandma.

283
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,976
Please drop him off at school.
I'll pick him up later.

284
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,978
-Okay. Let's go.
-Bye.

285
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,703
Gosh. You look great in purple.

286
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,349
You didn't

287
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,060
tell Hi-soo anything, did you?

288
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,688
Gosh. Why would I tell her anything?

289
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,860
But you're not keeping your promise.

290
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,862
What promise?

291
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,324
You promised to help Jin-ho

292
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,661
become the president if I stayed silent.

293
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,206
I kept my silence, so how could you

294
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,250
not make good on your promise?

295
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:27,711
I made such a promise to you?

296
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,172
I came here and told you that day

297
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,301
that I didn't want the position,
so I'd support Jin-ho.

298
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,928
So you thanked me for my support.

299
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,266
I want to make you happy as best I can.

300
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,686
But that's what the board decided.
What could I do?

301
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,313
Ji-yong.

302
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,025
What on earth are you talking about?

303
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,111
You can't do this to me.

304
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:56,656
You were the one who told us
that she was dead when she was alive.

305
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,575
But she came back,

306
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,995
and the fact that she was alive and
around us must've made you anxious

307
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,789
because she'd expose your lies.

308
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,125
So you wanted to keep it a secret
from Hi-soo.

309
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,586
Mother.

310
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,421
The past has no power.

311
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,507
But this is different.

312
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,676
-What…
-Why did you do it?

313
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,596
You didn't have to do that to Hye-jin.

314
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,183
Goodness. You…

315
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:27,187
You were the one who wanted
to tell everyone she was dead. It was you!

316
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,355
Mother!

317
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,815
-Are you unwell?
-What?

318
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:36,446
Let's get you tested for dementia.
I'll talk to Dr. Kim today.

319
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:39,324
My goodness. What are you talking about?

320
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,576
How could you do this to me?

321
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,081
Ji-yong!

322
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,000
Hey! You're unbelievable.

323
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,837
You… Oh, my. I don't believe this.

324
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,172
You!

325
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,550
Why are you doing this?

326
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,511
Goodness. Unbelievable.

327
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,520
I'll get engaged.

328
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,190
Let's have the ceremony
before I change my mind.

329
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,526
We should meet her family.

330
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,694
That's what engaged people do.

331
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,301
Go through the drawers in his study also.
And if you find anything,

332
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,679
I'll give you a big reward.

333
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,024
PHOTOS

334
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,992
Hi.

335
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,621
I heard Hi-soo comes
to see you at this hour.

336
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,332
I came because
I thought you would be available.

337
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:37,544
Okay. What is it about?

338
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:41,506
It's about Hi-soo.
Could you please come with me?

339
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,154
She won't answer it.

340
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,615
She'll probably want to be alone.

341
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,537
I think we should…

342
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,081
leave her alone.

343
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,877
Her morning sickness is severe.

344
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,129
And staying here is hard for her.

345
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,089
Would you have told yourself?

346
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:26,885
Don't even think about doing anything.

347
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,387
Be quiet as the dead.

348
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,104
MY LOVE

349
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,623
HA-JOON'S TUTOR

350
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,335
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

351
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,503
Please leave a message after the beep.

352
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,196
You can go now. I want to be alone.

353
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,165
It's a meeting between families
so there isn't much to prepare.

354
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,167
Only close family members will be invited.

355
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,795
So just schedule it as soon as possible.

356
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,047
Okay.

357
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,849
Ma'am, the guests have arrived.
Should I escort them in?

358
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,518
Yes.

359
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:01,604
DIRECTOR JUNG SEO-HYUN

360
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,996
Come on!

361
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,456
He has his own fancy private bathroom.

362
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,250
Why is he using the public one?

363
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,419
Exactly. It's our day to use the bath.

364
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,213
Gosh. He's been in there way too long.

365
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,174
But why is Seong-tae in there with him?

366
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:35,096
What are they doing together
in the bath? Gosh.

367
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:44,564
So did you find anything?

368
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,693
Poor thing.

369
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:53,031
What's up with the suspense?
This better be good,

370
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,824
or you'll get an earful from me.

371
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,034
This is ridiculous.

372
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,828
-Tell me already.
-Sir.

373
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,081
Mr. Han Ji-yong…

374
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,252
is gay.

375
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,506
-What?
-He's gay.

376
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,467
It must've been so tough on him.

377
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,469
What did you say?

378
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,388
He has a secret phone no one knows about.

379
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,892
And he has lots of photos of muscular men
on that phone.

380
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,144
Gosh, the photos…

381
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,448
I saw his elephant painting
at Hawon Gallery.

382
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,992
I was moved, so I bought it.

383
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,453
Thank you for appreciating it.

384
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,249
He's talented
and has a unique perspective.

385
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,837
I would like to sponsor him.

386
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,381
My gallery would like
to sponsor him financially

387
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:55,843
and exhibit his artworks,
so he can focus freely on his art.

388
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,431
My son is so lucky.

389
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,352
He's more talented than lucky.

390
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:09,774
As a matter of fact, fine art is trending.
His work is close to the essence of art

391
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:12,527
and he has a meaningful perspective.

392
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,320
I see.

393
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,574
The elephant stuck in the narrow door.

394
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,451
How can the elephant…

395
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,038
get through the narrow door?

396
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,630
I'm not asking you to draw it
as the gallery's director,

397
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,549
but as an individual.

398
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,301
I'll buy the drawing at the highest price.

399
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:47,186
How much time do you think you'll need?

400
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,153
I'm at my mother's house.

401
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,780
My morning sickness is awful.
I can't stand it.

402
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,285
Is my baby okay?

403
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,873
Yes, the baby is fine.

404
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,877
How long are you staying there?

405
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,845
-A week.
-A week.

406
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:55,338
2008 ACTING AWARDS
BEST ACTRESS, SEO HI-SOO

407
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,684
SEO HI-SOO'S FIRST MOVIE,
HER DAZZLING WINTER DAYS

408
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,408
FOCUS ON JEONG-EUN'S EMOTION!

409
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,536
THIS PART IS IMPORTANT!
DON'T YELL, STAY COMPOSED

410
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,626
"I'm not the same person
that I used to be.

411
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,212
Now that I know the whole truth…

412
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,008
how could I be the same?"

413
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,039
The doctor said
you should have seaweed soup.

414
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,958
Did I give birth?

415
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,961
I lost a baby.

416
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,673
I have no right to eat this.

417
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,301
And you have no right to be doing this.

418
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,262
You don't have anyone right now.

419
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:29,682
And you don't want…

420
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,727
anyone to see you like this.

421
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:49,535
ONE WEEK LATER

422
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,799
Ma'am.

423
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,553
The artist Suzy Choi
has asked to meet with you.

424
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,932
She says she will exhibit her works here
on the condition that you meet with her.

425
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,270
No.

426
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,773
Tell her I won't meet her.

427
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,152
Find another artist.
I don't think she's a good fit for us.

428
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,278
Yes, ma'am.

429
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,699
Hello, ma'am.

430
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,498
-Hi-soo.
-I'm back.

431
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,390
Mom!

432
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,228
How have you been, my son?

433
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,357
Mom, I missed you.

434
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,109
I missed you too.

435
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,236
The baby…

436
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,572
is okay, right?

437
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,325
I'll cook you braised ribs.

438
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,326
You're the best!

439
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,794
I missed you to death.

440
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:06,964
Me too.

441
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,758
Soo-young, can you get me some apples?

442
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,012
-I told you to buy some for me.
-Right.

443
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,430
Okay.

444
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,931
Still have morning sickness?

445
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,684
You keep asking for apples.
Do you think it's a girl?

446
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,935
Perhaps.

447
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:22,563
Let's go inside.

448
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:34,909
Hi-soo, the designer is here.

449
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,745
She said your maternity clothes are ready.

450
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:44,835
I brought the dresses we made
from the measurements

451
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,337
we took the other day.

452
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,548
Okay. I'll try them on.

453
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,425
Do you need assistance?

454
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,972
No. You can leave.

455
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,966
She was also…

456
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:36,136
an elephant stuck in a narrow door.

457
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:42,142
And she had to break down the door
at all costs.

458
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:48,315
But she had to be careful
not to hurt the baby elephant.

459
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,072
The board will meet tomorrow.

460
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,744
It was supposed to be last week,
but Ji-yong pushed it back.

461
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,873
Did he wait until Hi-soo came back,
so they could celebrate together?

462
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:11,463
Is there any way to turn the tables?

463
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,798
Soo-hyuk's fiancée.

464
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,010
If her family sides with us,

465
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,095
Ji-yong won't gain
a majority of the votes.

466
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,808
So even if he becomes president,
we can stop him from becoming chairman.

467
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,730
Soo-hyuk's your son.
Don't you hold any sway over him?

468
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,442
He listens to Ji-yong
more than his own father.

469
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,570
I mean, Ji-yong can win anyone over.

470
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,655
That's because they don't know
his true colors.

471
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,074
I must have taken in a monster.

472
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,786
He isn't human.

473
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:46,290
I had no idea he could be so heartless.

474
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,958
What are you talking about?

475
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,794
Fill me in, will you?

476
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:56,675
Ha-joon's tutor…

477
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,386
is his birth mother.

478
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,224
Who let her into the house?

479
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,726
Ji-yong did.

480
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:07,353
What?

481
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,856
Does Hi-soo know?

482
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:12,858
-No.
-Yes.

483
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,735
She does?

484
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,820
Yes, she does.

485
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,758
No way. How could he do such a thing?

486
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,511
His wife and ex in the same house?

487
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:43,180
Why didn't you drive here today?

488
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,307
Don't you know I'm banned from Cadenza?

489
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,434
They won't let my car in.

490
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,645
Then, why are you here?

491
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,231
Why do you care?

492
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,149
Right.

493
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,071
So scary.

494
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,990
People are the scariest of all.

495
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,618
Right.

496
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,750
He set up a whole bar in here.

497
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,259
Goodness.

498
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,846
How did you get in here?

499
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,348
There's a door behind the cabinet.

500
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,850
-What?
-And the passage leads

501
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,768
to the parking lot. Amazing, right?

502
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:30,686
Yes.

503
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:35,065
My father is so secretive and sly.

504
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,068
And Ji-yong has all of his qualities.

505
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,404
Can I leave through that door?

506
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,823
No. Only I can use that door.

507
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,700
You use that door.

508
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,410
You want me to come back here?

509
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,329
Of course. You must clean
and maintain this place.

510
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,115
Let's get a divorce.

511
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,077
You must think divorce will liberate you.

512
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,538
That won't happen.

513
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,831
You might end up with a woman
worse than me.

514
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,208
Don't jinx me.

515
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,794
Just beat me up instead.

516
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,463
Jung-do, I really want
to be a good wife to you.

517
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,050
Can you give me a chance?

518
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,221
Jin-hee.

519
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,099
Have you been…

520
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,394
-doing drugs?
-Drugs?

521
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,396
What drugs?

522
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,190
Yes. I take stomach meds because of you!

523
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,859
Did you seriously say that to me?

524
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:45,821
You. Don't chew with your mouth open.

525
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,114
It's disgusting! So nasty!

526
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,782
I don't want to hear you chew!

527
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,377
Are you done?

528
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,463
Should we go upstairs?

529
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,176
Good night.

530
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,940
The board will meet tomorrow
to appoint a new president.

531
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,401
I'll do what you want me to do.

532
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,571
I'll accept the position

533
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,325
so I can pass down the throne
to Ha-joon when he grows up.

534
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,077
I came to my senses after you scolded me.

535
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,083
But will it go as you planned?

536
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,421
Soo-hyuk is getting engaged
to Ms. Rho A-rim.

537
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,090
But then,

538
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,051
he's still young. Why worry about him?

539
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,056
About Ha-joon's former tutor…

540
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,853
I'm not talking about Ms. Kang.

541
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,398
The tutor before her. The one you fired.

542
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,734
-Yes.
-I spoke with her on the phone.

543
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:10,572
We need to find a new tutor,
and there's no one better than her for us.

544
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,575
Keep looking. Take your time with it.

545
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,618
But…

546
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,245
I still don't get it.

547
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:22,084
Why did you fire her so suddenly?

548
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,339
So Ms. Kang could…

549
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,216
No.

550
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,969
So Lee Hye-jin could move in here, right?

551
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:39,976
I was just speaking my mind.

552
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,104
It's all in the past anyway.

553
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,318
I'm going to forget everything
and start anew.

554
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,655
For myself and Ha-joon.

555
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,576
And for you.

556
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,705
I'll only think about the three of us.

557
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,709
I'm glad to hear that.

558
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,128
Let's forget everything.

559
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:10,632
Of course. We should.

560
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:16,805
By the way,

561
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:21,268
how did you get her to leave so easily?

562
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,106
She isn't someone who would
back away like that.

563
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,984
She's Ha-joon's birth mother.

564
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,445
It was for Ha-joon.

565
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,989
She did it for Ha-joon.

566
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,908
She's a mother, after all.

567
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:01,433
When is Hi-soo's baby due?

568
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:07,314
I'll check and let you know.
I haven't asked yet.

569
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,815
Take good care of her

570
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,693
until her pregnancy becomes stable.

571
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,070
Of course.

572
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,091
The guests have arrived.

573
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,812
It's been a while.

574
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,105
Hello.

575
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:04,371
I was surprised to hear
you wanted to have a meal so soon.

576
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,248
By the way, it was delicious.

577
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,415
It'd be nice

578
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,710
to switch our family chefs
from time to time.

579
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,839
Right. We only hire chefs

580
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:19,094
who have been approved
by our Hyowon Hotel.

581
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,221
So our food here is always delicious.

582
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,557
-I enjoyed the meal. I really did.
-Good.

583
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:26,184
Now that we finished eating,

584
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,187
I'll tell you why I asked us to meet.

585
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:34,359
People say marriage is not
between two people, but two families.

586
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:37,988
So I realized
the problem can only be resolved

587
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,115
when it's addressed to both families.

588
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,494
Faking my affection…

589
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,621
or hiding it.

590
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,081
I won't do that.

591
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,794
I won't go through with this.

592
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,466
I'm sorry, A-rim.

593
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,888
You…

594
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,183
If you leave like this, you get nothing.

595
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,272
Do what you want.

596
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,566
Because I'll do what I want.

597
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,594
We must get on good terms

598
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,096
with A-rim's family again.

599
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,140
Appeasing her family isn't the problem.

600
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,434
Soo-hyuk is.

601
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,603
Hey, can you do something?

602
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:56,858
You know he has to marry A-rim
so Jin-ho can become the chairman.

603
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:57,901
Please?

604
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,363
Seo-hyun.

605
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,700
We must help Jin-ho become the chairman.

606
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,744
I can't…

607
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:12,123
watch Mi-ja's son become
the chairman of Hyowon Group.

608
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,961
Never. I can't let that happen.

609
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,713
Ji-yong can't become the president.

610
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:22,926
Why not?

611
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,095
You got something on him?

612
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:32,727
So you're telling me that
my Jin-ho can keep his position, right?

613
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,354
Jin…

614
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,108
Where did Jin-ho go?

615
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,568
We should discuss a plan
to get out of this mess.

616
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,904
Where on earth did he go?

617
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,699
Ms. Joo, where did he go?

618
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:48,410
Did he start buying lottery tickets again?

619
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,828
No.

620
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,414
Is he hiding in an underground bunker
or something?

621
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,416
No. Of course not.

622
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,334
Well,

623
00:54:56,876 --> 00:55:00,880
he's been enjoying taking a bath
in the maids' tub recently.

624
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,968
Why in the world
is he taking a bath there?

625
00:55:05,051 --> 00:55:07,053
He has his own.

626
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,639
This is an important time for him.

627
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,933
Why would he do
something so silly like that?

628
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,184
I agree.

629
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,646
That's actually better. He won't
get in trouble outside the house at least.

630
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,319
Soo-hyuk, that brat.

631
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,948
I knew he would stab me
in the back one day.

632
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,158
It wasn't in the back.

633
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:31,453
That idiot. I'd kill him if I could.

634
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,912
I'm glad you held it in.

635
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,499
Patience makes you the winner.

636
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,503
What do you think of me?

637
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,092
I don't quite understand…

638
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,553
Have you gone mad?

639
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,806
Do you think I have
what it takes to become the chairman?

640
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,434
No, I don't.

641
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,312
If you did,

642
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:01,524
you wouldn't be rolling around
in the bath with me.

643
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,234
-"Roll around"?
-I mean,

644
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:07,697
I stole your family's expensive diamond,
but you're having me spy for you.

645
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,326
You expect people to change
but they don't.

646
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,982
How about we buy baby clothes tomorrow?

647
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,901
We can pick out a crib, too.

648
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,152
I already did.

649
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,531
I'm already decorating the nursery.

650
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,034
I wanted to surprise you,

651
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,747
so I've been decorating the nursery
without you knowing.

652
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,668
You want to pick out everything?

653
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,795
Let me do it with you.

654
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,339
I want our baby to have the best.

655
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:11,010
I hope it's a girl.
Some dads are crazy about their daughters.

656
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,846
I wanted to be one of them.

657
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,931
Just leave it to me.

658
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,477
I'll get going.

659
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,105
See you.

660
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,686
I LOVE YOU TWICE AS MUCH AS YESTERDAY

661
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,646
My goodness.

662
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,988
So you're not going to talk?

663
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,740
-Well, no.
-I see.

664
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,703
Where did you go

665
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,164
with Ms. Seo that night?

666
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:04,999
Come on.

667
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,378
What do you do…

668
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,882
with Mr. Han in the bath lately?

669
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,889
Should I tell Ms. Yang

670
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,641
that you stole the blue diamond?

671
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,143
The bath

672
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,603
or Ms. Seo.

673
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:28,439
Choose one. Let's trade secrets.

674
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:29,983
Which one?

675
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:33,987
The bath…

676
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:36,155
No. I'll tell you about Ms. Seo.

677
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,115
Good boy.

678
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,286
Ms. Seo…

679
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:45,790
lost her baby.

680
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,505
There was nothing…

681
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,426
but the narrow door?

682
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,765
It wasn't confined in the first place.

683
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,768
The wall was never there.

684
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:51,481
The elephant just thought it was there.

685
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,661
Yes.

686
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,333
I…

687
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:15,630
I was…

688
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:42,657
Before the board decides,

689
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,159
Mr. Choi Jin-yeong,

690
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:49,372
the chairman's legal advisor
and the leader of Hyowon's legal team,

691
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:53,960
will disclose the chairman's will
to the board members.

692
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:13,646
As the chairman had been fighting
a cerebrovascular disease for a long time,

693
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,692
he asked me to disclose his will

694
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:21,154
to both the family and the board

695
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,574
if he were to stay unconscious
for more than a month.

696
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:27,452
And I will submit his voice recording
to validate this.

697
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:41,484
Hello?

698
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,236
You should come over right now.

699
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,654
What's this about?

700
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,407
-Let's talk later if it's not urgent.
-Kang Ja-kyeong is here.

701
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,245
You should handle this matter yourself.

702
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:54,288
I'm on my way now.

703
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,709
How dare you come here?

704
01:05:29,216 --> 01:05:30,259
Get up.

705
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,180
-Give me back my son.
-What?

706
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,558
Give me back my son.

707
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:42,146
-Come out. We'll talk outside.
-Let go of me!

708
01:05:46,817 --> 01:05:48,986
I thought Hi-soo should know, too.

709
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:57,286
Hi-soo, I'm sorry.

710
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,748
Don't stay here.
You can't get stressed. I'll handle it.

711
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,376
I'm fine. I should know what's going on.

712
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,586
Why are you here?

713
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:06,963
To get Ha-joon back.

714
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:09,590
He's my son.

715
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:12,343
Have you gone mad? He's not your son!

716
01:06:12,426 --> 01:06:13,386
He's my son!

717
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:17,682
You're an awful dad.
And she's not his real mom.

718
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,268
Screw you.

719
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,731
-Get up.
-Let go.

720
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:27,400
-Let go of me.
-Get out!

721
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,402
Don't touch me!

722
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:40,871
Don't mess with me.

723
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,668
I'll kill anyone who tries to take
what's mine.

724
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,853
Death is an inevitable fate.

725
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:09,692
But our world is full of wrongful deaths.

726
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,029
What qualifies as a wrongful death?

727
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,282
Those with unknown reasons…

728
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,119
or misunderstandings.

729
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:53,129
Don't ask me anything and just wait.

730
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,213
I want to file a lawsuit.

731
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,966
The father is the second son
of Hyowon Group.

732
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:01,804
We can't let any more scandalous stories
about our family get out.

733
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:05,474
I think she asked for the day off
to spend time with the young master.

734
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,851
What are your true feelings?

735
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:09,395
-Why did you forgive me?
-Do you think I forgave you?

736
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,605
Is getting your son back really your goal?

737
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:13,649
It's not getting revenge on Han Ji-yong?

738
01:09:13,732 --> 01:09:15,151
Kill him!

739
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,194
Don't worry. I'm not going to lose.

740
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:21,282
