1
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,525
Don't leave.

2
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,533
-But you told me to leave.
-Don't.

3
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,035
There's something…

4
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,538
I need to know, so stay.

5
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,291
-Why must I do that?
-For Ha-joon.

6
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,377
Aren't you worried about him?

7
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,215
They crossed lines

8
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:32,759
and stepped into forbidden boundaries.

9
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,885
All right.

10
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,555
I'll remain here for now.

11
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,060
They were all headed toward a catastrophe.

12
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,109
Mr. Han Jin-ho hasn't been scratching off
scratch cards lately.

13
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,029
I wonder what he lives for these days.

14
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,032
He probably has a new woman.
He spent the night out yesterday.

15
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,495
In that sense, don't you think Ms. Jung

16
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,413
is one of a kind?

17
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,874
She's a born aristocrat.

18
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,668
If you think about it,

19
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,380
Mr. Han Ji-yong is indeed one of a kind.

20
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,549
He only has eyes for Ms. Seo.

21
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,717
He has an outstanding character.

22
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,927
But you know what?

23
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,764
There was another woman
before he met Ms. Seo.

24
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,308
-No way.
-The late mother of Ha-joon.

25
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:27,188
I wonder whether our young master
will follow suit in the end.

26
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,816
Marrying one woman and loving another?

27
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,193
It's a given for all men in this world.

28
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,653
They're not just two-timers.

29
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,990
The first one is their business partner.
The second is their wife.

30
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,575
The third is their true lover.

31
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,994
-I wish I could be one of their lovers.
-Me too.

32
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,956
And I wish I could be a two-timer.

33
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,208
Anything's possible if you have the money.

34
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,543
You come here.

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,731
Your grandmother invited me over
for breakfast.

36
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,191
-I see. Let's go.
-Okay.

37
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,739
-What is Mother doing?
-She's resting.

38
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,834
Poor girl.

39
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,840
She was my horseback riding coach.

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,760
And my horse trainer as well.

41
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,680
Do you think you know everything
about your husband?

42
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,726
Has it ever occurred to you that
you might've seen only what he showed?

43
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:50,563
That's it. The level of attachment.
It makes me uncomfortable.

44
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,317
Do you truly love Ha-joon?

45
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,069
She's just too much.

46
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,196
She's too attached to Ha-joon.

47
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,116
Then you think I should tell him
his birth mother is dead?

48
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,785
What if she's still alive?

49
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,928
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

50
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,979
We'll get going now.

51
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,404
This is the world I live in.

52
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,447
Does it look nice?

53
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,033
Yes.

54
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,245
You two look nice together.

55
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,060
What brings you here?

56
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,355
I have something to ask.

57
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,107
Let me go first.

58
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:33,041
I heard you were the one
who told Soo-hyuk where Yu-yeon was.

59
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,209
Why did you do it?

60
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,920
They seem to have feelings for each other.

61
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,630
Exactly.

62
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:41,299
He'll be engaged soon.

63
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,634
But is that what he wants?

64
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,719
What he wants?

65
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,558
Don't you know the more you have,
the less freedom you get?

66
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,019
You won't get to do things your way.

67
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,396
People think it's the other way around.

68
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,108
But that's how it is in this world.
You're the exception.

69
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,403
Do you think if you love someone,
you have to marry them?

70
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,031
Are you happy that you're married

71
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,866
to someone you love?

72
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,160
So far, I am.

73
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,870
I'm glad to hear that.

74
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:12,872
Seo-hyun…

75
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,540
I shouldn't have hired Yu-yeon.

76
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,001
There's someone else
that shouldn't have been hired.

77
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,922
Kang Ja-kyeong. Ha-joon's tutor.

78
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,217
How did she contact our family?

79
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,136
What do you mean?
I scouted her myself.

80
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,764
The madam of Iyeon Group
introduced her to me.

81
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,057
Iyeon Group?

82
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,020
I'd like to meet with her.

83
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,355
I can make that happen.

84
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,191
But may I ask what this is about?

85
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,737
That woman, Kang Ja-kyeong…

86
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,117
I'm suspicious of her.

87
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,035
Any proof?

88
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,622
No. It's just my sixth sense.

89
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,332
Sixth sense?

90
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,167
She's ominous…

91
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,296
as if she's hiding something big
behind a veil.

92
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,715
She's getting on my nerves.

93
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,842
Perhaps…

94
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,305
-Never mind.
-What is it?

95
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,475
I'll tell you when I'm sure.

96
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,603
Can you tell me--

97
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,190
I'd like to meet with the madam first.
There are some things I must know.

98
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,869
I've looked into Kang Ja-kyeong
like you asked me to.

99
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,620
Her résumé checks out.

100
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,999
She studied developmental psychology
at Goltcoast University,

101
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,626
has a mother and a younger sister,

102
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,545
and has never been married.

103
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,630
She is?

104
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,300
It was hard getting in here. Why quit now?

105
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,260
How do you know it was hard? I hired her.

106
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:27,590
EPISODE 5
THE SIXTH SENSE

107
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,600
Hello, ma'am.
I'm Jang Hye-yeong, the head maid.

108
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,018
Hello.

109
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,438
Our madam is currently abroad,
so let me help you instead.

110
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,816
She told me to let you know she'd like
to meet you in person next time.

111
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,610
Sure.

112
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,658
What are you curious about, ma'am?

113
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,912
Do you remember Ms. Kang Ja-kyeong?

114
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:00,540
-She used to tutor here.
-Of course.

115
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,252
She was abroad with the madam's daughters
for five years, then quit.

116
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,294
Five years?

117
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,630
The madam's first daughter
went abroad early.

118
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:12,468
She looked after her
from fifth to eighth grade.

119
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,763
She also looked after our madam's
second daughter at boarding school.

120
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,432
Then what about before she came here?

121
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,310
Do you know what she did?

122
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,355
She took care
of our madam's sister's children.

123
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,149
She worked there for more than six years.

124
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,027
After sending their young master
to middle school,

125
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,238
she came here to work for us.

126
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,157
Since this is such a discreet
and elite league,

127
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,744
we don't hire anyone
who can't be entirely vouched for.

128
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,373
She barely spent any time in Korea.

129
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,710
She was abroad for more than a decade.

130
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,295
She was there most of the time.

131
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,673
The children had a different tutor
when they were here.

132
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,177
I'm sorry, but may I see a photo of her
with the children?

133
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,679
One minute.

134
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,027
She was an excellent tutor.

135
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,280
The children listened to her
more than their own mother.

136
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,781
That's how good she was.

137
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,009
Right.

138
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,970
It can't be.

139
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,601
What was I thinking?

140
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,686
Ma'am, are you okay?

141
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,063
Should I drive you home?

142
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,273
No, please go with today's agenda.

143
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,358
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:48,541
Did you want to see me?

145
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,751
What did you mean earlier?

146
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,631
It's exactly what I said.

147
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,091
You guys look good together.

148
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,844
You're from the same world.

149
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,929
You look good together.

150
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,472
Do you…

151
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,975
really mean that?

152
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,436
-What do you want to know?
-Your true feelings.

153
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,985
-I don't want to tell you.
-Say it.

154
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,364
Tell me.

155
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,663
I think…

156
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,208
I like you.

157
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,637
Please move.

158
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,056
How am I supposed to take this?

159
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,101
You asked for the truth,
so I gave it to you.

160
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,687
Nothing will change.

161
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,440
We'll always live in different worlds.

162
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,401
And I won't ever be curious about yours.

163
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,487
After swaying me like that,

164
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,780
you say nothing will change?

165
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,620
How does it feel to be called
a young master at the age of 26?

166
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,624
How does it feel to not have to care about

167
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,876
things like minimum wage, bus fares,

168
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,378
student loan interest rates,
or phone bills?

169
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,131
I don't care about what's not mine.

170
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,592
I won't covet them either.

171
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,262
Don't be swayed
and keep living in your world.

172
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,807
That's what you need to do.

173
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,146
I'll take care of my feelings.

174
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,065
Don't mind me.

175
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,180
What is it?

176
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,517
I'm the one who fired her,

177
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,561
not your grandmother.

178
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,356
Didn't you know that I control everything

179
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,650
that goes on in this household?

180
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,068
How could you be so reckless?

181
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,403
Reckless?

182
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,323
You're the one
who's most reckless right now.

183
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,701
Do you want me to kick her out again?

184
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:12,870
I didn't think so.

185
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,290
Don't do anything foolish.
I'll be watching.

186
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,598
-Check and let me know right away.
-Yes, sir.

187
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,367
Hello, sir.

188
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,536
Can I get a cup of cappuccino?

189
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,789
Make it…

190
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,874
steaming hot.

191
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,633
So, at that moment,

192
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,471
you thought Ja-kyeong might be
Ha-joon's birth mother?

193
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,016
I know it sounds absurd,

194
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,354
but the thought crossed my mind
at that moment.

195
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,234
But after confirming her identity today,

196
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,070
I realized that I was being ridiculous.

197
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,280
But a part of me still feels anxious.

198
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,659
At times, the sixth sense is
more accurate than the others.

199
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,495
But many times, it's completely wrong.

200
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,958
How could Ha-joon's deceased mother
work at your house

201
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,876
as his tutor?

202
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,463
Because I thought…

203
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,342
maybe she was still alive.

204
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,554
Aren't I so weird?

205
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,475
That wouldn't be entirely impossible
for someone in that world, though.

206
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,854
Fabricating one's death

207
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,023
and disguising what's fake as real.

208
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,985
What's gotten into you?

209
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,822
I was expecting to get scolded
for being so absurd.

210
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,533
Think harder
and determine what's stranger.

211
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,535
I'm just not fond of her.

212
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:21,957
I don't like that she has something
in common with my husband's ex.

213
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,585
And her love for my son makes me anxious.

214
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,005
I hate myself for being suspicious.

215
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,631
There's nothing wrong with that.

216
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,052
Forcing blind faith onto someone
is more ridiculous.

217
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,262
The sooner you suspect, the better.

218
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,139
It'll prevent a bigger misfortune.

219
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,354
"The truth will set you free."

220
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,901
Search for the truth.

221
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,574
Talking to a new artist
took longer than expected.

222
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,409
I'm not late, am I?

223
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,702
You're right on time.

224
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:01,121
-Hello.
-Hello.

225
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,289
Did you hear?

226
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,833
About Hwang Geon-yong
of Laiza Hotel and his wife.

227
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,920
They had a late child recently.

228
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,381
But the baby didn't look like them,
so they took a DNA test.

229
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:14,093
And the tabloids reported about this,

230
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,761
so it's affecting their stocks.

231
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,431
Doctors nowadays have no sense of ethics.
How could they leak it?

232
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,767
But what was the result?

233
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,185
The baby is theirs for sure.

234
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,647
I knew it. She's not the type to cheat.

235
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:31,860
All right. Today's scripture
is from Isaiah chapter 40, verses 3 to 8.

236
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:32,986
-Okay.
-Okay.

237
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,115
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,787
Hello?

239
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,624
Soo-young, let's talk at home.

240
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
Bye.

241
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,563
-It's been a while, ma'am.
-It has.

242
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,732
You look just the same as you did
ten years ago, Mr. Kim.

243
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,317
You're flattering me.

244
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,236
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

245
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,280
It's about my brother-in-law.

246
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,115
Do you mean Mr. Han Ji-yong?

247
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:23,162
Do you remember the female coach
who taught him about eight years ago?

248
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,998
Eight years ago…

249
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,376
Are you talking about Ms. Lee Hye-jin?

250
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,130
Her name was Lee Hye-jin?

251
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,384
Do you happen to have a photo of her?

252
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,679
She quit after six months.

253
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,516
But we keep a record of our coaches,

254
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,809
so I'll look.

255
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,853
If you find it, please contact me directly

256
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,480
-instead of my secretary.
-Sure. I'll do that.

257
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,618
SENDER: MOTHER EMMA

258
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:08,123
Hello, Ms. Lee Hye-jin. I'm Mother Emma
from the Daoom Welfare Foundation.

259
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:17,132
Hello, Ms. Lee Hye-jin.
This is Mother Emma from Daoom.

260
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,476
I'm happy to inform you

261
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,479
that your precious donation has been used
in the following ways.

262
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,940
Thank you for your support.

263
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,693
I'd like to invite
all the members of Ilsin

264
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,780
who continue to encourage
and support our mothers

265
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,782
to a small luncheon.

266
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,619
Please come and grace the occasion
with your presence.

267
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,830
I would love to finally get to meet you.

268
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,465
LEE HYE-JIN

269
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,033
You knew I had Bible study.
What was the emergency?

270
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,828
Did Ha-joon go to his lacrosse lesson?

271
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,251
Look at this.

272
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,546
Ms. Kang gave it to him.

273
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,006
And?

274
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,383
Something felt odd,
so I convinced him to talk.

275
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,178
He said that she told him not to tell you.

276
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,994
-Go upstairs.
-Okay.

277
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,764
I heard you visited Iyeon Mansion.

278
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:34,644
The head maid and I used to be quite close
when I worked there.

279
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:35,896
I'm sure.

280
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,440
You worked there for five years.

281
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,278
What did you want to know?

282
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,947
Ask me.

283
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,493
Why did you go all the way there
instead of asking me?

284
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,536
I had to confirm it myself.

285
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,292
Ha-joon told me.

286
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,005
Thank you for keeping him safe.

287
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,632
I just did my job.

288
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,176
But shouldn't you have told me about it?

289
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,180
This is exactly why I can't trust you.

290
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,391
Fine. Maybe you couldn't tell me
out of guilt

291
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,727
for not protecting him properly.

292
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,109
But why did you give this to him?

293
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,612
Why can't you answer me?

294
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,532
It was for his sake.

295
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,201
I didn't want him to get hurt.

296
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,453
That necklace kept me safe

297
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,622
when I was riding horseback.

298
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,166
But why…

299
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,505
Why did you tell him
to keep this a secret?

300
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,676
Why did you tell him to do that?
Answer me this instant.

301
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,263
Because I knew you'd get emotional
about it just like this.

302
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,100
So you knew this was something
I'd get emotional about.

303
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,685
Of course.

304
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,273
Ha-joon is very different from other kids.

305
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,026
How is he so different?

306
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,903
I feel attached to him.

307
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,781
More to him…

308
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,284
than to others.

309
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,035
But why?

310
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,205
You feel the same way, don't you?

311
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,126
You're not his birth mother,
but you cherish him deeply.

312
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,461
He's…

313
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,547
so lovable.

314
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,132
That boy.

315
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,971
I crossed the line, ma'am.

316
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,931
I'll be more careful.

317
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,688
Do you know how it feels to hear someone
apologize for loving my son too much?

318
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,692
Please refrain
from making secrets with him.

319
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,904
That'll only make your bond more special.

320
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,822
Understood.

321
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,673
Hello.

322
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,761
-Did we get Julian Opie's work?
-Yes.

323
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,388
Then call Mr. Cho Gi-hyeon from NBK.

324
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:18,433
It's for his office building,
so check the walls and lighting.

325
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:23,063
Art Auction will set the starting bid for
Ed Valen's Gas Station at 350,000 dollars.

326
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,147
Will that be okay?

327
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,607
Tell them they can lower it.

328
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,068
But don't lower the price
on Lee Seung-ju's piece.

329
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,069
Yes, ma'am.

330
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:40,080
SPECIAL INVITATIONAL EXHIBITION
MEETING SUZY CHOI IN KOREA

331
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,520
You're home early.

332
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,905
There's something
I've always been curious about.

333
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,450
Why are you with me?

334
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,538
You don't care whether I become
the chairman or not.

335
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,623
And you don't love Soo-hyuk,

336
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,834
so it's not about maternal instincts.

337
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,169
You don't love me one bit.

338
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,171
So why do you live with me?

339
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,969
That's exactly why I'm still here.

340
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:38,972
If we get divorced,
everything that you just mentioned

341
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,849
will be known to the whole world.

342
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,184
Everything that should stay hidden

343
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,645
would be exposed if we separated.

344
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,819
Since we're on the subject…

345
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,322
Get drunk
and humiliate yourself once more,

346
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,615
and I'll send you to rehab.

347
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,286
As you know, I don't care
about you becoming the chairman.

348
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,913
This is the first and last time
I turn a blind eye.

349
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,790
Remember that.

350
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,253
We should also meet A-rim's family.

351
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,714
It wouldn't be right
for only his stepmom to show up.

352
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,592
He agreed to get engaged?

353
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:20,472
He has to. For your sake as well.

354
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,031
Ms. Han Jin-hee?

355
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,949
I'm Im Seong-su
from Shinilgan Entertainment News.

356
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,702
The manager of your bakery
wants to meet with us.

357
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,330
Right.

358
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,998
You're no longer in charge.

359
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,962
I won't meet with him under one condition.

360
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,591
Can you confirm the story
regarding Seo Hi-soo's son?

361
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,760
She's not his real mom, is she?

362
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,428
I know a few things,

363
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,057
but I can only write about it
if I get a tip-off from one of her people.

364
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,029
Hi-soo.

365
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,865
Are you waiting to have dinner
with your husband?

366
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,535
I guess.

367
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,245
Are you craving anything?

368
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,668
-Jonathan apples.
-Out of nowhere?

369
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,099
Hi-soo.

370
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,351
It's me.

371
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,271
Can you come over?

372
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,704
So?

373
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,831
Have you unveiled her?

374
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,624
I'm not sure.

375
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,545
It feels like
she has another veil over her.

376
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,506
Did you not get what you wanted
from Iyeon Mansion?

377
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,841
Explain in detail.

378
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,885
Seo-hyun.

379
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,890
Have you met Ha-joon's real mom?

380
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,018
The only thing I know is

381
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,104
that she was
Ji-yong's horseback riding coach.

382
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:36,691
Our mother-in-law is the only person
who has seen her.

383
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,401
What?

384
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,253
When Ji-yong was in the UK,
she came here with Ha-joon.

385
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:58,880
We were all taken aback.

386
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,510
Our mother-in-law forbade her
from entering the house.

387
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,846
None of us were even allowed to see her.

388
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,557
Wait. Why did she have to go that far?

389
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,019
Ha-joon was an illegitimate child.
She had to keep it a secret.

390
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,730
You know she'd gone through it once
and loathed it.

391
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,778
So until the DNA result came out,
she had her stay at our villa in Gwacheon.

392
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,032
No one knows what happened there
or who she was with

393
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,035
except for our mother-in-law.

394
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:36,209
I heard that the woman left Ha-joon here

395
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,338
and got into an accident not long after.

396
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,426
What do you think happened to her?

397
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,595
If that's what you want to find out,

398
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,389
our mother-in-law won't help you.

399
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,351
-Why not?
-Because it goes against family morals.

400
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,520
She won't want to revisit that.

401
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,691
Do you think she cut ties with her?

402
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,693
Or…

403
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,571
did that woman abandon Ha-joon?

404
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,997
I guess only Ha-joon's dead mother
would know the truth.

405
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,291
Probably.

406
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,167
I should get going.

407
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:19,210
Hi-soo.

408
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,636
Do you suspect

409
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,974
that Kang Ja-kyeong is
Ha-joon's birth mother?

410
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,717
Come inside.

411
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,033
Did I make you wait long?

412
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,701
No.

413
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,121
A Chocolate Old Fashioned for him, please.

414
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,164
Sure.

415
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,500
It's the perfect cocktail for you.

416
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:41,584
It's sweet at first,

417
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,087
but the Angostura bitters hit you
in the end.

418
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,506
You will never forget the taste.

419
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,425
I think it suits you better.

420
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,894
How does it feel to see Ha-joon?

421
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,396
I'm ecstatic.

422
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,273
I'm so happy.

423
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,319
I heard she told you to leave.

424
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,948
Why did you have to act that way?

425
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,700
Do you really not know?

426
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:15,827
Because I'm his mom.

427
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,124
I can't live like this anymore.

428
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,625
I'm…

429
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,128
going to take back what's mine.

430
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,551
Yours?

431
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,303
What's yours?

432
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,223
My child. My man.

433
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,726
The time I've lost.

434
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,602
Everything.

435
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,479
Just stay by his side as his tutor.

436
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,690
Don't sway him.

437
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,483
I hate complications.

438
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,068
Why must I do that?

439
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,696
I'm his birth mom,

440
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,906
so why should I do as that woman says?

441
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,995
I'm going to tell her…

442
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,709
the truth.

443
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,545
Has it ever occurred to you
that Ha-joon could get hurt?

444
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,632
Don't hurt my son.

445
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,759
He's also mine.

446
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,017
Why did you let me set foot
in the house so easily?

447
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,980
You gave birth to him,

448
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,316
and Hi-soo raised him.

449
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,652
I want both of you to take care of him.

450
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,281
That way, my son will become flawless.

451
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,718
I'm not very lucky today.

452
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,528
Mother.

453
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,532
I'll cut to the chase.

454
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,784
Please tell me

455
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,829
the name and birthdate
of Ha-joon's birth mother.

456
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,288
How would I know that?

457
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:27,792
It's been ages since we cut ties with her.

458
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,253
How am I supposed to know
about her whereabouts?

459
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,464
I never asked about her whereabouts.

460
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,174
I thought she was dead.

461
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,428
Yes. She's dead.

462
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,514
Then what were you just talking about?

463
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:45,810
What's gotten into you so late at night?

464
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,228
Why are you picking a fight?

465
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,647
Are you displeased Ji-yong didn't become

466
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,691
-the president?
-Mother.

467
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,652
I don't like talking about her.
That's all.

468
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,070
What's gotten into you?

469
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,949
She's not even
on Ha-joon's birth certificate.

470
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:04,203
She didn't file the papers before she
brought him here. We did everything.

471
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,205
I already told you about this.

472
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,418
Did she choose to leave him behind?

473
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,462
She said she couldn't raise him alone.

474
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:17,300
I want to see her face.
Do you have a photo of her?

475
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,760
Why would I have that?

476
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,346
Why would I have a photo of a dead woman?

477
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,599
This is unbelievable.

478
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,625
The sooner you suspect, the better.

479
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,669
It'll prevent a bigger misfortune.

480
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,546
Search for the truth.

481
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,156
Goodness.

482
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,889
My goodness.

483
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,436
How did she know
that I had a photo of her?

484
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,064
It's like she can see through me.

485
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,868
Hey.

486
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,162
Look.

487
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,581
About that girl…

488
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,420
The girl who used to date Ji-yong.
The one who rode horses.

489
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,338
Do you remember her?

490
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,798
No, I don't.

491
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,635
I was away for a month back then,
tending to the chairman

492
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,305
while he was getting treated
at Loum Medica in Germany.

493
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:28,889
Right.

494
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,558
Did she come then?

495
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,102
You absolutely didn't want
to accompany him

496
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,979
and sent me instead.

497
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,814
When I returned,

498
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:40,151
you entered Cadenza while holding

499
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,611
the adorable Ha-joon's hand.

500
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,615
Do you remember anything about her?

501
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,867
Why do you ask?

502
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,037
Do you want to commemorate
her death anniversary?

503
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,663
Forget it.

504
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,498
Don't ask me questions.

505
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,001
I just couldn't remember her name.
That's all.

506
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,461
Empty the trash can.

507
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,754
Yes, ma'am.

508
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,476
Ha-joon.

509
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,816
Why didn't you tell me
about this necklace?

510
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,362
Why did you keep it a secret?

511
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,531
Why must I tell you everything?

512
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,244
Remember what I told you?

513
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,997
I told you to be careful when strangers
act friendly or give you gifts.

514
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,999
Why is Ms. Kang a stranger?

515
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,253
-What?
-You…

516
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,172
don't know anything.

517
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,716
-Ha-joon.
-I want to be alone.

518
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,051
Please leave.

519
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,948
BIRTH CERTIFICATE
NAME: HAN HA-JOON

520
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,951
FATHER: HAN JI-YONG
MOTHER:

521
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,069
Mr. Im, it's me.

522
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,307
Who is it this time?

523
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,352
She works at the hotel lounge cafe.

524
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,480
She's not an employee of the Hotel.
She's with the catering company.

525
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,773
Should I take care of her?

526
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:08,317
No, just let her be.

527
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,318
Pardon?

528
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:13,489
You know how the food chain works.

529
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,325
I'll let nature run its course.

530
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,704
She'll be nothing more than his mistress.

531
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,040
Understood, ma'am.

532
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,391
This place is like…

533
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,102
a beautiful jungle.

534
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,524
You must be prudent
if you want to survive.

535
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,608
Understand?

536
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,806
Begin!

537
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,891
Honey.

538
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:31,103
Why are you still up?

539
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,272
I was waiting for you.

540
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,442
I have some questions.

541
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,124
Ms. Kang gave that necklace to Ha-joon.

542
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,712
Don't you recognize it?

543
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,257
You are wearing it

544
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,677
in the photo of you riding your horse.

545
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,848
Oh, I see.

546
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,476
She must've done horseback riding too.

547
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,520
It's a kind of lucky charm
for people who ride horses.

548
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,190
They may look the same,
but the designs are different.

549
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,652
This is driving me nuts.

550
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:27,743
You'd be lost for words
if you know what's on my mind.

551
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,828
Do you know what I'm thinking right now?

552
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,959
Tell me what you're thinking.

553
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,007
Is Ha-joon's birth mother

554
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,885
really dead?

555
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,220
That's harsh.

556
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:48,472
It's nothing compared to what
I'm going through.

557
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,642
Answer me.

558
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:59,441
Yes. She's dead.

559
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,946
What on earth are you thinking?

560
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,287
I got a feeling that his birth mother,

561
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,666
the woman you once loved,

562
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,504
is Ms. Kang.

563
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,009
You know that's absurd, right?

564
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,388
Suspecting someone solely based on a hunch

565
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,640
is destructive.

566
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,433
For me and you,

567
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,519
as well as her.

568
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,145
I know it's ridiculous,

569
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:39,898
but I've never felt this uneasy before.

570
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,485
This is unbelievable. Are you saying

571
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,988
that I deceived you and brought her here?

572
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,077
Hearing it like that is really awful.

573
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,087
What's her name?

574
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,385
I should at least know her name.

575
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,013
After all, she gave birth to Ha-joon.

576
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,527
Lee…

577
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:27,904
Hye-jin.

578
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,368
Lee Hye-jin.

579
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:39,875
What are you so anxious about?

580
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,879
You shouldn't be. You're in my arms.

581
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,674
Trust me.

582
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,191
Soo-young told me

583
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,318
that you craved Jonathan apples.

584
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,527
Ms. Jung.

585
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,613
Thank you for letting me come back.

586
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,910
Allow me to return this money.

587
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,628
Ms. Kim.

588
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,674
-Yes?
-Are you just ignorant

589
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,343
of the relationship
between an employee and an employer?

590
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,804
Or are you attempting to change it

591
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,765
based on your own beliefs?

592
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,017
I don't understand.

593
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,727
How dare you…

594
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,606
return the money

595
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,858
and skew my intentions?

596
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,861
Do you think returning the money

597
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:16,656
would change your current situation
even a bit?

598
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,827
Don't I have the right
to turn down money I don't want?

599
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,871
If you want to continue working here,

600
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,250
you must know when to put your pride aside
and when to protect it.

601
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,213
You need to find the right balance
between the two.

602
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,006
Do you understand?

603
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,845
Take my money
and distance yourself from Soo-hyuk.

604
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:43,475
That's the balance
you should be maintaining.

605
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,019
If you can't do that,

606
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,396
you'll fall apart.

607
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,736
You seem confused about what to let go
and what to protect.

608
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,946
Snap out of it.

609
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,282
Try to understand…

610
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:02,035
what you should be protecting.

611
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,714
No-deok.

612
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,591
Spread your feathers.

613
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,635
Please? Spread…

614
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,846
Spread them for me.

615
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,811
Ma'am, it's time for your massage.

616
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,022
Okay. When is my vocal coach coming?

617
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,064
At 5 p.m.

618
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,360
By the way,
why won't he spread his feathers?

619
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,196
Why doesn't he ever listen to me?

620
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,115
I'm not sure.

621
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:26,870
-Have you ever been ignored by a pet?
-No.

622
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,915
Maybe I've lived for too long.

623
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,668
You brat.

624
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,965
Call a vet
and tell them to run a test to see

625
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,217
why No-deok doesn't spread his feathers.

626
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,428
Tell them to give No-deok a shot.

627
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,804
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,525
What is it?

629
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,277
Hi-soo.

630
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,488
What is it? Tell me.

631
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,456
SEO HI-SOO OF HYOWON IS NOT
HER SON'S BIRTH MOTHER

632
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:15,377
FORMER ACTRESS SEO HI-SOO,
WIFE OF HYOWON'S HAN JI-YONG…

633
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:26,596
I'm going to end that journalist's career
once and for all.

634
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,058
He's the one who wrote
about Jin-hee as well. He's evil.

635
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,309
That was someone else.

636
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:32,811
What?

637
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,730
As if Ha-joon wasn't enough,

638
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,983
how dare he attack Soo-hyuk as well?

639
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,859
Why?

640
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,111
I won't let this pass.

641
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,239
How could you fail to stop one journalist?

642
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,200
How come journalists aren't afraid of us?

643
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,369
Mother, times have changed.

644
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,789
We no longer have control
over public opinion.

645
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,625
We must listen to the public.

646
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:56,835
Listen?

647
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,421
Unbelievable. My God.

648
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:05,176
Hey, Soo-hyuk will get engaged soon.
What are we going to do now?

649
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,972
Where is Soo-hyuk right now?

650
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,142
God, I don't believe this.

651
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:17,605
When has my dear Jin-ho ever abused women?
That's ridiculous.

652
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,399
Did they witness it? Did they?

653
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:23,528
That cruel bitch
abandoned her own son and left.

654
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:24,988
Goodness.

655
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:27,157
Damn it!

656
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,535
Don't just stand there.

657
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:33,079
Go do something about the journalist!

658
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,290
God, this is ludicrous.

659
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:41,629
"Han Soo-hyuk, the eldest grandson,
is also an illegitimate child"?

660
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,050
Does he not know
what "illegitimate" means?

661
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:48,428
We had him when we were married
then got divorced.

662
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,097
Damn it.

663
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,272
You must have no worries.

664
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,024
Golfing in this situation?

665
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,028
Did you see the news?

666
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,363
Your family is in huge trouble.

667
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,409
Oh my.

668
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,578
What is this?

669
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,122
It wasn't me.

670
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,334
I didn't do this. I said no.

671
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,217
Mr. Im, what is this article?

672
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,931
I never gave you permission
to release the article

673
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,642
and I told you I couldn't confirm
it was true.

674
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:37,227
What have you done?

675
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,897
It wasn't me?

676
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,441
Then who was it?

677
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,488
SEO HI-SOO OF HYOWON IS NOT
HER SON'S BIRTH MOTHER

678
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,490
FORMER ACTRESS SEO HI-SOO, THE WIFE OF…

679
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,250
"The birth mother of Han Ha-joon,
Seo Hi-soo's son,

680
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,585
is known to have passed away."

681
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,967
She's alive and well.

682
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,750
-Hello?
-Was it you?

683
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,133
I told you that Ha-joon would find out
sooner or later.

684
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,177
I told you not to hurt him.

685
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,597
I'm going to take my son back.

686
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,681
Just…

687
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,186
Just stay by his side and support him.

688
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,938
Why must you anger me?

689
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,288
It's time to pick up Ha-joon from school.

690
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,042
Are you going to go?

691
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:25,627
No.

692
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,129
Please go instead of me.

693
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,634
Comfort him well and bring him home.

694
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,636
You're not coming?

695
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:39,974
I…

696
00:58:43,144 --> 00:58:45,897
I don't think I can see him right now.

697
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,776
I don't know

698
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,487
what I should do to lessen his pain.

699
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,868
I just don't know.

700
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,127
Why am I such a fool?

701
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,674
What kind of a mother am I?

702
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,428
This is driving me insane.

703
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,521
I'll get going.

704
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,437
Don't mind the article.

705
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,275
Don't mind my feelings.

706
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,378
It's me.

707
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,756
It's about that article.

708
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:39,719
Look into the journalist and his source.

709
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,516
I won't let it pass this time.

710
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,023
You don't have an umbrella.

711
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,776
Wait until it stops raining.

712
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,465
SOO-HYUK'S TREE
I HOPE YOU GROW QUICKLY

713
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:07,432
I think your world is just as terrible

714
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:09,851
as mine.

715
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,687
You can cry if you want.

716
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,147
I'll keep it a secret.

717
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:15,815
I won't cry.

718
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:23,573
Do you want to go out in the rain?
It'll wash our worries away.

719
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,162
Yu-yeon.

720
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,041
I have trouble sleeping again

721
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,462
because of you.

722
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:18,377
Hi-soo.

723
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,965
-Where's Ha-joon?
-He's missing.

724
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,927
What do you mean?

725
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,221
He went missing after school.

726
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,931
I can't find him anywhere.

727
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,393
I'll call Mr. Han.

728
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:35,812
Hi-soo.

729
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,705
HA-JOON'S TUTOR

730
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,351
-Hello?
-Hello, ma'am.

731
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:19,438
I looked for Ms. Lee Hye-jin's file,
but it's gone.

732
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:24,110
After ten years of mandatory storage,
we're allowed to delete the records.

733
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,822
And she recently asked
for her records to be deleted.

734
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:29,532
She recently asked…

735
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:33,953
for her records to be deleted?

736
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,162
That's correct.

737
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,957
I'm sorry I can't be of any help.

738
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:43,838
She's alive.

739
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,267
Ms. Jung, Ha-joon's gone missing.

740
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,729
-What?
-He went missing after school.

741
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,698
Where is…

742
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,035
Ms. Kang?

743
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,253
Hi-soo.

744
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,172
This is bad.

745
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,215
Ms. Seo shouldn't be driving right now,

746
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,760
but she left by herself to find Ha-joon.

747
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:33,387
What do you mean? She shouldn't drive?

748
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:36,974
It's me.

749
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:38,935
Is it true?

750
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,147
Are you really…

751
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,566
pregnant?

752
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:49,695
Hi-soo.

753
01:05:57,453 --> 01:06:00,581
An untold secret became
the catalyst for war.

754
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:04,585
They could not tell friend from foe,

755
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,338
and it became an endless battle.

756
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:13,552
A battle that didn't end
until one of them was dead.

757
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,137
Leave Ha-joon and me.

758
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,014
It's not a request. It's an order.

759
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,640
Be careful around Hi-soo from now on.

760
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,392
She's pregnant.

761
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,144
Don't concern yourself with anything
from now on.

762
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:05,146
Think only about yourself and my child.

763
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,982
So Hi-soo and I have been fooled
by the little act

764
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:09,900
Mother and Han Ji-yong put together?

765
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,360
I’ve felt it for a while now.

766
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,404
How far are you going to pursue this?

767
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,114
Don't hurt her.

768
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,575
I won't go easy on whoever hurts her.

769
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:21,370
Will you be okay even if I make
you understand the uncomfortable truth?

770
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:25,541
