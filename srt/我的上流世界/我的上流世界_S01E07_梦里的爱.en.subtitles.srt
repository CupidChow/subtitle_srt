00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,802
Hello.

2
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,678
I'm Lee Hye-jin.

3
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,898
I'm a member of Ilsin too.

4
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,108
I was invited here today.

5
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,319
What an odd way to welcome a member.

6
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,656
Was this it? Are you really…

7
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,911
Did you become a member
because of my son and me?

8
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,454
Your son?

9
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,415
Of course not.

10
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,254
This welfare foundation was the first
to take me and my Ha-joon in,

11
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,381
so I've only been repaying the kindness.

12
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,550
Why did you come to our house?

13
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,301
To get back what's mine.

14
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,055
You protect your child,
and I'll protect mine.

15
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,519
Don't you know that I actually tried
to protect your child?

16
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,357
Hi-soo, let's leave for now.

17
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,318
You and I will talk later.

18
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,918
Tell Doctor Hwang to come to Rubato
in an hour.

19
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,661
If you report this to the police,

20
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,080
it'll be published in the newspaper.

21
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,332
What if…

22
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,460
it triggers a tax investigation
against your family?

23
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:35,048
What if the police get a search warrant
and rummage through the chairman's safe?

24
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,298
Gosh, be careful.

25
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,434
What's in there?

26
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,105
Sir! No!

27
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,779
No! Sir!

28
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,615
Sir! Get out of there!

29
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,013
I have loved

30
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,849
Someone I shouldn't have loved

31
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,395
Because loving her

32
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,482
Is an act of sin

33
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,403
Must my heart

34
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,324
Which can't profess my love

35
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:11,454
Cry again

36
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,372
Tonight

37
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,960
I must forget

38
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,755
The one I can't forget

39
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:31,724
EPISODE 7
LOVE IS JUST A DREAM

40
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:37,688
Must my heart cry again

41
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,193
Without a sound

42
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,153
Tonight

43
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,295
Think only about Ha-joon and yourself.

44
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,383
I'll do what you want to do instead.

45
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,342
No.

46
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,595
This is my problem.

47
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:12,181
I should deal with it.

48
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,185
You're in no position to confront anyone.
You're pregnant.

49
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,485
I'll meet with her first.

50
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,905
You need to be smart about what to protect

51
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,616
and what to let go.

52
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,332
You must stay strong.

53
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,186
-Hello?
-Don't you think we should talk?

54
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,439
I'm actually on my way
to your place right now.

55
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:05,943
No. There's something I need
to confirm first.

56
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,405
I'll contact you later.
And I'll choose the place.

57
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,202
Don't you dare set foot in my house
without my permission.

58
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,046
Ms. Jung.

59
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,924
You know why I'm here, right?

60
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,720
The real Kang Ja-kyeong
who worked here for five years.

61
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,431
Where is she right now?

62
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,438
Yes, Mr. Choi.

63
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,066
I'll summon Iyeon's head maid
and the real Kang Ja-kyeong

64
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,027
as witnesses in fabricating documents
and committing fraud.

65
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,333
Wait. Drive slowly.

66
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,174
SUZY

67
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,401
Goodness gracious.

68
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,449
These must've belonged
to Mr. Han Ji-yong's birth mother.

69
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,371
Let's keep this place secret
from everyone else.

70
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,872
Of course, sir.

71
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,545
Ms. Yang is calling for me.

72
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:23,516
Give me back

73
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,267
My youth

74
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,103
Ma'am, use less of your throat

75
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,605
-and more of your chest.
-Give me back

76
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,274
-My youth
-My youth

77
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,113
-I beg for it
-I beg for it

78
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,865
-As time goes by
-As time goes by

79
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,660
-I have so much love
-I have so much love

80
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,745
She must've been so lonely.

81
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,581
-To give
-To give

82
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,458
-I cannot
-I cannot

83
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,669
-Stop time
-Hold onto time

84
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,213
-From flowing
-From flowing

85
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,714
All right.

86
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,968
Give me back

87
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,857
Ma'am, Ms. Kang Ja-kyeong is here.

88
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,332
I visited Canada often

89
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,501
because the kids were there.

90
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,755
That's where I met Hye-jin.

91
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,716
She was a kind girl.

92
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,427
She let me stay at her second house
in Montreal for free…

93
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,222
for an entire year.

94
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,142
That's when I got to know…

95
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,853
about her past.

96
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,939
She only wanted help getting her son back.

97
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,900
I wanted to help.

98
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,777
She just wanted

99
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,363
to switch identities for a year.

100
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,498
You should leave.

101
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,218
Yes?

102
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,345
Ms. Kang is here, ma'am.

103
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,766
She came to see you.

104
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,977
But Mr. Han Ji-yong ordered us
not to let her into the house.

105
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,146
What should I do?

106
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,273
Let her in.

107
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,025
Have her wait in the reception room.

108
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,416
Hello,

109
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,418
my name is Kang Ja-kyeong.

110
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,963
-Please take good care of my son.
-I'll do my best.

111
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,258
Don't worry too much.
We have Ms. Kang now.

112
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,134
She seems sincere towards Ha-joon.

113
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,512
This is unbelievable. Are you saying

114
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,931
that I deceived you and brought her here?

115
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,624
HYOWON ELECTRONICS

116
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,258
HA-JOON'S TUTOR

117
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,850
Hello?

118
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,519
It's all over.

119
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,440
Your wife knows who I am now.

120
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,163
Ms. Kang is waiting in the reception room.

121
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,254
You're home early.

122
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,007
You may go.

123
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,676
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,644
Have Ms. Kang come to my study
in 15 minutes.

125
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:37,853
Don't let anyone in.

126
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,023
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

127
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,525
Are you going to record us talking

128
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,028
and send it to Han Ji-yong as well?

129
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,909
If that's your plan,

130
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,371
feel free to pop in.

131
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,972
Ms. Jung, is something going on lately?

132
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:14,932
You look sullen.

133
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,226
About Mother Emma…

134
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,229
Book me an appointment with her.

135
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,315
I'll receive counseling.

136
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,819
Leave me out when you talk with her.

137
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,946
Then why would you introduce her to me?

138
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,699
Focus on your business,
not on personal matters.

139
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,243
Don't disclose personal issues to others.

140
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,539
But she's a nun, so it'll be safe
to talk with her.

141
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,290
Hey, Ms. Jung.

142
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,046
Do you want in on two shocking secrets
that I've discovered?

143
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,590
I don't know how shocking they are,

144
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,427
but some secrets shouldn't be let out.

145
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,387
Keep them to yourself.

146
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,930
But they're truly mind-boggling.

147
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,480
What do you want?

148
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,773
Ha-joon.

149
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,525
I want to take him back.

150
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,403
As you can see, I'm alive and well.

151
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,656
I left my 18-month-old baby here.

152
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,036
I thought it would be better

153
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,248
for him to be raised like a prince
in Hyowon than by a poor single mother.

154
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,043
Then why the change of heart?
Nothing has changed.

155
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,128
Because I was wrong back then…

156
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,923
and what I think now is right.

157
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,383
I'm here to right the wrong.

158
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,761
I want my son back.

159
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,180
You know that's impossible.

160
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,556
I'll make it possible.

161
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,141
That won't happen.

162
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,893
What gives you the right?

163
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,979
Then what gives you the right
to say such a thing?

164
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,525
I carried him for 10 months
and raised him for 18 months.

165
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,901
And you talk about my right?

166
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,946
That's just absurd.

167
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:35,572
Will you make it a legal matter?

168
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,199
I know I'm David against Goliath,

169
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,618
but I have no choice.

170
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,995
I should've done this six years ago.

171
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,542
We have proof and witnesses to prove
that you've committed identity theft.

172
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,337
This is enough to ostracize you
from society.

173
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,923
You're still willing to do this?

174
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,008
You're…

175
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:56,969
a criminal.

176
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,640
Can't you take my side?

177
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,811
You could help me.
After all, I'm Ha-joon's birth mother.

178
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:11,567
I helped your husband become
the head of Hyowon Group.

179
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,861
Is that the deal…

180
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,698
you made with Han Ji-yong
and my mother-in-law?

181
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,577
I have no intention of helping you.

182
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,412
I wasn't involved in the deal.

183
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,873
Should I let the entire world know…

184
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,167
what the Hyowon family did to me?

185
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,626
Be my guest.

186
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,296
I'm going to let the world know

187
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,631
about how you came here and deceived us.

188
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,800
Both you and Ji-yong.

189
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,677
But he belongs to the Hyowon family.

190
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,013
Shouldn't you protect him?

191
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:44,683
Everyone must take responsibility
for their actions, whoever they may be.

192
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,978
After all, you two completely fooled
Hi-soo and me.

193
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,063
You shouldn't treat me this way.

194
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,190
Even I don't know…

195
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,151
what I'm capable of doing.

196
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,906
I'm not here as Kang Ja-kyeong
or Lee Hye-jin.

197
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,783
I'm here as Ha-joon's mother.

198
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,744
Hi-soo is pregnant.

199
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,705
Do you not want to play fair?

200
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,625
Do you really want to distress
a pregnant woman?

201
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,252
That's exactly why I'm taking Ha-joon.

202
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,004
She has her own kid now.

203
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,173
We should take care of our own children.

204
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,471
Besides, I'm still his tutor
since my contract hasn't ended.

205
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,390
It's time for him
to come home from school,

206
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,767
so I'll go over to him now.

207
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,310
Didn't I tell you

208
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,271
that you can't stay in this house
without my permission?

209
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,998
Hello?

210
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:57,172
Didn't I tell you not to let the tutor
into the house?

211
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,717
Who?

212
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,720
Seo-hyun?

213
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,670
I heard you weren't feeling well,
so I came home early.

214
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,673
Soo-young and I are
your emergency contacts.

215
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,970
Didn't you say
Ha-joon's real mom was dead?

216
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,516
You looked me dead in the eye and said so.

217
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,937
So how is she alive and staying here
at our house? As Ha-joon's tutor at that?

218
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,152
I didn't want to shock you.

219
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,572
I thought she was dead.

220
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,074
What do you mean?

221
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,869
I was studying abroad back then.

222
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,912
I found out through my mother

223
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,123
that I had a son

224
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,833
and that his mom had died.

225
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,046
I don't know what to make of this.
I'm going nuts.

226
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,131
She gave birth to Ha-joon!

227
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,008
How could you not recognize her?

228
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,093
It was a fling I had
while horseback riding.

229
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,970
I was young and dumb.

230
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,555
When she first came here,

231
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,433
I really didn't recognize her.
It's the truth.

232
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,477
Do you hear yourself?

233
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,479
She was a woman you used to love.

234
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,064
No, I didn't.

235
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,359
This is embarrassing to admit,
but it was a short fling.

236
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,820
I looked into her
because you were suspicious of her.

237
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,574
And that's when I found out
who she actually was.

238
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,411
I'm shocked, but I can't imagine
what you're going through.

239
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,246
That's why I wanted to let her go.

240
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,664
Because I have to protect you.

241
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,209
You separated Ha-joon from his mother
and faked her death.

242
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,960
I had no idea.

243
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,213
It wasn't my doing.

244
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,344
That woman…

245
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,847
is Ha-joon's birth mother.

246
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,975
Hi-soo. You're his mother.

247
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,062
We need to be selfish
in order to protect our son.

248
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,773
She wants revenge.

249
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,859
You mustn't believe anything she says.
Get a hold of yourself!

250
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,160
Give me some time alone.

251
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,789
I need to clear my head.

252
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,086
Get out.

253
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,959
What brings you here?

254
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,218
-Is that enough?
-Of course not.

255
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,263
But I've made a promise to Hi-soo.

256
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,144
You two shouldn't have done this
to someone carrying a baby.

257
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,816
It's my baby.

258
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,151
What's it to you?

259
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,237
Ji-yong.

260
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,617
Keep this up, and I'll kill you myself.

261
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,957
And I'm going to keep her
right by my side.

262
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,500
The fake Kang Ja-kyeong.

263
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,378
I'm the one who let her in here,

264
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,758
so I should own up to my own mistake.

265
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,973
I will protect Hyowon.

266
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,564
Mother.

267
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,206
Eat even if you're not hungry,

268
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,917
and laugh even if nothing's funny.

269
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,837
I can't bring myself
to tell my mom about this.

270
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,755
She'll be shocked.

271
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,842
Mother.

272
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,845
Can you be my mom just for today?

273
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,514
Of course. That's why I'm here.

274
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,268
What should I do?

275
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,022
The people here terrify me.

276
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,524
They make my skin crawl.

277
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,653
I don't know what's true or not anymore.

278
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,740
I don't know anything.

279
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,619
I want to get to the bottom of this,

280
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,123
but I'm afraid to do so.

281
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,085
I'm scared I might want to run away.

282
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,922
And if I leave this family,

283
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,717
this baby will have no father,

284
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,220
and Ha-joon…

285
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,974
will have no mother.

286
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,979
Actually, that's not true.

287
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,317
He has his birth mother.

288
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,823
What should I do?

289
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,991
Hi-soo.

290
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:45,955
A child can grow up just as well
under one parent.

291
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,170
Everyone is equal before the Lord,
but not in this family.

292
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,382
This is their own kingdom.

293
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:59,344
Under this roof,
that baby isn't really yours.

294
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,721
No. It is mine.

295
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,975
Lee Hye-jin had her baby taken away
and was kicked out.

296
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,355
I'm not telling you to give up.
I'm telling you to be strong.

297
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,608
You're a mother,

298
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,069
so you ought to be.

299
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,991
The Lord has granted women
the power to protect their children.

300
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,494
Mother.

301
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,665
I'm going to raise Ha-joon too.

302
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,543
I can, right?

303
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,795
He's…

304
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,257
my son.

305
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:54,482
Are you going to record us talking
and send it to Han Ji-yong as well?

306
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,236
We should stop seeing each other.

307
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,326
S.H. MUSEUM

308
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,831
I did it because I needed money.

309
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,251
You're more foolish than I thought.

310
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,087
How do you think I found out?

311
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,550
I guess Ji-yong used you
for his own benefit and discarded you.

312
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,096
You should've made a wiser decision.

313
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,181
Ma'am.

314
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,146
Ma'am.

315
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,107
Use me.

316
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,320
I'll be your loyal dog

317
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,655
when you need me most.

318
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,491
Use me then.

319
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,035
I'll do…

320
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,705
whatever you want.

321
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,387
Your scalp is very tense, ma'am.

322
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,640
Goodness.

323
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,561
That's because I'm always stressed out.

324
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:17,690
I bet there's no one
more stressed than I am.

325
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,111
Of course, there's no one

326
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:26,241
since they all must be dead
from all that stress.

327
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,451
Oh, my.

328
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:32,163
Hey, I didn't know you had a knack
for giving foot massages.

329
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,374
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

330
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,335
I should've used you.

331
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,548
What do you keep your skills
and strength hidden for?

332
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,425
God, that feels good.

333
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,263
You now have no choice but to do as I say.

334
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,974
You know what happens if you don't, right?

335
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,811
Don't just massage my big toe.

336
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,897
Massage all of them. Don't play favorites.

337
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,024
Don't.

338
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,654
That's it.

339
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,241
That's ticklish!

340
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,085
Damn it.

341
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:22,338
God, he's so annoying.

342
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,800
Get me a cup of iced coffee.

343
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,346
I might as well have dinner here too.

344
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:33,933
Ms. Joo.

345
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,769
Ms. Joo.

346
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,565
Answer me.

347
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,277
Ms. Joo, open the door!

348
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,945
I need to use the bathroom!

349
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,281
Open up!

350
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,242
Open the door!

351
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,995
Open!

352
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,123
Open up! I need to go!

353
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,794
I might pee my pants.

354
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,965
I'm going to do it.
You'll have to clean it up.

355
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,675
Okay?

356
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:10,887
Why are you so taken aback?

357
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:16,559
It's just that I don't quite understand
why you've made that decision.

358
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,394
Stagnant water is bound to rot.

359
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,189
Consider this a transfer of personnel.

360
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,400
Send Kyeong-hye, Seong-tae, and Yu-yeon
to Rubato.

361
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,653
And bring all the Rubato maids

362
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,738
and Ms. Kang to our house.

363
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,241
Seong-tae and Kyeong-hye
shouldn't work together.

364
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,119
Never mind, ma'am. Understood.

365
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,873
Okay. I understand.

366
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,399
Explain.

367
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,112
Or you can listen to me first
then speak your mind.

368
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,199
As Ha-joon's mother,

369
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,828
I'm going to do everything
that I have to do.

370
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,164
What would make him happier?

371
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,333
What will hurt him less?

372
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,462
These are what I'll consider
whenever I make a decision.

373
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,672
Thank you…

374
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,717
for caring about my son.

375
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,386
Why do you always thank me…

376
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,180
for caring about my own son?

377
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,558
-I gave birth to him.
-I raised him.

378
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,061
Is it revenge that you want?

379
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,938
You want to be compensated

380
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,191
for having both your son and your youth
snatched away from you.

381
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,526
Go ahead. I won't stop you.

382
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,612
He was sick.

383
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,949
So I had no choice.

384
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,325
I thought this family…

385
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,870
would take good care of him.

386
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,247
That's why I gave him up.

387
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,420
But he was always on my mind,
day and night.

388
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,005
It felt like…

389
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,467
my heart was torn
and my nails were pulled out.

390
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,219
My heart bled.

391
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,180
So what you want is…

392
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,018
Ha-joon?

393
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,146
Why him?

394
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,689
You should take revenge!

395
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,150
Thank you for raising him all this time.

396
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,819
Let me do it from now on.

397
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,114
-I'm his mother.
-No.

398
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,826
He's going to get hurt. Let's not do that.

399
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,412
Why do you think he'll get hurt?

400
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,831
He'll finally be reunited
with his real mother.

401
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,669
I'm sure Ha-joon remembers me.

402
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,546
I can feel it.

403
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,509
If…

404
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,637
If you truly care about him, just leave.

405
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,098
They even fabricate DNA.

406
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:02,391
Don't you know them?
They even faked your death!

407
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,936
That's why I have nothing to fear.

408
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,899
I fear only one thing in this world.

409
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,735
Not being able to see Ha-joon.

410
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:16,697
Just…

411
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,165
have Ji-yong instead.

412
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,144
Hey, she's calling all of us.

413
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,534
She's always like this.

414
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,676
From today on, Ju-yeon and Sang-a

415
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,595
will work here at Cadenza.

416
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,347
And Yu-yeon, you'll move to Rubato.

417
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,184
Seong-tae and Kyeong-hye as well.

418
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,894
-Me too?
-Yes.

419
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,315
Why is she suddenly being transferred?

420
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,025
Well…

421
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,693
-Ms. Jung said--
-No.

422
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,445
Yu-yeon will stay here.

423
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,404
No, ma'am.

424
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,407
I'll follow Ms. Jung's orders.

425
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,638
You can't be like that
in front of the maids.

426
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,891
Learn to hide your true feelings
if you want to succeed.

427
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,769
I have feelings for her.

428
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,605
You can't get tangled up with her.

429
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,607
-It's too late.
-You'll be miserable.

430
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,609
It's my life. And I don't care.

431
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,570
I've never been happy in my life anyway,

432
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,989
so I can't get any more miserable.

433
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,202
You don't know what true misery is like.

434
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,329
Don't try so hard to be my mom.

435
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,581
I don't need your advice.

436
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,751
I can already see so clearly
how miserable she will be.

437
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,711
I won't let her end up like my mom.

438
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,507
I'm confident about that. I'm not my dad.

439
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,636
Do you truly think so?
You'll be put in the same situation.

440
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:47,473
Sure, she won't end up like your mom.
She'll be more miserable.

441
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,352
At least your mom didn't love your dad.

442
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,939
You should stop now, Soo-hyuk.

443
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:56,565
I'm saying this not for your sake,

444
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,110
but for hers.

445
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,363
You shouldn't make the girl you like…

446
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,491
go through such misery.

447
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,255
Why does she want to transfer them?

448
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:23,467
I believe her biggest reason
is to separate Yu-yeon

449
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,344
from the young master.

450
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,096
If that's not the case,

451
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,892
could there be some other reason?

452
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,311
Maybe?

453
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,230
What's with your eyes?

454
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,192
By the way,

455
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:46,741
shouldn't we throw a party for Hi-soo
since she got pregnant?

456
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,453
I don't think
she's been feeling too happy lately.

457
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,291
-Did she find out about something?
-Of course not.

458
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,008
They should have many children.

459
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,843
That's what all the wealth is for.

460
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:12,141
If my husband weren't bedridden like that,
he would've been delighted.

461
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,144
You know, he cherished Hi-soo.

462
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,315
Kim Mi-ja, that bitch.

463
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,736
Ma'am, please let me excuse myself.

464
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,328
No.

465
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,381
Hurry, go up.

466
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,638
-Sir, help me.
-Close that up well.

467
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,431
Let's do it together. Gosh.

468
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,727
That little…

469
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,960
-Come down once you've unpacked.
-Yes, sir.

470
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,872
Where's your mouth?

471
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,749
Mouth.

472
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,878
And your ears? Where are they?

473
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,589
Ears. That's right.

474
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,257
Which one is "banana"?

475
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,219
BANANA

476
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,391
You did well. You're all done now.

477
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,732
Did it hurt a lot?

478
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:26,901
Are you okay?

479
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,781
The tooth fairy won't give you a new one
if you keep crying.

480
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:33,782
Stop crying now.

481
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,804
-Ma'am.
-Oh, my God!

482
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,932
-You startled me.
-Why are you so startled?

483
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,393
Why is that thing here?

484
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,686
What thing?

485
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,649
Oh, you mean Ms. Kang?

486
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,944
I told you earlier
that she'd be coming here to Cadenza.

487
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,487
Damn it.

488
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,240
Where's Jin-ho? I must speak with him.

489
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,701
-Where is he?
-He went to see a nun.

490
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,327
A nun?

491
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:02,913
He's seeing a nun these days?

492
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:03,956
Yes.

493
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,881
My name is Han Jin-ho.

494
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,509
I finished my military service in the army

495
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,720
despite having US citizenship.

496
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,222
But I have no plans to get into politics.

497
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,975
My blood type is AB.

498
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:25,894
You don't have
to formally introduce yourself.

499
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:27,896
Make yourself at home.

500
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,358
Just think of me as a comfortable sofa.

501
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,862
Are you telling me to sit on you?

502
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:42,328
No. What I mean is…

503
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,582
We tend to relax comfortably on a sofa.

504
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,208
Do that with me.

505
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:51,128
Oh, I see.

506
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,300
I'm sorry.

507
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,513
Your position at Hyowon Group

508
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:03,891
must feel burdensome and tough.

509
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,018
Not at all. I feel completely fine.

510
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,396
How so? Your position demands
a lot of responsibilities.

511
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:11,982
Sister.

512
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,945
If I strive so hard in life,

513
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,114
I'll only fall sick like my father.

514
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,409
I don't want that.

515
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,746
You're doing well.
Keep contradicting what I say.

516
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:31,919
My dad's always favored Ji-yong over me.

517
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,172
And today, I finally found out why.

518
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,841
He…

519
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,637
genuinely loved Kim Mi-ja,

520
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,056
Ji-yong's birth mother.

521
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,018
And Ji-yong truly takes after him.

522
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,229
He's living with two women.

523
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:53,607
But at least my father hid everything
in the basement.

524
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,359
How could Ji-yong be so shameless?

525
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,654
Talk about yourself, not others.

526
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,536
I'm…

527
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,247
lonely.

528
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,626
I wish there was someone
who could understand me.

529
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,216
Just one person.

530
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,413
Why did you get married to Jin-ho?

531
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,999
I didn't care whom I married.

532
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,710
It didn't matter.

533
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:58,422
Is it because you desire to rule Hyowon?

534
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:03,093
I am fully aware of your complete trust…

535
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,387
in Ji-yong.

536
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,390
Ji-yong will never

537
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,226
be my heir.

538
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:14,980
Be patient.

539
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,317
I don't know why you married my son,

540
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,445
but staying married will be better
than getting divorced.

541
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,792
Another board meeting will be held
on the third of next month.

542
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,380
Will you continue supporting your brother?

543
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,716
I'm a father of two now.

544
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,598
I should start taking what's mine.

545
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,395
Let's have an emergency board meeting.

546
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,231
The third of next month?

547
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,608
That's too far away.

548
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,382
Ha-joon.

549
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:25,467
That's your sibling.

550
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,224
Is it a girl or a boy?

551
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,184
I'm not sure.

552
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,936
I'm curious too.

553
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,022
I hope it's a girl.

554
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,276
If it is, she'll be as pretty as your mom.

555
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:04,423
Ha-joon, this is your mom…

556
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:09,136
Ha-joon, this is your tutor.
I'm in Cadenza.

557
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,847
I miss you.

558
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,726
INCOMING CALL
HAN JI-YONG

559
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,397
Hello?

560
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,858
Why are you still there?

561
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,655
Don't you think we should talk
face to face?

562
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,949
I'll come to your office.

563
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,208
Ha-joon's birth mother

564
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,044
will come stay at our house.

565
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,421
Who will?

566
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,590
I'll make your wish come true,

567
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,759
so please keep it a secret.

568
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,303
Hi-soo can't know about this.

569
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:53,263
What the hell are you saying?

570
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,890
Have you gone mad?

571
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,684
I believe he'll grow up well
if he's raised devotedly

572
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,728
by his real mother.

573
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,898
-But--
-And she misses him dearly.

574
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,192
As long as you keep your mouth shut,

575
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,486
everything will be okay.

576
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,491
Wait!

577
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,748
Would you have asked for the same favor

578
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,708
if I was your birth mother?

579
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,925
If you were my real mother,

580
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,220
I wouldn't have turned out this way.

581
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,040
-Am I a joke to you?
-Of course not.

582
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,210
You make my skin crawl.

583
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:06,920
You frighten me.

584
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,548
Didn't I tell you to get out of my house?

585
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,844
If you want compensation,
I'll give it to you.

586
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,220
How much this time?

587
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,682
I'm no longer who I used to be
six years ago.

588
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,934
Do you think money will move me?

589
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,894
Yes, I do.

590
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,397
You gave up your son for it.

591
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,277
How can you say that?

592
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,655
After what your family did to me?

593
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,615
Don't bring up the past I don't remember.

594
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,367
That's where it all began!

595
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,459
Do as you please.

596
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,297
The little generosity left for you
for being the mother of my child

597
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:53,091
will vanish into thin air.

598
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,973
You showed up one day
and desired to see Ha-joon.

599
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,310
You asked me to fire his tutor

600
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,396
and said that you'd only stay by his side.

601
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:11,985
I guess you could say it's my fault
for granting your pathetic request.

602
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,282
So I'm the only one guilty here?

603
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,160
Not you?

604
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,412
You're the one who offered
to fire the tutor.

605
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,998
Stop what you're doing right now.

606
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:28,376
-No, I can't do that. Never.
-You could die.

607
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,509
You might…

608
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,304
really die this time.

609
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,230
Then I won't go down alone.

610
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,488
This is my final warning.

611
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,033
Don't anger me anymore.

612
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,418
-That's Seo Hi-soo.
-Is that really Seo Hi-soo?

613
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,963
No way. It is her.

614
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,506
-She's so beautiful.
-She is.

615
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,636
Here's your fried chicken.

616
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:22,055
-Enjoy.
-Here you go.

617
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,939
Our family is so strict, right?

618
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:32,941
Why?

619
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,901
We can't order in jajangmyeon or chicken.

620
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,113
That's true. They're my favorites.

621
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,656
What about braised short ribs?

622
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,452
That's my favorite among your dishes.

623
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:48,999
But since I can't have jajangmyeon
or chicken whenever I want,

624
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,375
they're more tasty.

625
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:54,629
It's amazing
you and I have the same taste.

626
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,423
You should eat too.

627
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,175
I'm sure the baby wants to have some.

628
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,469
Okay.

629
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,643
Isn't it good?

630
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,615
Ha-joon.

631
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,868
It's true.

632
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,081
I didn't carry you in my womb

633
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,043
like I'm carrying the baby right now.

634
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:38,506
But ever since I was in my mom's womb,

635
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,593
I was destined to meet you.

636
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:44,888
That's how I felt when I first saw you.

637
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,681
Me too.

638
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,645
I felt the same way when I first saw you.

639
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,980
I was delighted.

640
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,067
Do you remember when we first met?

641
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,945
You were only three.

642
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,365
Yes. I remember.

643
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,366
Then…

644
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,286
do you also remember

645
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,538
your real mom's face?

646
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,630
I remember her scent.

647
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,258
I didn't recognize her at first.

648
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,219
But…

649
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,891
When I fell off the horse,

650
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:33,269
I was in her arms for a while.

651
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,606
That's when…

652
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,442
I remembered her scent.

653
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,737
I'm sorry, Mom.

654
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,782
Can I please…

655
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,660
not hate Ms. Kang?

656
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,665
Please…

657
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,545
don't kick her out, Mom.

658
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,177
It must've been so hard for you.

659
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,722
You kept this all to yourself.

660
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,810
You shouldn't have done that.

661
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,813
We promised not to keep secrets
from each other.

662
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,623
Why can't I go in? Why?

663
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,001
Why can't I?

664
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:43,631
I'm…

665
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:46,092
Ha-joon's…

666
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,473
I'm Ha-joon's…

667
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,957
Mr. Han was adamant about it,

668
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,542
so I had no choice, ma'am.

669
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:23,088
I told him that you'd moved her
to Cadenza,

670
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:26,299
but he said he could never let her in
as Ha-joon's father.

671
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,843
He was very worked up.

672
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,304
I guess you had no choice.

673
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,514
I'm sorry, ma'am.

674
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,105
Thank you for your service.
The HR Team will be in touch.

675
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,273
As of today,

676
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:43,983
you're fired.

677
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,825
Why is she out here?

678
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,660
Mr. Han forbade her from entering.

679
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,370
Escort her inside respectfully.

680
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,873
-But, ma'am.
-At once.

681
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:42,208
Did you not hear me?

682
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,754
I'll take responsibility, so do as I say.

683
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,028
Han Ji-yong.

684
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,823
It was him.

685
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,034
He brought me here.

686
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,287
Don't lie.

687
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,001
He said you had deceived him.

688
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,631
Why would he let you into his own home?

689
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,424
Are you naive?

690
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,177
Or have you read too many scripts?

691
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:37,722
Did he say that I had plastic surgery
to change my face?

692
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:42,852
Or did he say he didn't recognize me
because it was a mere fling?

693
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,314
Ma'am.

694
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,857
Ms. Seo.

695
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,071
You've been…

696
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,448
completely fooled.

697
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,661
You're just trying to mess me up.

698
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,163
You're the one who let me in today.

699
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:06,543
And he tried to stop me
from setting foot in here.

700
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:10,004
He was probably afraid
that I'd tell you this.

701
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,258
Shut up. I don't believe
a single word you say.

702
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,551
Ms. Yang is aware as well.

703
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:18,012
She knows about me. Everything.

704
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:23,226
Ji-yong and I have been seeing each other
for 2 years since 2019.

705
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,772
You can imagine how passionate
an old flame could be, can't you?

706
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,150
At first, I even thought of stealing him
from you.

707
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,611
I thought he loved me.

708
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,074
I should've learned
from my past experience,

709
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,118
but I was foolish.

710
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,788
When he found out that you were pregnant,

711
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:45,832
he abandoned me.

712
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,042
-Isn't that funny?
-Enough!

713
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,006
That man…

714
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:57,844
is much more dangerous than you think.

715
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,722
Don't you ever trust him.

716
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:24,996
Ma'am, are you okay?

717
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,709
Should I call a doctor?

718
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,379
I'll bring you some warm water.

719
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,131
Try to calm down.

720
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,973
Would you like to have dinner?

721
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,059
No, I'm not hungry.

722
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,394
Tell Jin-ho to come to my mom's room.

723
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:49,937
Yes, ma'am.

724
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,276
Director Jung Hyeon-taek told me this.

725
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,362
They're holding
an emergency board meeting.

726
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,947
Why? We had a meeting three days ago.

727
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:05,286
Rumor has it that the directorate will
support Ji-yong for the chairman position.

728
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,163
They're turning their backs on Dad.

729
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:09,791
You saw it at the meeting.
Besides, our stocks plummeted.

730
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:13,378
After Ji-yong took over the bakery,
the sales skyrocketed.

731
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,962
So have the semiconductor stocks.

732
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:18,549
That's my point.
He's in charge of the semiconductor.

733
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,928
They think he has
outstanding management skills.

734
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,847
And your dirty private life
is all over the tabloids.

735
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,391
What are you talking about?

736
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,434
Ji-yong is dirtier than me.

737
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,478
He's living with two women.

738
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,480
Don't worry.

739
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:34,691
Ji-yong will

740
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,902
tell them that he has no desire
to become the chairman.

741
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,948
He already promised me
that he'd support Jin-ho.

742
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,534
What are you talking about, Mom?

743
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,911
This is the big picture he had in mind.

744
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:50,707
He appointed you as the temporary head
and sat back and watched.

745
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,710
He wants everyone to know
how incompetent you are

746
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:55,712
so that you'll never set foot again.

747
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,339
Don't you know how merciless he is?

748
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,300
He sat back and watched? What do you mean?

749
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,343
My God.

750
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:07,473
He told the directorate
that he was interested in the position

751
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,600
and that he'd follow their decision.

752
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,895
Making it sound
like he isn't that ambitious.

753
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:16,441
He's going to "follow" their decision.
God, that despicable bastard.

754
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,737
That's not right.
Ji-yong can't do that to me.

755
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,614
He can't do that to me.
He should keep his promise!

756
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:44,343
Ji-yong, let's meet up. We need to talk.

757
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,181
Let's meet at our hotel's wine bar.
I'm going now.

758
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:09,827
Han Jin-ho…

759
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,087
I wanted to come sooner, but I didn't.

760
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,715
I had to protect my baby.

761
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:07,093
But I don't have a choice anymore.

762
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:08,803
So please.

763
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,723
Tell me the truth.

764
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,601
How could you fool me…

765
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,146
when you knew everything?

766
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,484
Tell me everything you know.

767
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,990
It wasn't my idea…

768
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,910
to fake her death.

769
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,746
It was Ji-yong's.

770
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,041
He wanted to do that.

771
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:42,587
He didn't want his son

772
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:45,840
to have a confusing childhood like his.

773
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:49,468
He said faking her death
would be better for Ha-joon.

774
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:53,556
He was seeing you at that time

775
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,602
and wanted you to think
that she was dead as well.

776
01:04:58,936 --> 01:05:01,814
He was the one who faked her death,

777
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:05,151
not me.

778
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:08,571
He asked me to keep it from you.

779
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:13,075
He offered a deal.

780
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:17,163
He promised to let Jin-ho
become the chairman

781
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:22,293
in exchange for keeping
that woman's identity a secret.

782
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:33,054
She gave birth to Ha-joon!
How could you not recognize her?

783
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,181
It was a fling I had
while horseback riding.

784
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,432
I was young and dumb.

785
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:37,767
When she first came here,

786
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:40,227
I really didn't recognize her.
It's the truth.

787
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,772
You've been completely fooled.

788
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:44,357
Don't worry. You're in my arms.

789
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,109
Hi-soo. You're his mother.

790
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,819
She wants revenge.

791
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,155
It wasn't my doing.
I found out through my mother.

792
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,324
He…

793
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,452
asked me to keep it from you.

794
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,534
No…

795
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,205
No…

796
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,513
Ma'am, Ms. Seo is…

797
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,433
Please come here right now!

798
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:08,769
Ji-yong cannot find out that you were
the one who told Hi-soo the truth.

799
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:10,771
But he's bound to find out.

800
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,607
If you were worried about that,
how could you tell her that?

801
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:14,942
And she's with child!

802
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:16,861
The board will meet tomorrow.

803
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:20,364
Watch Ji-yong's every move
and report back to me.

804
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:23,409
I'll get engaged. Let's have the ceremony
before I change my mind.

805
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:28,706
Wait until Hi-soo makes her decision.
Don't even think about doing anything.

806
01:09:28,789 --> 01:09:31,625
If you keep provoking me,
I don't know what I'll do.

807
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:32,668
Take your best shot.

808
01:09:32,751 --> 01:09:36,755
