1
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,970
She hurt her ribs badly,
had a pelvic fracture,

2
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:56,264
and hurt her head badly,
so she had an MRI scan.

3
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,809
The person passed out on the floor
next to Han Ji-yong was Seo Hi-soo.

4
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,520
Since she fell from the staircase,

5
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,607
it's very likely
that Ms. Seo really lost her memories.

6
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,775
I guess so.

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,443
Ha-joon!

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,991
Ms. Lee was indeed in the States
on the day of the incident.

9
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:15,909
Stop.

10
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,996
We got a photo of the person
who drove Ms. Seo to the ER.

11
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,423
And I think
someone had something big on him.

12
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,803
He started to get extremely anxious
a few days before his death.

13
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:39,015
13 DAYS AFTER THE MURDER

14
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,103
2 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

15
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,104
Cho Gyeong-cheol?

16
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,483
We suspect him to be the broker
behind Han Ji-yong's dogfighting ring.

17
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,901
The transactions are in here.

18
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,571
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-YONG

19
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,285
Hello?

20
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,040
What did you say?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,002
You're postponing my appointment?

22
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,713
Mr. Park.

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,049
You must think about our company's future.

24
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,677
Hello?

25
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,679
Hello…

26
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,564
It's all over.

27
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,484
Resign from your position
and turn yourself in.

28
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,698
Do you think I'll just sit and watch?

29
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,701
I'm different from the likes of you.

30
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,787
I'm a lowlife. A dog!

31
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,793
Bastards like me don't hesitate to bite
to keep what's ours.

32
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,212
And killing people doesn't faze me
anymore.

33
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,841
I'll end each and every one of you.

34
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,762
I was going to let you live…

35
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,938
1 DAY BEFORE THE MURDER

36
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,231
Do you think

37
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,400
you and Seo-hyun can bring me down?

38
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:16,070
You had Hye-jin make the video and send it
to the board, didn't you?

39
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:24,495
That video merely stopped you
from becoming the chairman of Hyowon.

40
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,874
There's more.

41
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,835
The proof of what kind of monster you are…

42
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,755
is all in here.

43
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,050
I have proof of your murder.

44
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,014
You'll be questioned tomorrow, right?

45
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,727
Hyowon's legal team won't be
on your side anymore.

46
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,062
I hope you'll make

47
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:52,649
the best decision you can
as Ha-joon's father.

48
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,525
The best?

49
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,986
Own up to everything you've done.

50
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,449
If you do,

51
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,036
I'll let you hand this
to the police yourself.

52
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,706
Don't do anything foolish.

53
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,167
Even if you kill me,

54
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,544
the police will get this eventually.

55
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,050
I'll never go down alone.

56
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,636
I know you want Ha-joon to yourself,

57
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,930
and Seo-hyun wants to lead Hyowon
when I'm gone.

58
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,391
That won't be possible.

59
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,517
Why?

60
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,478
Because Hyowon and Ha-joon are both mine.

61
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,523
-Yours?
-You're not his real mother,

62
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,234
and Seo-hyun is a lesbian.

63
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,861
Neither of you can take what's mine.

64
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,616
Never. Not while I'm alive.

65
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,260
Did you date anyone
before you got married?

66
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:03,886
Yes.

67
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,681
What was your boyfriend like?

68
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,268
I never had a boyfriend,

69
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,604
but I did have a lover.

70
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,440
Boyfriend.

71
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,233
Lover.

72
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,111
Aren't they the same?

73
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,006
Seo-hyun.

74
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,426
-Hello.
-Hey.

75
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,845
Hi-soo.

76
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,598
The engagement party dresses are here.
Let's go to Rubato.

77
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,059
This time, I'll pick one out for you.

78
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,936
Okay.

79
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,988
What about this one? I think it suits you.

80
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,658
Okay, I'll pick this one.

81
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,917
Hi-soo.

82
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,470
Be strong.

83
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,641
You should never lose your self-respect

84
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,353
just because the man you once loved
betrayed your trust.

85
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:37,939
That wasn't your fault.

86
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,987
You're like a big sister.

87
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,740
You always try to protect me.

88
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,285
Seo-hyun.

89
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,543
No matter what,
I'll always be on your side.

90
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,715
Everyone's different,
and it's fine to be different.

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,343
There's nothing wrong about that.

92
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,226
Do whatever your heart tells you to do.

93
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,439
I'll protect you.

94
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,076
Thanks.

95
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,079
I feel reassured.

96
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,342
Ms. Jung, the catering samples
have arrived at Cadenza.

97
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,303
Okay. I'll be there.

98
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,374
Explain. What is this?

99
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,502
Why would you look it up?

100
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,508
Why would you look
through someone else's phone…

101
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,261
without permission?

102
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,721
SLEEPING PILLS

103
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,133
Han Ji-yong

104
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,052
is a murderer.

105
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,266
If we're to go against such a man,

106
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,187
we need to prepare
our last resort as well.

107
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,567
Our last resort?

108
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,203
EPISODE 15
THE JUDGES

109
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,331
Why did you rush the engagement ceremony?

110
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,000
My stepmother suggested it.

111
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,961
She wanted our relationship
to be acknowledged.

112
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,964
And it just happened to be on the day
of Han Ji-yong's death.

113
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,132
It was also

114
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,469
to celebrate a new beginning for Hyowon.

115
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,598
After all, she was going to be
the new leader of Hyowon.

116
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,394
Then the late Mr. Han
must've been devastated that day.

117
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,566
Unfortunately,

118
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,526
yes.

119
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,869
That's right. Hi-soo was injured that day,
so I took her to the hospital.

120
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,208
Then why didn't you take her
inside the hospital yourself?

121
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,417
Sir.

122
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,629
The party wasn't wrapped up yet
at my house.

123
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,799
On top of that, someone was found dead.

124
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,052
I had other matters to tend to.

125
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,640
It would've been nice
had you told me about this sooner.

126
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,059
But you didn't ask, did you?

127
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,898
I believe I answered
all of your questions.

128
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,570
Please explain what you first saw
when you found Ms. Seo.

129
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,411
Someone was on the floor.

130
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,081
It was Ji-yong.

131
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:53,337
And you were on the phone with the legal
team leader in your study at that time?

132
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,006
-Correct.
-And after the call ended,

133
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,593
you spotted Mr. Han
on your way back to the party?

134
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,388
Yes, and I called the doctor immediately.

135
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,307
How did Ms. Seo look when you found her?

136
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,269
I was taken aback by the situation,

137
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,230
and it was too dark.

138
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,942
She was at the top of the stairs.

139
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,155
She was in extreme pain,
so I drove her to the hospital.

140
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,827
So you're saying Mr. Han and Ms. Seo
were the only ones at the scene?

141
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,705
Correct. There were just the two of them.

142
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,919
Then someone entered the house.

143
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,089
It was one of our housekeepers,
Kim Seong-tae.

144
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,345
After witnessing the scene,
Mother Emma was shocked and rushed out.

145
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,055
And the first person she ran into

146
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,807
was him.

147
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,642
That's correct.

148
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,978
Which exit did you take when you took

149
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,771
Ms. Seo to the hospital?

150
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:57,234
I'm asking because no one saw you
leaving through the front gate.

151
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:04,200
There are…

152
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,870
several secret doors in our house.

153
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,125
After Ji-yong's death,

154
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,544
as the police started investigating,

155
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,713
our stock prices have plummeted.

156
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,258
I am obliged never to let out
anything negative about Hyowon Group.

157
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,135
So I can't give you

158
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,889
any circumstantial evidence you want
that might hint at his murder.

159
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:27,806
Even if…

160
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,769
he was really murdered.

161
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,567
However, no one in this family
has his blood on their hands.

162
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,568
Then…

163
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,405
do you think he committed suicide?

164
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:46,825
I do.

165
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,915
But he would've picked a higher place.
It wasn't high enough to commit suicide.

166
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,084
He was being cornered.

167
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,794
He committed murder,

168
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,338
lost his chairman position,

169
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,384
and his honor hit rock bottom.

170
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,098
The facts speak for themselves, Detective.

171
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,601
He was already on the verge of collapse.

172
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,522
Why would anybody bother to kill him?

173
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,691
Isn't it more reasonable

174
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,612
to think that he killed himself?

175
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,373
Ms. Jung needs to attend a meeting.

176
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,712
I'll call you
if I have any more questions.

177
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,048
Feel free to do so.

178
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,894
The detective's heading
to Mr. Han Jin-ho's office.

179
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,814
Have Mr. Choi come to my office.

180
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,110
Don't worry about it.

181
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,780
They'll never find you, so just relax.

182
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,617
What?

183
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,119
Are you serious?

184
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:26,884
I must speak with Mr. Kim
who left the day after the incident.

185
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:28,510
Please cooperate with me.

186
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,220
What can I do?

187
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,557
I don't know anything
except that he's in Monaco.

188
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,019
I heard you helped him leave the country.

189
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,980
We got the recording from the airline

190
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,900
and confirmed that you purchased
the ticket for him.

191
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,652
Well, that's…

192
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,195
Yes, I did.

193
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,783
Why exactly did you have to send him
abroad that day of all days?

194
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,869
His…

195
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,330
His wish

196
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,668
was to live in Monaco. That's right.

197
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,463
So you just granted
your housekeeper's wish?

198
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,551
You must tell me the truth, Mr. Han.

199
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,813
I like him.

200
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,525
We care deeply for each other.

201
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,820
He and I

202
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,324
took baths together quite often,

203
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,411
and people got wind of it.

204
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:40,374
So I had no choice but to send him away.
God, I miss him.

205
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:44,003
Hold on. So you're saying

206
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,424
that you two were lovers?

207
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,551
What? Yes.

208
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:55,723
He's cute, isn't he? He's my type.

209
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,940
You see,

210
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:09,403
Ji-yong had already lost everything
by the time he died.

211
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,072
He had nothing left.

212
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,575
I knew him very well.

213
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,036
He probably had no other choice.

214
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,961
I already saw the painter's profile
and provenance.

215
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,715
It's one from the private collections
of the director of Mignon Gallery.

216
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,925
It's an extremely rare piece.

217
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,343
Give me a discount.

218
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,639
Fine. 1.2 billion then.
Take it or leave it.

219
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,105
Mother Emma's never taken such a long
break ever since our Bible study began.

220
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:50,235
I can't help but think that it's related
to Ji-yong's death.

221
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,156
I heard he may have been murdered.

222
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,662
Didn't you get the text
about Bible study being canceled?

223
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,916
Didn't you get my text saying
that I'd still come to see you?

224
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,710
Oh, you did.

225
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,797
Jasmin, why the long face?

226
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,799
Did something happen?

227
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,594
Gosh.

228
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,892
My baby had a car accident.

229
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,102
Oh, no.

230
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,395
My husband, who I want dead,
is perfectly fine,

231
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,314
and my baby got hurt instead.

232
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:31,985
The doctor said he may not be able
to walk ever again.

233
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,364
It's all my fault.

234
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,907
Were you with him?

235
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,555
Baby! So sorry! Oh, no!

236
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,390
Hold on.

237
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,354
Babe, wear this.

238
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,358
Remember the black sweatsuit
I gifted my husband,

239
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,527
hoping he'd jog in it every night

240
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,737
and get hit by a car?

241
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,157
I gave it to my baby.

242
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:25,205
And he wore it
while jogging late at night.

243
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,715
You shouldn't have wished
for your husband's death.

244
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,466
Look at who got hurt instead.

245
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,552
The day Ji-yong died,

246
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:41,138
my husband got into a car accident!

247
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,222
Jasmin.

248
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,643
Is your lover's name Park Jung-do?

249
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,606
How did you know?

250
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,691
Unbelievable.

251
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:55,736
No way.

252
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,239
I can't sleep well.

253
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,868
I feel tense all the time.

254
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,329
I can't seem to be at ease.

255
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,706
I'll prescribe you some sleeping pills.

256
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,625
No, it's okay.

257
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,294
I don't want to rely on them.

258
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,588
I'll overcome this on my own.

259
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,926
What bothers you the most?

260
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,598
The fact that I can

261
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,059
no longer trust anyone.

262
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,813
I don't know
if I can overcome this trauma.

263
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,359
I don't think

264
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,988
I can love anyone ever again.

265
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,035
I have nightmares every night.

266
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,249
I relive that incident.

267
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,126
The day my husband died.

268
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,337
Do you remember it vividly?

269
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,051
It's so vivid that I can't sleep.

270
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,644
I can't forget
the way my husband looked at me.

271
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,944
The look in his eyes as he died…

272
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,127
I want to start afresh
as soon as possible.

273
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,671
I want…

274
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,340
to reset my life.

275
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,217
Are you keeping an eye on me
or protecting me?

276
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,304
It must be the former.

277
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,598
Well, let me explain.

278
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,058
Did Mr. Baek order this?

279
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,478
You're the only person

280
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,439
who can tell us what happened that day.

281
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,985
When did you start getting therapy?

282
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,489
I've been seeing this therapist
ever since I was an actress.

283
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,159
Do you no longer receive counseling
from Mother Emma?

284
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:54,164
It's not healthy to rely on one person.
And the same goes for you.

285
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,043
-Sorry?
-I know I was the only one at the scene,

286
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,546
but do you really think watching me
at all times will get you any leads?

287
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,965
Right.

288
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,934
He fell to his death
after a cardiac arrest.

289
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,936
But now…

290
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,234
HAN JI-YONG

291
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,860
it's suicide?

292
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,489
Ha-joon!

293
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,668
SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE
FROM HAN JI-YONG'S FUNERAL

294
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,549
"The souls of the righteous
are in the hand of God,

295
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,634
and no torment shall touch them.

296
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,638
They seemed, in the view of the foolish,
to be dead.

297
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,224
Their passing away
was thought an affliction,

298
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,435
and their going forth from us,
utter destruction.

299
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,229
But they are in peace.

300
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:03,316
For if to others, indeed,
they seem punished,

301
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,569
yet is their hope full of immortality.

302
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:10,031
Chastised a little,
they shall be greatly blessed

303
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,951
because God tried them

304
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,871
and found them worthy of himself."

305
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,714
Whether it be amnesia

306
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,550
or purely acting…

307
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:31,928
Seo Hi-soo.

308
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,306
Her husband just died,

309
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,892
yet she didn't look sad at all.

310
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,064
Hello, how did it go?

311
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:46,276
Ms. Seo already knew
that you were suspecting her.

312
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,944
Really?

313
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,990
Keep an eye on her.

314
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,075
I need to meet with someone.

315
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,517
Today will be the last day
I lead our Bible study.

316
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,439
I decided to quit being a nun
and become an ordinary person.

317
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:31,446
I failed to guide a lost lamb
whom I had been keeping an eye on.

318
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,698
I have so much to repent of.

319
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,706
Father Paul will be leading
this Bible study once I'm gone.

320
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,959
Mother Emma, must you do this?

321
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,128
Thank you for everything.

322
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,757
During our last session,

323
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,469
I told you
to think about what's truly yours.

324
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,512
Right.

325
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:59,140
You all possess so many things.

326
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,978
You have many houses,

327
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,897
buildings, shares, yachts,

328
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,232
helicopters…

329
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,858
No helicopters yet?

330
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,947
You pretty much have everything you want.

331
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:19,286
But all those things will belong
to someone else when you die.

332
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,538
So they're not truly yours.

333
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,667
However, the things you've said,

334
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,961
the things you've done,

335
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:33,717
and the values that you've strived to keep
throughout your life

336
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:38,179
are what you'll bring with you
when you die.

337
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:46,271
Let's strive to find what's truly ours
during our time in this world.

338
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,700
I've returned as the legal team leader.

339
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,784
I'm here to report.

340
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,295
Thank you. I'm counting on you.

341
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,839
I will repay you
for the trust you have in me.

342
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,467
I'm planning to trust and rely on you
even more.

343
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,094
I'll do my best to end
the police investigation quickly.

344
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,473
Mr. Baek met with Dr. Kim.

345
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,185
Don't worry.

346
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,561
When he arrived,

347
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,564
Mr. Han had already died
of a cardiac arrest.

348
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,066
Also, since his birth mother

349
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,526
also died of a heart-related illness,

350
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,695
it could've been hereditary.

351
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,156
And his family wished
for a private funeral.

352
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,116
That's what Dr. Kim told him.

353
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,053
Ever since Ji-yong died,

354
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,099
I've lost my appetite.

355
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,687
You may find it hard to believe,
but it's true.

356
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,612
You eat instead of me, Ms. Joo.

357
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:22,700
For Chef Jung who worked hard
to prepare this.

358
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,802
No-deok.

359
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,312
No-deok.

360
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:55,191
It's not your baby.

361
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,278
Are you okay with it?

362
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,158
If you are, please…

363
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,704
Please take good care of it, okay?

364
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,831
Take good care of it.

365
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,095
I'm sorry.

366
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,184
In your next life,

367
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,687
I hope…

368
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,566
you'll be born as my real son.

369
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:03,635
You know what?
I think you should know about this.

370
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,221
It's unbelievable.

371
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,350
Jasmin's lover is my niece's husband.

372
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:16,606
Do you mean that cream bun woman's husband
is having an affair with Jasmin?

373
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:18,274
Yes, exactly.

374
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,652
My goodness. This is absurd.

375
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,863
If that was a drama series plot,
people would criticize it

376
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,032
-for being too ridiculous.
-Tell me about it.

377
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,703
Jung-do has such a distinct ideal type.

378
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,456
Does he like women who speak English?

379
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,251
Where's your niece right now?

380
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,919
She's at the hospital.

381
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,756
I think she decided to make up with him
after talking to Mother Emma.

382
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,258
Oh, no.

383
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,385
-What is it?
-Jasmin told me

384
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:48,888
that she'd be visiting him today
at the hospital.

385
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,098
What?

386
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,392
Colossians 3:13.

387
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:56,145
"Bear with each other
and forgive one another

388
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,107
if any of you has a grievance
against someone.

389
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:04,863
Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

390
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,073
That's enough.

391
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,119
I'm going to forgive you.

392
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,915
And I won't try to possess you either.

393
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,086
Even if you become disabled,
I'll be by your side.

394
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,088
Why would I be disabled?

395
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,883
I'm doing my best
with rehabilitation exercises.

396
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:28,428
I'll be golfing again in a year.

397
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,471
Do you think you can?

398
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,349
This is all for the best.

399
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:37,312
Golf courses are full of
pesticide and fine dust. What's the point?

400
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,646
Was Ji-yong's death

401
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,024
too traumatic for you?

402
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,692
I'll be your legs.

403
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,028
Craving anything?

404
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,950
I'm craving Ms. So's calamari.

405
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,620
But she quit.

406
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,456
I saw that coming.

407
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,208
I can't buy you any calamari right now.

408
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,128
I'll get some fried cuttlefish
from the restaurant downstairs.

409
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,673
You're making me nervous.
Why are you being so nice?

410
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,759
You should eat what you crave.

411
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,385
I'll be back.

412
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,397
What brings you here?

413
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,690
What about you?

414
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:27,028
Actually, my boyfriend I told you about
has been hospitalized.

415
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,364
-Really?
-Yes.

416
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,115
What brings you here?

417
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,618
My husband got hurt
and is hospitalized here.

418
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,080
I had no idea that happened.

419
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,415
It's one bad news after another.

420
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,085
Stay strong.

421
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,170
Thank you.

422
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,005
Comfort him well.

423
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,174
I will.

424
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,311
Come in.

425
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,446
How…

426
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,908
How could you come
without telling me beforehand?

427
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,326
-I was worried.
-Then…

428
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,204
you should've called first.

429
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,915
I just came here to tell you this.
I'm sorry.

430
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,168
That tracksuit I gave you

431
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,630
was actually for my husband.

432
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,675
I wanted him dead,

433
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,301
but you got hurt instead.

434
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,805
You should leave.
My wife will be here soon.

435
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,306
Go now.

436
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,102
I understand. We'll talk later, okay?

437
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,979
I want to be forgiven.

438
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,275
By you and the Lord.

439
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,528
What about me?

440
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:57,076
So was that "crazy woman" you talked about

441
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:58,995
me?

442
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,582
Is she your wife?

443
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,376
Do you two know each other?

444
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:27,940
She has anger management issues.

445
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:32,403
She must've already torn
Jasmin's clothes and hair by now.

446
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,739
-She must've pulled out her hair.
-Oh, no.

447
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,657
-Over there.
-Okay.

448
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,221
What will you do?

449
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:01,390
What do you think? I'll stop seeing him.

450
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,646
-I'm serious.
-That's not right.

451
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,065
You're the reason he's injured like that.

452
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,693
I'll meet with your husband.

453
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,948
He deserves to know the truth.

454
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,075
We even have witnesses here.

455
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,452
Listen. I'm seriously not going to see--

456
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,663
You should live with my husband.

457
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,123
What?

458
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,209
You nurse him back to health.

459
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,963
I already have a husband.

460
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,548
I'm not getting a divorce.

461
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,009
It's your choice.

462
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,387
I can tell your husband the truth,

463
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,222
and you'll take responsibility for it.

464
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:45,184
Then he'll divorce you and kick you out
without a single penny.

465
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,479
Or you could divorce him quietly

466
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,566
and start anew with my husband.

467
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,651
You said you weren't getting a divorce.

468
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:54,902
What's gotten into you?

469
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,779
The situation has changed.

470
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,782
That bastard doesn't deserve
my protection anymore.

471
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,538
What a sweet revenge.

472
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,249
After accepting the Lord,
I was going to be nice to him.

473
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:12,378
Jin-hee, if you accepted the Lord,
you should embrace everything.

474
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:14,046
I'm sure God will understand.

475
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,383
You're the reason he's hurt,
so take responsibility!

476
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,093
Responsibility, my ass.

477
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,137
You crazy bitch!

478
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,805
Oh, no!

479
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,558
You bitch!

480
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,020
Guys!

481
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:32,440
-Guys!
-How dare you?

482
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,572
We'll register the villa under your name

483
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,991
and take care of all taxes.

484
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,535
MEMORANDUM

485
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:45,953
Sign it.

486
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,581
You're agreeing never to utter

487
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,541
anything about Han Jin-ho.

488
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,961
What about me?

489
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,090
I heard you met four times.

490
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,842
Yes.

491
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,969
Shouldn't you want to hide that fact?

492
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,347
Aren't you ashamed?

493
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,475
You were involved
with a wealthy, married man.

494
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,186
Shouldn't you ask me
to sign a memorandum instead

495
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,104
to keep it secret?

496
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,399
Why are young women nowadays so shameless?

497
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,318
I know, right?

498
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,028
You should be ashamed.

499
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,322
Stop being a disgrace to women

500
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,200
and have some self-respect from now on.

501
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,202
I doubt you'd listen, though.

502
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,957
But ma'am, I'm sure your husband will
start seeing other women again.

503
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,375
I'm sure he will.

504
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,878
I'm just tidying things up
since the lease has expired.

505
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,297
Another tenant is bound to appear.

506
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,508
Are you comparing me to a tenant?

507
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,593
Shut it and live like
a decent human being.

508
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,720
Even if it's a small house,

509
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,889
live in a place you own.

510
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,654
You're always downing water, Aquaman.

511
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,534
They said I lacked water.

512
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,413
Ms. Yang told me
to drink three liters a day.

513
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,385
-Ju-hee.
-Yes?

514
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:29,390
I found something strange in my room.

515
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,599
What was it?

516
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,563
A male housekeeper
used to use this room, right?

517
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,815
Yes, it was Seong-tae's room.

518
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:42,194
What do these labels read?

519
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,406
I looked them up.

520
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,617
It's phosgene, a type of poisonous gas.

521
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,078
This is hydrochloric acid.

522
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,457
-Why do you think they're here?
-I'm not sure.

523
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,624
Shouldn't we tell?

524
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,380
Act rashly in this house,
and you'll get fired.

525
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,507
It happened to me but I'm back now.

526
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,927
Leave it up to me.

527
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:12,975
What…

528
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,228
You.

529
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:19,023
You do know you'll be done for
if you disclose this, right?

530
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,150
Why? What are these?

531
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,778
How could you have
still not learned anything

532
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,613
after getting doused with wine?

533
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,199
But Ms. Joo…

534
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,952
why would all this be in Seong-tae's room?

535
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,332
Are you sure he's in Monaco?

536
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,291
What?

537
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,836
He couldn't have been killed, right?

538
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,548
Seong-tae? Killed?

539
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,678
-You darn little…
-What did I do wrong?

540
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,888
You little…

541
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:55,559
Keep that mouth shut. Please. I beg you.

542
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,231
Thank you for the food.

543
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,836
When I first came here,

544
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,755
you told me that he liked

545
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:26,966
waffles.

546
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,385
Did I?

547
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,431
I found a waffle maker so I made some.

548
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,598
Have some with him.

549
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,191
Is it good?

550
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,777
Mom's waffles are the best. As always.

551
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,491
Her memories are back.

552
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:37,745
She sang along to Deathman's song
in the car yesterday.

553
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,290
She has an excellent memory.

554
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:56,764
Oh…

555
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,682
We need to talk.

556
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,687
So…

557
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,483
Ji-yong asked you
to get sleeping pills for him

558
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:11,362
-and you did as he asked?
-Yes.

559
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,989
I got the prescription in his stead.

560
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,785
How much did you give him?

561
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,163
Ask for a strong dose.

562
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,456
Quite…

563
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,625
a lot.

564
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,210
It doesn't matter if the dose is lethal.

565
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,753
He didn't mind it being lethal.

566
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,327
The guilt is eating me up.

567
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,747
Don't worry about it.
They'll never find you,

568
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,791
so just relax.

569
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:07,293
I didn't kill him.

570
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,378
I just opened the door for him.

571
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,504
What?

572
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,631
Are you serious?

573
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,675
Someone else killed him!

574
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,762
I didn't kill him.

575
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:21,974
Then who was it?

576
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:36,822
You need to see this.

577
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,580
Mr. Jang found these.

578
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:49,793
Seong-tae left them behind.
The police shouldn't know about them.

579
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,969
Explain. What is this?

580
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,222
"Poisonous gas materials.
How to make mixtures."

581
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,058
Why would you look it up?

582
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:10,022
Why would you look
through someone else's phone…

583
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,651
without permission?

584
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,531
What are you scheming?

585
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,325
-Seong-tae.
-What?

586
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,830
I thought you should know.

587
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,586
Who else knows…

588
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,466
about these bottles?

589
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,551
Ju-hee brought them to me.

590
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,012
Have them come to my study.

591
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,013
Yes, ma'am.

592
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,355
Then do you believe…

593
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,442
Ji-yong committed suicide?

594
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,779
No.

595
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:00,948
I don't think so.

596
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,997
Then who do you think killed him?

597
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:23,220
What brings you here?

598
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,638
I had something to confirm.

599
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:27,766
What a detective.

600
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,478
If you want to talk to the housekeepers,

601
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,189
-you must go through me.
-Didn't I warn you

602
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,442
not to order me around?

603
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,462
What did you tell her?

604
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,839
I told her the truth.

605
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:02,801
That Mr. Han had been taking
the sleeping pills I got for him.

606
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,140
-Did you tell the detective that too?
-Yes.

607
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,435
Okay.

608
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:20,319
In any case, be careful what you say
at all times.

609
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,239
But his death had nothing to do
with the sleeping pills.

610
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,825
It's obvious that someone killed him!

611
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,121
Who?

612
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:35,083
Someone who could put
that stupid Seong-tae up to it!

613
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:49,264
You're nothing but a thieving bitch,
so just shut up.

614
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,308
Got that?

615
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,364
So you found something
in Seong-tae's room?

616
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,908
Well…

617
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,494
I found some suspicious bottles.

618
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:15,082
And you gave them to Ms. Joo?

619
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,084
Yes.

620
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,628
Are you certain
they were in Seong-tae's room?

621
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:26,426
You're Mr. Jang, right?

622
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,470
Yes, ma'am.

623
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,014
How can you prove

624
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,268
that those bottles belonged to Seong-tae,

625
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,979
and not to you?

626
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,989
You two make sure to take care of these.

627
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,825
If you don't, your lives could

628
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:53,829
take a turn for the worse.
It'll be very painful.

629
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,334
Read the contract you signed

630
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:03,005
when you started working here.
Sentence by sentence, word by word.

631
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,424
I trust that you know the details
very well

632
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,384
since you've signed it twice, Ms. Lee.

633
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,052
Yes, ma'am.

634
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,265
I'll read it, ma'am.

635
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:14,933
You may leave.

636
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:16,643
Yes, ma'am.

637
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,171
Can you tell me…

638
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,675
what happened that day? Just me.

639
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,471
You know who killed Han Ji-yong,

640
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:54,973
don't you?

641
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,561
Ms. Seo, I know you didn't lose
your memories.

642
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,690
The motherly gaze

643
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,818
that made me surrender…

644
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,656
You couldn't hide it from Ha-joon.

645
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:15,410
Why do you have to pretend
to not remember anything?

646
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:18,038
What's the reason behind it?

647
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,125
Just turn a blind eye.

648
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,087
It's better for you.

649
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,423
At times, knowing the truth
is a punishment.

650
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,050
Did you…

651
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,679
kill him?

652
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,351
Would anything change
if you knew the truth?

653
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,144
Do you wish he was alive?

654
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:43,438
I don't care…

655
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,608
if it was you.

656
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,238
I just want to know how he died.

657
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,204
The other person on the floor was Ms. Seo.

658
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:03,041
Yes. She told me yesterday.

659
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,585
I guess you two stay in touch.

660
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:10,132
I called her to tell her
that I'll leave the convent soon.

661
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,054
When she told you where Kwak Hyeon-dong,
Kwak Su-chang's brother, was,

662
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,015
what did you decide to do?

663
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,438
If you…

664
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,898
don't turn yourself in,

665
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,821
I'm going to bring the police to that man.

666
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,826
Turn yourself in.

667
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,669
What did he say to that?

668
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:07,898
Mother Emma.

669
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,235
Why did you go…

670
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,197
to Cadenza during the party?

671
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,365
I was looking for Ji-yong.

672
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:23,497
That morning, he called me.

673
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,916
Hey, Ji-yong.

674
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,376
It's all over.

675
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,420
I'm going to leave.

676
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,297
Ji-yong.

677
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:41,306
I couldn't stop thinking about that call.

678
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:48,271
Everyone in the family was at the party
except for Ji-yong.

679
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:49,940
So I asked.

680
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,860
Where's Brother Han Ji-yong?

681
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,445
Cadenza.

682
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,824
I was told that he was at Cadenza.

683
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,327
Who told you that?

684
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,216
INTERNATIONAL CALL

685
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,300
Hello?

686
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,803
Are you the detective in charge
of Han Ji-yong's case?

687
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:20,887
Who is this?

688
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,310
Are you Mr. Kim Seong-tae?

689
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:29,980
I didn't kill him.

690
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:33,149
I just opened the door to the bunker
for him.

691
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,652
Hello? Mr. Kim Seong-tae. Mr. Kim--

692
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,657
I feel better now.

693
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,159
Bunker?

694
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,383
We burned everything that belonged
to Ji-yong's mother.

695
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,218
Father ordered it.

696
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,095
I see.

697
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,600
And he wanted to place…

698
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,895
Ji-yong's belongings there.

699
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:17,360
He wants to spend the rest of his life
repenting in there.

700
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,948
He must've done many wrong things
to Ji-yong.

701
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,036
Hi-soo.

702
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:29,873
You remember everything, don't you?

703
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:34,419
I know you remember everything…

704
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,672
that happened that day.

705
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,095
I can't tell you just yet.

706
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,142
You must have something to protect.

707
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,103
You do too?

708
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:57,817
Yes. I also have something to protect.

709
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,239
I'm leaving this house.

710
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:07,369
Ha-joon and Ms. Lee will be leaving
as well.

711
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,996
They're going abroad.

712
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,000
I guess Rubato…

713
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,878
will be vacant.

714
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,091
I guess so.

715
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,679
I should go.

716
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,107
The tea we just had…

717
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:42,070
is the same one you gave me

718
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,490
when we first met.

719
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,868
You said you liked it…

720
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,622
because it's stronger than espresso

721
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,167
and deeper in flavor than black tea.

722
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,673
This lemongrass taste…

723
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,801
is deeper today than before.

724
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,514
As deep as I care for you.

725
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,202
Excuse me.

726
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,289
Could you take me to the bunker?

727
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,166
Yes, ma'am.

728
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,090
Police.

729
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:45,985
Ma'am.

730
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,614
The detective is back.

731
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,798
Did you have to come here
so late at night?

732
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:10,051
The higher-ups ordered me
to conclude the investigation by tonight.

733
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,012
And I still had two hours or so,

734
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,640
so I came here.

735
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:17,809
The bunker.

736
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,228
May I see it?

737
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:23,606
The place Mr. Han had been to
before he died.

738
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,651
Do you have a search warrant?

739
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,905
You can't barge into our house like this.

740
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:34,200
Besides, it's our father's personal space.

741
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,745
No, it's fine. Be my guest.

742
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,749
Ms. Joo, please escort him to the bunker.

743
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,168
Yes, ma'am.

744
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,170
This way.

745
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,434
This room…

746
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,938
has the best oxygen in this house.

747
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:48,274
When it was built,

748
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:53,071
larger oxygen pipes were used
since it was underground.

749
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,908
Why are you here at this hour?

750
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,250
I told you.

751
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,794
I came here to get some better air.

752
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,090
Ms. Seo.

753
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,636
You remember everything, don't you?

754
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,724
Your entire family is…

755
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,895
trying to disguise this case
as suicide, aren't they?

756
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,731
Ms. Seo.

757
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:32,819
You killed him, didn't you?

758
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,459
Yes.

759
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,671
I killed him.

760
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:58,553
No matter how much I think about it,
it was me.

761
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,347
But I can't remember anything
so what can I do?

762
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,936
I'm afraid I can't help you.

763
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,269
Where are you going?

764
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,677
Please tell me…

765
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,054
why you pretended
to have lost your memories.

766
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,433
I've lost my life and heart.
I feel like I have nothing now.

767
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,893
I have nothing left.

768
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,272
I will comply with your decision.

769
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:16,941
Who did it, then? Who killed Ji-yong?

770
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:19,652
There's a reason you're leaving, right?

771
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:22,363
Leaving is the only option you have left.

772
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,531
Hello?

773
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:27,744
If I go to hell because of my lies,
I will gladly go.

774
01:02:27,827 --> 01:02:31,748
