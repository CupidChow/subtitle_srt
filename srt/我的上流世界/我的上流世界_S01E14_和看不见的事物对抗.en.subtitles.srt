1
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,219
You think life is that easy?

2
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,430
If you toss people away as you please,

3
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,016
do you think you won't face
any consequences?

4
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:00,894
Kang Ja-kyeong, who came into Hyowon

5
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,813
plotting revenge after her child
was taken away by Han Ji-yong.

6
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,358
Seo Hi-soo, who was enraged
that her six years of marriage

7
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,194
to Han Ji-yong were a lie.

8
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:16,367
He fell after the cardiac arrest.

9
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,536
That's what the doctor said.

10
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,209
We must find that missing person.

11
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,048
That person will know everything.

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,926
Who could it be?

13
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,637
Please find them.

14
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,264
I'm dying to know as well.

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,141
Does anyone

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,311
deserve to die?

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,608
One thing is certain.

18
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:52,445
This person deserved to die…

19
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,824
in someone's eyes.

20
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,586
This way.

21
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,842
Ms. Yang, this is the detective.

22
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,664
This is the chairman's study.
Please come in.

23
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,060
I think I'm done here.

24
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,188
Okay. Shall we go out now?

25
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,818
Get out.

26
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,237
Get out of my house. Get out right now!

27
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,573
I need your cooperation
to find out why he died.

28
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,784
The doctor said he died of a heart attack.

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,954
Why are you causing this ruckus
after only listening to that nun?

30
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:29,167
Has the possibility that she might
be lying not crossed your mind?

31
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,295
She had secretly been in contact
with Ji-yong for a long time.

32
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,382
That nun and Ji-yong's birth mother
used to be close friends.

33
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,593
And she hid that from us!

34
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:43,681
How could you believe that lying wench
and barge in to search my house like this?

35
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,308
Get out of here! Now!

36
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,102
-Get out of my house now!
-I'll show you out.

37
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,446
I'm Detective Hwang.

38
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,949
Yes. I got the call.

39
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,159
You could have waited at the station.

40
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,328
I wanted to see
the inside of the house, too.

41
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,332
It's been a week since the accident.
There's no point.

42
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,252
Gosh. That's not why I wanted to go in.

43
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,170
I wanted to see that fancy house.

44
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,256
It wasn't that great.

45
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,133
Maybe it's because it's big.
It was drafty.

46
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,844
Anyway, I hope we can work well together.

47
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,430
Let's go to your station.

48
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,183
I need to take a look
at Kwak Su-chang's case file first.

49
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,270
The police have begun investigating

50
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,147
the death of Mr. Han Ji-yong of Hyowon
a week after his death.

51
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,358
On the 3rd,
the day before the shareholders' meeting

52
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,819
to approve his new position
as the chairman,

53
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:41,698
the late Mr. Han died of a cardiac arrest
in his home at the age of 39.

54
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,200
His funeral was held privately
as his family wished.

55
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,829
However, as a witness testified
about what happened that day,

56
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,872
the police have started an investigation.

57
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,000
SEOUL GWANGUN POLICE STATION

58
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,001
I mean…

59
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,296
Why did the witness think
that it was a murder case?

60
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,048
She said there was a weapon
covered in blood on the floor,

61
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,844
and it was gone along
with the person lying next to Han Ji-yong

62
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,095
when she came back.

63
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,307
-A weapon?
-This will be a tough case to crack.

64
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,808
The crime scene is gone.

65
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,477
And we can't search the company, either.

66
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,980
That's not high enough to die from.

67
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,400
But if he was pushed and had a concussion,
it'd be enough to kill him.

68
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,444
To push him off with an intent to kill,

69
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,738
the culprit should be strong enough
to make him

70
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,197
unable to defend himself.

71
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,617
Then it probably wasn't a woman.

72
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,913
The only guy at the house
at that time was Kim Seong-tae.

73
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,999
Park Jung-do, Han Jin-hee's husband,

74
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,626
had a car accident that night,
so he wasn't there.

75
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,546
And Han Jin-ho visited him
at the hospital.

76
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,506
That's the weirdest part, isn't it?

77
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,968
It was his son's engagement party,
but he went to visit his brother-in-law?

78
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,929
He left in the middle
of the engagement party.

79
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,975
He isn't on good terms with his son,
while he and his brother-in-law are close.

80
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,935
That's what the nun told me.

81
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,772
We just have to find one person.

82
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,525
The other person who fell to the floor

83
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,652
besides Han Ji-yong.

84
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,489
Two people fell from the same height,

85
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,992
but one of them died
and the other came out unscathed?

86
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,955
The one who survived
must have visited the hospital.

87
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,052
Ms. Seo, Dr. Kim is here.

88
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,471
Your checkup is today.

89
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,889
Thank you, Kyeong-hye.

90
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,857
She remembers my name?

91
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,253
EPISODE 14
FIGHTING IN THE DARK

92
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:10,096
4 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

93
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,891
UNLOCKED

94
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,170
LOCKED

95
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,739
You'll easily get 20 billion won.

96
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,407
I want you

97
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,451
to kill Ji-yong.

98
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,800
Our shift isn't over.
What are you doing here?

99
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,010
Well…

100
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,137
I don't feel so good.

101
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,599
What about Mr. Han?
Did you escort him to the bunker?

102
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,768
Yes. Gosh, My stomach.

103
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,810
Okay.

104
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,198
UNLOCKED

105
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,915
Ji-yong.

106
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,042
Yes, Father.

107
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,045
Starting today,

108
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,466
I want to be your real father.

109
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,262
I want to swear it
in front of your mother.

110
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,808
I've always considered you my real son,

111
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,936
and I want to do my duty
as your father now.

112
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,107
Please let go of everything.

113
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,442
If you've done something wrong,

114
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,113
apologize and ask for forgiveness.
Turn over a new leaf.

115
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,532
You still have a lot of time left.

116
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,286
You're young enough to start a new life!

117
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,999
While everyone still wants to help you,
you must turn back.

118
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,167
I'm asking this as your father!

119
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,879
Let go of everything.

120
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,507
Wash it all out.

121
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,972
I cannot do that.

122
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,053
Have you been well?

123
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,139
Where are we?

124
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,439
Can you do me a favor?

125
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,692
Can you get

126
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,195
a prescription in my stead?

127
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,251
Ask for a strong dose.

128
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,462
It doesn't matter if the dose is lethal.

129
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,322
I'll get going.

130
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,373
Han Ji-yong's hobby

131
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,377
was watching two men fight in the ring.

132
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,507
And the men had to
beat each other up for money.

133
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,221
Then this man came
dangerously close to death.

134
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,476
The person who beat him up like this

135
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:09,687
is his older brother.

136
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,815
But his older brother

137
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,152
was murdered a few days ago

138
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,655
because he was going to expose

139
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,992
Han Ji-yong's secret to the press.

140
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,166
Ji-yong has been looking for this man
with his eyes peeled.

141
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,295
Mother Emma.

142
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,214
Decide.

143
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,428
Help him cover up his crime
by telling him this man is here.

144
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,596
Or…

145
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,391
persuade him

146
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,352
to admit his crimes and turn himself in.

147
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,565
I'll leave that…

148
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,860
up to you.

149
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,783
Ms. Seo Hi-soo and I…

150
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,621
wanted to give Han Ji-yong a chance.

151
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,585
He was falling down to the bitter end,

152
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,379
and we had to put a stop to it.

153
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,716
Why?

154
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,635
Because he was…

155
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,597
Ha-joon's father.

156
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,213
Ha-joon.

157
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:03,509
Don't feel small just because you can't
speak English when you're in the States.

158
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,182
No one is good at first.

159
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,767
But you're my son,

160
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,436
so you must become the best.

161
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,650
After…

162
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,236
I take care of urgent matters,

163
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,447
I will visit you very often.

164
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,286
Dad.

165
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,204
Yes?

166
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,624
Take care of yourself
even if I'm not here.

167
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,378
Okay.

168
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,882
Dad.

169
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,844
I love you.

170
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,251
That was the last I saw of him.

171
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,090
Ji-yong…

172
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,054
believed Ha-joon belonged to him
and him alone.

173
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:34,224
That was probably the only way
he could love Ha-joon.

174
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,853
Mother Emma is here.

175
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,648
I'm here to see Ji-yong.

176
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,982
"Ji-yong"?

177
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,192
I see.

178
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,111
Please escort her to Rubato.

179
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,761
If we repent of our sins,

180
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,680
Jesus will forgive us, right?

181
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,892
Evil is never punished in this world.

182
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,310
I've realized that.

183
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,312
Retributive justice is

184
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,481
served randomly.

185
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,151
Even sins have an end, my brother.

186
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,030
Jesus, who had not committed any sins,
was crucified

187
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,367
to save that cruel murderer, Barabbas.

188
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,328
That's how Jesus thinks.

189
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,207
He already died in place
of all the sinners. He died for us.

190
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,167
So I'm sure

191
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,254
he'll forgive me even if I commit sins.

192
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,424
Yes, he will.

193
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,050
But he'll also punish you.

194
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,429
If you knowingly commit sins,

195
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,389
you won't be forgiven.

196
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,061
Even if the sinner is an angel,

197
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,231
God doesn't hesitate
to throw them into Hell.

198
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,152
And they will stay
in the gloomy pits of darkness

199
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,820
until the Day of Reckoning.

200
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,614
That's not fair.

201
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,367
Jesus can't do that!

202
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,080
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,783
On that day,

204
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,537
Mother Emma must have tried everything
to change Han Ji-yong's mind.

205
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,460
Because she would have understood
what Hi-soo was going through.

206
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,982
Ji-yong.

207
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,486
You should have never committed such sins.

208
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,739
Why did you do it?

209
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,493
I've achieved everything.

210
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,913
I have taken back everything

211
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,624
God took away from me on my own.

212
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,088
I was utterly hurt and lonely

213
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,508
because I was powerless.

214
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,343
But I have power now.

215
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,847
There's nothing I can't do
in this world now.

216
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,808
So Mother Emma,

217
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,020
do not pray for me anymore.

218
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,607
Instead,

219
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,235
stop Hi-soo for me.

220
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,823
Make her stop.
She's trying to bring me down.

221
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,542
Unless you're going to help me, get out.

222
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,627
Now.

223
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,378
Ji-yong.

224
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,756
The Lord

225
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,133
loves you.

226
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,139
He loves you so much.

227
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,517
You cannot forget that.

228
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,776
Then tell that God of yours

229
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,737
to give up on me.

230
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,665
Oh, Lord.

231
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,875
Lord.

232
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,129
The shareholders' meeting
must be called quietly.

233
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,341
Make it look like it's one
of those regular shareholders' meetings,

234
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,176
so the board won't suspect anything.

235
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,181
Everyone's turned their back on Ji-yong,

236
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,559
but there are always fools in any crowd.

237
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,982
All of us must get through
the last five days.

238
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,441
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,749
Thank you…

240
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,585
for everything.

241
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,467
Take good care

242
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,137
of Ha-joon.

243
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,520
What will you do…

244
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,482
with Ji-yong?

245
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,240
God will…

246
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,326
help us all.

247
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:22,924
3 DAYS BEFORE THE MURDER

248
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:35,979
Hello?

249
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,023
-This is Gwangun Station.
-Inspector Hwang.

250
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,483
Cho Beom-gu has been arrested.

251
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,569
The suspect for killing Kwak Su-chang.

252
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,404
Really?

253
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,740
Han Ji-yong, you're screwed now.

254
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,910
I bet Ji-yong instigated it.
He's the real culprit.

255
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,787
You must come down to the station.

256
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,331
You must arrest Ji-yong
and interrogate him now!

257
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,583
We don't know what he might do next.

258
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,922
Aren't you glad to see them again?

259
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,804
Right here. Your boss.

260
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,311
Kill him.

261
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,190
Know that if you get caught
and give them my name,

262
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,775
your sentence won't be reduced.

263
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,611
Just tell them you had a grudge.

264
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,655
Won't that be better for you?

265
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,990
You'll be making money in jail.

266
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:34,454
A sum of money you'll never make
out here no matter how hard you work.

267
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,373
Cho Beom-gu.

268
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,292
We have confirmed that you roamed

269
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:42,796
around Kwak Su-chang's house
for four hours on the day of his murder.

270
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,300
Cho Beom-gu didn't leave
any DNA evidence at the scene

271
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,137
when he murdered Kwak Su-chang.

272
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,721
But for some reason,

273
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:55,642
he confessed to the murder
when all the evidence was circumstantial.

274
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,604
He never said
that Han Ji-yong paid him to kill Kwak.

275
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,399
He only said it was a personal grudge.

276
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,402
I'm sure Cho got paid a boatload of money.

277
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:12,909
It was a burner phone.

278
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,830
The phone belonged to a 63-year-old
homeless dude in Euljiro Station.

279
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,459
Then we just have to find
the burner phone, right?

280
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,170
Well, yes.

281
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,632
But we couldn't find the burner phone.

282
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,428
I'm sure Han Ji-yong
had already gotten rid of it.

283
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,681
But we had a definite piece of evidence.

284
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,807
Cho Gyeong-cheol.

285
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,895
The record of the transaction
between Ji-yong and the fight broker

286
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,063
was the smoking gun.

287
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,399
Once that came to light,

288
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,444
Cho Beom-gu had no choice but to confess.

289
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,239
Hello?

290
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,201
What did you say?

291
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,121
You're postponing my appointment?

292
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,707
Mr. Park.

293
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,417
You can't do this to me.

294
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,670
You can't treat me
and what I've achieved like this

295
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,756
just because of that crazy woman's video.

296
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,926
You must think about our company's future.

297
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,428
Hello?

298
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,472
Hello…

299
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,312
He had his back to the wall.

300
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:28,860
And I think
someone had something big on him.

301
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,740
He started to get extremely anxious

302
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,325
a few days before his death.

303
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,663
1 DAY BEFORE THE MURDER

304
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,776
-Seong-tae.
-Put it there.

305
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:10,902
-Are you okay?
-Okay.

306
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:12,654
You should be careful.

307
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,030
Be careful over here.

308
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,032
-Oh, my.
-Gosh. This is beautiful.

309
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,826
Right?

310
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,078
-Ta-da.
-So beautiful.

311
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,539
-Go over there.
-Congratulations.

312
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,041
-Be careful getting up.
-Hurry.

313
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,126
Okay.

314
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,130
Seong-tae.

315
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,507
What's up with you today?

316
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,967
I…

317
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,436
DAY OF THE MURDER

318
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,442
10 DAYS AFTER THE MURDER

319
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,952
Shouldn't we send Ha-joon and his mom

320
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,788
back to the States?

321
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,957
You're Ha-joon's mother.

322
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,294
It's important to keep
Ha-joon emotionally stable.

323
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,879
His father is gone,

324
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,465
and his mother doesn't even recognize him.

325
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,969
Do you think he should be away from home
at a time like this?

326
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,973
He must accept his situation now.

327
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,934
I don't think
time will solve this problem.

328
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,022
Besides, Ms. Lee Hye-jin,
Ha-joon's birth mother…

329
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,360
She's his real mother.

330
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,697
His father is gone.

331
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,325
And I'm not related to Ha-joon by blood

332
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,496
He's Ji-yong's son.

333
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,165
We'll raise him.

334
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,544
You're practically strangers to him.

335
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:19,507
Only Ji-yong and that tutor
are biologically related to Ha-joon.

336
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,135
Now that Ji-yong is dead,

337
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,971
That child doesn't have to stay here.

338
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,431
I'll also be leaving soon.

339
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,976
Goodness.

340
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,479
That child?

341
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,732
In the past, you would have
jumped into a fire for Ha-joon.

342
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,358
How can you be like this?

343
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,861
You should

344
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,072
raise Ha-joon here.

345
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,533
And have that tutor leave.

346
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,329
Ha-joon is a stranger to me.

347
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:50,705
I can't raise him.

348
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,377
You should focus
on bringing your memories back first.

349
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:59,047
Let's talk again
once you remember everything.

350
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,008
Ha-joon was everything to you.

351
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,636
He's a cute boy.

352
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,515
Wherever he goes, he'll be loved.

353
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,769
His birth mother should raise him.

354
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,605
Let her do that for his sake.

355
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,106
Your memories will come back.

356
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,067
Do as I say.

357
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,237
Actually, that scares me.

358
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,906
I hope they don't come back.

359
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,660
I don't want to know what I saw that day.

360
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,870
I wonder how shocking it was

361
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,583
that my brain became completely blank?

362
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,921
I must really not want to remember it.

363
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,549
Like the detective said,

364
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,969
someone could have murdered Ji-yong.

365
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,761
Ha-joon, let's have some of this.

366
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:36,728
Especially at times like this,
you must stay strong and healthy.

367
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,939
I'm sure your mom would want that. Right?

368
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,875
There's something I must tell my mom.

369
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,256
I made a promise to her.

370
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,259
Have you ever cried alone?

371
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,930
I don't want to tell you.

372
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,724
Are you thinking about something
that might break my heart?

373
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,018
Yes.

374
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,896
I don't want there
to be any secrets between us.

375
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,566
Okay. No secrets.

376
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,692
Pinky promise.

377
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,946
Pinky promise.

378
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,242
But I won't tell you now.

379
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,747
Okay, but you have to tell me
some other time.

380
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,292
After you showed up,

381
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,338
I was scared that she'd leave,

382
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:47,632
so I cried.

383
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,887
Losing my mom is…

384
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,391
what I'm afraid of the most

385
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,393
in the whole world.

386
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,897
But there's something
I'm more afraid of now.

387
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,275
Not being remembered by my mom.

388
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:08,611
Ha-joon.

389
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,532
Your mom…

390
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,660
She'll come back to her old self.

391
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,662
Dad is gone now.

392
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,959
So if my mom can't remember me,

393
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,421
what should I do?

394
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,339
No.

395
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,384
You have your mom

396
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,178
as well as me.

397
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,812
You'll be okay, Ha-joon.
Everything will be okay.

398
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,482
I promise. Everything will be okay.

399
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,012
Hey.

400
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,933
So the police started an investigation.

401
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,561
-Yes.
-Jin-ho.

402
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,857
There's another family secret
I don't know about, right?

403
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,776
If there is, tell me.

404
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,989
Is Jin-hee really
the chairman's biological daughter?

405
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,115
You bastard.

406
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,287
What kind of curse is this?

407
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,373
How could this happen to me?

408
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,335
I need physical therapy for a year.

409
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,712
And I might not

410
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,757
be able to walk ever again.

411
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,260
You'll be able to walk again. Don't worry.

412
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,474
So why did you have to fight with her
that day of all days

413
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,851
and miss the party?

414
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,771
Who hit you with a car?

415
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,358
Hey, what the hell happened?

416
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,449
Hello?

417
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,159
I'm still hurt.

418
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,496
I'm okay. I'll call you back.

419
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,374
Who is it?

420
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,589
I feel bad for Ji-yong.

421
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,092
Besides his death,

422
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,636
no one in the family was on his side.

423
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,429
I didn't either.

424
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,516
Everyone in our family is lonely.

425
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,060
I feel bad for all of them.

426
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,856
Everyone in our family was lonely.

427
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,656
May I come in, Mother Emma?

428
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:15,923
Oh, my.

429
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,302
You managed to pick the chair
you always sat on.

430
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,723
I guess it's muscle memory.

431
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,519
I guess you were very special to me.

432
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,440
You were very special to me, too.

433
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,401
It took almost a day to read
all of the text messages

434
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,695
between you and me.

435
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,114
I'm sure.

436
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,366
We talked a lot via text messages.

437
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,414
This is the last message I sent

438
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,791
to you.

439
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,044
"Mother Emma,

440
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:56,214
you've secretly been
meeting with Ji-yong, right?

441
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,260
Tell me the whole truth."

442
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:07,892
You didn't write back

443
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,145
after reading this message.

444
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,320
I want to hear your answer to my question.

445
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,577
Whenever I thought about Ji-yong,

446
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,039
my heart ached.

447
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:35,711
I've known him
ever since he was in his mom's belly.

448
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,215
After he was born, I watched him

449
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,343
growing up from a distance.

450
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,680
I thought he was living a good life.

451
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,934
If I only knew

452
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,438
that Ji-yong had no one
to turn to in that family…

453
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:09,161
It's already been 20 years
since your mother passed away.

454
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,543
She must be happy
to have a son who always loves her

455
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,545
so dearly.

456
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,507
Do you think I come back every year
because I love her?

457
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,425
What?

458
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:29,515
I come because I don't want to forget
what she did to me.

459
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,020
-Do you see it?
-Goodness.

460
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,357
When I was nine,

461
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,861
my mother got angry,
broke some glass, and threw it at me.

462
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,279
My goodness.

463
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,490
My mom believed I was the source
of all her misfortune.

464
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,410
She hated me
because I took after my biological dad.

465
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,705
It wasn't my fault, though.

466
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,668
But do you know what's even shittier?

467
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,673
My mother who abused me
was my only biological family,

468
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:07,053
so there was no one in the family
I could talk to about this.

469
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,096
Ji-yong.

470
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,142
I should have come to meet you sooner.

471
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,270
If I had even one person
who believed in me

472
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,148
and loved me,

473
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,901
I would've been different.

474
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,656
It's not too late.

475
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,619
I will listen to all of your stories
in place of your mother.

476
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,122
It's too late.

477
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,085
What do you mean?

478
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,714
I do a lot of bad things in secret.

479
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,884
Everyone does bad things.

480
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:48,969
It's worse than you think.

481
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,139
I even killed someone.

482
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,810
You're joking, right?

483
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,191
Of course.

484
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:07,947
But I might kill soon.

485
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,368
Ji-yong.

486
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,581
You think you're the only person
abused and never loved by their mother?

487
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:20,501
That doesn't mean they turn out bad.

488
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,212
There are way more people

489
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,048
who overcome their hardships
and lead good lives.

490
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,467
Don't justify your sins.

491
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,594
You won't be forgiven.

492
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,849
Who has the right to forgive me?

493
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,559
No one does.

494
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,979
No one in the world
has the right to do that.

495
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,152
Don't tell me God does.

496
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,863
Because I don't believe in God.

497
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,739
After that day,

498
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,243
I was always by his side.

499
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,913
I was worried that
he might go down the wrong path.

500
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,209
That's how I got to know you.

501
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,961
Do you…

502
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,382
-pity Han Ji-yong?
-Of course.

503
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,677
My heart breaks for his soul.

504
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,638
My heart is in great pain.

505
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,184
It was my fault
for not being able to stop him.

506
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,730
I will have to repent of my failure
until the day I die.

507
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,111
You said

508
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,073
you saw me at the staircase that day.

509
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,993
Was it really me?

510
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,330
Yes.

511
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,881
It was you.

512
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:53,302
But why didn't you report it
to the police right away?

513
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:58,015
To tell you the truth,
I suspected you at first.

514
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,059
Based on what I saw.

515
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,770
So I prayed to the Lord.

516
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,440
I asked for his guidance.

517
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,442
Then…

518
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:13,781
I found out that you'd lost your memories.

519
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,409
That's when I remembered

520
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,872
that there was one more person.

521
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:28,212
I thought you may also have been a victim.

522
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,422
Do you…

523
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,093
trust me?

524
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,350
Don't be heartbroken.

525
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,519
It's not your fault.

526
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,896
It was Ji-yong's fate.

527
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,773
That's not what's bothering me.

528
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,652
The police came to the house.

529
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,947
-That makes me uneasy.
-Mom.

530
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,243
You know something, don't you?
You didn't tell me everything, right?

531
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:00,786
No way.

532
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,539
-There is something.
-Someone…

533
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,672
murdered Ji-yong.

534
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,384
I wonder
who fell from the staircase with Ji-yong.

535
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:19,388
That's what the nun said,
but it might not be true.

536
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,098
Everyone seems suspicious.

537
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,895
You didn't do it, right?

538
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,773
What are you talking about?

539
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,609
It wasn't…

540
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:33,611
you, right?

541
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,119
You startled me.

542
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,213
Out with it.

543
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,801
-I'm sure you know.
-Know what?

544
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,553
Where Seong-tae went.

545
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,473
I don't.

546
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,685
Gosh, that asshole.
He took off without me.

547
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,688
Did you love him?

548
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,357
I don't know.

549
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,901
After committing grand larceny like that,

550
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,612
living here probably
won't be easy for you.

551
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,407
I'm so proud of you.
I guess you gave up on the diamond.

552
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,576
I didn't want to steal it
in the first place.

553
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,370
He wanted to steal it and leave here.

554
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,414
That's not what he told me.

555
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,878
Ms. Joo. Did Seong-tae…

556
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:39,176
Did Seong-tae kill Mr. Han Ji-yong?

557
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,720
He did, didn't he?

558
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,847
I mean, it's odd.

559
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:47,142
Why did he quit his job and leave Korea

560
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:50,312
the day after Mr. Han's death,
of all days?

561
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:51,980
Without telling me anything.

562
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:00,406
Actually, that's what I wanted to ask you.

563
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,116
But you're asking me.

564
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,912
-You don't know why?
-No.

565
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,290
I know nothing. He betrayed me.

566
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,423
I can't trust anyone
from this place anymore.

567
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,554
-Kyeong-hye.
-What?

568
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,014
Stop taking sleeping pills.
It'll ruin your health.

569
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,308
I'm not the one taking them.

570
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,486
Were you waiting for me?

571
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,156
Yes.

572
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,617
You must get your memories back.

573
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,371
You and I…

574
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,707
have a lot to discuss.

What are you doing here?

583
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,388
Ha-joon wanted to see you.

584
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,390
I thought you'd be here.

585
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,976
Mom. Can you cook me ramyeon?

586
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:54,645
Ramyeon?

587
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:57,481
You and I had ramyeon here.

588
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,565
Don't you remember?

589
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,904
You said
we'd have fried chicken here, too.

590
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,241
Ha-joon.

591
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,451
You showed me how to eat ramyeon
from a lid.

592
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,871
We even played rock-paper-scissors.
Why don't you remember that?

593
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,331
Why?

NIGHT OF MEMORY

NIGHT OF MEMORY SEO HI-SOO

596
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:44,152
"Surprisingly, Seo Hi-soo debuted
in the independent film, Night of Memory.

597
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,989
However, due to a sex scandal
of the male lead, Jin Si-han,

598
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,490
the movie was never released.

599
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,742
Nonetheless, the actress delivered

600
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,414
an incredible performance
playing a woman suffering from amnesia.

601
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,334
It was hard to believe
she was a rookie actress."

602
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,929
Hi. Look up Seo Hi-soo's medical record

603
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,848
and see if she really lost her memories.

604
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,808
It might…

605
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,686
be all an act.

606
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,401
The presidents of the subsidiaries
have full confidence in you.

607
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,239
Capital isn't the only thing
that gets a company going.

608
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:33,285
We must respect and supervise
the leaders of our company.

609
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,871
We all need to work together.

610
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,624
I'll never allow any discord
within the company.

611
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,503
I believe in you.

612
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,882
Soo-hyuk is coming back today, right?

613
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:48,967
Yes, Father.

614
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,677
Have him come to the company.

615
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:52,971
I will.

616
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,890
Also

617
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,224
about

618
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,685
my bunker…

619
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,438
I want all of her stuff

620
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,899
to be burned

621
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:08,945
and put next to Ji-yong's grave.

622
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:11,573
Okay.

623
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,840
Hey.

624
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,679
Hi-soo.

625
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:44,064
I'm going to an art auction today.
Come with me. It'll be fun.

626
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,484
But I'm meeting my friends today.

627
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,194
You are?

628
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:54,074
I'm having brunch with some friends
I made when I was an actress.

629
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,664
That's good. You must meet some people.
Don't avoid them.

630
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,249
Okay.

631
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,339
Yes. Jung Seo-hyun speaking.

632
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,674
This is Baek Dong-hun.

633
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,718
Hello.

634
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,387
I would like to meet with you today.

635
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,265
I'm available for the next hour.
Please come to the house.

636
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,857
These people are tenacious.

637
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:37,534
He's way too muscular.
Do you think you can do this job?

638
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,910
I will work

639
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,204
this macular body to the bone.

640
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,332
We won't ask you to do
physically demanding tasks.

641
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,294
Okay.

642
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,882
So you were born on September 3, 1985
on the witching hour…

643
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:55,635
We need someone who's tight-lipped,

644
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,804
not muscular.

645
00:50:57,888 --> 00:51:00,932
Well, you don't have to worry about that.

646
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,185
Okay. You can go.

647
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:06,229
We'll contact you later.

648
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:17,866
Why did you have to
let him into the house?

649
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:21,036
You could've interviewed him outside
and brought him in

650
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:23,038
once you decide to hire him.

651
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,373
Because I was leaning toward hiring him.

652
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:28,168
After all, Mr. Ha recommended him.

653
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:32,589
-What do you think?
-I see a lot of wood and earth in him.

654
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,257
But he lacks water.

655
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,761
Well, I'm sure he's tight-lipped
and will do his job well.

656
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,054
You should hire him.

657
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,307
You said he lacks water.

658
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,185
Is he going to be okay
if he drinks a lot of water?

659
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,917
I'll divorce you.

660
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,380
-What?
-It was your wish.

661
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,760
Jin-hee, this isn't right.

662
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,638
You can't abandon me when I'm injured.

663
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:26,226
Look at the situation you're in.
Timing is a funny thing.

664
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:30,188
No one will believe me,
but I was going to divorce you.

665
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,065
No. I can't.

666
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,861
Stay by my side until I can walk again.

667
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,864
You're ridiculous.

668
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:41,449
Before the accident,
you were so eager to leave me.

669
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:43,410
Now, you'll stay with me?

670
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,413
Look who's talking.
You're showing your true colors!

671
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,790
What are you talking about?

672
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,001
You're the one who wanted to divorce me!

673
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,087
Hey, keep it down.
You can't fight in here.

674
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,255
Let's get a divorce.

675
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,841
No, I won't. Never.

676
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:03,680
You'll have to stay with me
even if I turn into a zombie.

677
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,186
My gosh. Come on!

678
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,027
Do you remember

679
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,530
you had a big fight with your stylist
on a film set?

680
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,823
When are you talking about?

681
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,784
It was a really hot day in August of 2004.

682
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,830
Your stylist threw a fit because you got
itch relief gel on the sponsored clothes.

683
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,708
Your memory is amazing.

684
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:33,710
You still remember that?

685
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:37,422
She was known for her excellent memory.
She memorized lines faster than anyone.

686
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:40,091
Right. I still remember all of my lines.

687
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,319
Do you think
Ms. Seo really lost her memories?

688
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,323
And the person lying unconscious
next to Mr. Han,

689
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:07,494
who was gone when Mother Emma came back,
who do you think it was?

690
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,496
Why are you asking me that?

691
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,665
That person must've gotten hurt badly.

692
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,292
I'm sorry to ask,

693
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,379
but could you show me your arm?

694
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,564
Mr. Baek, it's Seo Hi-soo.

695
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:40,694
She hurt her ribs badly,
had a pelvic fracture,

696
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,988
and hurt her head badly,
so she had an MRI scan.

697
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,323
She came to the ER
on the day of the incident,

698
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:48,243
then received orthopedic treatment
for the next two days.

699
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:51,705
The person passed out on the floor
next to Han Ji-yong was Seo Hi-soo.

700
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,671
I hurt my finger

701
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,590
when I was moving
a sculpture at my art museum.

702
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,301
The metal piece was heavy.

703
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,387
The person passed out next to Han Ji-yong

704
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,015
was Ms. Seo.

705
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,359
Did you know?

706
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,320
You don't seem surprised.

707
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:27,991
Since she fell from the staircase,

708
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:32,078
it's very likely
that Ms. Seo really lost her memories.

709
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,663
I guess so.

710
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,670
Then who do you think was
at the top of the stairs?

711
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,214
I would like to check your house.

712
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,340
Very well.

713
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,055
Let me escort you.

714
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:54,035
I found Han Ji-yong dead.

715
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:02,627
And there was someone else
at the top of the stairs.

716
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,380
It was Ms. Seo Hi-soo.

717
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,342
Did it ever cross your mind
that she might be lying?

718
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:31,072
On the day of the incident,
who took Ms. Seo to the hospital?

719
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,201
The dashcam in Ms. Seo's car
was turned off that night.

720
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,122
And she was alone in all of the security
footage at the hospital.

721
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,124
Alone when she was hurt that badly.

722
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:42,750
I don't know.

723
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:49,299
It's odd enough that she went to
a regular ER when the family has a doctor,

724
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:54,679
but Ms. Seo's car entered the parking lot
of the hospital around that time,

725
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:56,389
not an ambulance.

726
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,851
It means someone drove her car
to take her to the ER.

727
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:02,061
She couldn't have driven in that state.

728
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,023
-Who could it be?
-Are you suggesting

729
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:09,569
that I drove Ms. Seo's car
to the hospital?

730
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:13,531
We obtained the dashcam footage
from other cars

731
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,326
to find out who came to the ER with her.

732
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,495
Stop.

733
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,083
How long will it take
to identify the face?

734
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,879
I need to reduce noise
and analyze the footage.

735
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,006
By tomorrow?

736
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,467
On the day of the incident,

737
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,512
I was in Boston with Ha-joon.

738
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,679
Don't lie.

739
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:40,391
I already checked your travel history.
Stop lying.

740
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,310
You didn't even go to the States.

741
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,232
That's ridiculous.

742
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,443
Check again.

743
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:54,447
Come to my house if you need
further questioning. I'm a bit busy.

744
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,994
Yes. I'm almost done.

745
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:02,372
I would like to see
Mr. Han Ji-yong's study.

746
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,582
Okay. This way.

747
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,712
He had his back to the wall.

748
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:13,967
And I think
someone had something big on him.

749
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:17,804
He started to get extremely anxious.

750
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,458
Kim Seong-tae.

751
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,589
Darn it.

752
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:55,216
I can't reach Kim Seong-tae on his phone.

753
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,260
Maybe he didn't get the roaming service.

754
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,013
Monaco isn't a member of Interpol,

755
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,431
and he's not a suspect.

756
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,182
So we can't track him down.

757
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:06,853
We really need his statement.
He's the one holding the key.

758
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,522
Right. Ms. Lee Hye-jin claims

759
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:13,234
she was in the States that day.
Did you check her travel records?

760
01:00:15,528 --> 01:00:16,821
Lee Hye-jin?

761
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,251
I have a few things to ask Ha-joon.

762
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:34,422
I'll be careful not to say anything to
hurt his feelings. Just a few questions.

763
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:36,549
Okay.

764
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,177
And I need his mother to be present.

765
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:41,054
Please come with me.

766
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,890
His English lesson will be over soon.
Let's go to him.

767
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,058
Okay.

768
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:04,661
Mom!

769
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,539
I'll go and bring him here.
You can stay here.

770
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,543
Stay there! I'll cross the street!

771
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,588
Ha-joon!

772
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,429
Are you okay, Ha-joon?

773
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,599
I told you dozens of times
not to cross when you see a car.

774
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,184
Mom.

775
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,397
Han Ha-joon.

776
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:36,067
I told you that you're the only person
who can protect yourself.

777
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,112
You're the only person
who can protect yourself.

778
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,321
So you have to be strong.

779
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,865
Whatever happens,
I'll be right behind you.

780
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,243
So don't be afraid of anything.

781
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:02,009
The face has come up

782
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,017
RESTORED FOOTAGE

783
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,657
Yes.

784
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:28,786
Yes. What is it? Did you check
Lee Hye-jin's travel history?

785
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,539
Really?

786
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,416
Okay.

787
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:56,147
Ms. Lee was indeed in the States
on the day of the incident.

788
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:57,273
The thing is,

789
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,776
the case file says
the tutor's name is Kang Ja-kyeong.

790
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:00,902
So things got mixed up.

791
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,864
And we got a photo of the person
who drove Ms. Seo to the ER.

792
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,324
I'll send it to you now.

793
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,294
Why are you rushing
the engagement ceremony?

794
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,963
It also celebrates
a new beginning for Hyowon.

795
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,258
And it just happened to be on the day
of Han Ji-yong's death.

796
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:50,469
I found something strange inside the room.

797
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,930
Why would all this be in Seong-tae's room?

798
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,266
I heard you helped him leave the country.

799
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:58,561
Why exactly did you
have to send him abroad just then?

800
01:04:58,644 --> 01:05:02,940
He was already on the verge of collapse.
Why would anybody bother to kill him?

801
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:05,818
The facts speak for themselves, Detective.

802
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,864
