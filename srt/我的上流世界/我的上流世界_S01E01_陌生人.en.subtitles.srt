1
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,393
Lead us not into temptation,

2
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,064
but deliver us from evil.

3
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,227
I witnessed it.

4
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,022
Someone was bleeding to death.

5
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,566
It's a murder case.

6
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,612
60 DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT

7
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,699
An honorary chairman,
who loved art and nature,

8
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,326
hired a world-renowned architect

9
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,662
to build Hyowon Mansion.

10
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,373
The main building was named Cadenza.

11
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,712
The annex was named Rubato.

12
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,426
This garden is so beautiful in the spring.

13
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,927
Beautiful, isn't it?

14
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:02,056
Donations to our Single Mothers Foundation
have grown a lot since last year.

15
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,851
-That's great.
-I'm grateful.

16
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,771
These mothers are so impressive.

17
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,359
They've decided
to raise their children single-handedly.

18
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:15,153
I hope they'll never give up.

19
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,406
They'll have to fight against prejudice.

20
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,949
It won't be easy.

21
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,828
That's why they're impressive.
They refuse to take the easy way out.

22
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,080
Do you want to visit the kindergarten?

23
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,415
Of course.

24
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:29,542
This is my first visit this semester.

25
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,170
Let's see.

26
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:37,508
It's already been five years since we met
and that donation started.

27
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,222
Anyway, I'll drive you home myself today.

28
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,558
Thank you.

29
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,483
Hello?

30
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,361
Yes, I'm looking for a tutor.

31
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,656
It's for my sister-in-law, not me.

32
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,743
Can you vouch for her?

33
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,955
-Let me go!
-Let her go!

34
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,040
-Don't do that!
-Let me go!

35
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,042
-Damn it.
-Don't do that!

36
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,544
-Don't do that!
-No!

37
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,713
What do you think you're doing?

38
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,090
Please leave.

39
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,008
This is a kindergarten.

40
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,262
We're just doing our job.

41
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,430
Aren't you ashamed in front of children?

42
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,182
You don't want to get in our way.

43
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,517
Let's see what happens.

44
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,733
This is Dawoom Kindergarten.

45
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,570
Some men have broken in,
assaulted and threatened us.

46
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,698
Please hurry. They may flee.

47
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,494
This is a school, after all.

48
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,329
They need to learn to be law-abiding.

49
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,750
Her father must've borrowed
quite a bit of money.

50
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,961
And she has three younger siblings.

51
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,798
How much is the debt?

52
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,384
Usually, it's never that substantial.

53
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,595
But the poor turn to suicide

54
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,850
or murder because of such small money.

55
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,863
So you want me to hire her as a maid here?

56
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,614
She has no place to stay.

57
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:27,201
Mother Emma told me
that she's very diligent and kind.

58
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,122
If she's that great,
why don't you hire her yourself?

59
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,584
I did consider that.
After all, she was a kindergarten teacher.

60
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,962
But this is related to Hyowon.
I should get permission from you.

61
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,505
You should meet her.

62
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,054
Did you find a tutor for Ha-joon?

63
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,057
Yes. Someone who's perfect.

64
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,075
That day may have been the beginning

65
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,745
of the murder that took place in Cadenza.

66
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,098
There was a strict caste system
in that house.

67
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,644
But ever since she came into the picture,
everything changed.

68
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,316
The caste system began to collapse.

69
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,250
RÉSUMÉ

70
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,377
EDUCATION
EXPERIENCE

71
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,586
THESES

72
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,383
The boy is eight years old.

73
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,385
I see.

74
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,096
And my sister-in-law is his mother.

75
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,389
I'm aware of that.

76
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,309
The lady of Iyeon who recommended you,
she and I are pretty close.

77
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,520
I heard you took care of all her children

78
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,730
until they went to boarding school.
Am I right?

79
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:20,982
That's correct.

80
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,319
You have quite a lot of work experience
for a 27-year-old.

81
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,362
WORK EXPERIENCE

82
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,614
You were a kindergarten teacher aide
for a while.

83
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,075
Yes, ma'am. I'm good with kids.

84
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,620
My youngest sibling is
still in elementary school.

85
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,081
And I pretty much raised
all three of my siblings.

86
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,916
Oh, no.

87
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,545
Will you be okay living apart from them?

88
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,591
Our new house doesn't have enough rooms,
so this is actually for the best.

89
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,678
You'd be perfect for Ha-joon.

90
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,307
I'll talk to my sister-in-law.

91
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,356
I understand, Hi-soo.

92
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,946
How about you work at our house?

93
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:12,116
I know you're overqualified for the job,

94
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,119
but I really like you.

95
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,581
We have many guests over.

96
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:23,377
I need a young guide who will tend
to them. Someone like a secretary.

97
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,005
If you accept this offer,

98
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,715
I'll exempt you from maid duties.

99
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,179
I'm afraid my sister-in-law
has already found a tutor.

100
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,734
-What is it?
-Jin-hee is coming.

101
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,738
We were going to talk here,
but we'll just go to my study.

102
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,752
Why don't you just go
to the annex as planned

103
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,213
and be Ha-joon's tutor.

104
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:08,714
Yes, ma'am.

105
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,466
I'm sorry, Yu-yeon.

106
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,219
I'm afraid you'll be going
to the other house.

107
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,430
I see.

108
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,062
If you have any problems working there,
make sure you let me know.

109
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,814
Yes, ma'am.

110
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,110
Ms. Kang.

111
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,529
Yes?

112
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,281
That.

113
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,912
The rain stopped, so I forgot.

114
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,206
It's a limited edition.

115
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,918
It's a knockoff.

116
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,841
It's Louis de Belle.

117
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,946
It was fate

118
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,950
that led these two women
down the paths they belonged to.

119
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,496
And this fate was created by God

120
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,333
unbeknownst to mankind.

121
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:31,881
EPISODE 1
THE STRANGERS

122
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,644
Whether it was heaven or hell,

123
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,688
whether she was an angel or a devil,

124
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,692
they did not know then.

125
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,322
Hello, ma'am.

126
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,075
Are you Ms. Kang Ja-kyeong?

127
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,039
Hello, I'm Seo Hi-soo.

128
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,542
Honey.

129
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,086
You're home early.

130
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,006
Say hello to the new tutor.

131
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,261
Hello, my name is Kang Ja-kyeong.

132
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,929
Please take good care of my son.

133
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,472
I'll do my best.

134
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,517
I'll see you later.

135
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,820
He's a bit shy around strangers.

136
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,697
Please have a seat.

137
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,206
Have some.

138
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,335
I make those often
since my son loves them.

139
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,012
It's good.

140
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,933
Ha-joon is a picky eater
and he's shy around strangers.

141
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,437
Please look after him.

142
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,149
Okay.

143
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,942
He's a free spirit

144
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,862
and may seem rude,
but that's never the case.

145
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,572
I see.

146
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,325
I'll jot down his favorite food,
preferences,

147
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,535
and anything significant. Do study them.

148
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,453
I will.

149
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,498
We have a family dinner today.

150
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,583
-Okay.
-It's only for the adults,

151
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:13,876
so please look after him.

152
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,419
Understood.

153
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,424
Hello, my prince.

154
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,092
Mom!

155
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,472
Hello, I'm Oh Soo-young.

156
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,599
So you're Ha-joon.

157
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,142
I hope we get along.

158
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,102
Hello.

159
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,021
Mom, I'm hungry.

160
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,106
I can't let you starve.

161
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,609
Hi-soo, the designer is here.

162
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,738
Please prepare his 4 p.m. snack.

163
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,781
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,325
Let's go upstairs
to wash our hands and change.

165
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,743
Okay.

166
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,508
-Just looking at you
-Just looking at you

167
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,511
-Is agonizing
-Is agonizing

168
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,430
My heart breaks

169
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,476
It's agonizing

170
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,396
I shouldn't be like this

171
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,482
Because of the tears I've shed

172
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:25,447
-You've found out
-You've found out about my love for you

173
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,991
My vulnerable--

174
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,328
I'm feeling so blue today.

175
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,330
So choose something cheerful for me.

176
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,957
Yes, ma'am.

177
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,459
-Give me back--
-Forget it.

178
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,754
What's my next schedule?

179
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,341
After this vocal lesson,
you have a workout session at the gym.

180
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,135
-And my husband?
-He's in the study.

181
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,140
Give me back

182
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,727
-My youth
-My youth

183
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,133
This one.

184
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,137
And this one.

185
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,396
-How's this?
-Gorgeous.

186
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,077
I doubt you're allowed to wear
such vivid colors.

187
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,621
Maybe, but it's worth the challenge.

188
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,208
-I'll wear this.
-Yes, ma'am.

189
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,460
It'll be okay, right?

190
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,785
-Who assigned the seats today?
-Hi-soo did.

191
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,329
I did it when it was Mother's birthday.

192
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,623
Then Ji-yong will sit opposite Father,
right?

193
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,377
It's a relief. If you sit opposite him,
it'll only upset him.

194
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,297
His blood pressure rose.

195
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,466
He's also taking
stronger heart medication.

196
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,303
I don't want to sit there either.

197
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,597
And I have high blood pressure too.

198
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,423
I'm here!

199
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,342
-Hey.
-Hurry.

200
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:16,887
Hurry up!

201
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,141
Yes, it should show.

202
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,740
Don't get stressed, sir.

203
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,159
Your blood pressure has gotten higher.

204
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,664
HAN JIN-HO

205
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:08,498
One of us should muster up the courage
to try something new.

206
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:12,169
Let's be frank.
Isn't our dress code too dark?

207
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,504
Why should we only wear achromatic colors?

208
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:22,429
All revolutions start
with the smallest changes.

209
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,892
It's just a dress code, Father.
I don't want a revolution.

210
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,900
The appetizer is fried scallop
and truffle tart.

211
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,445
The main dishes are lobster ravioli
with a Noilly Prat sauce

212
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,323
and Korean beef tenderloin steak.

213
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,658
Please enjoy.

214
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,842
Hello.

215
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,635
Who are you?

216
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,097
I'm Kim Yu-yeon, the new maid, ma'am.

217
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,519
I'm not a ma'am.

218
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,692
But it sure is nice to hear.

219
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,572
Who are you?

220
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,827
-You ate that?
-Yes.

221
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,455
It's food. Why shouldn't I?

222
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,171
My goodness. Who is she?

223
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,481
Now that the glasses are filled,
let's raise a toast.

224
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,775
Cheers.

225
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:29,282
This was Kim Mi-ja's favorite wine,
wasn't it?

226
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,210
You do know Ha-joon needs to study abroad
starting seventh grade, right?

227
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,378
Are you working on it?

228
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,588
It's a good day. Do you want to fight?

229
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,465
Why is it a good day?

230
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,008
Because it's Mi-ja's birthday?

231
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,556
I have to say,
I love Chef Jung's choice of steak.

232
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,226
Are you being like that

233
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,896
because Ha-joon isn't your biological son?

234
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,733
That's enough, Jin-hee.

235
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:10,323
It's best not to ignore
the elephant in the room.

236
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,119
Go on. Don't mind me.

237
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,125
Ha-joon is my son.

238
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,711
This is a whole new world.

239
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,673
This isn't the entertainment scene
where you used to play.

240
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,676
Would you have been like this
had he been yours?

241
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,639
Despite Soo-hyuk being my stepson,
I sent him to a foreigner's school

242
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,476
and had him study abroad in seventh grade
like he was supposed to.

243
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,479
So that's not the heart of the matter.

244
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,609
Picking a fight like that
won't change anyone's mind.

245
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:47,611
There you go again.

246
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:50,071
I can't let that little boy live abroad

247
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,990
without his mother.

248
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,119
I don't think
anything he learns in loneliness

249
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,704
will be of any worth.

250
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:02,500
Soo-hyuk and Ha-joon are destined
to live differently from ordinary people.

251
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:04,836
Your emotional approach to this

252
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,796
won't benefit his future.

253
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,174
Teach him lacrosse beforehand

254
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,385
and have him study abroad
in seventh grade.

255
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,554
I'll take care

256
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:16,890
of this matter.

257
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:19,809
Please let me do that.

258
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,186
He's my son.

259
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,113
Doesn't "Winter, Third Movement"

260
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,658
really sound like everything is freezing?

261
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:38,411
Do you know what happens when ice melts?

262
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,581
It becomes liquid water.

263
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,500
Spring comes, Father.

264
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:47,963
Exactly.
You are indeed incredible, Hi-soo.

265
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,849
Let's look forward to
our own springtime to come

266
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,310
and raise another toast.

267
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,355
All right. Cheers.

268
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:25,542
Today, I have decided to bid

269
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,004
my last farewell to her.

270
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:36,720
This is the last time
we'll celebrate her birthday.

271
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:41,224
Also, I will be gifting someone today

272
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:45,895
with something very important.

273
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,258
Come here.

274
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:28,438
I recently won the bid for this
at Christie's auction house in New York.

275
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,065
It's a blue diamond.

276
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:43,078
Today, I will give this blue diamond--

277
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,245
Sir.

278
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,571
-Sir!
-Sir!

279
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,489
Father!

280
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,242
-Sir!
-Father!

281
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,368
Father!

282
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,412
-Sir!
-Oh, no!

283
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,373
-Call the doctor!
-Give me my phone.

284
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,166
What should we do?

285
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,008
I have loved

286
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,886
someone I shouldn't have loved

287
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,599
Because loving her

288
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:50,103
is an act of sin

289
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,771
Goodness.

290
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,192
Look at this mess
after hiring a management expert.

291
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,737
I told you that
the bastard had a nasty face.

292
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,740
That bastard. How much did he embezzle?

293
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,117
Did you stop the reporters?

294
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,954
It's too late.
People are already searching

295
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,998
"Johyang Construction's illegal bid"
online.

296
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,541
HYOWON-JOHYANG'S ILLEGAL BID

297
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,128
Under the current law,
the CEO will be punished,

298
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,755
not Chairman Han.

299
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,550
However…

300
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,596
he may not wake up anytime soon.

301
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,973
I advise that you immediately appoint

302
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,809
a temporary president.

303
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,897
Let's do this step by step.

304
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,610
I'd like to speak
with Legal and Accounting.

305
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,652
Yes, sir.

306
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,205
Flowers are forbidden in the hospital,

307
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,748
so why did she do that?

308
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,251
He isn't Snow White.

309
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,213
Why does he need to be surrounded
by flowers in bed?

310
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,924
They're probably for the visitors to see.

311
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,635
How typical of her.

312
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,471
He's going to suffocate in the scent.

313
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,761
Where should I keep these?

314
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,721
Give them to me.

315
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,516
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but the chairman will scold me.

316
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,226
Then what are you going to do?

317
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,688
Shove them down his mouth or something?

318
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,023
-I'm sorry.
-You little bastard.

319
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,734
Give them to me.

320
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,320
Mom, don't do this.

321
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,950
You can't be like that
at a time like this.

322
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,289
Put them in his hospital safe
under his lawyer's supervision.

323
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,874
They have security cameras. Happy?

324
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,417
Yes, sir.

325
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,589
That crazy geezer.

326
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,008
I'm sure of it.

327
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,886
He was going to give that necklace
to Hi-soo.

328
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,138
Why? She doesn't deserve that.

329
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,057
Because it's that bitch, Kim Mi-ja's
birthday today.

330
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:38,354
He wanted to give it to Ji-yong's mother
for her birthday, but she's dead,

331
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,981
so he chose her daughter-in-law?

332
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,233
Be quiet.

333
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,653
You're only allowed

334
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,157
to call Mi-ja your father's mistress.

335
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,868
I'm Ji-yong's mother.

336
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,912
That's not something you can change.

337
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:57,165
-There's no point in being stubborn.
-I don't care.

338
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,133
Goodness.

339
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,930
I told you not to raise the volume
this high.

340
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,097
Do you know Woo?

341
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,850
-Woo?
-Or how about

342
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,602
Rugi and Just One?

343
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:21,439
Can you invite these rappers
to my next birthday party?

344
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,608
Are they your favorite rappers?

345
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,318
Yes. They're awesome.

346
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,823
But you know what? Dad will get upset
if he finds out you listen to hip-hop.

347
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,868
Here, you must listen
to classical music first.

348
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,454
-You know that.
-He already knows.

349
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,582
He does? And he didn't get mad?

350
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,000
No, he didn't.

351
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:45,797
"You're just like your mom."
That's what he said.

352
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,093
Yes, doctor.

353
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,679
Please keep an eye on him.

354
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,597
Thank you.

355
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:03,398
Don't you miss your late mother?

356
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,817
It's her birthday today.

357
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,657
I'm sure she was happy
because Father loved her dearly.

358
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,866
So what?

359
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,577
She lived in hiding all her life.

360
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,834
What was Ha-joon's…

361
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,129
birth mother like?

362
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,673
Why are you asking
about someone who passed away?

363
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,551
Our eight-year-old son listens to hip-hop

364
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,636
and prefers guitar to violin.

365
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,014
Does he take after me

366
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,140
or…

367
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,518
his birth mother?

368
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,396
I heard you told him

369
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:46,107
that he was just like his mom.

370
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,035
I was talking about you.

371
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,497
Okay. That's what you meant, right?

372
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,126
Fine. I won't ask anymore.

373
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,004
I shouldn't have asked.

374
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,217
But do understand.

375
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,679
You have no idea how it feels to have
an inferiority complex as a stepmom.

376
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,849
She was so suspicious.

377
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,934
Ms. Joo.

378
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,772
Why do you think the chairman collapsed
as soon as he drank that wine?

379
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,067
Are you insinuating that the tutor

380
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,653
poisoned his wine?

381
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,490
That's not entirely impossible.

382
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,492
Cut the nonsense.

383
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,243
Put the wine bottles back.

384
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:47,043
LOTTERY
500 MILLION WON

385
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,637
Nothing again.

386
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,981
Read through the illegal bid report again
at work tomorrow.

387
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:10,733
Find out who stamped it last.

388
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,861
Ji-yong will take care of everything.

389
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,414
Even if he's most likely
to become the next president,

390
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,376
you should at least take up the role
of a helper rather than a loser.

391
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,379
Or you could even try to turn the tide.

392
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,299
What is this? What the hell are you doing?

393
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,719
What did I tell you?

394
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,888
I told you to throw away those bottles!

395
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,057
So why would you re-store them?

396
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,560
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

397
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:50,815
That was that bitch,
Mi-ja's favorite wine!

398
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,360
Check if she's hurt
and take her to the hospital.

399
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,611
Yes, sir.

400
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,365
Hey! Have you even been
training them properly?

401
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,867
Mother, that's enough.

402
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,202
Your voice is being recorded right now.

403
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,287
What?

404
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,298
So why would you re-store them?

405
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:18,342
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

406
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,552
That was…

407
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:25,016
You bastard!
Why is that pigeon flying around here?

408
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:29,228
Who said you could let a bird fly in here?

409
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,856
-You're upsetting No-deok!
-I'm so sorry.

410
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,192
-Take better care of this house!
-Stand up.

411
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,068
Hey!

412
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,368
Why did you do it?

413
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,706
As you know,
Ms. Yang tends to speak very fast.

414
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,792
I only recorded her
so I could hear it again.

415
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,545
Please spare me.

416
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,673
Of course. I'll do that.

417
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,263
If you go to Mr. Oh in Insa-dong,

418
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:09,477
he'll pay you in cash for this.
It's four carats.

419
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,564
This used to be English actress
Demi Rogers' wedding ring.

420
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,151
You'll easily get 800 million won.

421
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,073
Ma'am, this is too much.

422
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,867
-Isn't this what you wanted?
-Ma'am.

423
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,620
You should also check the contract
for Tregon Pella,

424
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,039
the house in Gangnam
that my father gave you.

425
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,458
Aren't you supposed to

426
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:36,545
never disclose any secrets
that occur under our roof?

427
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,423
This is a breach of contract, Ms. Joo.

428
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,092
-I'm sorry.
-I'm afraid

429
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,843
you'll have to return the house.

430
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,930
Please forgive me this once.
This won't ever happen again.

431
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,475
Hand over all the files to me.

432
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,768
Of course.

433
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,231
SELECT VOICE RECORDING

434
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,320
Wait.

435
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,822
Are you…

436
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,658
trying to cut a deal with me?

437
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,581
I'll tell them

438
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,918
that it was Ju-hee.

439
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,379
Thank you, ma'am.

440
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,764
What should I do?

441
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,395
Damn it.

442
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,189
I've lost 650 million won.

443
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:51,370
I've deleted all the files,
and everything has been solved.

444
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:57,418
So that bitch, Ju-hee, did it?

445
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,463
I knew it. No wonder she got on my nerves.

446
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,590
I caught her well.

447
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,217
I'm such a good judge of character.

448
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,138
By the way, is Ms. Joo
even training them properly?

449
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,850
-Mother.
-What?

450
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,270
Please refrain from acting that way
in front of the maids.

451
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:18,981
What did you say?

452
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,275
Do you still love Father?

453
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,446
I bet

454
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,240
he still loves Mi-ja.

455
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,785
He yearns for her more
now that she's dead.

456
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,581
When your rival is a dead bitch,
it's hard to stay sane.

457
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,918
-Why do you ask?
-Good night.

458
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,989
I'll drop you off
instead of Soo-young today.

459
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,875
She threw wine bottles?

460
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,629
What if someone got hurt?

461
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,174
Why won't she and Jin-hee see a therapist?

462
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,303
Those who really need to
never see a therapist voluntarily.

463
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,597
Only their victims do.

464
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,683
Wearing a mask when going out

465
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,769
and mistreating their maids
inside the house? That's so cheap.

466
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,064
That's just cowardly
selective temper tantrums.

467
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,692
It's so animalistic.
They're two-faced and cowardly.

468
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,861
She'll be better when Soo-hyuk's here.

469
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,405
She'll have to save face
in front of her grandson.

470
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,662
This is so unfair.
I just did what Ms. Joo told me to do.

471
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,666
Ju-hee, forget everything.

472
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,918
You'll be handsomely compensated.

473
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,504
Just don't tell anyone about this,

474
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,840
or you'll have to return everything.

475
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,134
I don't care about the money.

476
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,803
What? Then what is it?

477
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,222
Why must I get fired?

478
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,726
It's such a fun place.
There are so many perks and spectacles.

479
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,728
It's so dynamic.

480
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,981
And the young master is flying in soon.

481
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,941
I really wanted to see him.

482
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,903
I want to kill that darned hag!

483
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,655
I just did what I was told to do!

484
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,243
Poor girl.

485
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,213
Did you not sleep well?

486
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,635
No, ma'am.
I have yet to adjust myself to this place.

487
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,803
If a worker looks unhappy,

488
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:57,473
our guests will assume that this place has

489
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,308
a poor work environment.

490
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,811
So make sure you get enough sleep
even if you must take medication.

491
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,606
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right.

492
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,317
Let me brief you on your duties.

493
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:12,613
You will serve and guide the guests
who visit Cadenza.

494
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,324
Cleaning the 1st floor guest room,
the 2nd floor stairs,

495
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,869
and the young master's room
is also your job.

496
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,454
-Do you remember that?
-Yes.

497
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,457
-The young master is coming today.
-Young master?

498
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,168
Look.

499
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,505
Mr. Chairman and Mr. Han.
Ms. Yang and Ms. Jung.

500
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,299
And Mr. Han's son, who's flying in today,

501
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,385
should be addressed as "young master."

502
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,679
-"Young master"?
-Why are you laughing?

503
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:41,100
I just find it funny that such things
still exist in this day and age.

504
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,018
Hey!

505
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,690
This is another world.

506
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,859
It's different from the world
you've lived in.

507
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,404
They're the employers,
and we're the employees.

508
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,989
We keep it strict.

509
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,574
You should know your place,

510
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,825
or you'll get hurt.

511
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,290
Yes, ma'am.
I'll keep that in mind, Ms. Joo.

512
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,337
No-deok.

513
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,715
It's time to eat.

514
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:17,886
Goodness, my lovely No-deok. Eat up.

515
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,655
No-deok. Eat this.

516
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,782
CURRENT SHARE OWNERSHIP

517
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:42,202
If a similar number of small shareholders
attend the general meeting,

518
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,956
we must at least acquire
35 percent of shares.

519
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,876
Jin-ho, support me.

520
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,961
I'm more competent than you.

521
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:53,714
Were you going to help Ji-yong?

522
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,801
I may not have what it takes,
but Soo-hyuk does.

523
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,428
He should take over.

524
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,973
That kid is only 26 years old.

525
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,934
When will he climb the ladder
starting from a regular employee?

526
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,520
I'll hand over my crown to him
when it's time.

527
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,731
-Happy?
-How can I trust you?

528
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,399
Then will you give it to Ji-yong?

529
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,318
Did you forget that he has a son too?

530
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,321
You know how much Father dotes on Hi-soo.

531
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,114
I'm stuck.

532
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,825
Me too.

533
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,455
Welcome back.

534
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,640
Go up. Your room is as it was.

535
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:09,892
Okay.

536
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,948
I must be insane.

537
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,993
Ms. Ko, you should always be meticulous.

538
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,453
Yes, ma'am.

539
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,172
Ms. Kim.

540
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,091
Yes, ma'am?

541
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,801
Have you greeted Ms. Yang yet?

542
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,554
No, ma'am. I wasn't told to just yet.

543
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,181
-Politely introduce yourself to her.
-Yes, ma'am.

544
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,808
She doesn't like loud voices.

545
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,185
-Understood.
-Ms. Kim.

546
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,772
I see.

547
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,486
Ms. Ko.

548
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,573
Goodness. Yes. I'm glad you're back.

549
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,200
Of course. Grandpa is ill.

550
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,213
Hello, my name is Kim Yu-yeon.

551
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,299
Ms. Jung told me to introduce myself
to you.

552
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,301
How dare you come here

553
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:09,219
when I didn't even call for you?

554
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:13,098
You should only come in here to clean
when I'm away.

555
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,017
What an impudent bitch.

556
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,063
Leave this room immediately.

557
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,945
Yes, ma'am.

558
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:33,619
Goodness.

559
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,289
You're so handsome.

560
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,503
Father is in the hospital.

561
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,340
I don't know if we should be having
a family dinner.

562
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,259
But the eldest grandson of Hyowon is back,

563
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,844
so a dinner is a must.

564
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,723
Seo-hyun knows everything about manners.
I'm sure she's prepared well.

565
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,144
Right. Do you like the new tutor?

566
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:01,271
I need some time to determine that.

567
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,359
I hope this tutor stays around
for a long time.

568
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,195
I feel the same way.

569
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:11,573
Anyway, you should treat her well.

570
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,533
Don't make it seem like a power trip.

571
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,952
That's ridiculous.

572
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,623
I mean, just be friendly
so that she won't misunderstand.

573
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,458
You're only kind to me.

574
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,085
Fine. I'll try.

575
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,600
Mother, why don't you say grace for us?

576
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,562
No, let's just eat.

577
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,815
I'm not going to say grace.

578
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,567
I'm considering converting to Buddhism.

579
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:52,364
I don't want to meet my husband in heaven.

580
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,200
Do you think you'll go to heaven?

581
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,787
Where do you get the courage
to be that cheeky?

582
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,790
From Soo-hyuk and Ha-joon, of course.

583
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,376
You don't get angry or yell

584
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,794
in front of them.

585
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,721
Did you visit your grandpa

586
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,139
-at the hospital?
-Yes.

587
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,307
I visited as soon as I landed.

588
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,059
I also spoke with the doctor.

589
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,312
You should intern at our company
before getting your MBA.

590
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,650
Why aren't you answering me?

591
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,362
Is there something you want to do?

592
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,031
It's not like I have any choice.

593
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,825
My fate is already determined here.

594
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,120
Just like I had to study abroad
when I didn't want to.

595
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,460
I'm thinking about having Soo-hyuk
get married soon…

596
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:50,589
to the eldest granddaughter
of Chairman Roh of Yeongwon.

597
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:54,259
I met her at the wedding
of Seogwang Group's daughter,

598
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,969
and she was a fine, young girl.

599
00:50:56,052 --> 00:50:59,014
His opinion matters the most.
Do you like her?

600
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:00,974
Well…

601
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,643
I'm not sure.

602
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:07,731
I don't think I know how it feels
to have feelings for someone.

603
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,232
That's not right.

604
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,610
You've never met a girl
who made your heart throb?

605
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,461
So you're saying
that the young master's biological mom

606
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,963
left home when he was ten?

607
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,715
Yes, I'm telling you.

608
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,426
His father used to be an alcoholic.

609
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,679
He'd always break things
and use violent language when drunk.

610
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,972
But he quit drinking

611
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,517
thanks to Ms. Jung
and has become a decent human.

612
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,187
Why is he so obedient to her?

613
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,398
Because her family is filthy rich.
She's a born aristocrat.

614
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,360
He knows he shouldn't upset her.

615
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,780
By the way, why do you think
she married such a dumb guy?

616
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,908
On top of that,
he's a divorcee with a kid.

617
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:03,203
When the wealthy get married,
it's not about love.

618
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,289
It's a business transaction
out of their love for money.

619
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,960
That being said, Ms. Jung and Ms. Seo
are some incredible women.

620
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,420
They're both raising stepsons.

621
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,714
It's all thanks to Chairman Han.

622
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,759
Even Mr. Han Ji-yong was born
out of wedlock.

623
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:19,010
Really?

624
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,264
Poor people. All of them.

625
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:32,315
They're done eating.

626
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,358
Let's go.

627
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,777
Stop.

628
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:21,114
That designer dish costs
1.5 million won each.

629
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,033
Goodbye to the Hermès.

630
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:25,035
-Hey, you'll get hurt.
-Do you want to die?

631
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,120
Farewell 2.4 million won.

632
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,747
-You--
-I told you not to lie!

633
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:30,749
That's a cultural asset by Seo Chun-hwa.

634
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:33,960
Who's the bitch

635
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,046
you secretly called on the balcony?

636
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,505
God damn it!

637
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,550
I'm the manager of a tennis club.
I told you many times!

638
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,762
What are you doing?

639
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,777
I'll make sure to replace them.

640
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,905
I only threw the ones
I could purchase. Don't worry.

641
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,493
You're not welcome here anymore.

642
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,120
How dare you break things in my house?

643
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:14,334
I will no longer condone
your and Mother's actions.

644
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,711
If word gets out,

645
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,713
Hyowon's reputation will be tainted.

646
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:24,177
That isn't what you're worried about.

647
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,513
It's your reputation.

648
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,933
Watch what you say. I am your elder.

649
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:33,561
Isn't it heavy wearing a mask
all the time?

650
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,398
Isn't it embarrassing to show
your true, naked face?

651
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,777
Father is ill.
We shouldn't fight like this.

652
00:54:41,277 --> 00:54:45,031
And Jin-hee,
I think you should talk to someone.

653
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,157
What?

654
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,785
You're getting cute nowadays.

655
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:53,164
And how can I trust a psychiatrist
and be honest with them?

656
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,333
Will you take responsibility
if word spreads?

657
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,459
Not a psychiatrist.

658
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,879
I'll introduce you
to a trustworthy counselor.

659
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,090
Just meet her once. I'll tell her--

660
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:05,468
No, I don't want to.
I can't trust her either.

661
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,721
I refuse to trust anyone!

662
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:08,805
Don't, then.

663
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,310
If you want to come here,
come when I'm away.

664
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:16,855
Let's go.

665
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,488
She vehemently refuses to get a divorce.

666
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,658
Isn't she twisted?
Does she just want to torment me?

667
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,661
I'll have a word with her.

668
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,706
Try not to approach this matter
so emotionally.

669
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,418
Listen, Jung-do--

670
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:44,591
Ji-yong--

671
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:45,675
Hold on.

672
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,219
Excuse me.

673
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,770
Dad, I have a stomachache.

674
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,397
Mom isn't picking up.

675
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:02,442
-Is it very painful?
-I think he has an upset stomach.

676
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:28,760
Ha-joon, are you okay?

677
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,096
He had an upset stomach,

678
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,722
so I pricked his finger.

679
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,266
Please don't do that again.

680
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,018
He has his own doctor.

681
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,065
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

682
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,566
I'm all better now.

683
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,362
I apologize. I was too hasty.

684
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:56,746
Don't mind him.
He's never gotten his fingers pricked.

685
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,082
You may leave.

686
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,960
Yes, ma'am.

687
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,092
-Hold on.
-What is it?

688
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,264
You're completely healed now.

689
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,517
PHOTOS

690
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,936
Hi-soo, it's me.

691
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,857
The trustworthy counselor
you mentioned today,

692
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,694
I'd like to meet with her.

693
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,030
It's for me. Yes.

694
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,116
I need some mental guidance.

695
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,326
You do?

696
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,912
Who is it? You said it wasn't a doctor.

697
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:23,208
You already know her. It's Mother Emma.

698
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,961
-Mother.
-Yes?

699
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,463
This family is strange.

700
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,842
Hey, you should hang in there.

701
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,137
Every rich family is strange.

702
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:40,391
I thought the wealthy
had neither worries nor rage.

703
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:42,727
I guess I was wrong.

704
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,479
They're living in hell.

705
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:47,273
-Sorry?
-They're never satisfied,

706
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,859
so they're always hungry for more.

707
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:58,618
Their endless greed threw them into hell.

708
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:03,790
But how do you know rich families so well?

709
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:07,877
Me?

710
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,129
I know them very well.

711
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:43,181
Why are you here at this hour?

712
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,309
I couldn't sleep.

713
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,896
I thought walking around might help.

714
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:53,524
But I lost my way back.

715
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:09,207
I'm sorry. I dropped it while dozing off.

716
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:17,298
I mean, I dropped this hair tie
while leaning slightly on your bed.

717
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,094
Do you sleep well in my room?

718
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:25,181
You said you only leaned on my bed
and fell asleep.

719
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,309
Why don't we switch rooms?

720
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:32,063
It'd be fun.

721
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,441
What are you doing?

722
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,115
I went to the laundry room.

723
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,287
The maids had put this dress aside
to dry-clean, and it looked so gorgeous.

724
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,706
That's mine.

725
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,041
I'm sorry, ma'am.

726
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:39,380
It was so beautiful,
so I just wanted to try it on.

727
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,592
I'll put it back.

728
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,053
Ms. Kang.

729
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,393
Ms. Kang.

730
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,069
Yes, ma'am?

731
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:50,076
I thought everyone was fast asleep.

732
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:54,413
I'm sorry, ma'am.

733
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:59,669
I promise never to lay my hands
on what is yours.

734
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,924
Good.

735
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:08,928
To avoid misunderstandings.

736
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,681
You should go to bed now.

737
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,769
Does anyone deserve to die?

738
01:05:03,441 --> 01:05:04,775
One thing is certain.

739
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:08,487
This person deserved to die…

740
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,574
in someone's eyes.

741
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,352
SPECIAL THANKS TO HONG SONG-WON

742
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:57,620
Did you run a background check
on that new tutor?

743
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,747
She is a bit peculiar.

744
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,124
I scheduled dinner with the girl

745
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,751
who's going to marry Soo-hyuk.

746
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:06,462
I should get them engaged first.

747
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:07,880
Let me sleep here.

748
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,133
There are people who are out to get us.
You must behave.

749
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,636
Don't look down on me!

750
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:14,929
I think it's Jin-hee.

751
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,974
If you want to cover it up,
you must give me something big.

752
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:21,268
Is there anything I can do for you?

753
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:25,439
