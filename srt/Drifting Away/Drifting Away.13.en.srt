[Episode 13]

4
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,680
Let go.

5
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,840
I will,

6
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,950
but not now.

7
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,760
Just return the money to them!

8
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,480
Don't move!

9
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:17,970
What are you doing?

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,430
Let's go!

11
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,120
What are you doing?

12
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,079
Why are you handcuffing me?

13
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,240
Is there a mistake?

14
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,190
My name's Sun Xuequan!

15
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm not from Xuecheng.

16
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,490
I-I was born in Suilu.

17
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,910
Is there a mistake?

18
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,620
Get up!

19
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,750
Let me ask you again.

20
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,310
What's your name?

21
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,430
S-Sun Xuequan.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,190
I've really never been to Xuecheng!

23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,560
My home...

24
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,360
My home is in Suilu.

25
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,150
Suilu...

26
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,380
Your name is Shi Bi!

27
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,190
Don't move!

28
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,210
Don't move!

29
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,800
Don't move!

30
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:55,710
Director Chen,

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,560
don't bother to see us out.

32
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,370
Thank you so much.

33
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
When you come to Xuecheng,

34
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:00,940
I'll receive you properly.

35
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,970
Alright, I won't keep you any longer.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,360
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

37
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,220
Sit still.

38
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,360
Shuanghuan.

39
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,000
I've committed a capital offense.

40
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,950
Thank you for taking care of me all these years.

41
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
Our time together has come to an end.

42
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,430
Go...

43
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,000
Go...

44
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,040
Go home

45
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,070
and raise the child.

46
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,800
In this life, we...

47
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,310
Don't ever come to me again!

48
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,230
Sit properly.

49
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:25,480
Keep grinning.

50
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,150
You won't be grinning for long.

51
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,830
Officer, I...

52
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,510
No talking.

53
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,950
I just want to ask

54
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,750
where my child is.

55
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,310
His grandfather took him away.

56
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,770
All these years,

57
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,680
you've been thinking about me.

58
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,400
It must've been hard on you.

59
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,600
How have you been over these years?

60
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Just so-so.

61
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,310
Neither good nor bad.

62
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,409
What about you?

63
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,800
I thought about you every day.

64
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,190
I also dreamed of you.

65
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,830
It was roughly the same for me.

66
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I dreamed a lot.

67
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,630
It's just that

68
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,950
I couldn't let you

69
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,310
appear in my dreams.

70
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:28,680
It doesn't matter.

71
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,730
Our dreams

72
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,680
have all ended.

73
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,480
Do you regret it now?

74
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,890
Is there any way back?

75
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,600
Captain Peng,

76
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,920
we've arrived in Xuecheng.

77
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,100
Has it changed much?

78
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,840
Not really.

79
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,790
Actually, it's the same for everyone.

80
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,910
This day

81
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,690
will come sooner or later.

82
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,690
But the processes

83
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,790
are completely different.

84
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,710
0213, you sleep here.

85
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,390
Hello?

86
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,360
We

87
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,030
have caught them.

88
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,150
Hello.

89
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:40,790
Wait a minute.

90
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,270
Wait a minute.

91
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,440
You're on speaker.

92
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,080
My daughter

93
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,000
and my wife

94
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,100
are both next to me.

95
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,720
Raise your voice

96
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,360
and say that again.

97
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,640
Everyone in the criminal gang that killed Liu Xinyuan

98
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,720
has been apprehended.

99
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,480
Daughter!

100
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,910
Xinyuan.

101
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,960
Xinyuan, did you hear that?

102
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,090
Did you hear that?

103
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:48,360
Xinyuan, did you hear that?

104
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,600
You've seen all the photos.

105
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,550
Do you know what crimes you've committed?

106
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,240
You're suspected of kidnapping,

107
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,510
intentional assault,

108
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,550
and premeditated murder.

109
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,080
Song Hongyu,

110
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,320
denying it is useless.

111
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,630
There are traces of your involvement

112
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,790
in the Bishui Garden case,

113
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,000
the Yanhui City case,

114
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,600
and the kidnapping case

115
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,790
in Luancheng.

116
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,440
On November 1, 2002,

117
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,550
you and Deng Ligang

118
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,270
took Liu Xinyuan and Huang Ying

119
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,610
away from the Green Island Hotel.

120
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
After that, the two of them

121
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,560
disappeared.

122
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,640
In the drain of room 402,

123
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,820
Bishui Garden, where you lived,

124
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,930
we found Liu Xinyuan's

125
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,510
DNA.

126
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,910
Do you remember this bracelet?

127
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,600
You don't need to use the photos

128
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,870
to intimidate me bit by bit.

129
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,400
The law values evidence.

130
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,790
I did

131
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,870
all the killings.

132
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,360
They just came into the room

133
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,020
to help me dispose of the bodies.

134
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,780
With all the lives

135
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:46,970
lost at your hands,

136
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,540
getting involved in any of the cases

137
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,390
leads to the same result.

138
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,720
Does your loyalty

139
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,840
make any sense?

140
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,670
May I ask you a question?

141
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,500
Go ahead.

142
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,270
I hid my driver's license

143
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,490
in the cabinet crack in Bishui Garden.

144
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,860
Did you find me

145
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,480
because you got that license?

146
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,060
That was the first clue we found.

147
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,070
Why did you put the license

148
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,020
back there?

149
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,860
It was hard for me to get my driver's license.

150
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,270
I didn't want to throw it away.

151
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,960
If I could

152
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,600
be a normal person someday,

153
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,080
I could

154
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
continue

155
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,760
delivering beer.

156
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,350
You're an optimistic man.

157
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,630
Do you remember us?

158
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,310
The two police officers

159
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,819
who were almost killed by your car

160
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,650
in the winter nine years ago.

161
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,030
The assault on police officers alone

162
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,829
is enough to convict you.

163
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,550
Let me jog your memory.

164
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,829
Over these years,

165
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,589
your criminal activities

166
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,849
spread across nine provinces in the country.

167
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,240
You only kidnapped

168
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,870
women in special professions.

169
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,270
You usually kidnapped

170
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,010
two women

171
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,480
who were beautiful

172
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:36,820
and had many customers

173
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,310
to increase efficiency

174
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,590
and make quick money.

175
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,680
When you coerced them

176
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,880
into asking their friends

177
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,920
for money,

178
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,240
you used fake addresses.

179
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,400
Am I right?

180
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,920
Does that ring any bells?

181
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,880
It seems you're saying

182
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,790
that all cases in China

183
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,640
were committed by me alone.

184
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,440
Then tell us about

185
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,660
the Bishui Garden case.

186
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,270
How did you commit the crime?

187
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,200
How did you divide the work?

188
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,030
How did you split the loot?

189
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,240
Deng Ligang said

190
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,630
they didn't kill that person.

191
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,480
They let that person go after getting the money.

192
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,000
How's that possible?

193
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,750
When have they ever spared a victim's life?

194
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:58,680
Calm down.

195
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,360
No suspect

196
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,520
confesses everything right at the beginning.

197
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,480
Among the four of them,

198
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,270
Shi Bi was the first to crack.

199
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,960
We should find a breakthrough from him.

200
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,880
Focus on him.

201
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,920
Within 48 hours,

202
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,550
we must get them to talk.

203
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,000
Are you in charge here?

204
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,160
Can you do me a favor?

205
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,200
What's that?

206
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,210
I have a wife

207
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,880
named Feng Shuanghuan in Suilu.

208
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,200
When I was brought in,

209
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,270
I had some valuable items with me.

210
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,110
Can you give them to her for me?

211
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,550
No.

212
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,410
Feng Shuanghuan is a good person.

213
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Do me a favor.

214
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,070
Pass on a message for me.

215
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,010
First of all,

216
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,510
the items you had with you

217
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,550
are all exhibits.

218
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,990
No one can take them out

219
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,240
just because they want to.

220
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,210
But we can assure you

221
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,720
that after your sentence is pronounced

222
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,750
and we make sure there's nothing wrong with these items,

223
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,440
we can give them to her for you.

224
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,590
Tell us

225
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,000
how you teamed up with Deng Ligang.

226
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,960
My wife

227
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,790
was the first person I killed.

228
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,510
After killing my wife,

229
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,200
at the time,

230
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,270
I didn't want to live anymore.

231
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,000
But

232
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,400
I couldn't really bring myself

233
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,680
to commit suicide.

234
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,880
After killing her,

235
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,220
I didn't know what to do.

236
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,350
So, I called

237
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,970
my only friend at the time,

238
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,000
Deng Ligang.

239
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,000
Love isn't worth much,

240
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,880
but this

241
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
is worth something.

242
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,200
Next time, kill more efficiently.

243
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:49,060
It's best to use a rope

244
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,830
to strangle her.

245
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,350
Look at the mess you've made.

246
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,510
She's already dead.

247
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,270
How can there be a next time?

248
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,920
Everyone's like this when they kill for the first time.

249
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,830
You'll get used to it.

250
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,920
Come on.

251
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,440
College graduate who delivers beer.

252
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,110
Have some hard liquor

253
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,680
to calm your nerves.

254
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:03,750
What can you do?

255
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,170
You still have to live.

256
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,590
The two of us

257
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
were both fired from the factory.

258
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,270
From now on,

259
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,900
we'll set up our own factory.

260
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,550
Do you hear me?

261
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,680
What?

262
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,600
We'll set up our own factory.

263
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,160
What factory?

264
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,360
A meat processing factory.

265
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,400
Deng Ligang helped me.

266
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,510
So, I thought

267
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,720
I might be tied to him

268
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,120
for the rest of my life.

269
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,230
Actually, I was quite afraid of him.

270
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,000
Take a break.

271
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,480
When I first did it,

272
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,440
I was just like you.

273
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,830
Five...

274
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,200
There's 100,000 yuan in total.

275
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,070
Let's split it evenly between us.

276
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,070
Congratulations on finishing your first job.

277
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:58,790
Here.

278
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,550
Come on.

279
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:04,880
Open your mouth.

280
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,250
Open it wide.

281
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,400
Wider.

282
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,630
When you killed,

283
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,550
did you feel guilty?

284
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,510
Yes.

285
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:37,200
When I killed the first person,

286
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,400
I was quite scared.

287
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,590
I also had nightmares at night.

288
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,330
But after killing many people,

289
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,680
I became numb to it.

290
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,800
How many people did you kill?

291
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,030
10...

292
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:56,840
18.

293
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,640
Or maybe 19.

294
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,920
I don't remember.

295
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,350
Do you regret it?

296
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,440
It's fate.

297
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,680
I'm sorry!

298
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,310
Can you forgive me?

299
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,360
How I feel about you

300
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,250
can be summed up in one word:

301
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,640
hatred!

302
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,850
You did what I wanted you to do,

303
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,410
and I'll do what you want me to do.

304
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,880
I'll tell you everything.

305
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:07,180
♫The first lunar month brings the Chinese New Year♫

306
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,460
♫On the first day of the month♫

307
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,310
♫The young wish the old a happy New Year♫

308
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,750
Why are you sitting here?

309
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,550
Don't be afraid.

310
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,590
Do you know

311
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,310
which part of the human body

312
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,790
bleeds the fastest?

313
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,240
Right here.

314
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,070
I won't bully you.

315
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,590
I just want to sit beside you every night

316
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,670
and look at the moon.

317
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,020
I can see

318
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,330
the same moon as my son.

319
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,420
How many times have you been arraigned?

320
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,720
When will you be sentenced?

321
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,150
You've never mentioned it.

322
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,920
What crime did you commit?

323
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,240
Do you have children?

324
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,480
Yes.

325
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,270
My son...

326
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,070
has never been away from me

327
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,350
even for a day

328
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,680
ever since he was born.

329
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,000
I don't know

330
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,470
how he's been doing these days.

331
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,750
The correctional officer told us to watch you

332
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,480
in case you try to kill yourself.

333
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,600
I won't commit suicide.

334
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,720
I'll be out soon.

335
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,720
After I get out,

336
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
I need to take my son

337
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,100
to and from

338
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,270
school.

339
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,960
When we get home,

340
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,240
I need to prepare an extra meal for him.

341
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,240
In a couple of years,

342
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,310
I'll enroll him in a painting class

343
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,160
and have him learn to play an instrument.

344
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,730
I need to be there for him

345
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,520
as he grows up.

346
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,030
What took you so long?

347
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,030
Sorry to keep you waiting.

348
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,270
I've been waiting for so long.

349
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,830
Did you

350
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:32,150
find hope again

351
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,270
when my brother

352
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,270
returned to Xuecheng

353
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,070
for medical treatment?

354
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:40,960
Yes.

355
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,240
Now it's my turn to ask you.

356
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,110
When you changed your mother's household registration information,

357
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,830
you changed everything

358
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,790
except her name.

359
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,070
That wasn't an oversight, was it?

360
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,830
Suppose

361
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,630
I had changed her name.

362
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,390
She's lucid one moment and confused the next.

363
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,500
What if she got lost?

364
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,550
You have a sense of filial duty

365
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,270
and treat your mother so well.

366
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,190
Have you ever thought

367
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,310
about those kidnapped girls?

368
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,610
Those women?

369
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,160
They didn't give birth to me.

370
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,310
You think

371
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,400
this is cool,

372
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:28,640
don't you?

373
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,790
How should I put this?

374
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,240
When I was a kid,

375
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,790
my father was a boiler operator.

376
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,110
Every day, he drank counterfeit alcohol

377
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:46,960
and talked nonsense when drunk.

378
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
When he got drunk,

379
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,710
he would beat my mom,

380
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,960
me,

381
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,310
and my brother.

382
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,920
So, I secretly went to Mount Jingliang

383
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,530
to learn martial arts.

384
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,750
I didn't expect he'd be so lucky.

385
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,720
He got liver cancer early

386
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:05,400
and died.

387
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,680
I couldn't take revenge on him,

388
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,420
so I could only take it out on society.

389
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,960
Let me tell you something.

390
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,920
I've interrogated many criminals.

391
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,160
Almost every one of them

392
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,070
mentioned

393
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,930
their family of origin issues

394
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
at the critical moment.

395
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,480
They had either a bad father

396
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,680
or a bad mother.

397
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,240
There was something wrong

398
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,160
with their wife,

399
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,880
husband,

400
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,550
and children.

401
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,270
There was always someone else to blame.

402
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,030
They shifted responsibility

403
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,270
to gain sympathy.

404
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,240
You don't have to do this.

405
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,030
Don't you enjoy being cool?

406
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,350
Be a man.

407
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,880
In this world,

408
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,510
there are so many alcoholic fathers

409
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,400
who come home and beat their family.

410
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,400
But many of their children

411
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,850
succeed despite the adversity.

412
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,480
Have you ever thought about this?

413
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,750
Through learning,

414
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,150
knowledge,

415
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,540
diligence, and hard work,

416
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,300
we can change many things,

417
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,000
including our fate.

418
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
You chose this path

419
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,219
because you thought it was

420
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,230
a shortcut.

421
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,570
Fundamentally,

422
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,280
this proves

423
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,550
your laziness

424
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,230
and stupidity.

425
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,480
Do you understand?

426
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,510
I understand.

427
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,960
It's fate.

428
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,150
Alright.

429
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,790
Let's

430
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,420
stop arguing.

431
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,360
In the taxi murder case

432
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,159
in 1993,

433
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,489
you killed for the first time, right?

434
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,560
[Available]

435
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,630
You see?

436
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,230
I told you they were doing roadwork.

437
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,700
[Roadwork ahead. Please detour]

438
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,400
You didn't believe me

439
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,420
and thought I was making a detour.

440
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:05,230
I've at least driven seven or eight kilometers

441
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,500
for you.

442
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,810
You should give me at least

443
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,880
an extra eight or 10 yuan.

444
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,480
Right after I got in your car, you told me

445
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,510
your meter wasn't working.

446
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,730
Then, you made a detour.

447
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,880
Now, you want to charge me extra.

448
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,670
What's your game?

449
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,840
Isn't this an illegal taxi?

450
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,920
My meter wasn't working.

451
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,030
I told you

452
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,970
my meter wasn't working!

453
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,970
You agreed to it!

454
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,880
Let me tell you.

455
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,150
I have 10 yuan,

456
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,890
but today,

457
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,760
I'm not giving it to you.

458
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,530
What can you do to me?

459
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,290
Get out. Get out.

460
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,580
What? Are you refusing to take me?

461
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,280
Listen.

462
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:28,880
Today, you must

463
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,590
take me to my destination.

464
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:30,800
Otherwise, I'll make a complaint about you.

465
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:35,520
What are you doing?

466
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,070
Get out of the car.

467
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:36,840
No!

468
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,480
Get out!

469
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,230
No!

470
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,080
What can you do to me?

471
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,040
I don't believe this.

472
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,480
You scumbag!

473
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:44,150
I've never seen anyone like you!

474
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,110
I've never seen anyone like you either!

475
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,840
Shame on you! Scumbag!

476
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,620
You refused to take me.

477
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,520
Listen.

478
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,510
I've got your license plate number!

479
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,400
Shut up!

480
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,190
Rogue!

481
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,970
Scumbag!

482
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,100
Just go!

483
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,880
I'm telling you.

484
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,280
You can't get away with this even if you drive away!

485
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,090
She's not going to stop.

486
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,360
How dare you curse me?

487
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,430
How dare you curse me?

488
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
How dare you curse me!

489
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,350
You've got a dirty mouth.

490
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,000
Help.

491
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,310
Are you alright?

492
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,570
Get up and walk. Hurry.

493
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,760
Get up.

494
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,440
Come on.

495
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,030
Come on.

496
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,480
Get up and walk.

497
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,960
Come on.

498
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,760
Get up.

499
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,880
Come on. Get up and walk.

500
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,790
I'm letting go.

501
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,480
H-Help me.

502
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,600
I-I'll give you

503
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,510
money.

504
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,440
Come on! Get up.

505
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,640
Walk on your own.

506
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Try walking on your own.

507
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,000
Have a try.

508
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,110
Madam?

509
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,030
Madam?

510
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,150
Wake up.

511
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,360
I think it was an accident.

512
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,880
I had never thought

513
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,600
about killing someone before that.

514
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,750
But what could I do?

515
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,710
I didn't dare to call the police.

516
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,650
I couldn't dump the body

517
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,150
into the river

518
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,630
because it was frozen.

519
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,070
Nor could I bury the body under the ground

520
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,710
because it was frozen, too.

521
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,360
So,

522
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:19,230
I chopped her up

523
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,000
and dropped her body parts

524
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:22,710
along the way

525
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,670
as I drove on

526
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,340
until dawn.

527
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,190
That was

528
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,260
my 1993.

529
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,960
Then how did you all

530
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,000
get together?

531
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,150
And tell us how you committed your crimes.

532
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,360
It was fate.

533
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,440
We were all skilled workers.

534
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,880
I was a fitter.

535
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,110
Ji Dashun was an electrician.

536
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,280
Shi Bi

537
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,360
was a blacksmith.

538
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,150
Every day, we were dressed

539
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,030
like big shots,

540
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,510
wearing gold rings

541
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,800
and gold necklaces

542
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,230
and carrying briefcases.

543
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,550
Now that I think about it,

544
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,710
we were quite stupid.

545
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,070
However,

546
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:26,880
there were people who believed us.

547
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,270
Then, we

548
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,660
found a target,

549
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,430
demanded money,

550
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,190
killed them,

551
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,440
and dismembered the body.

552
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:39,070
That was the whole process.

553
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Pretty meticulous, right?

554
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,510
If you

555
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,070
had caught me in 1993,

556
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:48,150
I'd probably have been sentenced to death then.

557
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,960
But you didn't.

558
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,590
Now, you've caught me.

559
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,150
I've lived for another 18 years.

560
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,150
I've gained.

561
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,920
People always want

562
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,160
another chance.

563
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,360
If I could go back in time,

564
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,030
I think

565
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,430
I would do a better job of covering my tracks.

566
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:20,330
You probably wouldn't even

567
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,710
be able to catch my shadow.

568
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,320
I'm not afraid of death.

569
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,670
Lying in a grave

570
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,610
is fine.

571
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,950
There's no need to be afraid of getting old

572
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,400
or having no money.

573
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,670
There's no need to be afraid

574
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,010
of the miserable life every day.

575
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,400
There's also no need

576
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:00,880
to be afraid

577
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,400
of counting the letters

578
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,180
in the word "afraid."

579
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,030
I'm afraid

580
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,580
you'll be counting

581
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,030
the letters in "afraid" in that place.

582
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,190
Besides,

583
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,980
do you think you'll have a grave?

584
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,370
82...

585
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,760
32...

586
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:54,020
19.

587
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,010
Remember this badge number.

588
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,000
It's my honor.

589
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,480
See you in court.
