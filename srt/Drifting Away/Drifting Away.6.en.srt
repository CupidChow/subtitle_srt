[Episode 6]

4
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,329
What are you waiting for?

5
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,840
Take her away.

6
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,690
What are you doing?

7
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,280
If you had filled the gas in one go,

8
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,960
would this have happened?

9
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,680
If she had called the recruitment number,

10
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,710
wouldn't everything have been fine?

11
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,340
You almost screwed up, you know that?

12
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,090
It's not my fault.

13
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,920
This girl was too cunning!

14
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,350
She was hard to catch!

15
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,910
Besides, if she didn't call,

16
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:29,770
she would have been locked up

17
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,520
for a whole day.

18
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,430
What if she called the police?

19
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,310
I already got her back for you.

20
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,060
Why do you keep beating me?

21
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,360
Quit moving!

22
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,530
Behave yourself!

23
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,360
In order to get you,

24
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,190
I spent two times the time.

25
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,770
You ruined my

26
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,820
short,

27
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,730
smooth,

28
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,160
and fast rhythm.

29
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,850
What?

30
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,710
Do you want to talk?

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Go on.

32
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,800
Say it.

33
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,630
Say it.

34
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,240
Say it.

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,590
What do you want to say?

36
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,710
Did I offend you?

37
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,470
Let go!

38
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,000
-Let go of me! 
-Stop pretending!

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,000
Stop pretending! Stop pretending!

40
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,020
Stop pretending!

41
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,000
I dare you to yell again.

42
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,630
The house isn't yours.

43
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,390
Do you know why I beat you?

44
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,800
Because you swindled people.

45
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,220
I've asked around.

46
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,510
Your business is the best.

47
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:47,920
You have earned

48
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,010
around 500,000 yuan, right?

49
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,110
I've only been here in Luancheng for three months.

50
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,480
Even if I had business every day,

51
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,350
I couldn't have made that much.

52
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,300
You have 8,300 yuan in this statement,

53
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,600
and 44,400 yuan in this one.

54
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,750
You even recently withdrew 20,000 yuan.

55
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,870
Where did the money go?

56
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,750
Who told you to spend that money?

57
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,240
What's the password?

58
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,190
I'm asking you.

59
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,710
What's the password?

60
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,240
435678.

61
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,360
What about yours?

62
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,700
Where did you hide your bank card?

63
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:35,870
I don't have it.

64
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,800
Be honest.

65
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,480
I really don't have it.

66
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,120
Boss, you see this?

67
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,070
She's just so stubborn.

68
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,830
Really.

69
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,130
I had such a hard time with her in the car.

70
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,600
Really.

71
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,250
Just you wait.

72
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,440
I thought you were a big catch.

73
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,440
Turned out you're worth nothing.

74
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
I'll leave it to you two.

75
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,070
Here.

76
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,120
Take it.

77
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,200
Beat her.

78
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,120
Beat her!

79
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,770
You call that beating her?

80
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,190
Let me teach you.

81
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,670
Let me teach you how to beat someone.

82
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,310
Come on.

83
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,580
This is called a beating.

84
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,390
This is called a beating, got it?

85
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,560
This is called a beating, got it?

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,430
Here.

87
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,600
Take it.

88
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,360
Beat her.

89
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:39,830
Come on.

90
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,360
Kill me.

91
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,810
You're quite like me.

92
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,070
Let me choose one for you.

93
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,160
This one.

94
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,040
You must like this.

95
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,240
Your daughter left a letter

96
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,150
before she ran away from home.

97
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,200
Currently, it cannot be filed

98
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,150
as a criminal case.

99
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,510
Officer,

100
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,270
please enlighten me.

101
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
When does it

102
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,030
become a criminal case?

103
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,410
Must someone be dead

104
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,510
for it to be filed as a criminal case?

105
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,000
What are you talking about?

106
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,030
It'd be too late by then!

107
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,870
No one's dying.

108
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,750
Don't talk nonsense.

109
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,320
I understand how you feel.

110
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,270
But didn't I

111
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,000
explain it already?

112
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,960
You should

113
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,030
go back to the police station

114
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,670
and wait for news.

115
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,790
If your child

116
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,000
hasn't been home for more than ten days,

117
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,080
do you have the patience

118
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,180
to stay home and wait for news?

119
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,120
Do you?

120
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,390
Where is your leader?

121
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,220
Where is your leader?

122
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,360
Bring me to your leader.

123
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,600
Are you looking for your daughter

124
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,270
or their leader?

125
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,580
I'll file a case with their leader.

126
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,840
All right.

127
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,600
Listen to me.

128
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,500
I'll send you out.

129
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,470
Wait for our call.

130
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:22,880
We will inform you

131
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,720
immediately about updates.

132
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,320
We'll wait for your call.

133
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,030
Okay.

134
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,820
Hurry up.

135
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:36,960
Here.

136
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,660
Captain Peng, are you busy?

137
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,270
What's up?

138
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:41,750
A couple

139
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,870
came to our criminal police department.

140
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,200
They said their daughter

141
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,240
had been away from home for 12 days.

142
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,960
They reported to the police station.

143
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,910
The police have

144
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,750
uploaded their daughter's information

145
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:49,650
into the system.

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,550
But

147
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,390
there hasn't been progress.

148
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,480
We can't let them come to

149
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,150
our department every day.

150
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,810
So I got the family's information

151
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,720
from the police station.

152
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,150
Please take a look and see

153
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,600
if we can find a breakthrough.

154
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,150
What are their jobs?

155
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,140
The man does contract work on construction sites.

156
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,390
The woman works

157
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,390
at Bishui Garden Property.

[Police Report Registration Form]

159
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,440
Oh my god.

160
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,600
It's dawn.

161
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,580
You tortured them overnight?

162
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,660
They deserved it.

163
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,090
She's so frail.

164
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,550
Can she take it?

165
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,150
If you accidentally kill her,

166
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,290
who'll give us the money?

167
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,550
Even now,

168
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,490
she hasn't told me where the money is.

169
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,200
How about this?

170
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,870
Get some rest.

171
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,200
Let me do it.

172
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:50,150
Okay?

173
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,480
Don't let her sleep.

174
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,080
It's been a day and a night.

175
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,760
Are you hungry?

176
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,710
Are you thirsty?

177
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,790
It's simple.

178
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:14,670
Call your family

179
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,550
to send 50,000 yuan to us.

180
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,670
Then we'll send you back.

181
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,390
Think about it.

182
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,320
Life is more important than money.

183
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,630
If you die here,

184
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,100
your parents

185
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,470
won't even see your body.

186
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,390
Understand?

187
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,420
Will you really kill me?

188
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,790
I'll stab you

189
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,200
with this.

190
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,440
Come on.

191
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,150
Where should I stab you?

192
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,790
Should I poke your thigh

193
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,840
or your heart?

194
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Should I stab you

195
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,440
here instead?

196
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,590
How about this?

197
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,590
You two

198
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,910
can guess head or tail.

199
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,170
If you win,

200
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,080
I'll stab

201
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,750
the other person.

202
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,550
Okay?

203
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,030
Okay?

204
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,600
To be honest,

205
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,360
we don't need this.

206
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,030
I'll ask that fatty to come in later.

207
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,750
I'll find a steel rod.

208
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,550
We'll each stand on one end

209
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,030
and do this.

210
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,250
By the way,

211
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,030
do you know what that

212
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,840
machine is for?

213
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,360
It's fun.

214
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,030
Let me show you.

215
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,190
It's a meat grinder.

216
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,690
If you two won't listen to me,

217
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,530
I'll use that on you.

218
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,910
Try screaming.

219
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,360
Try screaming

220
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,510
for help.

221
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:18,630
Try it.

222
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,600
See if anyone can hear you.

223
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,550
Look at the walls.

224
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,790
Look.

225
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,750
We've made the preparations.

226
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,350
We can kill you

227
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,390
without leaving a trace.

228
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,650
Erasing you from this world

229
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,770
is a piece of cake.

230
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,720
Are you willing to

231
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,720
disappear from this world

232
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,600
just like that?

233
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,320
Are you

234
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,540
calling your family or not?

235
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,670
Are you calling them or not?

236
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,720
Can you

237
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,270
stop pacing about in front of me?

238
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,440
What else can we do?

239
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,320
What else can we do?

240
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:27,630
Hello.

241
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,510
This is Zhen Zhen.

242
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,720
You...

243
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,870
Where have you been?

244
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,270
Zhen Zhen.

245
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:39,630
Zhen Zhen.

246
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,720
Where are you?

247
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,850
Tell me.

248
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,150
I was fooling around with someone

249
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,750
and accidentally shoved him down the stairs.

250
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,550
He's in a coma.

251
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,610
He needs 50,000 yuan for medical expenses.

252
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,240
Where are you?

253
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,030
I'll send you money.

254
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,370
You're from Xuecheng?

255
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,880
Why did you hang up?

256
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,660
She hung up.

257
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,750
I didn't hang up.

258
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,390
Boss.

259
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,000
Didn't Dashun say that girl

260
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,080
was from Maizhou?

261
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,080
Just now,

262
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,270
she called her family.

263
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,140
The number is from Xuecheng.

264
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,240
We...

265
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,240
What should we do?

266
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,130
What a disgusting

267
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,970
mess.

268
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,600
How about this?

269
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,910
Get her to call her family

270
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,040
and ask for money.

271
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,440
Well...

272
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,200
Isn't calling her home

273
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,670
a little...

274
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,770
We nabbed her here.

275
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,870
We can't waste money to keep her alive.

276
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:16,720
Who is it?

277
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:18,170
Hello.

278
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,470
I'm from the criminal police force.

279
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,030
I was on my way to see you.

280
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,310
My daughter called!

281
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,240
She said she pushed someone

282
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,030
down the stairs

283
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:24,869
and hurt him.

284
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,200
She asked us to send money over.

285
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,440
Otherwise, she'll go to jail.

286
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,490
Can we talk inside?

287
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,270
Of course.

288
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:31,960
Come in.

289
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,790
No need to change your shoes.

290
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,270
No need.

291
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:34,790
No need to change your shoes.

292
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:35,400
Come in.

293
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,200
Where was the call from?

294
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,790
I don't know.

295
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,510
Doesn't your phone

296
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,550
display the caller ID?

297
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,140
No.

298
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,000
You didn't pay for the caller ID display service?

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,720
Inform the Telecom Office

300
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,960
and get them to identify this call.

301
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:58,720
Okay.

302
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,350
What's the number here?

303
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,540
I'll write it down for you.

304
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,030
What's wrong?

305
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,830
I think I've

306
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,640
seen you somewhere before.

307
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,640
Bishui Garden.

308
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,070
I went there a few months ago.

309
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,540
The dismemberment case?

310
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,740
You...

311
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,440
Why are you here?

312
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,960
Is my daughter... I...

313
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,350
I...

314
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,200
No.

315
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,640
I...

316
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,830
Alright, stop asking.

317
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:25,550
You...

318
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,790
You haven't solved the case, right?

319
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,880
You...

320
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,270
Stop asking, okay?

321
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,800
How can I not?

322
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,430
Why did he come to our house?

323
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,160
Why is he here?

324
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,270
Enough, stop adding to the mess!

325
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,110
Put it on speaker.

326
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,270
Hello?

327
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:48,640
Dad.

328
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,510
I'll give you a bank card number.

329
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,180
Send money to the card.

330
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,600
After that,

331
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,110
the hospital

332
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,270
will let me go home.

333
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,830
Ask for the card number.

334
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,970
Okay, tell me the card number.

335
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,800
6338.

336
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,110
1138.

337
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,700
8128.

338
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,720
3898.

339
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:21,880
Well,

340
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,480
your mom and I don't have that much

341
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:24,200
money with us.

342
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,350
We need to borrow money.

343
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,890
Can we wire them in parts?

344
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,350
The total will be the same. Tell him.

345
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,820
Send whatever you have.

346
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,000
Send whatever you have.

347
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,030
Which hospital are you in?

348
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,000
Hello?

349
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,680
Hello?

350
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,830
Officer,

351
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,750
is my daughter being kidnapped?

352
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,880
Please save her.

353
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,010
I shouldn't have hit her.

354
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,030
If I hadn't hit her,

355
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,280
she wouldn't have run away from home.

356
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,030
Miss, calm down.

357
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,790
Listen to me.

358
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,880
It's useless to be anxious now.

359
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:05,880
It's useless.

360
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,400
We all need to calm down.

361
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,400
Calm down.

362
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,030
Send him 10,000 yuan first.

363
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,310
Transfer the rest

364
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,550
day by day.

365
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:14,720
Send a few

366
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,590
thousand each day.

367
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,060
Buy as much time as possible

368
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,960
for us to investigate the situation.

369
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,790
Calm down.

370
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:25,680
Gu Jing.

371
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,240
I sent you a card number.

372
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,600
Keep an eye on it 24 hours a day.

373
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,680
We'll talk about it later.

374
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,640
Where is the money?

375
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,880
Didn't you say it'll be transferred today?

376
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,000
9,000 yuan, right?

377
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,510
Yes.

378
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,110
90 notes.

379
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,110
Okay.

380
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,200
Got it.

381
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,330
I'll be right there.

382
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,270
Attention.

383
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,200
The money sent by the Zhen family

384
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,000
was withdrawn by someone

385
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,750
at an ATM in Luancheng.

386
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,550
Get the Luancheng Police Station to cooperate with the investigation.

387
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,990
Report to the superiors immediately.

388
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,510
Get moving.

389
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,450
As for the leaders...

390
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,960
I'll handle it.

391
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:45,940
Okay.

392
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,480
Boss.

393
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,030
Qiu's family hasn't paid us.

394
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,200
The younger one's family

395
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,030
sent over 10,000.

396
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,000
Why didn't your family send money?

397
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,040
I don't know.

398
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,440
You don't know?

399
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,880
You don't know.

400
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,070
Without money,

401
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,920
the world wouldn't

402
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,030
spare you a glance.

403
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
It's too hard

404
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,600
to ask for some money.

405
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,660
Aren't you stubborn?

406
00:22:59,030 --> 00:22:59,720
Listen.

407
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,920
One hit from me, and you'll be

408
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,610
weaker by the day.

409
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,010
This is the unstoppable law.

410
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,400
Ji Dashun?

411
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,350
Isn't he part of Deng Ligang's gang?

412
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,350
These bastards showed up on their own.

413
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,310
Assign men to all banks.

414
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,030
Hurry.

415
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,590
I've wandered around

416
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,310
every ATM in the area.

417
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,720
There are cars and people

418
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,750
guarding all of them.

419
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,920
They look like the police.

420
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,510
One of their families must have called the police.

421
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,900
All the ATMs?

422
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,720
All of them.

423
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,960
Probably.

424
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,230
Why do you think they're cops?

425
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,960
They looked like cops.

426
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,170
You didn't get the money?

427
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,550
The police were watching.

428
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,160
How could I have withdrawn it?

429
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,830
You didn't get a single cent?

430
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,510
No, I really...

431
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,750
The police were watching.

432
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,680
What could I have done, Boss?

433
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,800
There really were police.

434
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,160
No.

435
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,310
Someone must have called the police.

436
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,810
Whose family called the police?

437
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:30,960
Was it yours?

438
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,830
Was it yours?

439
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,460
I'm asking you, was it yours?

440
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,720
No.

441
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,950
Definitely not mine.

442
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
She said it wasn't hers.

443
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,960
But someone must have called the police.

444
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,640
Then...

445
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,440
Then it must be hers.

446
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:41,290
Her family must have done it.

447
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,030
Did your family do it?

448
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,660
Did they?

449
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,640
Shun.

450
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,440
Think about it.

451
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,710
How could it have been her family?

452
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,370
If it were her family,

453
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,000
they would have paid.

454
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,480
The family that called the police

455
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,210
would be paying us to stall for time.

456
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,190
What's your dad's name?

457
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,350
Zhen Yuliang.

458
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,720
What's his name?

459
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,720
Zhen... Zhen Yuliang.

460
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,350
Zhen Yuliang.

461
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,600
Zhen Yuliang.

462
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:36,830
Hello?

463
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,310
Zhen Yuliang.

464
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,030
Why did you call the police?

465
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,570
All the police

466
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,680
are squatting in the place I want to go.

467
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,110
You're colluding with the police

468
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,270
to catch me, right?

469
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,020
Did you think I wouldn't kill her?

470
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,440
Hello?

471
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,000
Listen, Zhen Yuliang.

472
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,310
I don't want a single cent now.

473
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,480
Hello, who are you?

474
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,590
You will never

475
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,890
see your daughter again!

476
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,750
Now all the police

477
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,880
are squatting in the place I want to go.

478
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,270
You're colluding with the police

479
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,510
to catch me, right?

480
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,570
Did you think I wouldn't kill her?

481
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,170
Zhen Yuliang,

482
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,570
I don't want a single cent now.

483
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,440
You will never

484
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,720
see your daughter again!

485
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,950
Don't panic.

486
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,200
There's 59,000 in the card.

487
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,670
This matter won't end for now.

488
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,480
Have you recorded

489
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,210
the license plate numbers

490
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,440
of the cars that stopped by the bank?

491
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:03,920
Yes.

492
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,840
Tell the traffic control department

493
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,070
to check on

494
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,680
all those cars.

495
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,720
Inform the bank

496
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,230
to make the ATM confiscate the card

497
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,160
if someone uses it to

498
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,880
withdraw money,

499
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,220
and ask them to get it from the counter.

500
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,170
Okay.

501
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,750
I know who you take after

502
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,440
now.

503
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,590
Your family

504
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,510
are all so willful.

505
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,550
They're working together

506
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,830
with the police

507
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,840
to capture us.

508
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,440
You know?

509
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,270
This way...

510
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,790
We'll be scared.

511
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,590
Do you really think

512
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,440
you can escape from

513
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,360
this room

514
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,830
with the police involved?

515
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,400
You're too naive.

516
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:42,960
Later,

517
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,970
I'll cut off your flesh

518
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,350
bit by bit with the knife,

519
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,800
and teach your parents a lesson.

520
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,160
Let them know that

521
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,640
they delivered you

522
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,000
into this world.

523
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,350
And I'll remove you

524
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,770
from this world.

525
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,910
This place

526
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,640
is too

527
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:24,880
hot.

528
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,200
You start to stink

529
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,480
one day

530
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,920
without showering.

531
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,830
Yes.

532
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,920
When someone's born,

533
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,390
the first thing to do

534
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,110
is to take a shower.

535
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,640
When someone dies,

536
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,030
the last thing to do

537
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,750
is to cleanse the body.

538
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,430
Leave this world

539
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,550
in a clean state.

540
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,790
Women

541
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,510
care about feelings.

542
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,790
Men

543
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,700
care about logic.

544
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,440
Today,

545
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,070
it's fate that brought us together

546
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,640
in this room.

547
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,400
Don't complain about fate.

548
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,790
Every step in life

549
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,720
is decided by yourself.

550
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,440
I need to smear more oil

551
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,830
in the bathtub.

552
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,480
The blood won't stick easily this way.

553
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,480
It's easy to clean after.

554
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:28,920
Don't be afraid.

555
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,160
By then,

556
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,640
I'll give you a quick end.

557
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,830
You won't feel anything.

558
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,030
When you get to the afterlife,

559
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,920
be happy.

560
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,440
Don't come back to me.

561
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,070
He's calling you.

562
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,350
Take it away.

563
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,430
From the moment I saw you,

564
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,000
I knew you had a fight in you.

565
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,490
I wondered who you reminded me of.

566
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,750
Today, I suddenly remembered it.

567
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,760
You're just like

568
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,580
that girl called Huang Ying.

569
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,310
She was so stubborn.

570
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,310
This bracelet

571
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,960
belonged to her.

572
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,390
I proved it to her with my skills.

573
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,750
The knife

574
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,150
is indeed better than the mouth.

575
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,030
How much more money do you have?

576
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,860
I've given you all my money.

577
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,310
What else do you want?

578
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,190
I can kill you, you know?

579
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,150
Go ahead.

580
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,280
Kill me.

581
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,800
I'll wait for you in hell.

582
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,760
Go to hell then.

583
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,150
She bragged to me

584
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,880
that it was their family heirloom.

585
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,440
I thought it must be valuable,

586
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,489
so I didn't sell it.

587
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,510
I'll give it to you today.

588
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,440
I'll help you put it on.

589
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,840
Try moving again.

590
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,710
Want me to get the pincer

591
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,190
again?

592
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,420
Don't get me wrong.

593
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,540
It's not yours now.

594
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,190
I'm just lending it to you

595
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,970
to get some of your blood on it.

596
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,730
Give it back to me

597
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,480
when you go to the afterlife.

598
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,230
You two are leaving soon.

599
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,550
Let me tell you

600
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,360
another story.

601
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,660
My hometown is in Huayuan County.

602
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:47,940
It's a small place.

603
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,070
It's not far from Xuecheng.

604
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,630
When I was 14,

605
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,280
my mom had breast cancer.

606
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,590
In order to treat her,

607
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:00,570
we sold our house and land.

608
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,590
But she still died in the end.

609
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,880
When I was 15,

610
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,150
I traveled out to work.

611
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,480
I worked in a

612
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,170
barber shop,

613
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,630
sold vegetables in the market,

614
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,230
and did all kinds of dirty work.

615
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,880
When I was 18,

616
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,940
I met a boss.

617
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,700
He was generous to me.

618
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,030
He was nice to my family too.

619
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,430
I didn't know

620
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,460
he had a family back then.

621
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,190
Not long after,

622
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,590
his wife came to me

623
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,320
and humiliated me.

624
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,370
She took all my

625
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,420
hard-earned money.

626
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,760
That time, a friend

627
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,070
introduced me to a bar

628
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,610
to be a saleswoman.

629
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,330
Although the working hours

630
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,070
were not fixed,

631
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,150
I earned something

632
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:02,220
every time.

633
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,840
Right there,

634
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,510
I met them.
