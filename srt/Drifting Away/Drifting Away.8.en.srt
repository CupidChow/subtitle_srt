196
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,760
Yes.

197
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,380
For our futures,

198
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,590
let's never look back.

199
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,220
This trauma...

200
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,500
let's erase it.

201
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,670
Let's not meet again.

202
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,100
Let's not.

203
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:02,960
I wish you well.

204
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,890
Damn those two brats.

205
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,060
Can't believe they slipped through our fingers.

206
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,920
Even stabbing her a million times won't be enough.

207
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,590
Don't worry, Boss Lady.

208
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,110
Isn't one of them from Xuecheng?

209
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,490
Once I go back,

210
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,640
I'll kill her first thing

211
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,690
and then her family.

212
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,330
You still want to go back?

213
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,140
Why not?

214
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,930
No one's home waiting for you?

215
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,100
What's so great about going home?

216
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,750
One must always return to their roots.

217
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,920
I have my son at home.

218
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:50,790
What about you?

219
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,000
What do you think?

220
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,750
To be honest,

221
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,160
with the matter of the girls

222
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,230
and throughout our escape,

223
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,320
no matter what I do,

224
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,410
I just feel uneasy.

225
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,270
I'd been kneeling

226
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,570
for a whole day.

227
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,100
Kneeling there,

228
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,680
I felt like even

229
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,510
Buddha can't help me.

230
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,960
My legs and stomach were

231
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,040
trembling non-stop.

232
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:16,570
There was a chill

233
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,900
that kept invading my bones.

234
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,510
Look.

235
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,760
After this blunder,

236
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,510
one wants to go home

237
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,660
and one is scared witless.

238
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Everyone has their own ideas.

239
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,400
They're all right.

240
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,570
After this meal...

241
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,300
let's call it quits.

242
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,870
Dashun.

243
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,490
You have a wife

244
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,130
and a kid

245
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:17,560
at home.

246
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,130
So you should...

247
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,720
get a bigger share.

248
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,390
Thank you, Boss.

249
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,090
Why are you suddenly splitting

250
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,190
our earnings?

251
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,060
Shi Bi.

252
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,730
We were both

253
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,880
fired from the factory.

254
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,440
It's like

255
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,170
we share the same fate.

256
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,270
Then we started

257
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,370
this meat factory together.

258
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,370
All good things must come to an end.

259
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,460
Some day, I'll even have to

260
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,200
say goodbye to my mom.

261
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,300
Boss.

262
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,440
Like you just said...

263
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,700
I've been with you for...

264
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,340
even longer than Hongyu.

265
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,900
I'll follow you for life,

266
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,480
Boss.

267
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,310
I've never once thought of leaving you.

268
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,570
Boss.

269
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,410
I've never once r-regretted

270
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,410
enjoying life with you.

271
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,870
Here.

272
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,670
Tell me.

273
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:31,770
Where are we going?

274
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,440
We'll both follow you.

275
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:34,990
Are you crazy?

276
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:36,830
Um...

277
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,800
Boss, t-t-that's not what I meant.

278
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,200
Boss.

279
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,830
H-He...

280
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,730
I'm with you for life.

281
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,750
He is immature.

282
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,330
D-Don't stoop

283
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,260
to his level.

284
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,760
What's wrong with vegetarian food?

285
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,830
You won't die without meat!

286
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,830
So many complaints, huh?

287
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,070
Shi Bi.

288
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,450
What are you doing?

289
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,100
Don't make a scene.

290
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,280
So what should we do?

291
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,220
Should we...

292
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,290
still split up or not?

293
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:11,960
N-No way.

294
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,380
W-We mustn't split up.

295
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,050
Okay.

296
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,720
Let's split

297
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,570
the money...

298
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,030
and stay together.

299
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,710
I've already got four train tickets

300
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,400
from the ticket dealer.

301
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,070
Let's go together.

[Rongxin Bank]

303
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:54,970
How's it going?

304
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,130
Let's grab a bite.

305
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,440
We have to eat.

306
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,920
No card

307
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,890

308
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:03,950
or bank transactions.

309
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
What should we do next?

310
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,890
This is the last place

311
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,790
they appeared.

312
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,540
[Incoming call: Director Jiang]

313
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,190
Go eat.

314
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,740
I'll check the surveillance nearby.

315
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,480
Have some.

316
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,530
I'm not in the mood to eat.

317
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,310
Who is it?

318
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,600
Director Jiang.

319
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,110
Captain Peng rejected his call twice.

320
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,480
Should I answer it?

321
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,880
Yes.

322
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,000
Hello, Director Jiang.

323
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,160
Captain Peng...

324
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,830
Well...

325
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,590
Okay, I...

326
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,200
Got it.

327
00:28:59,400 --> 00:28:59,880
Yes.

328
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:03,420
What is it?

329
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,940
They want us to go back.

330
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,140
After

331
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,840
each crime,

332
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,360
they'd always mop the floor thoroughly

333
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,750
and then clean it

334
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,530
with alcohol,

Zero trace.

339
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,110
When they evacuate,

340
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,280
they'd spray air freshener

341
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,020
throughout the place.

342
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,120
They left in a hurry this time

343
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,150

344
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,610
There are fingerprints in the house.

that Song Hongyu

347
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,280

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,690
Okay, Captain Peng?

349
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,850

Mom, I'm scared they'll come to our house.

00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,340
I can't breathe.

368
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,980
They'll be at the door when it gets dark.

369
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,030
If I fall asleep...

370
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,650
As soon as I fall asleep, they'll be here.

They won't come here.

372

They can't come here.

00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,750
No way.

Yes, no way.

381

Lie down and sleep.

386
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,700
Here.

387
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,420
Here.

388
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:44,850
Here.

389
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,440
Don't go.

390
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,160
I won't.

391
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,900
I won't leave.

392
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,920
I'll stay here.

393
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:04,860
Sleep.

394
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,630
Go to sleep.

395
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,280
What should we do?

396
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,030
This won't do.

397
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,450
Our baby

398
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
has nightmares every night.

399
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,160
She can't go out, see others,

400
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,020
or go to school

401
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,070
in the day.

402
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,450
If this goes on, her health will decline.

403
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,350
The psychiatrist said

404
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,000
a new environment,

405
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,410
like a new city,

406
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,630
might help her recover gradually.

407
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,450
But our home is here.

408
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,370
Where can we go?

409
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,190
Hexi.

410
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,080
I have a friend there.

411
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,150
I've found a job

412
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,490
and also contacted her school.

413
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,410
We're really responsible

414
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,750
for her state now.

415
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,430
Let alone moving houses,

416
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,480
I'd agree even if we have to die.

417
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,720
As long as she's okay,

418
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:31,530
our family won't fall apart.

419
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,800
I'll listen to you.

420
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,950
Let's go to Hexi.

421
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,830
Don't buy this anymore.

422
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,710
It's so bad.

423
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,120
Don't worry.

424
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,610
This is delicious.

425
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,760
Pack your things later.

426
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,130
We'll get off at the next stop.

427
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,670
Where the hell are we?

428
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,740
A hell for people like us.

429
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,500
It's safe.

430
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,950
Suilu.

431
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,930
It's both new and old.

432
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,720
During its urbanization construction,

433
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,010
a group of Northeasterners

434
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,510
came to work in the western regions.

435
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,750
Their accent is similar to ours.

436
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,840
It'll be...

437
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,510
easy to blend in there.

438
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,970
I've long been tired of running.

439
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,150
Any nook or corner will do.

440
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,910
As long as it keeps the wind and rain out.

441
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,530
Is this short-term

442
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,240
or long-term?

443
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,630
Guess.

444
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,850
[Suilu]

445
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,310
I can't stand this life.

446
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,690
This is too shabby.

447
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,840
Boss, how long more do we have

448
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,650
to stay here?

449
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,330
It's only been a few days.

450
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,480
What's with the food?

451
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,580
Do better.

452
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,640
We can't do what we used to.

453
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,740
We're at a new environment...

454
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,090
so we've to live differently.

455
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,580
Boss.

456
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,660
If you're planning

457
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,880
to keep living

458
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,410
in this place,

459
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,660
we have to think of

460
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:44,920
a way to

461
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,860
make a living.

462
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,330
That's right.

463
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,400
If we want to stay

464
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,860
for a long time,

465
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,830
we need to find a way

466
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,280
to put food on the table.

467
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,680
Do proper business?

468
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,110
Then we have to

469
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,070
change our identities.

470
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,080
New ID cards?

471
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:16,900
You're right.

472
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,640
Change our identities.

473
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,900
Completely erase our past,

474
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,910
as if we've never lived before.

475
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,940
Make a new future for ourselves.

476
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,860
Let's change our identities.

477
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,890
A clean slate.
