[DRIFTING AWAY]

00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,800
[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,650
[Episode 10]

4
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,950
I know

5
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,509
this is very difficult.

6
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,950
But I can't think of any other way.

7
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,400
I understand how everyone feels.

8
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,000
If you don't want to do it,

9
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:58,950
you can opt out.

10
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,660
I didn't say that.

11
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,760
I didn't say we wouldn't investigate.

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,430
That's not what we meant.

13
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:05,920
Thank you.

14
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:07,920
Come on.

15
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,910
Let's begin.

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,800
Come on.

17
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,280
Come on.

18
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,020
Mom.

19
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,200
Is this our home?

20
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,400
Did we come to the wrong place?

21
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,710
This is our home, right?

22
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:30,750
Peng Zhao–

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,030
You didn't come to the wrong place.

24
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,500
Please, come in.

25
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Son, look at this. What is it?

26
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,710
Such a big wall!

27
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,360
Son,

28
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,190
isn't this cool?

29
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,050
Where did you get this?

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,210
This is amazing.

31
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,710
All right.

32
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,470
I want to go to the moon!

33
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,440
Let the kid go wild.

34
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,240
You don't need to join in the craziness.

35
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
I want to go to the moon! I want to go to the moon!

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,450
That full wall of wallpaper...

37
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,680
I want to go to the moon!

38
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,150
What about the pillar?

39
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,060
I had it knocked down.

40
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,950
Knocked down?

41
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,960
Guess what happened after it was knocked down?

42
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,579
What?

43
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,740
The house didn't collapse.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
So it wasn't a load-bearing wall.

45
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:24,650
Right.

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,560
-We should have smashed it earlier.
-Right.

47
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,800
Where's my cupboard?

48
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,470
Here.

49
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,930
Peng Zhaolin.

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,650
A new color.

51
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
It's quite close to your skin tone, isn't it?

52
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,960
We've been married for 10 years now.

53
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,400
We're now living in a new house. Not bad!

54
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,190
Did you win the lottery?

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
How much did you spend?

56
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,710
My bros helped out.

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,280
I didn't spend much money, really.

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,030
The most expensive thing

59
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,490
is just this.

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,910
I wanted to get something for good luck.

61
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,780
How much was it?

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,470
5,600 yuan.

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:51,870
What?

64
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,400
After the discount it's 3,800 yuan.

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,960
That's too expensive.

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,520
I don't like it.

67
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,840
The meaning isn't good.

68
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,770
Always on the go, just like you.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,240
Never at home all day long.

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,150
Return it.

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
You should think positively about everything.

72
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,840
Why don't you think of it as "instant success"?

73
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,400
More like "just so-so."

74
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,280
I "look to you for guidance."

75
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,520
That's a good one.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,089
Wipe the drool off your mouth.

77
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,269
Who's drooling?

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,510
Isn't this it?

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,560
No.

80
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,070
Isn't this it?

81
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,430
Your body

82
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,450
has a lot of moisture trapped inside.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Later,

84
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll give you a moxibustion treatment.

85
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,070
Is your technique reliable?

86
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:34,800
Using me for practice?

87
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,310
What if you make

88
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,270
my back look like a Go board?

89
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,370
Black and white patches all over.

90
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,460
How am I not reliable?

91
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,600
If you get this treatment outside,

92
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,710
it would cost at least one to two hundred.

93
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,230
You charge that much for a game of chess?

94
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,120
I couldn't afford that even if I wanted to.

95
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,850
You want to come up with that money?

96
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,600
Go to the slaughterhouse.

97
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,680
You can make money quickly there.

98
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,400
What's the use of making quick money?

99
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,150
The key is to earn a lot.

100
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,860
They make hundreds of thousands a year.

101
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,080
How much? Hundreds of thousands?

102
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,030
You've got connections, huh?

103
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,000
Can't you stop relying on me

104
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,200
for everything?

105
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,460
Since when have I done that?

106
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,980
I'm just leaning on you.

107
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,120
Are you going or not?

108
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,720
Of course I'm going. Why wouldn't I?

109
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,210
That's a lot of money.

110
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,010
Do you even know how to do it?

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,190
Know what?

112
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,490
What they do at the slaughter house.

113
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,420
I'll learn on the job.

114
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,100
Come on, eat this.

115
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,070
Go ahead, eat.

116
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,400
Careful, it's hot, hot, hot.

117
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,240
Blow on it, blow on it.

118
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,750
It's delicious, right?

119
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
It's much better than what you make.

120
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,600
It's your first time eating this

121
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,480
so you find it novel.

122
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,350
Ma'am.

123
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,830
I want to buy some tea leaves.

124
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:54,950
All right.

125
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,870
What kind of tea would you like?

126
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,750
Let me ask you,

127
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,510
do you usually eat this

128
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,680
in the morning?

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,430
No.

130
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,390
Then what do you eat?

131
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,610
Shumai, pancakes, and eggs.

132
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,480
What?

133
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,040
Say it slowly.

134
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,750
Shumai, pancakes, and eggs.

135
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,960
Shumai,

136
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,500
pancakes, and eggs?

137
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,560
That's not right.

138
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,680
Come on, say it again with me.

139
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,830
Shumai.

140
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,990
Shumai, pancakes, and eggs.

141
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,750
Shumai, pancakes, and eggs.

142
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,510
That's right.

143
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,280
That's better this time.

144
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:28,920
Good.

145
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,350
Be careful on the road.

146
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,100
Watch out for cars.

147
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,600
All right.

148
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,750
Come here.

149
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,000
Put your backpack on.

150
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,560
All right.

151
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,480
Okay, let's go.

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,170
You're in third grade?

153
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,430
What are you learning in third grade?

154
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,290
So how's your new partner treating you?

155
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,680
He's...

156
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,600
attentive,

157
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,560
skillful,

158
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,950
and a good cook.

159
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,390
The food he makes

160
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,610
is even better than restaurant food.

161
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:12,920
He seems

162
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,160
not to be from our western district, right?

163
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,160
No, he's not.

164
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,510
Haven't you asked him

165
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,470
why he came here?

166
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,430
Why did you come here?

167
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,430
Well, I married a man,

168
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,070
for clothes and food.

169
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,680
I married him,

170
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,980
where else would I go if not here?

171
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,090
That's it.

172
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,270
People who come here,

173
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,160
how many of them aren't here

174
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,000
to make a living?

175
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,630
A wife who holds her head high,

176
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,750
a husband who keeps his head down.

177
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,360
Look at the way he walks,

178
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,450
with his head down like that.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,710
Let me tell you,

180
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:37,789
this person,

181
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,950
he's hard to figure out.

182
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,400
Are you jealous because

183
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,600
you see someone likes

184
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,360
me and my son?

185
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,470
Today, let's talk about

186
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,670
[Bleach in real life]

187
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,390
how bleach works in real life.

188
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,120
We are using

189
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,270
sodium chloride for bleach.

190
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,790
Let's investigate

191

The mother's genotype is also Aa.

199
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,050

You're different from me.

383
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,140
Look at my old mother.

384
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,030
She gets lost every other day.

385
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,200
My brother...

386
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,400
His life skills are too poor.

387
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,370
He can't handle her.

388
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,830
I'm at my wit's end here.

389
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,190
Did you bring

390
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,190
your wife's family over too?

391
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,330
That's a

392
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,270
different situation.

393
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
Look at her father.

394
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,880
He talks nonsense all the time

395
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,430
and gets drunk with just a little alcohol.

396
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,590
And her brother...

397
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,830
Look.

398
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,550
He's even worse.

399
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,170
Well, if I can't bring them over, it's fine too.

400
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,110
Let me go home and visit them, will you?

401
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,590
You're homesick, aren't you?

402
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,640
Sure.

403
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,680
If you win this round,

404
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,030
I'll let you go home for a look.

405
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,510
If you lose...

406
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,200
Hey, Boss...

407
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,090
There won't be a chance anymore.

408
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,790
The years pass by so quickly.

409
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,640
It's time for us to gather again.

410
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,510
Let's all be happy.

411
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:11,820
As long as we can be together,

412
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,740
it's our blessing.

413
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,800
Like I said,

414
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,830
we're now

415
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,400
together less and apart more.

416
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,030
But no matter what,

417
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,110
we can still meet.

418
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,460
Thank you, bros,

419
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,140
for the beef and mutton

420
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,650
you brought from the slaughterhouse.

421
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,730
Thank you, bros,

422
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,770
for the good wine you brought.

423
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,040
All right, all right.

424
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,890
Stop talking.

425
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,510
The hot pot is all boiling.

426
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,550
There's nothing good to eat, let's have some meat.

427
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:37,680
Go ahead.

428
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:38,910
Let's eat.

429
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,820
Boss.

430
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,750
Brother-in-law.

431
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,030
I went to look at cars a couple of days ago.

432
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,750
Those cars for the New Year are so cheap now.

433
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,680
All discounted.

434
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,960
When can you get me one?

435
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,030
Get a car for me to drive.

436
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,560
You stay at home all day.

437
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,070
What's the use of having a car?

438
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,210
He's unfamiliar with this place.

439
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,210
Where else can he go

440
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,270
if not stay at home?

441
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,340
I asked him to come help me at the billiard hall

442
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,160
to earn some pocket money.

443
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,480
Has he ever come?

444
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,590
I mean.

445
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,520
Brother-in-law,

446
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:14,980
here?

447
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,830
This billiard hall?

448
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,750
This place of yours,

449
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,330
what's the point of coming here?

450
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,480
How about this,

451
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,270
you get me a car.

452
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,960
Really, get me a car.

453
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,590
I'll sort this place out

454
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,370
for you.

455
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,350
Crystal clear.

456
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,020
Sort it out crystal clear, huh?

457
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,870
Get you a car?

458
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,610
How's a rocket instead?

459
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,530
As if I owe you anything.

460
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,320
It's the New Year,

461
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,530
who are you cursing at?

462
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,860
You don't owe my son,

463
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,680
but you owe my daughter.

464
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,370
If you owe my daughter,

465
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:55,190
you owe our entire family!

466
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,150
Seriously.

467
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,680
Eat.

468
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,720
Why is she hitting people? This old lady.

469
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,020
Can't you control this?

470
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,880
Mom, mom!

471
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,530
Auntie!

472
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,440
Auntie, auntie!

473
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,350
If you're buying, buy one for me first.

474
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,170
It's the New Year.

475
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,270
What are you doing?

476
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,410
We're just joking around, right?

477
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,160
It's the New Year.

478
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,760
My friend and I here,

479
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,440
we'd like to propose a toast to everyone.

480
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,070
Wishing everyone good health

481
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,870
in the coming year.

482
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,110
Yes, yes.

483
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,930
It's the New Year,

484
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,780
let's all be harmonious.

485
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,200
It's just a car, right?

486
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,640
Next year, when I sell those sheep,

487
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,530
I'll get a car for each of you.

488
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,980
How's that?

489
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,240
Now that's what I like to hear.

490
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,070
That's great.

491
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:28,680
Right, Uncle?

492
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,510
Come on, let's drink up.

493
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,000
Cheers.

494
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,750
Come on, come on.

495
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,720
Bottoms up, bottoms up.

496
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,270
Happy New Year.

497
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:32,880
Come on, come on.

498
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,960
I just don't understand.

499
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,210
They can bring

500
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,200
their family over

501
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,830
like this.

502
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,270
But I can't even go back for a quick look.

503
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,240
Don't argue with him.

504
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,830
If you argue with him,

505
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,000
what good will it do?

506
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,690
Let me tell you,

507
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,310
if you ask me,

508
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,170
you really can't go back.

509
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,000
At this time,

510
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,940
we need to prioritize safety.

511
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,590
Well, his idea of safety

512
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,650
is bringing over a bunch

513
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,400
of trouble?

514
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,600
How sickening.

515
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,550
All right.

516
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
We're all brothers here.

517
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:52,960
Well...

518
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,200
Feng... Feng what?

519
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:55,350
Feng Shuanghuan.

520
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,450
How is she treating you?

521
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,030
It's just like that.

522
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,590
Pretty good.

523
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,350
I'm just trying to stay safe too, you know.

524
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:03,890
You do need to be careful too.

525
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,280
You always fail at things like this.

526
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,550
Who are you talking about?

527
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,430
You better watch yourself.

528
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,450
H-How's it going for you?

529
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,800
That old woman Xiao Liying

530
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:13,110
is getting greedy now.

531
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,100
Just cause she's a little pretty,

532
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,350
she's now making demands.

533
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,640
All she talks about is money.

534
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,640
Problems that money can solve

535
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,830
aren't real problems,

536
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,440
right?

537
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,080
I mean, sure you can say that,

538
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,200
but is money that easy to make?

539
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,840
Then what?

540
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:28,570
Can we make money

541
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,590
like we used to?

542
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:35,510
I mean

543
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,840
I just want to go back and see my son for a bit.

544
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,060
Is that asking too much?

545
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,480
It's not.

546
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,720
So what do you want to do?

547
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,400
What can I do?

548
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,580
What can I possibly do?

549
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,310
All right.

550
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,550
Stop thinking about it.

551
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,070
This matter,

552
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,230
let's talk about it again in a couple of days.

553
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:09,830
There's someone!

554
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,030
Theres's–

555
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,440
Why are you here?

556
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:23,820
I-I'm using the bathroom.

557
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,840
Hurry up.

558
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,170
I'll wait for you outside.

559
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,000
Where are you going?

560
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,960
Want to go home?

561
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,470
Why didn't you tell me?

562
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,960
I know you don't understand.

563
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,470
We brought our families over,

564
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,820
and you want that too.

565
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,720
Actually, we thought about it

566
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,080
before we brought our family together.

567
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,480
We can live together,

568
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,860
or die together.

569
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,770
Think about it.

570
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,210
Your child is still so young.

571
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:35,000
They need to grow up.

572
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,840
They need to study.

573
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:38,930
If one day...

574
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,490
we get caught by the police...

575
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,640
what do you plan to do?

576
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,310
Actually, your son

577
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,520
and your wife

578
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,160
can be completely uninvolved

579
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,150
in this matter.

580
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,290
Right?

581
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:11,590
Hey.

582
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,240
Did you give them the things?

583
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,790
The money has been delivered.

584
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:21,680
Hello?

585
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,450
You had someone else deliver the money back?

586
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,920
Why didn't you come back yourself?

587
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,230
I'll be back in a couple of days.

588
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,420
I asked someone to send it back to you first.

589
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,480
Do you still have

590
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,310
me and your son in your heart?

591
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,170
Will our son ever see his father again?

592
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,830
Spend it wisely, don't waste it.

593
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,510
Use it for the child's education.

594
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:44,960
I understand.

595
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,750
How's your health?

596
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,400
I'm fine, I'm fine.

597
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,750
I'm busy. I have to go now.

598
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:56,960
Boss,

599
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,640
I... I... I just want...

600
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,510
I want to... to take a look.

601
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,490
I want to go home and take a look.

602
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,880
I just miss home.

603
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,440
I want to go home and take a look.

604
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,240
Let me tell you something.

605
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,590
Remember.

606
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,160
Since I can find someone

607
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,110
to send money to your wife,

608
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
I can find someone

609
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,160
to send your wife to her funeral.

610
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,990
[2011]

611
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,070
Peng Cheng.

612
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,240
Mom, I'm going to training.

613
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:52,920
Your dad isn't back yet.

614
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,000
I won't wait for Dad.

615
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,720
I'll go with you.

616
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
I can go by myself.

617
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,660
I'm old enough.

618
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,640
No matter how old you are, you're still my son.

619
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,510
Don't be silly.

620
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,070
Balloon! Balloon!

621
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,280
Mentor.

622
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,630
There's a room here.

623
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,650
Do you see it?

624
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,880
Two points.

625
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,670
First,

626
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,449
you were following me too closely.

627
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,070
Second,

628
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,639
you were only focusing on me

629
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,989
and not paying attention to your surroundings.

630
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,870
I've told you this more than once.

631
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,080
Don't be too obsessive.

632
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,670
The more you want to capture someone,

633
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,870
the more you need to relax.

634
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,070
You always make the same mistake.

635
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,190
So, do you think

636
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,390
I can give you a passing grade today?

637
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:02,800
No.

638
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,630
I think so too.

639
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,510
Come on, push harder! Harder!

640
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:06,840
Zhen Zhen.

641
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,590
Zhen Zhen.

642
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,000
Let me spar with you.

643
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,110
I told you to train her,

644
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
not to kill her.

645
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,660
You need to rest.

646
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,190
You'll wear yourself out like this.

647
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,940
Mentor...

648
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,190
Sis.

649
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,300
You're so good at teaching.

650
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:44,820
I understood everything as soon as you explained it.

651
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,470
That's good then.

652
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,400
Then I guess I'm not eating for nothing.

653
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:49,880
Zhen Zhen,

654
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
let me interview you for a bit.

655
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,350
Why do you insist on working in criminal investigation?

656
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,510
Because

657
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,360
my mentor told me

658
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,150
this is the only way to completely eliminate

659
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:00,840
my fears.

660
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,620
Aren't you just dragging others into danger with you?

661
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,430
That's not a nice thing to say.

662
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,420
How is it dragging others into danger?

663
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,520
Every time you go out on a call,

664
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,000
your son and I worry so much.

665
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,280
We're afraid something might happen to you.

666
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,910
And this child,

667
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,350
what must her parents think?

668
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,070
Ma'am,

669
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:25,560
actually, my parents are quite supportive of me.

670
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,490
Your parents must be really bold then.

671
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,280
It's mainly cause

672
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,110
I've thought about it for a long time.

673
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,230
I really feel that

674
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,150
Mentor is right.

675
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,510
Moreover,

676
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,800
to eliminate fear,

677
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,710
the only way is to face it directly.

678
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,190
That's why I came back.

679
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,630
What are you sighing about?

680
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,000
What's wrong?

681
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:53,190
What's wrong with you?

682
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:53,810
I-I...

683
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,450
So if Peng Cheng becomes a police officer in the future,

684
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,000
what'd come of that?

685
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,110
Peng Zhaolin.

686
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,980
Whether he becomes a police officer or not

687
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,510
is something we can discuss together,

688
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,030
right?

689
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,110
But this girl,

690
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,820
if something happens to her,

691
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:08,030
can you take that responsibility?

692
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm asking you.

693
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,000
Hey.

694
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,800
She just said very clearly

695
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,760
why she wants to be a police officer.

696
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,280
I heard it clearly.

697
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,920
I... Yes.

698
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:17,440
You heard...

699
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,760
So what?

700
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,440
Yes, you heard it clearly.

701
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,480
It shows that her parents

702
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,360
are amazing.

703
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,840
Yes,

704
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,770
so why are you still

705
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,030
questioning me about it?

706
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Can you be more respectful

707
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,290
when you speak to me?

708
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,190
Stop with all the sighing and groaning.

709
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,230
Doing this at the dinner table

710
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,200
makes me embarrassed,

711
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,830
you know?

712
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,630
Peng Zhaolin.

713
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,000
What are you trying to do?

714
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,590
I just want to tell you!

715
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,720
I can wash the dishes later.

716
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,250
As if I need you to wash them.

717
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,830
I'll have to rewash them after you're done anyway.

718
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,590
You should go to the hospital tomorrow.

719
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,670
I'm not sick.

720
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,280
My brother is sick, okay?

721
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,550
What's wrong with your brother?

722
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,840
He got a heart bypass surgery.

723
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,320
Your brother got a heart bypass surgery...

724
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:57,880
What about it?

725
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,580
I'll go, alright?

726
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,070
[Inpatient]

727
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,320
Brother-in-law.

728
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,420
You came despite being busy?

729
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,000
Brother.

730
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,590
I heard from Cheng Guo that

731
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,760
you're recovering well from the surgery.

732
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,480
I came to check on you.

733
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,390
I've already told Guo

734
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,970
that after a few more days of rest,

735
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,190
I'll be able to leave the hospital and go home.

736
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,920
You're so busy,

737
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,150
yet you made a trip here.

738
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,150
I'm not busy.

739
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,590
Why was your heart

740
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,790
having discomforts suddenly?

741
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,690
It's just fate, I suppose.

742
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,670
Fortunately,

743
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,360
my condition is treatable.

744
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:42,070
The one next bed

745
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,740
had it worse than me.

746
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,140
The doctors don't even dare to operate on him.

747
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:47,920
Right.

748
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,290
When Brother first got admitted,

749
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,150
he said he wanted to leave.

750
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,670
I saw on the medical chart said that

751
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:53,820
his name was Sun something.

752
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,630
But looking at his face,

753
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,400
it seemed very familiar.

754
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:57,560
Now that you mention it, I remember.

755
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,030
He was my middle school classmate.

756
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,790
He was quite a troublemaker in school,

757
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,080
really famous.

758
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,110
But I remember his surname was Deng...

759
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,190
How come he's changed it to Sun?

760
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,710
Our place isn't that big,

761
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,630
to run into such a coincidence...

762
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,840
Deng?

763
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,110
Right.

764
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,420
You're from No. 4 Middle School, aren't you, Ran?

765
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,260
Yes, No. 4 Middle School.

766
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:29,820
What's wrong?

767
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,480
Have a look.

768
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:32,550
Is it him?

769
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,370
Brother,

770
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,480
why are you insulting me?

771
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:38,850
My ex-classmate.

772
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,320
Do I look that old?

773
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,320
Is this him then?

774
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,590
Yes, that's him.

775
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,440
No doubt.

776
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,320
His name is Deng... Deng... What was it again?

777
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:47,960
Deng Lide.

778
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,510
Right, Deng Lide.
