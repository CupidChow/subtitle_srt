[This is a work of fiction. Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental.]

3
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,800
[Episode 4]

4
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,479
You're early today.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,470
Two of Bamboos.

6
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,710
I can't sleep.

7
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,430
I might as well come and play a few rounds.

8
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,710
One of Characters.

9
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,410
Boss Lady.

10
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,840
What are we having for lunch?

11
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,400
Good food.

12
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,710
Duck soup and radish stewed beef brisket.

13
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,830
Your turn.

14
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,840
My hands stink.

15
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,360
Hurry up.

16
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,840
Alright, stop laughing. Hurry up and play your tiles.

17
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,000
Goodness.

18
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,190
I'm waiting for a tile now.

19
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,430
Seven of Characters.

20
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,440
Jin.

21
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,360
How did you get out today?

22
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,079
I told my wife that

23
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,750
there's an emergency

24
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,590
and I must go to the scene immediately.

25
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,079
Five of Bamboos.

26
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,190
You're lying all the time.

27
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,630
Eight of Characters.

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,000
Nine of Circles.

29
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,430
Five of Bamboos.

30
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,240
Nine of Circles.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,190
Nine of Circles.

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,170
I win.

33
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,910
My hand stinks.

34
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,250
What tiles are these?

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,670
I quit, I quit, I quit.

36
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,120
Don't. We haven't even played four rounds.

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,880
With this luck? I can't play anymore.

38
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,840
Three players missing one.

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,150
Exactly.

40
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,840
Don't quit playing.

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,750
Let me play a couple of games for you

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,630
to change your luck.

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,840
If I lose, it's on me.

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,110
If I win, it's on you. How about that?

45
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,840
Is there really such a good deal?

46
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,590
We'll swap and

47
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,420
your luck will be back soon.

48
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:05,960
Come on.

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,400
Okay.

50
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,590
Fine.

51
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,750
Doesn't matter who's playing.

52
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,460
Doesn't matter who's playing.

53
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,960
Who was the banker last round?

54
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,150
Me.

55
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,870
You know our rules, right?

56
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,630
Of course.

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,360
Alright. Come on.

58
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,440
Be careful. I’m waiting for a tile now.

59
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,630
Three of Bamboos.

60
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,390
Nine of Bamboos.

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,030
Three of Bamboos.

62
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,960
Self-draw,

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,240
Seven Pairs.

64
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,810
Not bad.

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,520
How lucky.

66
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,590
How is this?

67
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,750
Awesome, awesome.

68
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:47,680
Come on.

69
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,579
Here, Boss Lady.

70
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,329
They're paying my lunch and dinner

71
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
for the whole week.

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:52,960
Okay.

73
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,710
They lost to me.

74
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,520
I'll write it down for you.

75
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,120
Sister,

76
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,280
thank you for today.

77
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,630
You're welcome.

78
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,000
I feel you look quite familiar.

79
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,680
Have we

80
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
met each other before?

81
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,590
I always sing at

82
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,800
the Ding Xiang Karaoke.

83
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,590
My name is Fan Ying.

84
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,220
You live nearby too?

85
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,590
Used to.

86
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
When I was living here,

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,360
my husband thought the house's direction was not good,

88
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,000
so we moved across the street.

89
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,450
The houses over there

90
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,040
are much more expensive than the rent here.

91
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,280
If the man can pay for it,

92
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,360
I can afford it.

93
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,780
You're so tall.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're not a local, are you?

95
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,270
Are you jealous?

96
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,870
Let me treat you to dinner.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,650
Don't.

98
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,380
I'll treat you.

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,920
Come upstairs with me and get acquainted with the place.

100
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:35,680
Sure.

101
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,310
Let's go.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,430
Come on.

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,070
Come in please.

104
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,630
Your house is pretty.

105
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,830
Here, have some water.

106
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,580
Your own?

107
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,770
Did some simple renovations.

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,690
Not bad, right?

109
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,430
Absolutely.

110
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,140
It must cost a lot of money.

111
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,240
As women,

112
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,120
don't we make money for ourselves to spend?

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,390
We can mistreat anyone

114
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,430
but ourselves.

115
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,180
Well said.

116
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,360
I could tell you've been earning a lot

117
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,600
in the past two years.

118
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,830
Just a small amount.

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
Sister, make yourself comfortable.

120
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,240
I'll get changed now.

121
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,990
Okay.

122
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,510
What time is it already?

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,350
You're still in bed?

124
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,650
I'm coming in.

125
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,890
So early?

126
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,920
Hello.

127
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,190
Ms. Chang.

128
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,640
Hello.

129
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,710
I'm Zhen Zhen's mother.

130
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,770
May I ask

131
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,230
if Zhen Zhen went to school today?

132
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,350
Let me tell you.

133
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,640
Zhen Zhen didn't come to class today.

134
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,160
If she keeps

135
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,320
skipping class like this,

136
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,120
she might get expelled from school.

137
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,430
Dad.

138
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,430
Mom.

139
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,410
Seventeen years of life,

140
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,190
and now we part ways.

141
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,630
If there is a next life,

142
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,920
let's not meet again.

143
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
You don't love me at all,

144
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,270
especially Mom.

145
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,560
You could say she hates me to the bone.

146
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,890
Otherwise, she wouldn't

147
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,270
have humiliated me

148
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,240
in front of my entire grade.

149
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,360
Mom,

150
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,040
if you hate me so much,

151
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,600
why did you

152
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:47,720
bring me back from Grandma's house?

153
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,680
The last bad thing I did

154
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,480
was to take 500 yuan

155
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,850
from your wallet.

156
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,190
If I can survive,

157
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,560
I will definitely pay you back.

158
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,560
Since we can't stand each other,

159
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,660
I'll take a step back

160
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,390
and disappear from this home

161
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,780
forever.

162
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,280
Why are you here again?

163
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,590
I have nowhere to go.

164
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,310
Are you her relative?

165
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,120
We were neighbours when we were kids.

166
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,340
We grew up together.

167
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,150
She later moved to Luancheng with her parents

168
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,790
and we separated.

169
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,150
She told me I should come and find her

170
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,030
if I ever visit Luancheng,

171
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,360
so she gave me this address.

172
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,200
Do you have her home number?

173
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,720
She left her phone number in Shanghai.

174
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,270
I'm afraid this doesn't solve

175
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,200
your current problem.

176
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,600
It's okay. Please write that down for me.

177
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,080
Thank you.

178
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,720
You haven't seen Zhen Zhen, have you?

179
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,480
She didn't

180
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,850
contact you yesterday either?

181
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,960
No?

182
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,750
Okay.

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,670
I see.

184
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Think harder.

185
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,550
Whose phone call have you not made yet?

186
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,170
Continue to call them.

187
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,720
My aunts and uncles,

188
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,380
I've called up all of the relatives.

189
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:22,870
I'm almost done

190
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,000
with her classmates too.

191
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,280
She didn't contact anyone.

192
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,670
Hello?

193
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,630
It's for you.

194
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,000
Hello?

195
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,390
No, no, no.

196
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,810
Forget about the construction site.

197
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,870
Something happened at home.

198
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,480
If we really can't find our kid,

199
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,120
we'll do as you say.

200
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,020
We'll divorce.

201
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,390
Don't cry, Zhen Zhen.

202
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:16,260
Stop crying.

203
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,080
You will cross the bridge when you get to it.

204
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,060
Let's think of a way together.

205
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,150
We can solve it.

206
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,510
I have no choice.

207
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,240
I have no way out now.

208
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:24,910
How about this?

209
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,290
In my apartment,

210
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,960
there is a room that hasn't been rented out.

211
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,480
But,

212
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,670
my things are left inside.

213
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,370
You can pack them up

214
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,370
and stay there for the time being.

215
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,130
Are you serious, Yachun?

216
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,960
But you have to promise me

217
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,680
you'll ask your parents to take you home soon.

218
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,000
Or,

219
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,440
ask them to send you money

220
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,400
to buy a ticket home.

221
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,870
Okay.

222
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,870
From the accent,

223
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,210
I'm guessing you're from the north?

224
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,240
Where are you from?

225
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:14,910
I'm from Guangnan.

226
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,110
Guangnan Puhe.

227
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,030
That place produces pearls, right?

228
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,680
Yes.

229
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,320
I left home early

230
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,730
so I don't really have an accent anymore.

231
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,390
What do you do?

232
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,670
I don't work.

233
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,750
My boyfriend gives me money.

234
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,750
He gives me ten thousand yuan

235
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,480
every month.

236
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,330
Besides, for expenses on

237
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,240
things like cosmetics and bags,

238
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,600
he even sends me extra money.

239
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,440
That's great.

240
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,860
I envy you.

241
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,600
Here, eat this.

242
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,750
Thank you.

243
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,400
By the way,

244
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,480
can you ask your

245
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,400

246
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,750
to come hand out at our club?

247
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,590
No problem.

248
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,440
Just so happens that

249
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,120
my partner's business associate

250
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,260
is meeting with him tonight.

251
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,840
They would need to spend somewhere.

252
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,500
I'll bring them to your place.

253
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,050
That's great, sister.

254
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,960
You're welcome.

255

Are you happy?

256
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,870
I'm so happy.

257
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,270
Let me bring a few people in.

258
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,030
No need.

259

he wants to meet his mother.

388
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,790
With this,

389
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,830
we can already arrest

390
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,720
Huang Qi.

391
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,960
Isn't that right?

392
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:47,830
Captain Peng.

393
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,880
I've told you eight times.

394
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,980
Stop calling me Captain Peng.

395
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,400
I'm not your captain anymore.

396
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,680
Where is the evidence?

397
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,220
Bring my bowl back later.

398
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:16,890
Your cupping marks

399
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,750
haven't disappeared

400
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,240
after such a long time.

401
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,940
How severe must your dampness-toxin be?

402
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,380
You can't eat cold food anymore.

403
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,230
It's you.

404
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,370
Come in.

405
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,750
Who are you looking for?

406
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,710
Did you have a nightmare again?

407
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,030
It's okay.

408
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,070
It's okay. It's okay.

409
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,310
It's okay. It's okay.

410
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,380
Are you looking for me?

411
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,280
After I'm done takin gout the trash,

412
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,100
I'll come back to you.

413
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,350
Wash your hands and eat.

414
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,030
I got a call.

415
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,990
I need to go on a work trip.

416
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,190
How many days?

417
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:02,970
Three to five days.

418
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,550
Why don't you ask me where I'm going?

419
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,270
I just need to know

420
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,640
how many pairs of shorts to pack for you.

421
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,880
Brother.

422
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,280
Captain Peng.

423
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,720
Why are you here?

424
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,030
I'm passing through on a work trip.

425
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:56,040
I came by to see you and your wife.

426
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,650
Is the case solved?

427
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,440
Sorry.

428
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,160
Xinyuan.

429
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,510
Captain Peng is here to see you.

430
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,920
Both daughters

431
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,920
are buried here.

432
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,960
You can talk.

433
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,490
They can hear you.

434
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,200
Xinyuan, are you hungry?

435
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,920
Eat up.

436
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,110
This is brought by Captain Peng.

437
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,940
Go inside if you feel cold.

438
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:41,510
As soon as it's mealtime,

439
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,860
Xinyuan's mom would

440
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,260
accompany her daughter to eat,

441
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,650
no matter it's windy or rainy.

442
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,800
When Xinyuan's mother knew that

443
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,830
her daughter was chopped into pieces,

444
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,190
she went crazy.

445
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,730
She often goes to the moat.

446
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,130
How is the case progressing?

447
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,550
Not going well.

448
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,710
Our savings

449
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,590
and the money borrowed from other,

450
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,250
were all given to kidnapper.

451
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,680
We couldn't save our daughter

452
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,850
and we now owe a lot of debts.

453
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,540
You've seen

454
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
our health condition too.

455
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,950
Tell me the truth.

456
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,640
Will I survive till

457
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,350
the day the criminal is arrested?

458
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,030
Brother.

459
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,970
I was transferred to another department.

460
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,910
This case

461
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,020
is no longer handled by me.

462
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,600
What should I do then?

463
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,680
I'm here

464
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,020
to discuss something with you.

465
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,680
Go ahead.

466
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,550
I want you to report me to the authorities.

467
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,940
Escalate the complaint layer by layer.

468
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,630
For what?

469
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,730
Report me for not doing anything.

470
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,110
Here's the thing.

471
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,070
Does she have

472
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,880
any close friends

473
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,680
or classmates

474
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,790
who would know where she is?

475
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,030
I've contacted everyone.

476
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:56,960
Also,

477
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,200
we've called and contacted

478
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,080
our relatives

479
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,340
and family friends.

480
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,480
And...

481
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,800
Did she bring money with her?

482
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:07,680
She...

483
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,470
She took 500 yuan from home.

484
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,480
500 yuan?

485
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:11,990
How about this?

486
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,590
Don't worry too much.

487
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,160
We definitely

488
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,550
will do our best.

489
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,640
So, you two

490
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,790
can go home

491
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,510
and wait for our update.

492
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,690
If there's no problem,

493
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,510
please take a look.

494
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,400
If possible,

495
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,200
I need either one of you

496
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,390
to sign on this.

497
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,310
Let me do it.

498
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,920
Thank you, young lady.

499
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,050
You're welcome.

500
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,030
I can wash it for you.

501
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,230
What do you mean?

502
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,200
I...

503
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,550
Can I stay here

504
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,270
and work?

505
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,200
We don't need people now.

506
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,500
I can work for free.

507
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:26,890
I...

508
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,510
I'm good as long as you give me food and a place to live.

509
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,370
How old are you?

510
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:32,660
Do you have an ID card?

511
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:33,960
Show it to me.

512
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,070
Can't do if you don't have an ID card.

513
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,790
Two meals a day is fine.

514
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,480
I won't starve anyway.

515
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:19,870
I'll take it as a diet.

516
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,720
Boss,

517
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,040
I asked around

518
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,000
on the street.

519
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,950
They pay 20 yuan to helpers.

520
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,020
I only get paid 10 yuan a day.

521
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,200
See if

522
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:55,190
you can...

523
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,400
Give me your ID card,

524
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,310
and I'll give you a raise.

525
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,240
You said you're 18 years old,

526
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
I don't think you look like one.

527
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,810
It's risky

528
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,160
to hire you.

529
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,340
It's okay.

530
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,440
Sir, I'll get some more shrimp.

531
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:10,870
Sure.

532
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,640
Look at how great these shrimp are.

533
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,110
Yes.

534
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,880
Young lady,

535
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,000
how much is the mantis shrimp?

536
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,310
Mantis shrimp is

537
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,140
25 yuan per jin.

538
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,070
Why does your shop

539
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,310
sell it more expensive than others'?

540
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,000
Our shrimp

541
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,390
are bigger than theirs.

542
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,510
Look.

543
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,310
Right?

544
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,920
How big are these?

545
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,390
Alright, give me two jin.

546
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,350
Okay.

547
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,200
I want it crispier.

548
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,000
Okay.

549
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,920
Sure

550
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:40,680
Is that okay?

551
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:41,580
Okay.

552
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,750
How many do you want?

553
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,130
Just one.

554
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,460
Since you're staying for long,

555
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,110
I have a few requests for you.

556
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,030
What is it?

557
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,880
First, you need to pay attention to hygiene.

558
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,380
You don't live in this house alone.

559
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,160
Second,

560
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,460
you need to learn to think for others.

561
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,510
Feng.

562
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,590
I've been looking for you all day.

563
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,320
Why are you here?

564
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,230
I'm off work.

565
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,440
What do you mean off work? Let's hang out a little longer.

566
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,880
I'll book you for another hour.

567
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:17,820
If not, two more hours.

568
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,679
You can't escape today.

569
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,590
Let me tell you.

570
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,150
It's 62 yuan in total. Just pay me 60 yuan.

571
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,160
I'll give you the change.

572
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:00,360
No need.

573
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,520
Take the 100 yuan.

574
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,770
Give me the knife.

575
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:52,800
Stop eating.

576
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,320
Young lady.

577
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,260
How many times have I told you?

578
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,480
After taking a shower,

579
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,670
clean up the bathroom.

580
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,510
Can't you understand that?

581
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,540
Didn't your mom teach you?

582
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
It's a hygienic habit.

583
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,800
I'll wipe it for you.

584
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,840
I'll do it now.

585
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:09,520
What do you mean "wipe it for me"?

586
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,360
The bathroom is our

587
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,000
common area.

588
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,440
Can't you have some moral conscience?

589
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,070
You still know what moral conscience is?

590
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,480
I haven't criticized you yet.

591
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,760
You come back every day

592
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,230
at 3 or 4 a.m.

593
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,510
Creating so much noise.

594
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,770
Why don't you talk about yourself?

595
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,200
Let me tell you one last time.

596
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,920
The bathroom, the kitchen and the living room

597
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,870
are the common area.

598
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,070
Clean up after using them.

599
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,690
Do you understand?

600
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,090
Didn't your mom teach you?

601
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,280
Didn't your mom teach you

602
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,670
to not make dirty money?

603
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,560
I dare you to say it again.

604
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,590
What?

605
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,180
Don't make me beat you up.

606
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,360
With someone like you

607
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,840
who doesn't know anything,

608
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,150
I simply have no reason to argue.

609
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,920
I pay rent here every month.

610
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:58,560
You're just a freeloader.

611
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,510
My friend is willing to let me freeload.

612
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,360
It's none of your business.

613
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,870
You insist to stay here, don't you?

614
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:05,910
Fine.

615
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,070
I'll leave then.

616
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,370
When your friend

617
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,400
loses her rent income,

618
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,070
I'll see how long she'll let you freeload.

619
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:46,360
Hello?

620
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,280
Hello?

621
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,010
Hello, realtor here.

622
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,920
Do you plan to sell your house?

623
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,010
I'm not selling my house.

624
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,330
I've thought about it.

625
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,510
Our daughter didn't go to the north.

626
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,920
She's afraid of the cold.

627
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,280
Left, west.

628
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,880
Right, right, east.

629
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,990
Up, north.

630
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,470
She went to the south side.

631
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,150
The south.

632
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,930
It's warm in the south.

633
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,000
Maybe she just

634
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,110
went there for fun.

635
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,460
She'll come back after that.

636
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,360
Let's go find her.

637
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,150
Let's go find her now.

638
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,440
We'll definitely find her.

639
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,320
Let's go, go find her.

640
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,800
Enough.

641
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,480
Let's go find her.

642
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,400
Enough.

643
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,300
Go find her.

644
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,170
Go find her.

645
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,110
Little fellow.

646
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:50,070
Come on.

647
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,070
Are you calling me, boss?

648
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:52,360
I'm mopping the floor over there.

649
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,550
Take off your gloves. Take a rest.

650
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:55,910
I'm fine.

651
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,800
Your pay for the past two days.

652
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,440
Thank you.

653
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,940
I'll pay you another two days' wage.

654
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,040
You can stop coming to work tomorrow.

655
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,750
What do you mean?

656
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,280
What did I do wrong?

657
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,230
I don't need to increase the pay anymore

658
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,030
I have to rest even if you don't.

659
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,550
Take it.

660
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,880
I don't need to rest.

661
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,360
It's my dad's 70th birthday.

662
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,280
"Don't need to rest."

663
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,570
Go and have fun for a few days.

664
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,240
Can I come back afterwards?

665
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:27,140
Come back to work three days later.

666
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,590
Thank you, boss.

667
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,960
Happy 70th birthday.

668
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,190
I'll keep mopping.

669
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,150
[Dingxiang Nightclub]

670
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:36,450
Take care.

671
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,400
It seems like

672
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,730
you really like this job.

673
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,090
I don't.

674
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,220
You don't?

675
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Why not?

676
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,110
I encountered too many bad guys here.

677
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,190
In that case,

678
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,550
why do you still work here?

679
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,800
Money comes fast and in plenty.

680
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,060
Clocking in for work is so tough.

681
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,510
Clocking in for work is so tough.

682
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,400
Why don't you take a rest then?

683
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,200
We can't let Boss rest, can't we?

684
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,160
Look at his physique.

685
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,880
We can't let him sit idle.

686
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,400
Come on, Hongyu.

687
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,580
Here, have a drink.

688
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:24,960
Come.

689
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:26,900
Sit next to Kai and rest for a while.

690
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,220
I don't like to dance with him.

691
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,440
What's wrong?

692
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,360
Are you afraid I'll be tired?

693
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,220
Isn't this all for the sake of life?

694
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,840
But even when it's not for the sake of live,

695
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,110
you never stay idle.

696
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,070
Really?

697
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:58,800
Seems like

698
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,080
you're observing carefully.

699
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,320
Hongyu,

700
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,440
next time when we come out

701
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,230
to have fun,

702
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:10,810
can our budget

703
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,670
be a little higher?

704
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,070
I'm so lonely.

705
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,030
No problem.

706
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,770
Kai, how long are you planning to stay?

707
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:20,960
It depends on

708
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,930
whether the business deal goes well.

709
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,920
What kind of big business does Kai do?

710
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,100
I'm in the electricity industry.

711
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,150
Electricity?

712
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,290
Electricity industry is lucrative, right?

713
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:34,350
What lucrative?

714
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:35,970
Compared to him,

715
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,480
I'm just making small money.

716
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,760
It seems like your wife is very costy.

717
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,020
You can't bring that up.

718
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:50,840
What's wrong?

719
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:58,840
I'm divorced.

720
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,920
I'm single.

721
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,600
Don't be angry.

722
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,840
Don't be angry, Kai.

723
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:32,670
Do you see this?

724
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,590
Come on. Give me your hand.

725
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,010
Wear it.

726
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,110
Don't ever give it back to me.

727
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:52,780
Here.

728
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,670
Look at the ring Kai gave you,

729
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,850
It's so beautiful.

730
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,540
Thank you for today.

731
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,070
You're welcome.

732
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:06,080
Did you have fun?

733
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,070
Of course.

734
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:07,850
I'll be happier

735
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,590
if you come to my house.

736
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,280
Come on.

737
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,760
It's too late today.

738
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,550
I'm not going.

739
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:13,730
What do you mean late? Look at the time.

740
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,030
And we stay so close.

741
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,690
I still have something to do tomorrow.

742
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,620
I need to go back to sleep.

743
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,190
You're not fun.

744
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,150
You're such a killjoy.

745
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,070
Come again another day.

746
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:22,170
I'll hang out with you again next time.

747
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,800
Kai, Xi.

748
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:25,510
Brother-in-law.

749
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,000
I'll leave now.

750
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I'm really sorry.

751
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,960
Come another day.

752
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:30,160
I'll hang out with you tomorrow.

753
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:30,920
Bye.

754
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,750
Coming.

755
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,460
Who are you looking for?
