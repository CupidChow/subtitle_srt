[Episode 1]

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,380
[2002, Xuecheng]

5
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,800
Awesome, Captain Peng.

6
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:34,650
Great, Captain Peng!

7
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,520
Captain Peng, you're amazing!

8
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,710
Admit defeat?

9
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,329
Nope.

10
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,000
Now the red team is challenging the blue team to a duel.

11
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,400
Go for it! C'mon!

12
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,060
Nice!

13
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,750
The blue team wins!

14
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,460
Captain Peng is indeed mightier.

15
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,190
I don't even want to call you out.

16
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,000
The high-sticking,

17
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,000
and kneeing the others.

18
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,400
Are you proud of this sort of victory?

19
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,280
Seriously?

20
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,840
Your team was busy playing tricks too,

21
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
like elbowing our teammates!

22
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,710
What are you thinking about?

23
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,270
Those bandits.

24
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,030
Can't believe those farmers in the southwest

25
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,440
were actually trained by the village chief.

26
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,030
Yeah.

27
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,870
They climbed the high-rise

28
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,430
with bare hands

29
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,360
and pulled it off every time!

30
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,310
It took us

31
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,190
over a month of stakeout

32
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,870
to finally crack this case.

33
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,910
I'm speechless.

34
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,120
C'mon...

35
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,240
The case is over.

36
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,190
Take your time to chill out.

37
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,070
Your lipstick color

38
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,390
matches your skin tone perfectly.

39
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,630
I've never seen you before.

40
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,890
Are you a newcomer?

41
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,620
I joined just two days ago.

42
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,510
My name is Song Ying.

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,190
What's your name?

44
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm Huang Ying

45
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:33,720
We're both "Ying"!

46
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,810
What a coincidence.

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,040
Could you let me know if you need help in receiving guests?

48
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,159
Sure, no problem.

49
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,630
Hurry up.

50
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,159
What are you doing?

51
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,450
The guests are waiting for me.

52
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,070
Those poor guys in your room

53
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,890
even ordered beers in half-dozens.

54
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,120
Why not join me for a feast tonight?

55
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,510
A guest sent the invitation.

56
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,190
Who's it?

57
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,390
So generous.

58
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,000
The guest you met

59
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,800
yesterday.

60
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,480
The one with long hair

61
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,600
and a mustache.

62
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,600
He's interested in you.

63
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,660
Be smart tonight.

64
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:07,870
Okay.

65
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm heading back now.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,600
I'll wait for you.

67
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,270
And be quick!

68
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,190
Zhao! Zhao! Come here!

69
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,450
Block here...

70
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,440
Where did all this nasty water come from?

71
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,110
It stinks!

72
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,110
Can't stop it...

73
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,120
Too stinky...

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,190
Hurry...

75
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,630
Can't stop it at all...

76
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,270
I can't fix the toilet either!

77
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,390
-What a mess...
-Go...

78
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,510
Go there and get more tools.

79
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,310
I got it...

80
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,000
I got it...

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
The plunger didn't work?

82
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,520
No.

83
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,360
The bathroom is a complete mess.

84
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,130
How about this?

85
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,360
I'll ask the engineering department

86
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,200
to bring their tools

87
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,750
and go to 102 to check it out right away.

88
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,080
I told you not to dump the leftovers

89
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,170
into the toilet.

90
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,790
You didn't listen. Now look at this mess!

91
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,000
There's no way I poured this!

92
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,850
It's obviously not leftover food!

93
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,750
Apparently, it's

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,160
the meat stuffing poured from upstairs.

95
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,520
Meat stuffing?

96
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,810
There are always weirdos in this big world.

97
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,620
We've just had a few days of peace!

98
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,980
It's all hair.

99
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,159
Well,

100
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,510
no wonder it's clogged!

101
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,750
The people upstairs are way too irresponsible!

102
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,000
Guys, what is that?

103
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,750
It's a finger!

104
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,510
Emergency call.

105
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,160
Some unknown body parts were found

106
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,560
in Bishui Garden Residential Compound.

107
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,920
The things

108
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,840
that gushed out of the sewer

109
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,120
include painted nails

110
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,070
and hair.

111
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,070
It's a criminal case.

112
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,320
We're leaving it to your department.

113
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,750
I'll go upstairs to pack up.

114
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,299
You two wait for me behind the building.

115
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,789
No.

116
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,559
It's too dangerous.

117
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,210
It's more dangerous not to take anything.

118
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,390
Is that thing rotten?

119
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,720
And who else?

120
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:11,950
My mom and dad.

121
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,360
Only the three of you?

122
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,080
Hello.

123
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,550
Hello...

124
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,360
Hi, sir.

125
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,080
Do you live in this building?

126
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,140
We're from that building.

127
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,510
Building 3.

128
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,580
Building 3?

129
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,730
Are you going on a long journey?

130
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,270
To the south for a vacation!

131
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,030
He's insane,

132
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,320
bringing such a big leather bag.

133
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,510
It's freezing cold here,

134
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,000
seriously.

135
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,600
It's so cold.

136
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,630
Let's go. They're waiting for us!

137
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,510
Hurry up.

138
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,700
What happened?

139
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,930
S-So many people here...

140
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,960
Hello.

141
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,790
Please hold on.

142
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,390
Do you live here?

143
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,510
Yes.

144
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,000
Where are you going?

145
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,910
I'm taking out the trash.

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,670
I'm a cop.

147
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,090
Could you tell me which room you live in?

148
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,910
401.

149
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,450
OK.

150
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,870
Do the upstairs and downstairs

151
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,910
share the same sewer?

152
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,350
I don't know.

153
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,550
Thank you.

154
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,200
Did anything go wrong?

155
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,790
Nope.

156
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,320
Come here!

157
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,080
Hey! Come here!

158
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,670
Give me a hand! C'mon!

159
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:17,960
Give me a hand.

160
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,720
Come on...

161
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,760
What is it?

162
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,750
The strong stench!

163
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:26,480
What the heck is it?

164
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,240
I noticed something was off

165
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,150
when I reached the entrance.

166
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,550
So I turned around to wait

167
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,200
for you at the back gate.

168
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,000
It means you've become quick-witted.

169
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,590
I'm picking your brain while working.

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,870
Did you keep someone's brain?

171
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,150
He means

172
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,600
learning while working.

173
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
He didn't get anyone's brain.

174
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
You're so interesting, Hongyu.

175
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,450
You talk too much every day.

176
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:10,870
Big bro,

177
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:11,720
did you bring all my things out?

178
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,980
Yeah, all the necessary stuff.

179
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,240
Including my cigarettes?

180
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,750
I just opened that pack.

181
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,360
What?

182
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,630
Cigarettes.

183
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,320
Come upstairs

184
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,030
to 402.

185
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,960
Do you think

186
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,590
the cop I ran into

187
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,970
will start suspecting me soon?

188
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,960
No suspicion on the spot, of course.

189
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,940
But he'll surely find you suspicious later.

190
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:42,850
Yeah...

191
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,380
Over all these years of work...

192
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,220
It's also the first time I've seen such a case.

193
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,360
Do you think

194
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,480
401 and 402

195
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,490
share the same sewer?

196
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,390
What sewer?

197
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,440
Hello.

198
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
Did you knock on the door just now?

199
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,570
Yes, it was me.

200
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:46,790
I'm a cop.

201
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:47,840
Well,

202
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,120
can I go in and ask you a few questions?

203
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,750
Come in, please...

204
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,390
Come on in.

205
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,240
Hello, sir.

206
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,270
Madam.

207
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,270
Have a seat.

208
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,240
Don't bother, m-madam.

209
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,640
I just wanna know

210
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,360
if you've ever seen

211
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,390
your neighbor next door?

212
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,000
No.

213
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,359
Like, never?

214
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:04,960
Never.

215
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,069
Then,

216
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,750
have you heard the din

217
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,960
over the past few days?

218
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,440
I can't hear things clearly.

219
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,670
Your son's still not back from taking out the trash?

220
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,030
I don't have a son.

221
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,460
I only have one daughter

222
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,960
who's doing business

223
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,210
in Hailar.

224
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,110
A man in a red sweater with long hair,

225
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,110
heading out to dump the trash,

226
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,440
is very likely the suspect.

227
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,240
Send someone to check all cars going out of the city.

228
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,160
Hello?

229
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,440
Okay.

230
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:48,750
Understood.

231
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,830
Chen!

232
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
They're closing off this highway

233
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,510
for ad hoc police checks.

234
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,740
Tell them to drive back.

235
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,270
Got it.

236
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,950
The police are doing ad hoc checks!

237
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,510
Back off!

238
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,810
Back, back.

239
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,030
This road is closed!

240
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,160
The police are doing ad hoc checks!

241
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,070
Back off!

242
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,830
This road is closed off!

243
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:09,940
Go up there!

244
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Ad hoc police checks.

245
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,320
What's wrong with you? How did you drive?

246
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,920
You hit my car!

247
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,110
You crashed into me!

248
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:27,720
What?

249
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,350
Drive forward!

250
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,030
He told me to back off!

251
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,960
You were supposed to drive forward!

252
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,350
Why should I drive forward?

253
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,460
That gesture means driving forward!

254
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,270
Can you drive properly?

255
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,510
How many years have you been driving?

256
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,750
Can you really drive?

257
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,270
Are you blind?

258
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,720
Can you drive?

259
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,200
Can you...

260
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,030
Go foward now!

261
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
Only drive forward on the highway!

262
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,860
What are you thinking about?

263
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,230
Nothing.

264
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,480
They're fighting.

265
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,510
Do or die.

266
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,790
Stop arguing.

267
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,440
Make way!

268
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,330
Don't get in the way!

269
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,790
Enough... Listen to me.

270
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,070
There's a traffic jam behind. You go first.

271
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,500
Let them go.

272
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,140
Hu, let them go first.

273
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:43,520
OK!

274
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,000
OK!

275
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,160
Get in the car...

276
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,430
Enough. Stop arguing.

277
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Hurry! Get in the car...

278
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,350
Move the car.

279
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,200
Just make way.

280
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:50,830
Get in the car!

281
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,200
We didn't find any suspicious vehicles

282
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,110
during our checks

283
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,030
on the cars driving out of the city.

284
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,680
After that, we started

285
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,510
a search in Bishui Garden

286
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,520
and found the rental information

287
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,200
about Room 402, Unit 1.

288
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,510
What's the name of the person

289
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,200
who rented your house?

290
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,440
Li Jianfeng.

291
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,550
He rented my house for three months.

292
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,010
1,500 yuan per month.

293
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,030
T-The lease isn't due yet.

294
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,110
Show me the contract.

295
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:21,930
There you are.

296
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,000
What does he look like?

297
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,750
He's over 180 cm tall

298
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,830
with long hair

299
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,550
and a mustache.

300
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,200
The ID number

301
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,160
of this tenant, Li Jianfeng,

302
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,790
belongs to Tienan District in Xuecheng.

303
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,590
This is his phone number.

304
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,110
Hello?

305
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,310
Who is it?

306
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,070
This is the Public Security Bureau.

307
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,030
Public Security Bureau?

308
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,070
Are you scaring me with this title?

309
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,240
I'm a policeman.

310
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,000
And I'm the police's father!

311
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,200
Get lost!

312
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,270
He yelled at me.

313
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,550
Let's go find him?

314
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,490
Yeah, let's go...

315
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,350
What are you doing?

316
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,110
Don't move! We're cops!

317
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,830
Don't move!

318
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,880
Freeze! Police!

319
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,510
What do you want from me?

320
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,260
Stay still!

321
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,310
Did I do anything wrong?

322
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,750
What's your name?

323
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,750
I'm Li Jianfeng.

324
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,110
Show me your ID card.

325
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,670
I lost it long ago.

326
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,350
Where did you lose it?

327
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,590
I dunno!

328
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,510
What do you mean?

329
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,400
I totally forgot!

330
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,920
No one in the east room.

331
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,920
The west is clear, too.

332
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,160
What did I do?

333
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,070
Are you chickening out now?

334
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,510
You didn't hold back

335
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,440
when yelling at me on the phone, remember?

336
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,680
That was you?

337
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,510
Sit still!

338
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,590
Just answer the questions.

339
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,890
I thought it was a scam call.

340
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,790
You didn't have to

341
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,400
bring a host of men to scare me.

342
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,390
Do you live alone?

343
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,070
Where do you work?

344
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,790
I work at No. 2 Machinery Factory.

345
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,110
I'm just a lathe worker.

346
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,510
Have you been to the east of the city recently?

347
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,240
Where?

348
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,100
Don't you know the east of the city?

349
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,280
The east?

350
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:18,960
N-No, I haven't been there.

351
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,750
Think carefully.

352
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,750
Have you been there lately?

353
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,880
I go home right after work.

354
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,400
I-I'm an honest man.

355
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,160
Get his fingerprint first.

356
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:32,510
What?

357
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,920
Get your fingerprint.

358
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,640
Okay, got it.

359
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,650
An update from Ge Shoujia.

360
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,000
According to the village committee,

361
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,920
the factory, and the police station,

362
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,130
this man didn't have time

363
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,750
to commit the crime.

364
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,240
And we've checked

365
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:44,880
his social network.

366
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,790
Nothing suspicious.

367
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,590
Fine, let's go.

368
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,000
Gu Jing, you go

369
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,290
take his knives back

370
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,240
for a check.

371
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,590
Got it.

372
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,510
Where are we going later?

373
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,070
Let's go to the crime scene to take another look.

374
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,800
The crime scene has been inspected

375
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,590
several times.

376
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,590
Just take one more look.

377
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,230
Okay.

378
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,320
[Original Copy of the Driver License, Shi Bi]

379
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,750
A new discovery.

380
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,550
A significant one.

381
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,110
What are you doing?

382
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,160
Packing up.

383
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,720
Time to eat.

384
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,050
Just a second.

385
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,550
Brother, we can't come back to Xuecheng again, right?

386
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,610
Peng Zhaolin!

387
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,830
Come here!

388
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:06,870
You're finally back.

389
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,070
It's been

390
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,020
dribbling for two months.

391
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,270
I can't fix it.

392
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,140
My pee's

393
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,850
also been dribbling for two years.

394
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,000
I can't fix it either.

395
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,270
Are they the same thing?

396
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
Both men's business.

397
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,510
Men?

398
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,930
There are only two men in our family,

399
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,060
one away from home most of the time,

400
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,110
one just in primary school.

401
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,720
What should I do?

402
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,550
Son.

403
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,930
Son?

404
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,750
Get me a tape.

405
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,510
Dad,

406
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,290
do you want the one for tying or for durability?

407
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,340
The daily type or the special type?

408
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,210
Or the most commonly used one?

409
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,490
Get out.

410
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,330
Yes, Captain Peng.

411
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,440
That crazy smell...

412
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,360
Gosh.

413
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,880
Almost knocked me out.

414
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,120
I can never forget that.

415
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,510
Well,

416
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,230
the victim is a girl, right?

417
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,830
It's said so...

418
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,070
If her parents know about this,

419
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,310
how can they pull through?

420
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,830
Yeah...

421
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,160
Their daughter...

422
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,110
An incident like this

423
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,720
that is happening in our community

424
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,110
has already hurt

425
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:12,880
the reputation of property management.

426
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
Let's not spread it around, okay?

427
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,790
Who's spreading it?

428
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,720
Where is it being spread?

429
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,110
I mean, don't talk about it outside.

430
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,750
I was just talking in the room.

431
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,200
Who went outside?

432
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,110
Fine.

433
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,310
Have a seat, ma'am.

434
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:29,480
Who are you calling "ma'am"?

435
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,480
Give me the feedback form.

436
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,830
Manager.

437
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,400
You can't keep doing this.

438
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,510
I've got a whole team

439
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,880
of workers under me,

440
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,440
right?

441
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,520
If you keep delaying the project payments like this,

442
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,880
what am I supposed to do?

443
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:45,750
No...

444
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,350
Dad.

445
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:50,960
No.

446
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,590
If you really treat me like a brother,

447
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,110
seriously, I'm begging you,

448
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,890
please settle the payment for me.

449
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,640
Why is it all vegetarian today?

450
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,270
Did your dad give me money to buy meat?

451
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,270
The mat.

452
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,110
Come on, wash your hands and eat.

453
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,590
Okay.

454
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,750
Please help me out, okay? Thank you.

455
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,480
There's been a murder

456
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,830
at Bishui Garden.

457
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,940
What they pulled out of the sewer

458
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,580
was all human flesh.

459
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,480
If it wasn't twenty jin,

460
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,510
it was at least fifteen.

461
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,410
I'm telling you, for the next two weeks,

462
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,000
I can't even look at meat.

463
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,510
What murder case?

464
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,510
Does it have anything to do with you?

465
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,400
Hurry up and eat.

466
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,590
Finish your meal and get your homework done.

467
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,690
Let's dig in.

468
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,200
Come on.

469
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,370
Don't start criticizing the kid as soon as you get home.

470
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,350
He got sixth place in ice skating today.

471
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,400
What else do you want?

472
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,640
I tried my best, Dad.

473
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,020
How many people were competing in total?

474
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,000
Six.

475
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,240
Alright then.

476
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,950
Dad will still encourage you.

477
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,690
Every night

478
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,790
before bed,

479
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,200
you have to do fifty squats,

480
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,970
then fifty frog jumps.

481
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,760
I promise you,

482
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,590
you'll be in

483
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,830
at least fifth place in no time.

484
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,070
Okay?

485
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,110
Here, braised pork.

486
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,220
Eat more meat.

487
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,030
Mom.

488
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,050
What's wrong with Dad?

489
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,880
What's wrong with you?

490
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,720
Nothing.

491
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,730
From now on,

492
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,410
let's make more vegetarian dishes.

493
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,130
We've checked

494
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,820
all the coffee shops, hotels,

495
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,890
foot massage parlors, internet cafes, and inns in the area

496
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,370
to see if any women are missing.

497
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,040
Only the Green Island Hotel

498
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,720
responded.

499
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,630
They reported three missing women—

500
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,110
one named Liu Xinyuan,

501
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,250
another named Huang Ying.

502
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:10,890
They've been working here

503
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,790
for a while.

504
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,400
And a third, named Song Ying,

505
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,390
has only been here for two days.

506
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:15,670
None of them have ID cards.

507
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,070
These places

508
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,000
have a high turnover,

509
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,510
and the relationships between people can be complicated.

510
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:20,400
Plus,

511
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,720
they're probably not locals

512
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,750
and didn't use their real names.

513
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,030
So, investigating

514
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,310
the women's true identities

515
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,270
will take a lot of time.

516
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,510
The hotel manager said

517
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,400
-there’s a lot...
-Stop.

518
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,510
That's him.

519
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:43,200
[Xuecheng Green Island Hotel]

520
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,200
We can't go back to Xuecheng.

521
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:51,460
Shi Bi, what do you think?

522
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,350
Tell me.

523
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,790
Safety first.

524
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,240
I think we need to head south.

525
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,960
South is good.

526
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,370
The meat is fattier down there.

527
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:00,320
Our meat processing plant

528
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,440
still needs to keep running.

529
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,110
Let's go.

530
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,310
I'll go gas up the car then.

531
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,920
You haven't gassed up yet?

532
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,690
You have no idea

533
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,000
how much the oil prices are fluctuating right now.

534
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,680
If you fill up too much, it's a loss.

535
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,350
That's a setback.

536
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,810
Hello,

537
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,310
you're Liu Liang from Jibei, right?

538
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,590
Yes.

539
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,280
Hello.

540
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,920
Please come with me.

541
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,620
As soon as I got the call,

542
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,830
I came straight here.

543
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,370
I couldn't get a seat,

544
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,020
so I stood all night.

545
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,040
I really appreciate it. This way.

546
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,880
I work at a chemical plant in Jibei City.

547
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,790
Seven days ago,

548
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:45,640
I got a call

549
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,640
from my daughter, Xinyuan.

550
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,270
She was crying on the phone,

551
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,920
saying I needed to send money to save her.

552
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,430
I panicked

553
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
and started borrowing money from everywhere.

554
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,110
I borrowed 50,000 yuan in just seven days.

555
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,670
I sent the money over,

556
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,400
but I haven't heard from her since.

557
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,000
I've been really worried,

558
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,500
and then I got the call from you, the police.

559
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,680
How did you

560
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,310
find her?

561
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,880
Where is she now?

562
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,830
Do you remember

563
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:15,810
the remittance card number?

564
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,990
Yes.

565
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,500
I wrote it down at the time.

566
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,070
Good, just wait a moment.

567
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:33,030
Please,

568
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,720
in a bit, you'll need to come with me

569
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,640
for a DNA test.

570
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,640
DNA?

571
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,510
What's that for?

572
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,440
To verify

573
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,630
your relationship with the victim.

574
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,200
Victim?

575
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,310
What victim?

576
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,370
We can't confirm it yet,

577
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:57,950
which is why

578
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:58,970
we hope you'll cooperate

579
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,520
and take the test.

580
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,070
What happened?

581
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,310
What's wrong with my daughter?

582
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,880
The current situation is that

583
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,960
multiple fingerprints were found at the scene.

584
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,070
The initial assessment is that

585
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,520
the suspect fled in a hurry.

586
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,350
The Identification Department

587
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:16,000
found during the fingerprint investigation that

588
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,360
one of the fingerprints

589
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,760
closely matched that of

590
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,590
a person named Deng Ligang.

591
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,200
Five years ago, he was involved in a fight and injury case

592
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,690
and left a record at the police station.

593
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:23,590
Also,

594
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,350
the homeowner carefully identified a photo

595
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,390
and confirmed that

596
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,950
he is Li Jianfeng, the person who rented the house.

597
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,890
At the same time,

598
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,040
two of the three missing women

599
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,310
from the Green Island Hotel

600
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,000
have had their identities confirmed.

601
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:33,920
Upon investigation,

602
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,550
Song Ying's real name is Song Hongyu.

603
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,410
Song Hongyu

604
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,310
is now missing.

605
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,350
She is either an accomplice

606
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,350
or has been kidnapped

607
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,750
and left alive for further use.

608
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,070
Shi Bi's driver's license

609
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:42,810
is not fake;

610
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,160
he is indeed from Xuecheng.

611
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,440
After graduating from university,

612
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,750
he came to work as an assistant engineer

613
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,880
at a large factory.

614
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,520
Later, he was fired

615
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,190
for stealing

616
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,440
the factory's electrical cables.

617
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,930
The person he interacted with the most

618
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,720
was Deng Ligang.

619
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,410
Before Deng Ligang was detained,

620
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,650
he worked at the same factory.

621
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,510
What about their family relationships?

622
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,000
Shi Bi has no immediate family.

623
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,790
His wife used to

624
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,790
run a small shop with him.

625
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,640
Then, she suddenly told her family

626
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,590
she was heading south for business,

627
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:07,930
and after that, she lost contact.

628
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,969
Deng Ligang's younger brother, Deng Lide,

629
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,840
committed robbery

630
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,670
and is still serving a prison sentence.

631
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,480
At home,

632
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,409
they have an elderly mother

633
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,710
who suffers from dementia

634
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,000
and cannot answer questions properly.

635
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
The bank account

636
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,860
Liu Liang sent money to

637
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,050
was registered under Li Jianfeng's ID card.

638
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,920
There's still 23,000 yuan inside.

639
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,710
It's a significant amount.

640
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:26,570
I think

641
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,040
they won't give up

642
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,920
the money easily.

643
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,510
While we monitor

644
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:31,699
the bank account,

645
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,030
we'll also set up surveillance

646
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,760
on Deng Ligang

647
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,030
and Song Hongyu's families,

648
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,150

649
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,000
and catching them in the net.

650
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,800
What are you doing?

651
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,020
Are you afraid

652
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:49,810
I'll gouge your eyes out?

653
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,960
You really almost gouged them out!

654
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,760
It hurts so much!

655
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,550
I...

656
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,800
What does this mean?

657
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,320
Happy birthday!

658

So moving!

659
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,110
I should make a wish now, shouldn't I?

660
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,550
Go ahead.

661
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,880
Then I wish us all great wealth.

662
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,840
May we live a long life.

663
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,550
Definitely.

664
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,360
I, Ji Dashun, wish for good luck and smooth success.

665
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,030
Awesome.

666
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,550

667

Thank you.

I'm so moved.

Quick, drink up.

673
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,360
Why is there such a surprise for me?

674
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,460
Don't forget to pay the bill.

675
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,880
Sure, Brother.

676
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,880
I'll pay today.

677
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,120
On your birthday, you should treat us to a meal.

678
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,190
Brother, do you think we should still withdraw money

679
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,000
from the card?

680
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,400
What do you think?

681
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,920
Definitely.

682
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,150
As of now,

683
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,150
the last time money was withdrawn from that card

684
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,430
was in Nanqixia.

685
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,110
The balance left in the card is

686
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,440
18,000 yuan.

687
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,440
The daily withdrawal limit is 5,000,

688
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,070
so we have four more days,

689
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:07,920
four more chances.

Here's the news.

00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,710

the surveillance photo we retrieved

00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,150
from Ruihe Bank in Wuzhou.

We found a new suspect.

712
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,000
They each withdrew money twice using that card,

is from Xuecheng.

He used to work in the same factory

as Deng Ligang and Shi Bi.

719
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,340
Based on the initial judgment,

720
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,600
this criminal group

721
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,750
consists of three male suspects.

Deng Ligang is just like a wolf.

732
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,020
He looks like one, too.

733
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,450
He can sense danger every time.

734
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,440
This is an animal's survival instinct.

00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,510
Liangxi is 50 kilometers away from Wuzhou.

766
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,370
These bastards are really fast.

767
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,920
What's wrong?

768
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,000
She keeps staring at me.

769
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,200
It's creepy.

770
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,250
I closed her eyes, and she glared at me.

771
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,000
I closed her eyes again, but she glared at me once more.

772
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,070
But, Dashun,

773
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,120
I really have to praise you for this.

774
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,510
Your bone-picking skills

775
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,360
are amazing.

776
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:33,160
Did you learn this before?

777
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:35,810
I picked it up on the job.

778
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,150
Impressive.

779
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,320
Honestly,

780
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,550
none of us here

781
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,230
can do this like you can.

782
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,320
Right?

783
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,840
Stop staring at me.

784
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,300
[Yanhui City]

785
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,820
[East Road Butcher Shop]

786
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,360
Boss.

787
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,070
I'm taking the hair.

788
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,170
Go ahead, take it.
